uh thanks for the organizer uh grace and annette for putting the paper on the program this is how competitive in the stock market and this is joint work with vanuatu is here and paul who is a graduate student at ucla also here okay so what got us started uh working on this paper is like a very important question in finance which is what happens to equilibrium prices when some uh institutions of inve or investors uh decide to change their uh trading strategy and you know the standard answer in finance is that actually nothing happens and and the rational for that what people say is that the markets are very competitive and so prices are just going to fix themselves somehow and but if you dig a little more of what people have in mind that you know the direct effect of some investors changing their trading strategy is going to be counteracted by maybe other investors actually adapting and responding to the initial change in in strategy so to take the example that we're going to study today if you have a rise in passive investing some investors become passive maybe other investors on the market are going to start trading more actively on doing the the initial effect you know you can also think about the different example of like think about arbitrage and you know if some uh people stop looking for 20 dollar bills on the floor others are going to pick up the slack and stop looking for them very very actively now when people say markets are very competitive what they have in mind is that you know the response actually undo the respond undoes all of the the direct effect effect such that equilibrium prices are actually not moving now what we do in this paper we're actually uh asking and answering the question how large is this competitive response now once we're going to have a number for this competitive response we'll just plug in the rise in passive investing and you know we'll be able to see the implication of of past investing for uh equilibrium prices now for today's talk i'm only going to talk about passive investing but you know this equilibrium response has actually like large implications when you study common questions in finance right if you want to think about how what happens when you know financial intermediaries get distressed or face title regulation so that they have to trade more conservatively or you know what happens with a hedge fund or an arbitrage goes fast you know you need to take into account maybe the equilibrium response uh uh in the market now how do we do this well first we're gonna formalize what people mean when they say that markets are very competitive as it's clear from the example i've shown you this is not about how investors directly compete with with one another right it's not whether investors are price takers or not this is so like a different notion of equilibrium how investors interact with one another in setting their their trading strategies right how does my trading strategy respond to what other people are doing now if you want to make some progress on this right you need to go a little bit further because you know the universe of trading strategy is very large but across different theories of competition turns out that that what matters uh in these trading strategies can be summarized by changes in human elasticity so essentially how aggressive you're gonna go after changes in prices and we find that this equilibrium response can be summarized by a simple statistic that renamed competition chi and basically it answers the question how much does my demand elasticity respond to a change in the demand elasticity of everybody else right so if someone stops looking for 20 bills on the floor how much harder am i actually going to look uh for for the 20 audience now how do we bring this to the data we're going to provide so like a an equilibrium framework to quantify investor competition and you know how it impacts prices so we're going to take a semi-structural approach what this means we're going to have exogenous but very flexible decision functions for investors and we're going to solve the equilibrium of this decision function this will allow us to be very agnostic about the foundation of investor competitions but i'll get back to some of those foundations you might be interested in later now our model is going to have a two layer equilibrium the first layer is going to be prices that are just such that markets are clear and the second layer that's what's new is that investors are going to compete in strategies right investor interactions are going to be through their uh demand elasticities that we show how we can solve this model and so i provide an answer to find the uh size of the competitive response and we take it to the data using portfolio holdings on the u.s stock market from the 13f finance and we find that competition chi is equal to 2. what does it mean well the first thing you should know is that it's far from the perfect competition benchmark which means that composition should be equal to infinity now in terms of numbers that are maybe more uh uh speaking to you well the direct change of individual behavior is going to be dampened by 60 with the level of competition equal to two right so 60 smaller than just only the direct effect now in terms of thinking about the rise of passive investing we'll find that the rise passive investing that we observe in the last 20 years leads to more inelastic aggregate demand curve at the individual stock level of 15 so that's a large number if you want to put this in so like in terms of multipliers it used to be that when you buy one dollar of a stock raise its price by 2.5 dollars now with 15 and more in elastic demand the price would rise to three dollars so that's the headline number we have i'm gonna show you introduce you our framework first then we'll see how we bring this uh to the data before estimating the model and then uh getting at the implication for prices so the heard of a framework is really this two-layer equilibrium the first layer as i said is standard here investors are going to buy only one asset to keep things simple so investor i demands uh asset uh demands the quantity of the asset di so those small letters are logs and large capital letters are levels and you see that demand for the asset is very simple there is a baseline level level of demand d bar i and then it's simply uh decreasing in the price with respect to a reference price p bar with elasticity ei right of course we have an equilibrium condition where the supply of assets is called the sum of of the demand now this demand elasticity is important right it measures your trading aggressiveness by how many percent are you gonna increase the quantity of the asset that you buy in response to a one percent decrease in the price of the asset right and we know that this matter right for inelastic markets we know that uh flows have large impact on prices right if you want to translate flows into prices one percent increase in demand is going to create one over the elasticity percent increase in prices and beyond the uh effect on prices we know that across many theories inelastic markets go with higher volatility less price informativeness and also less liquidity on market now what's new is really the second layer and that's the competition and strategy so the elasticity of individual investors has two components first an individual component that's specific to the investor that's this epsilon bar i and then how the investor interacts with all the other investors which is here materialized by this aggregate elasticity e-ag right and we respond with chi times to the aggregate elasticity now what this means means that with no competition investors are going to follow mostly independent strategies right they don't respond to one another and with full competition any change is going to be fully counteracted by the reaction of of investors what's nice about having these parameters we can actually study all the intermediate cases right uh and the granular measuring chi and estimating the size of of this response now finally since uh you know it is a model of like how investors interact with uh still need to close the model for the second layer of the equilibrium and the aggregate elasticity in the market is equal to the sum of the individual elasticity now let me just say a word about some of the foundations right so there are many economic forces that could shape this competition parameter kai there are many theories that actually would limit the ability to have a fully competitive response so why is sky not equal to infinity right for example it could be hard for you to acquire information that would make you respond perfectly to uh like you fully respond to uh changes in the uh elasticities of others um maybe you're facing some you know investment mandate and you it's hard for you to change your investment strategy or even you can think of other behavioral theories where you know you don't really fully understand what others are doing and so so much that it's actually hard for you to uh change your behavior in response to what to what other people are i do so so what we are going to do uh uh here is actually what we show in the paper that all of these theories map tightly to the two-layer equilibrium but we are going to go directly at measuring chi in the data and going to be agnostic about which precise economic force is actually going to shape uh the competition pattern now before i show you how we estimate the more on the data let me actually tell you about our example and how how this uh framework applies to the rise of passive investing and so here i want to do a very very simple example where we have homogeneous investors which all have the same elasticity e naught and you know we're going to take the numbers that we find has been a rise in passive investing such that the fraction of active investors actually decreased by 30 roughly over the last 20 years so this means that if you account for just a direct effect so the effect without any competitive response means that elasticity has actually uh seen a proportional decline right going from enough to now 70 of enough if you start accounting for the competitive response when you you need to take into account the fact that the active investors are going to see that aggregate elasticity in the market has been decreasing and so they are going they are going to trade a little bit more actively in response right how much more actively well that's going to depend on the chi parameter but they are going to increase their uh elasticity every so slightly so you'll see that aggregate elasticity in turn is going to increase but then there is going to be a second round response of the uh active investor and so on so forth until we reach an equilibrium and so you see that the final aggregate elasticity is actually the combination of the direct effect that's uh the number in green right alpha times e naught that's 70 of of e naught plus the competitive response which depends on the uh chi here okay so if chi is infinity that's a very uh interesting case if guy's infinity actually we are back to uh uh you're not right the competitive response undoes the uh uh rise of passive investing and thus the fact that some of the active investors became fast now if you plug the number that we're going to estimate if you foresee the numbers that we have which is chi is equal to 2 you find that actually the elasticity of uh the demand elasticity experience a decline of roughly 13 with respect to uh its initial level right so remember it's 100 percent if you have perfect competition there is no change in the assist it would be 70 if there wasn't any competitive response so we're roughly uh somewhere in the middle okay now let me move to uh how we actually estimate chi and then we'll actually look a little bit more deeply into the implications so we're going to uh use portfolio holdings data on the u.s stock market from the 13 apps so that has every institution with assets under management over 100 million dollars has very large coverage of ownership in the u.s stock market and the difference with the model i've shown you is that you know uh uh investors don't buy only one stock they buy portfolios of stock so here again we're gonna follow uh uh the work of uh half and motor would tell us that uh you it's a good representation uh to write a logic in portfolio shares that's what you have on the left hand side you have relative demand and on the right hand side you have this baseline level of demand that i showed you earlier and then the price elasticity and then the baseline and then the elasticity again depends on two things first the baseline level of elasticity and then uh that specific to you and then how you respond to to competition now you might think this is just you know adding a bunch of parameters to this to the framework of of uh kojan yoga but actually there is sort of like a wrinkle here because the aggregate elasticity is the equilibrium of the individual elasticity that you are going to to estimate so that was this uh estimation challenges actually we have three challenges in the estimation since you know we have to estimate them all where investors interact with one another as is a command we are facing reflection problems uh and i'll give you some insights on how we can solve this uh in a minute then we have classic issues of androgenetic demand estimations we need to uh have a price instrument and also an instrument for aggregate elasticity and last you know we actually have to to run this we had to devise uh an efficient algorithm to be able to solve for kai uh uh numerically now let me give you so like some insider how we actually solve the the reflection part so let's i took you as an example i i know you like to trade gamestop uh quite aggressively but when i see you do that i can't quite tell whether you are just uh an aggressive trader naturally so like your uh uh base level of uh elasticity is actually higher whether the people you are facing so say philippe bob and annette and harrison here uh are encouraging you because they are quite passive to trade uh aggressively so if only i could observe you trading on some other market with some other uh investors uh maybe i could sort of disentangle what's your own elasticity and what comes from from others right but of course it's not that simple but because you know to do that i still need to know you know for example what philly proving and the harrison base level level city are so i've saw like a chicken and egg problem but we solved this we actually show a condition on the graph of investor stock links that that solve the the reflection of that so that's that's how we do it now being said that that's the estimation let me show you our results the time that i've left so first we find that competition ki is equal to 2.15 we estimate this in the cross section so here you see the histogram of uh the estimation across all the quarters and you see that it's tightly uh centered around uh uh two so we have very very precise estimation what it means in terms of individual response well if aggregate elasticity increases by one that means i'm going to decrease my own demand elasticity by 2.15 and so again that's very far from full competition it's hard to compare any number to infinity but let's imagine you wouldn't you would like to compensate the direct effect all the way to 90 percent you need a chi parameter equal to 18. so we also like an order of magnitude below below that in terms of the competitive response now we confirm the robustness of our results across many different specifications of our estimation we use a different slightly different instrument additional control we weigh the regression uh uh differently we even group investor types differently or impose that chi should be the same across all quarters and we find out all the estimates actually all around number two now that's not mechanical right because if you do the wrong thing say you don't use an instrument you'll find that competition chi so the size of the response is going to be much smaller more around one so that gives you really confidence for of us in our estimates now to the subject at hand right the rise of passive investing as i said uh there's been lots of evidence here this graph focused on on mutual funds that there's a rise in the share of passive funds and share of active funds actually plateaued and even declined in the last few years now on estimation we find that the fraction of active investors gone down from 80 to to roughly 60 in the last 20 years what does it mean for elasticity well i'm just going to redo the simple example i did earlier but now we can be a bit more sophisticated right because aggregate elasticity not only depends on the fraction of active investors but also the whole distribution of these investors in addition to the equilibrium response and if you want to know the effect of a change in the active share on the aggregate elasticity we have a pass-through formula that tells me that it's just the inverse of one plus the competition parameter kai times the uh active share and we estimate with a number 2.15 for chi and 68 for the active share it's just 0.4 conclusion elasticity is going to drop by 0.4 uh the pass-through times 32 percent which is our estimates of the decline in uh uh the active share so 13 percent is the decline in interest now you might be worried about external validity right we're only using one source of variation in the active share to look at the change in elasticity uh and you know uh we are actually looking at different source of variation to see that this uh a path through right the number 0.4 is actually robust uh to other source of variation so we use uh in uh column one two four actually the panel uh variation in the panel to uh look at the pathway and we find that it's again between point four and and point four seven five so in line with the original estimate and we also use index inclusion as a source and variation in the active share to confirm that uh our number of point four is a robust and and has some external value now before i wrap up i just want to say that you know elasticity is not the end of the road and as there are uh implications that as i said you know uh inelastic market goes with higher volatility actually less price informativeness and less liquidity and we confirm this in a regression using elasticity on other outcomes so if you're not interested in variety in elasticity per se you know beyond elasticity this has implications for quantities that that you might care about now let me wrap up here so we've done a couple of things so first we think we have defined investor competition which we think is very useful statistic to understand the effect of a change of some investor behavior by introducing this two-layer equilibrium we have estimated this model and showed you that chi is roughly equal to two this means that the direct effects are dampened by sixty percent and the rise of passive investing if you have to remember one number sled to fifteen percent more in elastic market now there is lots more applications to this but i'll leave it there thank you
