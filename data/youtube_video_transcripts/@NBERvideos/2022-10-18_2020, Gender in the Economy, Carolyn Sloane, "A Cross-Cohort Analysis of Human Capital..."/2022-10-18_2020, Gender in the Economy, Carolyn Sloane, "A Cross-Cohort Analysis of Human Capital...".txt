I'm happy to speak about my joint work with Eric Hurst and Dan Black about the college gender wage Gap and human capital specialization in Broad Strokes what we do in this project is link and expand on two classic literatures when it comes to human capital specialization and gender the first literature is looking within some specific institutions and cohorts and also in older survey data at patterns and sorting by gender when it comes to undergraduate field of study and shows evidence that men and women sort differentially when it comes to undergraduate field of study and this is consistent with what we see in the occupational sorting literature the second literature takes this fact that men and women sort differentially when it comes to undergraduate field of study and connects it to labor market outcomes such as employment and earnings so again in this project we're going to link and expand on these two literatures in a modern data set specifically the American Community survey which starting in 2009 began asking questions of people with at least bachelor's attainment about their undergraduate field of study we're going to focus on the post-recession years from 2014 to 2017 in this data to collect information about the 1950 through the 1990 birth cohorts when it comes to undergraduate field of study occupation employment and importantly earnings the innovation in this paper comes in two buckets so the first is in how we describe sorting so we're going to introduce some new indices to just basically give us a larger toolkit and how we describe sorting and specifically we're going to place sorting into a price space secondly we're going to show some evidence about the linkages between college major and occupation by gender and show evidence of differential sorting by gender when it comes to that mapping so really what we're trying to do when it comes to the mapping part of the paper is reduce the dimensionality of a high dimension problem which is moving from 136 detailed Majors to 251 occupations with that said I'll get started on the details of the paper I do have a disclosure to make it's not about the data we use public data but it's a 2020 disclosure which is to say that this talk is pre-recorded so if something should happen to be between now and July 25th and there's no longer College maybe we could just use this evidence to better understand human capital sorting by gender and whatever a way that manifests itself in the future this project tries to gain greater insight into human capital sorting that happens pre-market and connect that to sorting that happens in the market and then use that to explain gender differences in employment and wages specifically first we document cross-cohort patterns and gender sorting by both undergraduate major and occupation secondly we introduce new indices that measure specialization third we're going to examine gender differences in the mapping between undergraduate major and occupation and then fourth we're going to assess the contributions of major and occupation to college gender gaps and employment and hours worked and wages so what we find is that first across all birth cohorts women are sorted into Majors with lower potential earnings that is to say that even if women were rewarded the same way that men are rewarded to have the same major they've sorted into Majors with lower potential earnings secondly we find that conditional on major women are subsequently sort into occupations with lower potential earnings so that's our mapping result third we find that gender differences in major explain a substantial portion of the college gender gap in wages and that's above and beyond what's explained by the occupational sorting literature so this result connects to evidence on occupational sorting and wages so work to send by blaucon and Cortez and pan to name a few and lastly we find that some of the gender differences in occupational sorting conditional on college major can be partially explained by women sorting into occupation with lower potential hours worked so that really speaks to literature on the search for flexibility and and gender we're going to motivate the project by looking at gender sorting within broad major categories in a set of male-dominated Majors that's the figure on the left and in a set of female dominated Majors that's the figure on the right the y-axis of both figures is going to be the number of women to the number of men in the major and the x-axis is the five-year Birth Cohort so two big takeaways in these figures so men and women do sort differentially when it comes to undergraduate major Choice they're not exactly in the same majors and then also there's a takeaway when it comes to kind of cross cohort patterns and that is that some Majors we see convergence over time so we see men and women moving closer to parity in the major so things like biology or engineering and male dominated majors and things like nursing and pharmacy and female dominated Majors other Majors have become increasingly male or increasingly female over time and then we see some Majors that have remained static over time so different patterns when it comes within major to to a convergence over time so the previous slide I showed you some sorting patterns when it comes to a select set of broad major categories we would like to get an idea of overall sorting patterns by gender across cohorts and so the first pass that we're going to take at this is using a measure that is going to be pretty familiar to most of the people in this virtual room and that's a Duncan Duncan index we're just going to renormalize it and call it an inverse Duncan Duncan index so it's going to be 1 minus the traditional Duncan Duncan index so kind of a classic construction it's just going to be one half of the summation of the mail shares within a major minus the female shares within a major and so this number as it tends towards one we're going to approach gender parity and sorting again because this is an inverse Duncan Duncan and a classic Duncan Duncan as you approach zero you're going to approach parity and sorting so Duncan Duncan indices are kind of the main summary statistic that those of us who are interested in sorting by race or gender have to describe sorting patterns and it's limited because it doesn't take rank into account and so what that means kind of in an occupational context is that if all men were lawyers and all women were doctors the Duncan Duncan index is going to yield the same number as if all men were lawyers and all women are garbage collectors and we know that these are very different scenarios when it comes to earnings implications so we wanted to take a similarity index and set it in a price space so that it would have an economic interpretation and so we're going to do is develop a potential wage index which is going to be really similar to what Marianne Bertrand does in her 2018 paper and so we start by developing a potential wage within a major and so that's just going to be the wage of white Native men in their Peak earning years within the um within a major so the median wage of that group of men so that's this A Y Bar superscript M subscript mail that's the potential wage and then we're going to weight the potential wage by the distribution of men and women within that major category and so this index is going to be equal to zero if major choices of women yield the same potential wage as as their male counterparts so this graph shows the potential wage index in Majors that's the black solid line and in occupations that's the blue dashed line for the birth cohorts from 1950 to 1990. and so we start with looking at occupations we can see that in price space we also kind of see this movement towards parity from the 1950 birth cohorts to the 1990 worth cohorts so kind of this slow movement towards uh towards parity in the potential wage space when it comes to occupation and gender in the major space what we see is that in the 1950 Birth Cohort women sorted into Majors that reduce their potential wages by 12.5 percent relative to their male cohorts by the 1990 Birth Cohort that's going to be a 9.5 percent difference between women and men when it comes to potential wages as did determined by major and so we can also see the shape of this graph for major looks quite different than what's going on with occupation so here we kind of see this movement towards a parity from the 1950 birth cohorts to The 1975 Birth Cohort and then we kind of see this leveling off and reduction that happens from The 1975 Birth Cohort to the 1990 Birth Cohort so an interesting fact from the previous slide is that there's a wedge between the potential wage index for major and the potential wage index for occupation such that the potential wage index for occupation is lower than the potential wage index for major so this implies that conditional on major women must be sorting into occupations with lower potential wages compared to their male counterparts with the same Majors so we wanted to think about summary statistics that would help us summarize these mapping patterns between major and occupation and be able to describe these mapping patterns across cohorts so we start with a measure that's going to tell us about the concentration of Occupational choices conditional on major so what we're trying to get at here is thinking about you know condition on having been an engineering major are women sorting into a broader set of occupations than men who are maybe more narrowly sorting into engineering occupations and so in order to describe the concentration of the Sorting into major conditional or sorting into occupational conditional on major we're going to use a herfandel Hershman index and so specifically we create a cross-occupation her phenol Hershman index for each gender cohort and major and so this index is going to range between 0 and 1 and as it approaches one that's going to tell us that occupational sorting is more concentrated and as it tends towards zero that's going to tell us that occupational sorting is less concentrated or more so these figures are going to describe some patterns with respect to the herfandahl Hershman indexes so again trying to describe uh the amount of dispersion there is in occupational Choice conditional on major so if we look at panel a the x-axis is going to be the female minus the male herfinal Hershman index and occupations and the x-axis is going to be the female minus male share in the major so we can see here that there's some symmetry in that the female dominated major see a more concentrated occupational sorting by women in the major and that for male dominated Majors they're going to see more concentrated occupational sorting for men in that major and so panel B it's going to show us the dimension in which um this kind of sorting is not created equal when it comes to the concentration of Occupational sorting conditional on major and so it's going to take that same y-axis from panel a so that's the female minus male herbinol Hershman index and then the x-axis is going to be the potential wage based on the major and so what we can see is that in the lowest potential wage Majors women are going to have more concentrated occupational choices and that in The Highest Potential wage Majors women are going to have more dispersed occupational choices than men and so this kind of suggests that for low potential wage Majors that men are trying to escape maybe a low potential wages in their kind of scattering towards a broader set of occupations so this table is going to show evidence of differential mapping between undergraduate major and occupation for men and women within a set of broad major categories and the last column of this table is going to give us the herffendol Hershman index of Occupational Choice within each broad major category so recall that as this index tends towards one that's going to represent a tighter concentration of Occupational choices conditional on major so with the education Majors we can see that women who are education majors are going to be sorted into a more concentrated set of occupations than men who are education majors and if we look down to engineering Majors we can see that overall Engineers are sorted into a broader set of occupations than education majors and that male engineering majors are slightly more likely to sort into more concentrated set of occupations than women who are engineering Majors the other big take away from this table is that there are significant rank effects when it comes to this mapping between undergraduate major and occupation and so we can see within education Majors that women who are education majors are twice as likely as men who are education Majors to end up in administrative support roles and men who are education majors are twice as likely as women who are education Majors to end up an executive manager roles and so for all of the set of broad majors in this table it's true that men are more likely to become Executives or managers conditional on having the same made the same major Choice as their female counterparts and this is actually true for the full set of Majors so we're just showing us cell slack set here and so this is important because our Herbert Hershman index is not going to take rank into account it's just going to describe the concentration of sorting and so we would like to have an additional measure that's going to describe these mapping patterns between major and occupation that's going to take rank into effect so much like we did earlier we want to set this index into a price space and so we're going to introduce an index that's going to think about mapping between major and occupation taking potential wages into account so the last index that we introduced in the paper again is trying to provide a summary statistic to describe differential mappings between major and occupation for each gender and cohort and so what we do is very similar to what we do in the construction of our first potential wage index is that we're going to weight the potential wage based on occupation by the distribution of women in that occupation conditional on making major selection M compared to the distribution of men in those occupations conditional and having majored in major M as well so when this index equals zero that means that the occupations of women yield the same potential wage as their male counterparts who measured in the same subject so in this graph we wanted to be able to summarize the rank effects of differential mapping between major and occupation for men and women over the full set of Majors so what we've done on the x-axis is we've binned Majors based on the potential log wage of the major into deciles and then on the y-axis we're Computing the within bin mean potential log wage based on the occupation and so the dashed lines here are going to be this measure for the male series and the solid lines are going to be this measure for the female series the color variations are cohorts so the black lines are the 1955 cohorts the red lines the 1965 cohort and then the blue lines the youngest cohort here that's the 1975 cohort so we can think of all these cohorts as kind of set in their occupations potentially and also we would think of undergraduate major as being very sticky and so what we can see here is that the male series are above the female series at every bin for all of the cohorts and so what this means is that conditional on majoring in the same subject matter men are sorted into a higher set of potential wage occupations and so they're set into a more remunerative set of occupations of women having made the same undergraduate major Choice um we don't see much convergence over time across the cohorts when it comes to the lower bins here for majors and where we see the convergence happening across cohort is actually in The Highest Potential major bins and so things like stem are kind of leading the charge for the convergence over time in terms of of mapping so there's much more in this paper but I'm going to leave you with some evidence on the big question that we have for this research agenda which is how much does Major matter so how much does pre-market sorting matter with respect to the college gender wage Gap above and beyond Market sorting so Brown and Corcoran 1997 shows the first evidence on this which in the Sip and in the NLS 72 for cohorts kind of predating the overtaking in terms of college completion by women that controlling for just 20 broad major categories improves explanatory power with respect to the college gender wage Gap and so here we can see that moving from our raw College gender wage Gap that's column one only controlling for some demographics two are fully controlled model with both major and occupation we're cutting the gender wage Gap in half by by controlling for both pre-market sorting and Market sorting and you know we can see that major has Independence explanatory power we do a bounding exercise which is saying you know if the overtaking had never happened what would these coefficients look like and so our College gender wage Gap would have been bound between 0.21 and 0.27 and our full fully specified gender wage Gap would have been bound between a 0.11 and 0.12 and then lastly we're going to look across cohorts and we can see that major has always been important over time for explaining the college gender wage Gap whereas occupation is becoming less important over time in terms of explaining the college gender wage Gap so with that I'll close very close to 20 minutes and I thank you for your attention and I hope you'll check out our paper
