my name is bill evans i'm from the department of economics at the university of notre dame and thanks for uh joining our presentation about our new nbr working paper with my colleague chris cronin also from notre dame um in this talk we're going to provide some basic facts about the kova coca-19 crisis in nursing homes and then we're going to outline the role of nursing home quality and combating the pandemic and one thing i'll say at the beginning there's no way around that these numbers are incredibly sad uh just the the level of loss that's occurred in nursing homes the covid19 virus is particularly risky for two groups the elderly and people with particular conditions and these sets of risk factors are highly prevalent in nursing homes so these are incredibly vulnerable institutions um uh which it is important to sort of think about how we're going to deal with this moving forward we're going to use two sources of data on mortality in nursing homes from covid one are information from state web pages uh all states have a dashboard that has a running count of what's how coveted is impacting their state not all states report this information but the information is reported is fairly complete we're going to supplement this with information from a new data source that's put together by the centers for medicare and medicaid that has weekly data on coveted cases mortality etc for all nursing homes in the country this data was started to be released on may 24th and it comes out weekly now unfortunately this data set tends to under count coveted mortality with the nursing homes for a particular reason the first week that the data was released they allowed nursing homes to report either the cumulative number of deaths up to that point for the year or the deaths for the week ending may 24th and a lot of nursing homes especially in some high risk states chose the second this means however that the deaths between say the end of may and today appear to be fairly accurate but just in terms of uh um matching these two things up the cms data is going to understate mortality some the first fact i want to point out is that the code situation in nursing homes has been a disaster as of september 13th 2020 there have been about 192 000 cova deaths for the country as a whole and 56 000 of these have been in nursing homes which is about 39 of all kova deaths so this is a large part of the problem if you take a look at kova death rates which are deaths per hundred thousand for the nation as a whole as of september 13th that number was about 59 per hundred thousand if we were to take a look at the number for non-nursing homes that number falls to 36. a group of people that's comparable to those in nursing homes are the non-nursing home pages uh patients age 65 and above their death rate is 208 but the nursing home death rate is about 5500 per uh 100 000. about five percent of nursing home patients have died since the beginning of the year because of covet alone this is 150 times a non-nursing home rate so it's a staggering number the second fact is that death rates and nursing homes are tied closely to the underlying risk in the general local population in this graph we use data from the cms reports and construct death rates for non for nursing home residents that's on the vertical axis and then on the horizontal axis we take a look at state non-nursing home death rates per 100 000 and just fit a line through these points these are strongly correlated with a correlation coefficient about 0.8 so it's no surprise on areas that have had the biggest risk massachusetts new jersey connecticut they've also had the largest nursing home death rates as well unfortunately the virus is not the only risk that people in nursing homes face there's tremendous excess mortality not associated with the virus among the elderly and particularly alzheimer's patients this is a graph of deaths by week for those 65 and older the dotted gray line at the bottom is the average desk per week in 2018 and 19 it represents a baseline the black line are all desk by week in 2020 um and clearly there's a massive increase uh around april and march when covid was really hitting quite hard but the gray line here are all deaths in 2020 minus covalent mortality and these are excess deaths that are attributable to things like heart attacks or violence or just depression that's occurring and notice that about a third of the total increase in mortality is due to non-coveted reasons this year so among people 65 and older there seems to be a lot of mortality not attributable to the disease itself but rather to the pandemic in general these numbers are particularly stark for alzheimer's patients as of the end of september there were about 30 000 excess deaths estimated by the center for disease control occurring among alzheimer's patients only 6 900 of these deaths actually had a diagnosis of covid almost 23 000 these excess deaths are occurring for people without a covert diagnosis and a lot of this is just their disruption of their lives that's occurred has been pretty traumatic for alzheimer's patients the final fact is that the crisis is heavily concentrated in a few nursing homes but the problem is not insurmountable the top five percent nursing homes uh in just in terms of raw mortality is responsible for about forty percent of all mortality in nursing homes among covet patients um and fully fifty eight percent of nursing homes have had no cover deaths uh this number is actually thirty one percent and states really hard hit in nursing homes such as new jersey massachusetts connecticut and new york so a big research agenda moving forward has to be what are the homes that are preventing deaths doing right and how can we use this information moving forward the research question that we focus on in this paper is a relatively simple one if you had to find a nursing home for a loved one right now what variables would you focus on what objective criteria could you use to help you select where your loved one should go and one thing we want to point out through all this research is that cova death rates are tied closely to nursing home quality the centers for medicare and medicaid have a five-star nursing home ranking where more stars is better these rankings have three components based on inspections staffing levels and quality metrics such as falls and bed sores the inspections component of the ranking is thought to be less manipulable by uh the nursing home so we're going to focus on that measure but in the paper we present results from all the different quality metrics and what we're going to do is estimate a statistical model that tries to explain the differences in covet 19 death counts across nursing homes controlling for a variety of factors such as the profit status of the nursing home how big it is the underlying risk level that uh the nursing home has in the county in which it's situated plus we're going to control for you know just differences across states uh because of things like regulatory environments in the next couple graphs what i'm going to do is report the coefficients as we move from a one to a five star ranking and the results can be roughly interpreted as a percentage difference in mortality attributable from moving from a low to a high quality nursing home so in this graph i report the percentage change in mortality as you go from a 1 to a 2 3 4 and 5 star nursing home the gray bar represents the estimated effect and the small darker gray line represents the 95 confidence interval and five-star nursing homes have 24 percent lower covert mortality than a one-star nursing home so the effect of quality is fairly massive in this particular case how do high quality nursing homes reduce deaths well we know what they don't do the results seem to indicate that they don't prevent the disease from entering the nursing home quality is not predictive of whether you have any resident or staff cases so what nursing homes seem to be able to do high quality nursing home is prevent the spread of the disease conditional on a case so how do they end up doing that well our results suggest that they tend to have lower staff shortages and lower ppe outages and this explains a large fraction of the quality difference between them they just seem to be better on institutions to deal with the things necessary in order to handle the pandemic within the nursing home the problem however is that quality nursing homes appear to generate greater excess mortality nursing home residents have experienced a tremendous amount of extreme isolation visitors are prevented from entering group activities are prevented group meals have been discontinued and so as a result there's been a lot of dislocation within nursing homes especially for particular patients like alzheimer's patients so in our statistical model we're going to run exactly the same model that we did before but what we're going to do is change the outcome from coca-19 test to non-covet mortality and take a look at what's happening to mortality along these other dimensions this is a graph that takes a look at the effect of moving from a low to a high quality nursing home in on non-covered mortality and unfortunately in four and five-star nursing homes uh they tend to have about nine percent more mortality for these non-coded causes than a lower quality nursing home now non-cova deaths are more prevalent than cova deaths so when we take a look at the effect of quality on total mortality in a nursing home there's no effect whatsoever now we've examined some of the heterogeneity in this across different types of nursing homes and the one that we find to be incredibly predictive is that we split the sample into nursing homes in counties that are above and below the median covered case rates and so these are essentially high and lower risk areas the high quality nursing homes still reduce cova deaths in these low quality areas but the increase in non-cova deaths in low risk areas is incredibly large and so this kind of makes sense all nursing homes isolate patients in low risk areas there's very little benefits on the covid side of this isolation just because they don't face as much risk however because of the isolation they're experiencing most of the cost as a result so in this graph we take a look at the percentage change in non-cova deaths moving from low to high quality nursing homes in those nursing homes that have below the median risk and notice that the effect on mortality on these non-cova deaths is monotonic in quality and in the five-star rest in the five-star nursing homes they're experiencing 20 percent higher non-coveted mortality if we take a look at the percentage change in all deaths uh in these nursing homes and below median risk areas uh the effect again is monotonic in quality and there's a 15 increase in mortality in these uh nursing homes that have the higher quality so the areas that have experienced the least coveted risk which have also isolated patients have experienced a lot of non-covered mortality as a result so the efforts to protect patients were successful at reducing covered mortality risk and high quality homes but it did come at a cost and that it increased isolation and an increased excess mortality this was heavily concentrated in homes with low coven risk which suggests that maybe we need a more nuanced policy in terms of the way in which we deal with residents in these nursing homes and there's a current cms circular that came out maybe a month ago that starts to outline how to allow visits in areas with little or no risk visits outside visits within the hospital or within the nursing home to try to deal with this problem of social isolation that's occurring within nursing homes um so that's a brief outline of our research if you google william evans uh you can easily find my email address if you have any other questions about our research and thanks for taking a look at this video have a good day
