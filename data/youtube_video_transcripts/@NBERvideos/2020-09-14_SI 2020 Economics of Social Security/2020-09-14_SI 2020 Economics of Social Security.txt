as those of you who have been frequent participants in the nber social security meeting over the last few summers will know we have tried to identify a core big issue on which there would be some scope not for paper presentations as much as for presentations on what we know and what some of the core open issues are we've talked about mortality prediction about fertility rates disability claiming rates and this year there was just an obvious topic to convene this discussion around which is the consequences of the covet 19 pandemic for social security and disability we have four panelists this afternoon who will be able to attack this question from different perspectives uh jim stock the harold hitchings burbank professor of economics at harvard and a former member of the council of economic advisors uh we'll start off by talking about the current state of the economic impact of the pandemic and what we know about the the possible near-term consequences we'll then turn to the team from the social security administration uh chief actuary steve goss as well as deputy chief actuary uh karen glenn who will basically uh talk with us about the work that's going on at social security and their take on a variety of things the drivers of mortality uh near-term returns and other factors that contribute to the outlook and finally uh louis shainer who's the robert kerr senior fellow in economic studies at brookings and the policy director at the hutchins center and a member of recent technical panels at social security will will give her uh impressions of some of the long-term consequences we should all be focused on there's been a lot of research on economic activity and shutdown orders and so forth and i just want to summarize what that literature says because i think we're at a point of consensus uh about that i want to do a quick review of the public health data as of this morning and i know uh steve and karen are going to see more on that i want to talk a little bit about the policy dependence of uh the recovery uh or the pre-vaccine recovery and then i want to spend some time looking at the post-vaccine recovery for a topic like social security uh and economics one would normally be thinking about um a very uh distant uh horizon uh i think for reasons that i'll make clear uh what matters over the next six months is of tremendous importance in my view for the more distant horizon okay so a quick um quick okay so i'm not being able to okay here we go okay so uh so just a there's been quite a bit of work uh and i've listed some papers here uh and this is a partial list there's been quite a bit of a bit of work now on uh what actually the dynamics on a daily or a weekly basis were uh during the shutdown and then during some of the reopening periods and the big question is how much of that shutdown is endogenous and how much of it is exogenous that is to say if a government says oh all businesses the governor says all businesses are closed is that what's driving a shutdown in economic activity or alternatively is it that just people don't want to go to the restaurants if they think you're going to be infected and by and large where this literature comes down is on the second one of these points which is that much of the much of the shutdown not all of it but much of the shutdown self-protective behavior there's a huge implication of that and the reopening is also uh you can't just you can't just open a restaurant and say oh great okay people will go back people will only go back when they feel comfortable doing that i'll show a couple of pictures uh to that to that end there's a really important implication really important implication which is that can't simply announce that the economy is going to reopen you can't simply you know say that bars are open or whatever it is the only way the economy is really going to recover even in the short run or get any semblance of normalcy even in the short run is by suppression of the virus so epidemiological policy or public health policy at this point is economic policy here's a couple of pictures the one on the left is just something i pulled down this morning from tsa looking at the people who go through screening seven day moving average and what's striking about this is of course not just the big drop in march and april which of course everyone knows but the remarkably slow recovery so despite all of the economic reopening announcements uh despite uh you know despite all the governors or many of the governors lifting uh restrictions we are still down at i don't know what is this a quarter of where we were or maybe even less uh in in a year ago in terms of people actually going on the plane and and if you look at it recently as there's been this uptake in cases and deaths uh it's flattened out over the course of the summer travel season the picture on the right here is a dips in this type study uh which is this chart happens to be taken from a paper by chetty and hendren and friedman and others but there's a a lot of other papers that make the same point this is looking at spending and this is comparing colorado which opened reopened earlier than new mexico and you can look at spending in colorado and here's the colorado reopening and here's the new mexico reopening and you can see that basically there's very little difference between these two it's not what what driving what's driving the spending is not whether the businesses are open or closed but whether people want to go and shop or go to the restaurant okay so that really brings us to the question of what is it what what does the data look like right now i think everybody is aware of this we'll all be quick and i know that steve and karen are going to say a little bit more uh in the northeast which was hit early deaths have been declining there's been a little uptick in cases in the rest of the u.s cases surged back in june deaths have been ticking up consistently if you look at the different states arizona seems to have cases declining now although deaths which occurred with a lag are increasing texas continues to have cases increase uh florida seems temp might have peaked in terms of cases but it's not quite clear but in any event deaths are continuing to increase in florida so some people call this a first wave or a second wave or whatever but we're hardly you know we're still in the midst of this so what this uh is this raises here's just some some data on uh on r effective on the effect of r and and as you can see here uh a lot of some of these states are still hovering around one so arizona is hovering around one florida serving round one massachusetts is hovering around one one is kind of it's better than 1.2 but it's not where we need to be if what we're really going to be doing is fully suppressing uh fully suppressing the virus okay um this is so i guess we get to do a little self-promotion so i'm gonna talk about a paper which was a bureau working paper uh back in may and then a new version of that is a brookie's paper coming out that was in the june brookings conference uh and the big picture uh conclusion from that picture from that paper is that um the the most important the the closures themselves so simply closing restaurants or simply closing shopping malls doesn't have enough oomph by itself to uh really stop a second wave so here's a simulation of the second wave for people that stop wearing masks and that sort of thing what really works for a second wave is increased testing increased mask wearing quarantine self isolation small group restricting large group gatherings outside of work uh outside of the workplace and outside of shopping and it's possible to do that based on our simulations uh but but that is entirely a matter of policy and i think the main point here is whether we end the year with 10 plus percent unemployment or whether we end the year with the low you know with the mid single digits unemployment is entirely a matter of what happens with epidemiological policy over the next few months especially what happens with expansion or not of testing and tracing and protections for the algebra okay so what do we make of this in terms of the forecasts uh here's a couple of forecasts i'm going to just look at the genie excuse me the gdp uh forecast the level of ged or the law of an indexed level of gdp as produced by the wall street journal survey of professional forecasters which is nice because it's publicly available every month on about the uh 10th or 11th of the month back in may uh the wall street journal forecasters were moderately pessimistic they saw a v coming out of the second quarter but then after you know into next year it really looked like the median forecaster was saying that we'd be essentially on the path of gdp during the financial crisis so i set this figure up so that this is the gd this is the gdp path projected by cbo before the pandemic this is the um this is the actual path i'm sorry this is the action this is the actual path of gdp during the financial crisis and then this is the wall street journal forecast based on the may and the may and june employment reports those forecasters got more optimistic so they thought that the median one thought that we might almost be back to the pre-pandemic level of gdp by uh the beginning of 2021 or maybe you know if we project this out maybe the middle of 2021 um i i personally think that this is overly optimistic it's also based on the june employment report and this was done back in june 11th before we saw the most uh i'm sorry this is july 11th but it was but the forecasts were done uh the forecasts were actually done earlier than that and i think they don't they don't take into my cases they don't take into account the full the full range of the implications of the second round of shutdowns and consumption drawbacks but but anyway that's just what it is and steve i think steve and karen will be discussing this further okay i'm going to provide some time series evidence and the few minutes that remain i'm going to provide some time series evidence on what i think are the two key features two key questions here um which is the transition from uh from what we what i might call faster v-shape dynamics to slow dynamics coming out of normal recessions when do we think that might happen under what circumstances might that happen how do we think that that's going to play out so how do we think about the post covert recession uh recovery um and then then there's a related question which is is this is this like a completely new world is this recession entirely different and if so that would actually be pretty optimistic because we might think that all of the traditional dynamics that we normally see are ones we don't need to pay attention to and that this recession has just got a new world of fast dynamics and we might come out of this quite quickly or alternatively have the old dynamics or the old comb movements essentially continue to exist in the current in the current crisis just exacerbated in a huge way and unfortunately the preliminary analysis that i'm representing suggests it's the latter okay so here's slow dynamics this is what we don't like and this is where the unemployment rate increases by you know between like almost one percentage point decreases by about one percentage point per year during the 1980s recovery by about half a percentage point per year during the next two recoveries and then during the most recent recovery by about seven tenths of a percentage point per year so this sort of slow and steady march of the unemployment rate towards a lower rate uh if we're starting if we find ourselves at the end of year or when we get a vaccine at about a ten percentage point unemployment rate you know just extrapolating this we'd be looking at a recovery like the financial crisis recovery and the question is you know where are we going to be and do when do we think these slow dynamics are going to take over so we did so we don't to try to get at the fast and slow dynamics we've done some time series modeling of weekly series this is the weekly economic index which is produced by the new york fed and the dallas fed uh jointly and so what we've been able to do is extract a slow moving factor or slow moving component and a fast-moving component the fast-moving component accounts for nearly all of the most recent movements although it is kind of interesting to note that recently the slow-moving component the more persistent what we might think of as normal business cycle component does seem to be declining in the weekly economic index um this this is this is unfortunate we just don't have i'd sort of hope that by this point we have enough information to be able to tease out the slow-moving and the fast-moving dynamics and maybe see some of the slow-moving fast-moving leak over into the slow moving and we haven't really been able to do that one thing i do like is i do like the our forecast chart which shows that um there's a pretty wide range of uncertainty uh in terms of even the weekly index going into the fall and and i actually think that's a reasonable a reasonable forecast ban um here's a here's a second exercise and this exercise is looking at uh monthly co-movements so this is a little this might be a little hard to read so this is going to be a growth rate of the index of industrial production and this is ju and what you can see is that a five factor model fit to 80 something series monthly in series this has been around for ages you fit it through 2019 and so given the estimated parameter values you can compute what this what the five factors would be and then compute what the predicted values should have been using the old parameter values and that's a measure of out of sample stability of the old factor model for the new dynamics and what's striking about this figure is that you see that those old factors completely explain the the movements in industrial production now that's kind of maybe that's not surprising and if you have five factors you ought to be able to get five series exactly right maybe this is just one of them this is the picture for retail sales and you can see that that really matches also this is the figure for payroll employment you can see that that again really nails it so the big macro aggregates are co-moving in a way that is remarkably consistent with historical business cycle patterns much bigger much faster but the same co-movements okay so that may be neither here nor there because we know the shocks are different and maybe they'll die away here's the scary part for me which is we start looking at durations of unemployment you can see that duration of unemployment that is the number of people unemployed for 5 to 14 weeks has been has the same dynamics in this recession as in previous recessions so it actually went down the growth rate actually it declined a little bit not as fast well that's because of people sleeping over from 14 in the most recent employment report the june employment report seeping over from 14 weeks into 15 to 26 weeks if you look at the 15 to 26 weeks you'll see that there's that increase and it's the same co-movements with these big aggregates and if you look at 27 weeks plus it's the same co-movement so what concerns me is that we're seeing this same sort of pattern that we see in normal recessions of people slipping into longer term rates of unemployment i guess that kind of makes sense but maybe what is novel or maybe the contribution here is that these patterns are the same as in previous recessions what that really flags is that if this continues that is to say if the post covid uh if the covert um if the covert public health situation does not improve so that the current economic situation does not improve we would expect to see this continued slippage into longer-term unemployment and those are situations that are consistent with the slow dynamics taking over during the during the post covert recovery so i know louise is going to say a few things about looking further ahead and there's been an awful lot of discussion what are the implications for productivity growth what are the implications for labor force participation are there major sectoral shifts that we can anticipate you know always remember the air travel picture are there shifts in the structure of the workplace are going to have implications and it reminds me of when i was in graduate school a long years ago many years ago i just heard this it's always stuck with me at this great economist response and it's you know is productivity what's going to be happening to productivity growth uh over the next over the next 20 years and and the answer is well it could go up and it could go down and it could stay the same and that i think continues to be the right answer uh in response to the covet 19 recession i think it's just awfully early to to even know what the direction of any of these signs actually are at the moment and the the immediate issue for fiscal health and social security and of course for the overall economy is to do everything we can to try to be on this slightly more optimistic path so that we're only four or five percentage points beyond of of a gdp gap as opposed to eight or nine percentage points of a gdp gap in a year from now we're going to talk to a little bit of the covet effects on economy demography social security benefits and financing but we kind of want to start on slide number two here are actually slide number three with uh with really some of some of the sort of background some of the the nature of the characteristics of kova 19 because after all that's that's sort of the first order effect here what is the nature of this virus we're all familiar highly communicable it's transmissible prior to symptoms showing up even with someone who never shows symptoms one of the unfortunate things it's going to have a specific implications near term and long term is the nature of immunity that is acquired uh it appears as the moment as though it's much less than 12 months so therefore uh that has direct implications for her immunity and also the potential for repeated infections for folks this is very much yet to be determined uh we have by the way i should mention karen and i and others in our office have talked to dave rubin over at chop children's hospital of philadelphia and mark lipsich at harvard uh the chance school about a number of these ideas of the characteristics of the virus that has been extremely informative uh one of the observations is that some of the european uh experiences indicated that the overall death rate might be you know not all that high point four to one percent uh concentrated at higher ages uh and one of the one of the major questions is compromise for survivors going on later in life and the fundamental question we're all facing here in the near term uh is will there be a vaccine or therapy and how effective will that be so if we flip to uh slide number four uh our our real focus here is probably on deaths because deaths are while they're a lagged indicator they're a relatively pure indicator of what's going on we all know that reported cases uh through testing uh are not only lagged but they're also uh unclear we've uh heard people saying that uh you know the number of cases that are actually reported uh you know might be a small fraction of the number of cases that are actually in effect in society so are we looking at something that could be like a worst-case scenario 1918 where come the fall we had dramatic increase uh because people let down their guard or are we looking at something that'll be much better in 2020 will we avert a substantial second wave in the fall and if so we may able to return largely to normal as i think jim stock was sort of indicating uh perhaps in next year uh if not then we are facing uh something that will be much more serious than one year or two years sort of drop off uh in economic activity uh and by the way we we pay attention to deaths because deaths would appear to be the driver that really is going to be directing uh individual uh and societal response to what's going on so on on the next slide uh we can see uh where we are sort of currently jim stock had a couple of slides on where we are currently this is a little bit different look again focused on the deaths and one of the things we're all very very familiar with is the lag and reporting we're most familiar with that and think about that in terms of the lag of reporting for people uh who have been infected obviously not until they get tested and it's confirmed will we have counts the number of people are infected but we have a similar situation with deaths so i would suggest you know back actually in early april uh jill shansky and hiram uh uh and uh hiring beltran sanchez over at illinois and ucla and i started looking at some of the numbers from cdc and some of their stuff and we realized very quickly that if we just looked on the week-by-week death reports that these were lagged and they were incomplete the the left little graph here you can see an indication of that this is focusing on week number 15 the week ending april 10 which was sort of the peak level of deaths that have been reported uh and by the way the cdc numbers that we've been looking at this is into the fluvu fluvview uh uh panel that cdc has been reporting on fridays uh for for for many many weeks actually it's gotten delayed after june 26 uh to being about a week late coming up but we're hoping it's still consistent data the data are actually shown for the number of deaths that occurred within a week and not reported in a week so uh what we recognized fairly quickly was the number of deaths that were reported within a week say for week number 15 which is ending april 10 the number that reported as of april 24 were likely to be low uh lower than what actually being occurred so we started doing some uh some sort of lag analysis by looking at uh two-week separation uh uh counts that were indicated by cdc for a given week and by using that lag analysis we were able to make a projection out in may 1 that the total deaths for that week 15 ending april 10 would actually not be the number that was shown as of that time about 65 000 more like 80 000 and it turned out this looks like this is a pretty robust approach of looking at this lag analysis because low and behold his time has gone up by for that week 15 of 2020 april 10 uh the number actually looks like it's creeping up towards essentially what we've been estimating on our lag analysis of about 80 000. we've done successive lag analysis or i have at least and it looks like the lag analysis is continuing to show an expectation for that we about 80 000 deaths and we're sort of climbing up to that now on the right hand panel you can see a little bit of what the implications of this are uh what we've shown here on the blue and the black lines are what cdc was showing for the various weeks january all the way out through uh through uh partially into june of this year in their reports uh as of uh june 26 and july 11. and you can see the june 26 are what they were showing uh for the number of deaths in these weeks that they had recorded today uh and the blue line and then for uh july 11 you can see what they are but when we apply our lag analysis and make an estimate of what completed deaths are likely to be and again in the left panel you see how how effective that appears to be it looks as though the turnaround in desk going back up didn't actually occur in july yes it did occur in july in terms of numbers or reports but it looks like likely the complete count of actual deaths looks like it actually turned around in june uh and started going up essentially uh uh in the weekending june 12. so uh again the lag the lag is uh uh is significant here and it's something we want to pay attention to because we really want to know where the turning points and where changes are really occurring uh so if we uh on that let me end with the sort of preliminary stuff and pass the baton over to karen to talk about some of the economic effects near terminal intern great thank you steve um so before i really get started i just want to note that i am in a vacation rental right now and the road noise is a little louder than i would have liked so hopefully it isn't too distracting to everyone but just be aware um so first we just wanted to go through a few economic effects on social security and the main takeaway here as shown on the slide is that in the near term effects will really be largely due to the lower payroll tax you will see which in turn is due to the reduced employment and gdp so this is a really nice graph that one of those folks on our team put together it looks a lot like what jim's dog showed earlier um a lot of lines here so let me orient you a little bit these are real gdp levels in dollars billions the um solid lines are what folks were projecting before cozy so you will see on here the red line was the fiscal 21 budget which is always a little more optimistic than the other forecasters the blue line which is sort of similar to the purple line is what was projected in the 2020 trustees report and that was before any coded effects now the lower dashed lines are what forecasters are saying now so obviously a huge drop in quarter two of 2020 and then rising up at various rates going forward um what we've done here are some moody's ihs and cbo um the takeaway here forecasts are really varying widely and they're being updated extremely frequently sometimes you'll see new forecasts each week now similarly this is just looking at the ratios of where we were pre-coded to now so um again we've got cbo we've got moody's and we've got ihs a huge drop in order to rising up relatively quickly for most of them you'll see that the ihs projection in may actually went above pre-posed levels but they've come down a bit since then the bottom line here will the gdp levels return to those pre-recession levels or will we see a permanent loss to future potential gdp as been typical in past recessions labor force um this really matters to the social security program labor force goes directly into employment which was then directly into the payroll taxes we received um again you can see really varying projections of what's going on here ihs in june was saying uh labor force participation rates would be all the way down to 59 and rising back up from there cbo had a really more gradual path um and moody's is somewhere in the middle um how severe will these declines be and will we get back to where we expected to be before the reception and really what goes directly into social security financing it's really the earnings and the payroll tax revenue similar grass here before kobe things were looking pretty worthy lines were going up and up um after you see the drop and then again those revenues go up over time the trends all seem to reach pre-reception levels within the next few quarters but it looks like we're really going to take a hit on the levels the forecasters all see lower nominal nominal aggregate earnings is that because of lower employment lower inflation lower wage really a combination of all three of those factors go into this so social security payroll tax revenue will almost certainly be lower than we've projected but by how much back in april we offered a few scenarios that assumed 15 lower earnings and payroll tax for the year 2020 now looking like them i've been a little excessive maybe 10 seems more likely of course who knows what's going to happen will there be a substantial second wave that can make us a little more pessimistic again um one good piece of news part of the legislation recently was allowing employers to defer payroll taxes um that does not affect social security at all we get the revenues just like we always would have no changes there you may have heard in the news that the president is really interested in a payroll tax cuts well that happens hard to say historically any of those payroll tax cuts have been reimbursed to trust funds by the general fund of the treasury so it's likely that if there is any story because social security would be unaffected by that and the big question what will any of these effects be beyond 2020 um so now i think i will turn it back over to steve to go through a few more slides on the demographic side thank you karen great uh so yeah we've got some uh some demographics five karen and i'm gonna sort of talk a bit about uh the mortality fertility and immigration so let's start with the mortality uh if we could flip to slide number 13. uh so this is really just where our baseline is in the latest trustees report i think we all all you know understand that mortality is has tended to drop over time but since 2009 not so much uh deaths of despair lots of other things have been happening one of the important things to keep in mind with mortality is that a decline in mortality uh at very younger ages under about 35 or 40 actually is positive for program finances uh uh uh uh i i'm sorry and yeah that's right for because more people surviving at those ages a decline in mortality at higher ages is negative for program finances of course those of us who are over 50 like to see it but for program finances that has an effect so a specific is really important now getting into well what's happening under covid if we flip to the next slide we see the big question is how much effect will kova deaths have uh we know they're going to be concentrated at older ages and the question is will there be persistent cumulative effects on mortality in the longer term uh we know about the direct virus-related immediate deaths we're recounting those we're getting with the lag and we're estimating them for completeness also uh but increased deaths uh from covid uh at a later point because of cumulative compromises that people are experiencing there's the other question is are we also having a miscoding of deaths uh or deaths from despair and violence suicide and homicide that are associated with the current pandemic situation uh very serious questions and at this point the data are simply unclear if we flip to the next slide uh the next slide uh we have some graphs here of what's been going on these are again a deaths from the uh the cdc uh fluvview uh uh uh basis and i should mention there that uh in that data series that was provided weekly by cdc they split they show total deaths in the u.s then they also sweat out the pneumonia influenza coving the pick deaths separately and these graphs show you what has been happening over the last several years on a period-by-period basis uh over time as we move seasonality uh on the left we see uh weekly deaths excluding influenza pneumonia and kovet uh and we can see that typically what has happened is after the 11th week of each year uh we tend to see that it drops off a lot we get past the flu season obviously this year not the same and keep in mind this is deaths excluding pneumonia influenza and covet the right panel is the implicit numbers uh that come out of the flu view numbers from from cdc which show what is happening if we look solely at the numbers for influenza pneumonia and covet the interesting thing on this is even with our completeness analysis these numbers for the pic do not show an increase as we get into june whereas the numbers excluding pneumonia influenza and covet do show the increase on the redline by our completeness analysis in june so is this a miscoding issue or are we really seeing really a drop-off in deaths due to covet uh continuing through june and its other reasons uh a question to be determined because we don't really have clarity on what uh what the death counts are with any precision by uh by calls of death now on the next slide uh we see uh this sort of elaborated a little bit more here we're showing uh on these different graphs the black line is what we have in a completed estimated basis uh again through uh through this is most of the way through june because i'm a little bit reluctant to sort of show you numbers that would be uh taking you into july on the completed basis uh the completion analysis is a little bit tricky there so this is just through through uh most of june i believe it's june 19. you we can see the total deaths are rising up and the deaths for other than pic which is the red line are also rising up but the numbers estimated based on the numbers from cdc for for pic are not actually going up in that time so there is a serious question here as to whether there's not just lag but also whether there is a a coding issue are are the are the numbers that are really associated with uh with covid really being uh uh put forth uh and being recorded by cdc and reported to cdc at a basis that is really consistent so this is and others we know some folks uh i think uh dan i forget his last name up at yale's look at this looking at sort of total deaths uh maybe a better indicator of what's really going on here especially from our point of view where total deaths is what really matters uh the fact that deaths are coming from covet versus from suicide or anything else all matters in terms of the number of people we have in our population as workers or beneficiaries so with that again let me now pass the baton back to karen for some of the other uh demographic issues thanks steve so obviously mortality is a big factor when it comes to proven effects but we do express some other effects of codeless on other demographic factors that are important to the social security program so one of those is fertility this graph here is just showing us historically what the total fertility rate has been through time and the total fertility rate is a measure of the number of birds per woman over her full lifetime so you can see that it was way up in the baby boom came down precipitously in the 60s and 70s remained at pretty low levels for a while rose up and then now since the last recession has been declining quite a bit his most recent data is about 1.7 i believe that was in 2019. um obviously some of that was due to the most recent recession some of it is likely due to other factors or women delaying birds more and more so co-lib obviously has induced a recession will it have similar effects on fertility as other recessions have will we expect fertility to go down even further which changes the age distribution of the population which is really important to the social security program it's really about the number of workers per beneficiary that's paying for the program so you can see here the very tiny alternative tube line is our intermediate projection for the future so we are assuming that ultimately births will get back up to 1.95 per woman um will cover it affect that in the near term we wouldn't really expect any longer-term effects from herbig but it is something we're thinking about similarly immigration we would expect coveted to have some effects um although they're seen extremely speculative at this point um we split things up into two different buckets basically number one is lawful immigration um we're thinking there may be some timing of executed delay processing there obviously not as many folks are actually completing their applications getting them and getting through the system but um our general thinking at this point is that these folks have been waiting for a long time to immigrate to the us and they likely won't be deterred um unauthorized immigration might be a different story um sometimes people say well why do i care about unauthorized immigration um you do receive payroll tax revenue from a lot of these workers whether they make up a social security number or of some other way of getting money into the system many of them really are paying taxes um so we do expect order closings to have some effect really both people coming in into the country and leaving the country will the recessions deter unauthorized immigration historically in other recessions immigration has gone down so we would expect covet-induced recessions to have similar effects there an interesting thing with thinking about some is will the varying impacts of coded around the world affect migration patterns it very well might again it's pretty speculative at this point but it is something we're thinking about so moving on to some specific program specific effects on social security we talked some about economic effects demographic effects which are a little broader but zooming in more on social security um one thing you may have heard about it's been in the press i think andrew diggs uh first had an article about it a few months ago is the effects of the average wage invest so the average wage index for 2020 will likely decline meaning that those who become newly eligible for social security benefits in 2022 will have lower benefits for retired worker benefits this is anyone who reaches age 62 in 2022 so those who were born in 1960 for disabled workers it's those who will be newly entitled for benefits in 2022 and also survivors and auxiliary beneficiaries on those accounts as well so the key here is that the awi is determined based on the ratio of total wages paid in the year that's your numerator to the denominator of the total number of at any time workers in the year so the wages the numerator we expect will be down significantly to the recession but the number of anytime workers in a year we don't expect that to change very much so overall we think that ratio will decline significantly just because of the timing and the abrupt drop of employment earlier this year so one thing i noticed we didn't really put in these slides and probably should have was that the awi directly affects social security benefit calculations earnings are indexed to two years before your eligibility year so the awi in 2020 is the indexing for anyone who's retiring in 2022. so really there are two main effects here and let me go through these quickly i know we don't have a huge amount of time but we can answer questions at the end um the first main effect we're calling this the notch so given an illustrative scenario similar to what we talked about before total wages for 2020 of about 10 below the level that was projected in last year's trustees report and the number of workers going down just a little bit about one percent lower than we've projected in the 2020 trsa report so what does this mean under this scenario about 4 million actually more than 4 million retired worker and was able to work for beneficiaries who were newly eligible in 2022 would receive a benefit that's 9.1 lower 9.1 lower than expected for life as would all survivor and auxiliary beneficiaries pay on their accounts that's about another 1 million so um so another way to look at it not only is it 9.1 lower than they might have expected it's also 5.9 lower than similar folks who retired the year earlier so they're actually receiving lower benefits despite the wage indexing of the program than people who retired one year earlier a secondary effects we're calling this one the boost so same illustrative scenario the awi will increase 9.1 percent less than expected this one's a little trickier but all workers with earnings in 2020 to become eligible after 2022 when their earnings are indexed the 2020 earnings will be indexed 10 higher than they would have otherwise so that one year of earnings will kind of get a boost because that increases for only one year of the earnings out of normally the 35 used in the average index monthly earnings increase will be relatively small it'll be generally less than 0.3 everything you think about 0.15 so while the effect is small for an individual it affects a lot of individuals it's anyone who becomes eligible after 22. so for example me i would get this benefit so what are what are lawmakers doing about this um one thing to know is that these effects won't really be seen until 2022 so there may not be a huge rush to get this addressed but i think lawmakers are thinking there's all this kovis legislation out there now why not get it addressed now while people are thinking about us so there are two though out there right now that will address this um s-4180 the protecting benefits for retirees act that was introduced on july 2nd by senators tim kaine and bill cassidy and that does not let the awi decrease from one year to the next and it addresses both the notch and the boost so both of those will be taken serious um another bill was hr 7499 that was introduced on july 9th by representative john larson again it doesn't let the awi decrease from one year to the next but in this case the legislation specifically only addresses the notch the boost remains in place um there are also a few other items in this legislation uh that will raise benefits for just the one year 2020 and they're very similar to what is in representative larson's comprehensive social security bill that's the social security 2100 app um a little advertisement at the bottom of this slide we did provide an analysis to representative larson and you can find out on our website okay moving on what do we see will be the effects on the numbers of beneficiaries so focusing on the retirement side the oasis program there's been a lot of speculation in the press and elsewhere that the recession will cause workers to apply for retirement benefits earlier than they would have otherwise we have seen that some in past recessions we've been looking at the data very closely mike stevens in our office just got his finger on the pulse there we're actually not seeing that in the data yet speculation is folks are relying on extended unemployment benefits for now and maybe later if the recession persists then they will apply for the restaurant benefits we do know that some of those intended unemployment benefits are expiring at the end of this month i think the 6 hundred dollars extra that's what you're getting um if that isn't changed by legislation soon um the increases in survivor benefits will likely be pretty limited here um one interesting point is that earlier benefit starts for those who have atrial fatigue actually tends to lower longer term cause by a little bit so what about on the di side um again so far we aren't really seeing any evidence of the increased ei applications um that may happen in the future but we're not seeing a uh one thing we're just showing here on this graph is what happened in the last recession so you can see in 2007 2008 we were getting about 1.5 million disability worker applications a year that jumped up extremely quickly in the last recession up to 1.8 million in 2009 1.9 million in 2010. it did come back down even a lot more precipitously than we expected you can see each one of these lines is what we projected in each successive trustees report you didn't do a great job of predicting this this extreme downturn so it's an interesting graph that we'd like to show so what what will happen in this in this reception if it extends we would expect to see some sort of jump through putting it all together there will clearly be competing effects on the size of the beneficiary's population in the near term there will be a decrease in beneficiary due to the increased deaths there will be increases in beneficiaries if we get additional retirement and disability applications assuming the recession persists and recovery isn't abrupt um just for example if there are an additional 200 000 to 300 000 bi applications and about one half of those are allowed which is about the average will that be on the order of the number of additional deaths we see in 2020 will it kind of even out um or could there be even more beneficiary deaths in 2021. again tons of uncertainty as everyone seems to be saying we keep saying we hope we'll know more in a couple of months but it seems like the further down the road we go the more uncertainty there is you can see bottom line what's going to happen to the trust funds uh under this you can see this is our projection under the 2020 trustees report of what will happen uh to the cost of the program uh and where we will have reached reserve depletion out in 2035 uh at which point uh we wouldn't be able to pay full benefits that was under a not taking into account covered baseline so what are we looking at under the potential recovery well first of all let's take a quick look on the next slide i know that uh jim stock uh earlier mentioned about the last recession many other folks uh including those at the bipartisan policy center and others have said hey maybe this recession is going to be just like the great recession well i think there's some real differences and we ought to be cognizant of that this is not an economic recession of the type that we've seen most often in the past you can see in the great recession here where and as with most recessions the real driver of the impacts on social security is the drop in revenue far more so than any effect on beneficiaries and benefit amounts and you can see though that the last recession which started at the end of 2007 we had only a very gradual uh movement towards less revenue than had been expected this is comparing what actually occurred relative to our 2008 trustees report which anticipated none of that recession you can see it took two three four years for the revenue to really drop off those unemployment rates and the depth of the recession was gradual this recession is so dramatically different it happened in a heartbeat and so there is that possibility that if we get that wonderful vaccine that we're all hoping for that maybe we could come back maybe not as precipitously but perhaps almost as precipitously and you can see also that the persistent effects all the way through 2014 in terms of reduction relative to expectation in constant dollar uh revenue was quite dramatic uh under the under the last recession will we have that under this so bottom line on our next slide uh we we back in april right after our trustees report came out talking with the folks at bipartisan policy center we speculated at that time based on what we'd seen today uh that we might have for the year as a whole 2020 something like 15 less earnings and less taxable earnings and less revenue coming into the program uh if that would have persisted for one year we're wrestling that that would change our trust our combined trust fund reserve depletion date from early in 2035 to mid-2034 that's assuming that in 2021 we would basically come back with full recovery uh if in fact we had two years or a little bit more than two years of a 15 reduction in revenue revenue relative to 2020 trustees report expectation and then came back in 2022 we were expecting that we might move to early 2034 or maybe late in 2033 for the reserve depletion now more recently and as of the hearing we had last week uh and jim stocka made this point that actually the economic recovery to date was looking like it was better than had been expected back in april so what then we were seeing the possibility of maybe only a 10 drop relative to expectation uh in aggregate wages and earnings during the year uh and if it were no worse than that then we might end up with our reserve depletion date advancing again maybe only a half a year into mid-2034 however the huge question is what is going to happen uh beyond that so if we flip to the the next slide which is actually our last slide but i'm glad to tell you this if instead a closure from the pandemic extends through 2021 and in fact which would be contingent upon having a second wave in the fall and if we have or if we have a permanent reduction in the level of economic activity which uh jim was referring to in turn referring to earlier then we could have much more substantial negative effects the great recession obviously advance our our reserve depletion date by about six years uh such could happen again if we take a hit in terms of economic activity from which we do not recover anytime soon so reserve depletion date it's up in the air i i much appreciate jim stock's earlier uh uh panel which showed uh the breadth of a stochastic uh expectation for the future uh and the screen is not tall enough to really show that here uh because we've never seen such uncertainty and with that let me sort of stop here because we want to get louise knowing the panel that i was on uh with uh jim who's been following every daily movement in the in the data and karen and steve who know exactly how this all works for social security i thought i'd go a little bit big picture um let's see how do i so what i'm going to talk about today is what drives economic assumptions usually and how should covet change that and as jim said patreon said i was a member of the last technical panel and so i'm sort of coming at it from that perspective everything i say today should not be intended as any kind of criticism of steve or karen i learned so much from them and they're so thoughtful about this um so i just want to give my my view though um so how does code affect my views on some of the assumptions i'm just going to talk about a few of them um and then i'm going to move it away from just the social projections to think about what the implications of covet are might be for social security policy which is not karen and steve's baileywick but i thought i would include it okay so the first thing i want to talk about is sort of how the projections are framed so they're basically done with two sets you have a near-term set that's the first 10 years on a long-term set that's the last 65 years when we talk about these projections we'll say they're 75-year projections and so you should really lose long-run historical averages as a guide to the long-run assumptions what that means in general is that the first few years are going to kind of reflect current data but then you're going to have to transition to the long run values so most of the first 10 years really are a function of the gap between current values and long run values and that to my mind means that the long run assumptions kind of drive the projections and then i want to ask is the long one really important a lot of people will say and i sort of agree that the long run isn't that important because we don't know anything about it but i don't even want to talk about that right now i think that when you think about why we care about these numbers um from a policy and political perspective the really important numbers are for the next 10 and 15 years right the demographic transition we're a third of the way through it over at 2035 the hi twist is depleting within six years osdi by 2035 pre-covered so getting the next 10 to 15 years right is really what the projection should all be be all about so how does this relate to covid well i think kobe could easily affect the next 10 years but it's not very likely to have large long run effects so if we're going to continue doing projections where we're sort of gearing towards a long run value and we don't change the long run value very much we might miss the code effects i'm not saying they will i'm sure they're thinking very carefully about it but i just think it's something to remember um let me give you an example of what i mean so one of the things um it's that cbo cbo ssa predicts is the labor share so this is the compensation share as a share of gdp we know it declined through the early 80s and it was generally not every year but generally well below the 1947 to 2018 average since there are various explanations for the decline i think we can over explain the decline in the labor share with globalization higher depreciation higher housing share decline in worker power these explanations not sure which ones are exactly right and how they sort of work together but they're all kind of likely to persist at least for a while so if you ask me what my best guess of the labor share over the next 10 to 15 years is it would look kind of like the labor share today um but ssa has says over the long run we're going to get back to the long run average and so you can see they have these sharp increases over the next 10 years so they're back to the long run average by the end of it um so i think that's kind of a problem and then when i think about covet on top of it i agree with jim it's too early to know how anything is going to work out work out but right now when i look at the level of the stock market and the level of unemployment it sure looks like that the labor share is going to stay low for longer um so that's just okay let's look at productivity growth so we've had very weak productivity growth over the past decade the trustees assume it rises back to the long run average almost uh over the next five years i thought this seemed optimistic before could happen but there's not much weight on sort of a secular stagnation hypothesis or something structural like productivity related to aging uh lack of competition and then when we think about what effect poverty will have on productivity you know i'd argue in the long run probably nothing you know maybe there'll be some reduction from like we recognize now that we can have pandemics and so we need to have sort of a little bit more preparation which might be costly but i think over the next 10 to 15 years again speculative i agree the effects could be substantial um if we have a lot of business closures then large costs to start up again we have job losses uh if they're permanent which some of them will clear clearly are it means we're gonna have to find new labor matches the quality labor matches are likely to suffer from specific human capital is going to be lost you know and then another question is this prolonged period of lockdowns and working from home and uncertainty about the future what is in itself doing to innovation right if we sort of believe people all working together in the same offices is kind of really important for innovation um you just wonder whether or not we're sort of losing uh some undefined you know year year and a half where innovation is going to be held down so again when i think about what's going to happen to productivity i would really want to focus on the next 10 to 15 years and not care so much about getting back to a long run average um finally let me talk about interest rates so that's nobody's mentioned so real interest rates have been declining for decades they averaged just a half a percentage point real from 2010 to 2019 aging rising inequality low productivity are likely contributors again things that many people think are going to persist and that interest rates will probably remain low for long um the trustees actually did lower their interest rate recently to 2.3 which i think is a reasonable long run assumption but again they get there very rapidly and so interest rates are going up quite rapidly over the over the next 10 years or five years even and i think that seems unlikely and then what one of the biggest things that's happened since covet is that interest rates have fallen even more sharply um i show here what the july 2020 interest rate on the social security special uh treasury is it's dropped uh 1.25 percentage points since january that's the nominal rate i think the real has probably dropped a little bit less and so this possibility of low interest rates for a really long time seems even more likely than it did before and importantly the probability that the interest rate is less than the growth rate of the economy or less than g is what's high before i think and higher now right and if you think that this might be a longer run recession there might be a lot more saving you just have to worry about this persisting um so why do we so what are the implications now of coving for social security policy and i'll come back to the r less than g um so you know action to address imbalances and social security and increases in the federal deficit we all know the long-run projections we will need to do those eventually uh most likely um i think covet has probably sped up the date of reserve depletion um and likely increased the changes required to address the long-run imbalances particularly because of the lower interest rate um that doesn't necessarily mean that we should act sooner rather than later because of coven okay and i have sort of two reasons one thinking about ensuring the economic recovery is complete and two i'm going to go back to the r less than g okay so ensuring the full economic recovery so under the current law without any additional stimulus dollars which we're likely to get but also no second wave and also pretty optimistic numbers about the control of the virus cbo projects gdp won't be back to pre-coveted baseline for like almost a decade right so in my view the main goal of fiscal policy should be to get back to the hot labor market that we had right before the pandemic labor markets are incredibly helpful for low-income working age households they lead to both higher gdp and lower inequality and i think one of the things that we learned with the hot labor market was potential gdp was bigger than we thought um but you know i worry with debt to gdp projected in the cbo baseline again without additional stimulus um to hit 180 by 2021 and with reserve depletion looming for medicare and social security i think there will be tremendous political pressure to cut spending and raise taxes and i think anything that sort of is aimed at debt reduction or putting social security back on a footing over the long run before we are back to that strong economy is self-defeating for a longer economic and social security health so from that perspective the covenant economy in my view should lead action on social security to be later rather than sooner unless the action is just about either transferring general revenues or announcement of plans far in the future that's not going to affect anybody's uh spending behavior now let's talk about the implications of our less than g so another reason is often mentioned for acting sooner rather than later is because delay imposes costs on future generations and that's the way we've always talked about it so from the 2020 trustees report if substantial actions were deferred for several years the changes necessary to maintain social security solvency would be concentrated on fewer years and fewer generations significantly larger changes would be necessary if action is deferred until the combined trust fund reserves become depleted in 2035. so the truth is if r is less than g over the long run everyone's actually better off if we allow those reserves to exhaust and just run a pay-as-you-go scheme i'm just going to show that with a very simple simulation using two interest rates which i call high and low and i can compare act now and require reserves at the end of simulation to cover costs for one year that's basically the long-run uh social security stability condition or deplete the reserves and then just run a pay-as-you-go scheme okay i'm going to use ssa gdp income and costs and the average nominal gdp growth is about four percent uh over the long run for ssa um my high nominal interest rate is four point seven percent which is the ssa long run and my low number interest rate is one percent which as i said is a little bit higher than what we're seeing now it's a very low one so this is just illustrative i'm not saying this is what's going to happen but i just think that we need to consider the implications if it does happen um so here's the experiments if you look the top right corner i'm just going to explain what the experiment is this is the ratio of trust fund to the costs and so what i call one year is this um situation where we raise contributions just enough um so that by the end of 75 years we have one year's worth of costs in the trust fund and the pay go says do what you're doing now don't do anything different until it depletes and when the reserves replete go pay go okay so you have no trust fund okay so if you look on the left um at the top left this is what happens with high interest rates so and this is the contribution change that you have to make relative to current law for these different stabilization exercises as a share of gdp not payroll um so what i call the one year you have you see that you have to raise contributions by a little bit more than one percent of payroll um per different horizon for paygo you do nothing until uh reserves deplete and then you have to do more in order to be stable you have to go to a pago which sort of stabilizes it one and a half percent of gdp in the level run so this is a classic trade-off earlier generations pay less later generations pay more okay now let's look at what happens if you have our less than g and i do less less because i have this is kind of a big a big r is way less than g here but here you can see it's turned exactly on its head so you have to do about one and a half percent of gdp starting now if you try to do this long run stability with one year of um of assets at the end but if you go panko you do nothing now and then you have to do less and eventually you end up having to do just a little bit less why is that well we're in a world where debt is less than free which means assets are costly right the rate of return on your assets are not enough to keep those assets equal to one year of cost and so you have to take some of your contributions just to maintain those assets and so i'm not saying you know you know with rls and g we should just keep going forever we should pay any taxes so obviously our listen g forever is not something that we can count on or that we you know you can even sort of understand how to think long term about but i do think the fact that it's pretty likely that r will be less than g for a long time um especially with current you know current expectations on interest rates and we have to and i think that at least makes you say the problem is not as urgent as you might think and the benefits of acting sooner are not what you might have once thought and i just think it needs to get into this conversation it has uh been the case in every uh recession we've had for the last whatever 50 60 years that essentially there's been unit root behavior so there's essentially been a step down in the level of gdp and the path has been permanently lower so it could be that this time is different of course this time could be different and there are a lot of things that are really different about it now but i i think betting against the historical correlations especially if um if we stay in this current uh model for the another whatever eight months uh is not something i would want to do that would suggest therefore that we should probably have a lower trajectory for expected uh gdp and productivity growth in general in the future given that uh we have not outlawed the business cycle yet so if we're going to have repeated economic recessions from time to time that would suggest and if each one of them is going to lop off something from our potential then we should have a much lower gradient on potential growth in the future and that's certainly something to consider uh you know to louise's point i i would just want to mention first of all that uh louise you did point out a number of assumptions which you obviously disagree with uh all of which i believe are ones where you're saying the trustees assumptions are too optimistic you didn't point out the disability incidence rates which are assumed to rise back up very quickly uh or mortality improvement which is assumed to rise back up very quickly also uh and uh and sort of going the other direction just by way of balance the other thing i would just comment on that by the way we'll use also is please keep in mind the trustees report by law is supposed to speak to the actual status of the trust funds it's not supposed to be an economic forecast or near term it's supposed to speak to the actual status of the programs where policymakers have tended to want to sort of know what it's looking like it's going to look like over the long term and a final comment too also and here's here's a hyper speculation innovation i think we've all heard uh all of us i believe are dealing from our homes some of us have a beautiful background of of a wooded setting and others have a bookcase like jim has we have two gyms that polar opposites on this uh but but i think there's been a lot of discussion about many businesses now are kind of getting to the use to the idea that people working at home and having less infrastructure space is potentially a model in some cases for the future will that be greater efficiency less efficiency i don't know about you all but i think and and karen in my office people have been actually working more hours than before no commuting time the bars are closed at least here in maryland so so you know is innovation really going to take a hit or is it possible that it could go the other way i'm not saying we're banking on that i'm just saying that uh while economics is indeed the dismal science not everything always needs to necessarily be dismal so so maybe i i'm just gonna can't resist jumping in for a second steve we we actually did a panel last week on innovation and covid at the summer institute and had people who were you know from places like the genealia farms howard hughes medical institute uh research lab and nih i think the general sense and it's also i think born out by the experience of social of summer institute in the last two and a half weeks is that the the thing that is taking the greatest hit in this crisis for scientific interaction is the informal and you know sort of spontaneous discussion of new ideas new projects that people are doing pretty well at managing to keep their current projects going and moving them on to completion but the the startup process for new things is the more open-ended question on how we're doing so the q and a box we have olivia mitchell's asking a question about uh saying in the uk the estimates indicate apparently a five percent saving on social security payouts as a result of covet and do we have any related numbers for the us i think that probably is for karen or for steve to say something oh hey i i i was just gonna say i think we feel like it's really too soon to tell um we're we're learning more where i i don't i don't think we could say anything like a five percent saving at this point olivia i think you should be unmuted if you want to jump in okay thank you yeah i mean it's obviously speculative and the other question is how to the extent that higher mortality is concentrated among the older population how many years of less life will it take before it can make a five percent difference that would once olivia uh you know if if on average people in retirement are living about 20 years that would be simply whopping one year off of of their uh of their life span after they reached retirement that would be about a 5 however we have lots of things going on here i mean it could be more or less than that uh uh as as we move through time right now we're seeing obviously some increase in mortality but we're not expecting to see five percent death amongst our our beneficiary population five percent death amongst our 60 million population would be uh would be a lot and we're not expecting necessarily to see that on the other hand in terms of cost of social security there's speculation that we may have more people being compromised in the near term suffering insults and therefore perhaps coming to us for disability has occurred in a big way in the last recession we are not seeing that as yet again as karen mentioned before probably largely because of the extended unemployment and cares payments if those come to an end before we have a strong recovery in the economy might we see a surge in disability we might see some surge in disability like we did last time but if that's the case we would probably expect that not to be persistent as what occurred in the last economic recession was not persistent so five percent what reduction in overall costs uh you know that sounds like a lot and i'm sure that louise louise would add in well so we'll probably see even a greater reduction that in terms of revenue
