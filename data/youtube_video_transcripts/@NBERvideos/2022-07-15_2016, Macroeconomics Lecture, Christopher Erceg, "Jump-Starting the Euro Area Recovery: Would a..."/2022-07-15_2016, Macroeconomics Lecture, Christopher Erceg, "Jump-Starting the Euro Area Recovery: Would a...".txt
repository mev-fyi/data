this paper is with olivier and with jasper who will continue the presentation in a little while so if the euro area was a fiscal union like the united states there'd be a strong case for fiscal expansion the unemployment rate remains in double digits inflation is too low and monetary policy has limited scope to provide more stimulus given that interest rates are extremely low out the maturity spectrum so given that the periphery economies are constrained from expanding government spending due to fiscal solvency concerns including very high public debt levels any sizable expansion would have to come from the urarius core economies so germany france and some others our paper assesses the effects of an expansion in government spending in the area's core economies so there's extensive literature on fiscal multipliers these are some recent contributions [Music] but they've mainly focused on models that take an aggregate perspective in contrast our paper is going to focus heavily on the distributional effects of an expansion in fiscal spending asking the question would a rise in core government spending raise periphery gdp substantially or would the stimulus mainly be concentrated in those core economies increasing government spending so how diffuse would it be and outside of a liquidity trap the literature has shown that a rise in government spending would actually be likely to depress periphery gdp so be counterproductive in a sense because the ecb would raise policy rates we're going to focus on a fiscal expansion in a liquidity trap in which the effects can be very dramatically different so take away a couple lessons first from the fifth fiscal consolidation that occurred earlier this decade in the periphery um one lesson is that the fiscal multiplier is much larger than in normal times when the zlb is binding olivier alluded to that earlier uh and that's in line with work that he's done with daniel lay looking at the uh specific case of the fiscal consolidation in the periphery but it's certainly consistent with a very extensive literature fiscal shocks have important rebalancing effects on net exports through relative price channels and here what we look at is realized price inflation in the euro area between i'm sorry the realized price level changed between 2009 and 2014 in the year area over that five-year period and uh on the horizontal axis we plot that against the average output gap as measured by the oecd between 2010 and 2014. and what you see are economies including spain ireland and portugal that had very large average output gaps had almost no increase in their prices over that period by contrast uh germany and belgian that had relatively small output gaps on average uh had uh average inflation rates of close to two percent so the price level went up about eight percent over that five year period and so this is suggestive that although there are many factors depressing output in these economies that fiscal consolidation to the extent that it had a material impact caused relative prices to decline and that would have benign effects on the export sector uh conversely we're going to consider the case of fiscal expansion in the core economies which should push up core domestic demand as well as boost core prices rather than periphery prices so relative price adjustment plus uh stronger domestic demand in the core should help periphery exports and that'll be a channel that we consider in our our model good so we show specifically that a core government spending expansion has large positive spillovers to the periphery in a prolonged liquidity trap core domestic demand expands a lot as i just mentioned in part given the multiplier is very large for the country's expanding spending and that should boost periphery net exports core relative prices should be boosted as well that should also boost periphery net exports and finally periphery inflation should rise uh even if less than core crowding in periphery domestic demand so those are three key channels that give us uh sizable spillovers under our preferred model a rising core government spending equal to one percent of your gdp i think about a hundred billion euros essentially would boost periphery gdp about one percent liquidity trap lasting twelve quarters roughly half the effect on core gdp so very different than the case of normal times we're also going to study fiscal expansion in a normative perspective in terms of the modeling framework we use two variants of a two-country new keynesian model that's calibrated so that one block corresponds to the uraire periphery the other to the core the benchmark model is very similar to gaulium monticelli's with some modest extensions and then we also consider a larger scale model that allows for endogenous investment wage and price rigidities and a number of other fractions including hand-to-mouth agents that amplify multiplier effects so the benchmark model is comprised of two countries that may differ in population size so a periphery and core it has complete financial markets producer currency pricing sticky prices ale calvo and we also include habit persistence and consumption to yield more plausible dynamics in particular it helps avoid a high degree of crowding out in normal times and also we allow for some fraction of government spending to be imported it's helpful to decompose the model into two parts the first part can be regarded as determining the aggregate effects on the currency union as a whole and there the usual three equations from the workhorse new keynesian model apply aside from being adjusted for habit persistence and these determine currency union output inflation and the policy rate the second part characterizes the differences between the responses of the periphery versus the core economy this relative or compositional impact turns out to depend only on the terms of trade and exogenous shocks not monetary policy so monetary policy works only through the aggregate channels it affects interest rates in core and periphery in the same way inflation and output so this is just the familiar new keynesian model for the currency union inflation of course is related to the output gap uh via the new keynesian phillips curve output negatively to the difference between the real interest rate and the currency union versus the potential real interest rate in the currency union and finally monetary policy follows the taylor rule subject to the zero lower bound this is all written in deviations from baseline form hence the minus i bar and the zero bound constraint monetary policy determines the response of currency union output so a tight monetary policy could keep aggregate currency union output is zero if it's sufficiently tight uh conversely in a liquidity trap monetary policy will be very accommodative and you'll get big effects on currency union output so you can think of monetary policies determining how much pi there is to distribute between the periphery and core well the next question is how is that pi distributed and relative demand uh in the periphery ydt relative to the core ydd such dt star is given by this expression if you assume that uh omega g which is the import share of government consumption is zero for simplicity to start then a rise in core spending gt star equal to one percent of gdp would simply shift output uh one for one into the core if there is no terms of trade or other uh endogenous adjustment so this is the direct effect but there will be some partial rebalancing towards the periphery well key source is that relative prices in the periphery are going to fall that's going to be represented by a rise in tau t the relative price of court or periphery goods here and the strength of that effect will depend on how much uh the terms of trade moves plus the trade price sensitivity uh summarizes by this composite parameter epsilon so that's going to stimulate periphery net exports and shift a little bit back to the periphery um then uh some core government spending may fall directly on periphery imports that's going to be captured by these omega gs and so that's going to damp the effect of a ryzen gt star on this gap so you know in principle this could be almost completely balanced if you had enough spending going directly to periphery goods so in terms of thinking qualitatively about spillovers of the periphery they depend on the monetary policy response and the degree of tilt towards the core under a very tight monetary policy periphery output invariably must decline because relatively more is going to the core but conversely if monetary policy was very accommodative as in a liquidity trap uh the periphery output would rise so i'll guide you through the empirical simulations or numerical simulation paper so in the benchmark model we we're going to explore the symmetric calibration where the parameters are the same in in the core and the periphery and the core is going to consist of two-thirds of the currency the model features we put in a low phillips curve slope so the coefficient or marginal cost in new case and phillips curve is 0.06 you know this would be consistent with estimates of models you know estimated through the global financial crisis but it's on the low side relative to the pre-crisis evidence say the work that mark did with jordy would say basically twice as high but so it's a little bit lower than normal parameters determine the responsiveness of trade flows trade price elasticity near unity 1.1 core import share of private spending looking at intra-euro area trade it's like 0.01 and we're going to start out with the the talk is just going to focus on the case where the import share of public spending is zero in the paper we play with that parameter monitor policy we think it is a little bit more hawkish on inflation but we have the standard output gap coefficient finally log utility and the habit persistence parameters is is set to 0.8 all right so what we do now is gonna use the model to run uh impulse response function to a core garment spanning shock uh in normal times the liquidity trap and the size of the shock is going to be set so it's one percent of currency union gdp for 10 quarters so it's an ma10 process and then going snapping back to to baseline and we're first going to consider the normal times when monetary policies unconstrained and simply follows the taylor rule and then we're gonna consider the case of a liquidity trap that would last 12 quarters in the absence of any fiscal stimulus and the the core spending hike we're looking at we're going to assume that's not large enough to affect the liquidity trap duration so liquidation is fixed oh all right so so here is the results done in the benchmark model so the left column here shows results in in the normal case there is no liquidity trap case and what you see there is that you have a currency multiplier less than unity because that's the solid blue line because the ecb tightens monetary titan's policy and increase the policy rate so in addition you also see that only core gdp rises periphery gdp actually falls slightly as higher policy rates by the ecb causes private consumption to fall more than offsetting the the the the positive speed lowers you get from the slight depreciation of the terms of trade but those those are not large enough to get the periphery output to expand all right turning to the the right column which is the liquidity trap case you see that basically uh the liquidity trap here as chris said lifts all bolts so it shifts up the currency unit multiplier and it shifts basically ups the the response of core output and periphery output in tandem so it's just like a parallel shift upwards um and essentially from the perspective you know one perspective i guess is that the stimulus to to periphery is you know similarly qualitatively in a qualitative sense to what would occur save if periphery had monetary expansion basically you know we see in terms of trade depreciation which is same as in normal times but we also see as inflation goes up that basically lower real rates stimulates periphery periphery consumption but that lower rate of course is not the lower real rate is not achieved by by cutting the nominal rate it's it's achieved by inflation uh going up solder said this all right so we use the the simple model to do some some normative uh analysis as well and we start out with where we assume that current union welfare is is simply assumed to depend on quadratic inflation and output gap deviations in each country weighted by the population size so the prefix is a third and of course the two thirds and it's a deviation from target inflation plus a coefficient on the output gap so the lambda y here is set to a third now given the current outlook of euro-area economies we find that a core fiscal expansion leads to large welfare improvements uh especially for the periphery according to this metric uh why is that then so the expansion of core g as we said it raises peripheral gdp as we saw in the previous less than half as much as core gdp but periphery welfare nevertheless improves by more than core warfare because the initial condition is such that the previous output gap is much more elevated so the marginal value according to this loss of reducing it is much higher with the quadratic with the quadratic loss all right so that's but of course that loss function is is that hog is not the true welfare so then we also in the paper look at the welfare effects on the utility-based welfare criterion which is given here so there we assume that some utilities is derived from from government spending now while a core only government spending expansion it causes core welfare to improve to buy to some extent that comes from the fact that g enters here it basically gonna leaves discounted periphery welfare about the change according to this to this metric so why why the stark distinction between the difference between that hawk and the utility-based well the litmus test here for periphery welfare improvement is whether the periphery's consumption rise is big enough and front load enough to basically happen when you have a negative consumption gap to justify the cost in terms of higher employment here which is which is a negative according to utility all right so trying to understand that so so basically what this the the the mall that we use that the periphery when the periphery is mined in a deep recession when things are bad period utility in the periphery does improve so we look at the period utility period by period we see it goes up when things are bad but some of the periphery output expansion with the welfare metric is due to higher net exports that is essentially a negative for welfare with with utility-based criteria right they're just working and shipping goods abroad and it's also true that consumption remains high long after the fiscal stimulus has ended and the recovery economy has recovered and also weighs against sort of the the welfare benefits according to utility base so basically it's a wash uh and we think this you know it's interesting to see that the utility-based metric highlights that open inflation responses shouldn't be the sole criteria for measuring welfare but i guess even so we we believe that utility metric likely understates some of the benefits of boosting periphery gdp when resource lag is high for instance due to imperfect consumption insurance all right so i use my last minutes to to go through results in the large-scale model so basically the channels i've discussed in the benchmark model remains operative in a fully fledged open accommodation model with indulgence capital accumulation the mall we use here features two regions within a currency area with you know normal price and weight stickiness its habit persistence consumption and the christian eichenbaum evans type of investment has the cost is hand to mouth households and in the open economy dimensions we have now incomplete markets but we retain the assumption of producer currency pricing now following christine arkenbaum evans and the work we did together we estimate the key parameters to match empirical vr responses to euro-area-wide government spending and monetary policy shock so that's how we pin down the key parameters in this model and what we see in this structural video estimate is that that vr generates an aggregate url multiplier of about 1.5 in normal times which suggests that g-shocks imply some crowding in of domestic demand both cni and in the lower scale model you know how to get that high multiplier well we have to work with a fairly high share of hand-to-mouth households to get that now it's interesting in this logical model to look at the local multipliers and those local multipliers suggest that government spending hike in one region say the core induces crowding in of domestic demand that region with the multiplier estimated to be around basic one point five to two so that's the work by by nakamura steinson among others now in the hand to mouth in the version with in our large game when we hand to mouth agents that actually boost this local uh multiplier above one while it's well below one in in the simple benchmark mode two thirds so in that sense um when you look at the results in the large scale model you would think that that in a sense it would be harder for the spin lovers to be favorable in the large-scale model but in fact that's not true there's still positive very positive spillovers because the large-scale model in a liquidity trap here lasting two quarters as a previous simulation increase g core hike with one percent of currency uv basically elevates the currency union multiplier so therefore even though there is more shifting here towards the core the the elevated aggregate multiplier still implies that the speed lowers to the periphery or are sizeable and in their simple model here you know what we're going to say is that that sort of positive pillows to the periphery are not contingent on very large movements in inflation so just to conclude you know in a deep liquidity trap we think we you know the paper tries to make a case that a government spending expansion decor might be a powerful tool for boosting open inflation with fairly broad-based effects across the corn prefix thank you
