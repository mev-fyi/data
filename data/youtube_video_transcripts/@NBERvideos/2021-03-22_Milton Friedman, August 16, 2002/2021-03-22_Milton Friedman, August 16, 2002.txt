the home of rose and milton friedman here in san francisco and it is august 16th friday in the morning uh do i have that right now okay and milton's gonna begin by telling us um about how he got to the bureau uh and um how he got to the bureau uh from going to colombia and so why don't you begin wherever in the 30s you want to begin no i really got to the bureau i'm sure by virtue of the undergraduate my undergraduate in rutgers because arthur burns was one of my teachers at rutgers and so it was through arthur burns in my connection with the bureau developed and then i went to columbia but that really had uh the only thing that happened at columbia was of course i took a course from wesley mitchell and so i got to know wesley mitchell and wesley mitchell got to know me a little but beyond that the but then i went to washington i worked in washington in the new deal for at the national resources committee and uh at about this time simon cousins had gotten involved with had had been involved in estimating the national income as part of his work on national income he had collected a bunch of data a bunch of questionnaires from independent professionals in as part of his work of getting the data for national income but he thought those data required an additional analysis he started on that analysis but he got tied up and he got too busy and he wanted to hire somebody to help him and i think arthur and burns suggested me to him and that's how and so simon i don't remember the details anymore right but he offered me a job as an assistant to him at the bureau and so that's how i got to the bureau you mentioned something um in two lucky people about the conference on research in in human wealth that was a one of my assignments at the time that is my school the the main purpose for which simon hired me was to work on professional incomes and we did complete ultimately the book on income from independent professional income now as you know that book was the source of a great deal of controversy but going back to what you're saying a secondary duty was that at the time simon was organizing the conference on research and wealth and income which was bringing together the various people who were getting involved in this very rapidly growing field of estimates of wealth and national income and so i served as secretary or something of the right my main function was to edit the proceedings of the right successive meetings that your role on it began when you were on the nrc yes i was on the national research sorry well my role on in that sense if i remember rightly i i attended one meeting i attended a meeting as a representative from the nrc because the nrc was also was producing material that was relevant to the national income estimate was that the first time you met simon i believe so i don't guarantee that but i think it was the first time i met him okay and then um arthur comes to you and and suggests that you were born arthur i think suggested to simon right and simon got in touch with man and uh offered me the job right and then that was september of 37 when you went to the bureau to work with simon you're better off the data's in the book right and i'm sure that's about right right and and then as i say one of the we started analyzing the data that he had gotten from the professional incomes in the course of a year or so i wrote a bulletin about it and ultimately i used this as my dissertation my phd dissertation no so far as the conference and income and wealth was concerned i think it played a very important role at that time it has ever since in the business of the various estimates of national income i was involved with it for the fir i think i edited the first three volumes of the and they say later on that they're the only ones that came out in the same year in which the conference was held that that certainly would be sounds reasonable a lot longer now yeah the uh and that was an education for me i must say because it it exposed me to a range of uh issues and problems that i would not otherwise have had any connection with right but it was not a field that appealed to me particularly as a anything of any interest for my own work and then in between doing that of course your main job was working on these data and working with the professor right right yeah it was a full-time job these were this is a very large collection of data there was a lot of data and there were many interesting problems both statistical and economic right and it was a field in which very little had ever had been done essentially the whole problem with one of human capitalism realized the uh simon had had written a kind of a draft an initial draft before i got on it which consisted mostly simply of as i remember it and very little analysis mostly it was a statistical summary of the relevant material and he and that was mainly to fit it into national income accounting to fill in for this big hole and that's one income from independent data were collected for that reason right that is you had figures for almost everything else but there was no real source of figures for independent professionals and so as part of his project at the department of commerce simon had arranged for a survey to collect a sample survey of the independent professionals and he had used it to make the estimate and what was involved and that was what essentially i started with if i remember rightly so how did do you remember how it transformed from measuring the incomes of independent professional practitioners to fill a national income account to a sort of modern human capital analysis of you know are these equalizing differences why professionals earn more than others workers as opposed to sort of rents in the role of the ama which clearly is what it's remembered for now well i think i had to remember my background was largely economic theory it was statistics as well but the main reason i had really gotten involved in statistics was because that's where jobs were but my basic interest was in economic theory and i had spent studied at chicago before i had gone to colombia and before i had gone to the national resources committee and before i had gone to the bureau and so it seems to me it was very natural as a student in marshall as a someone who was interested in theoretical issues to raise the human capital question that was a question that was obvious and i have no i have no idea i have no recollection of anything other than that kind of a because i don't believe yeah i think that's the i think it just came out of the prior interest in theory but it wasn't very it did i i i realized at the time that it was both simon and i realized at the time that it was a not exactly a widely used approach at the time and of course simon's interests it was clear that simon had an interest in distribution uh and this fitness the other thing that's you see one of the other things i was involved at the bureau was the the study in delaware the state of delaware this is these are the tax records from the yes pierre du dupont right was tax commissioner for the state of delaware and he had money of his own that he was willing to spend over and above what the state provided and he decided that the only way he could get a satisfactory income tax was by requiring everyone to file whether they were subject to tax or not and he paid the extra costs of that out of his own pocket as i remember it and so that was a body of data which had no counterpart in the rest of the country and i forgotten who was that there were some somehow there was a group in delaware i used to go down about once a month or something that was very important because it was during the war and i was able to bring back or or it was before the war but just before the war and i was able to bring back for rose uh nylon stockings which were available only in delaware this is the ponzo yeah they were very precious at that time though today as she would tell you they were very thick compared to the stockings you get today and yeah simon was very much interested in the subject of income distribution and the delaware project was one project directed at that there was also a project in wisconsin using the wisconsin tax returns and again that was part of the attempt to get data on the distribution of income all right um do we have any other questions on simon well i guess you know their issue is clearly there was controversy developed in this book over the conclusions concerning physicians medical practitioners versus dentists and you know i understand there were many years it took for the publication to come out because of this oh yes it was it was delayed about what i think it was completed let me see if i've got this right i think it was completed the book was essentially completed i think by 1940 early 40. it comes out 45. and that delay was entirely due to the this problem no i no longer remember exactly the same but it's described in detail in our book so i don't really think that right that's funny and you know so i don't want to let this go without expressing my admiration for simon he was you know he it would have been very easy for him to have taken the position as well we don't want any trouble with this let's get rid of this joke but he didn't he was completely supportive you see i was responsible for this junk of course right and so but simon's position was always one of being supportive and of going as far as he possibly could to make sure that we weren't prevented from saying what we thought was right and mitchell also was very supportive right i mean this was just uh i think i think it's a very unusual episode in a way because under those circumstances you know i was not very naive at the time but after a long experience since then the temptation is always to compromise to give in right i mean it's it's a it's a wide group of directors in part this policy is a good policy in saying that books will be reviewed by everybody and anybody has the right to dissent but uh but because the people on on the board are representing different different groups they're advocates then it then it's not all scholarly and then there could be a problem is in this case yes in this case right have there been well you've been going over this i'm sure you have there been any many more cases of that kind i think even monetary history and but the monetary history had an odd one and and i reread that dissent and it's it's it's almost a real chuckle because the person has great admiration and respect for what you and anna wrote and somehow he wanted to dissent and it wasn't clear exactly what the dissent was um i don't remember any other there are some other decisions but certainly not in the past 20 something years while there still are board members representing different constituencies they aren't very active right technically still any bureau book has to be approved by the board of directors by no memory of anything being held up at that level in many years one why yeah i mean why should there be a difference you would think the afl-cio has a representative you know they would have an interest in potentially things that you know come out on trade positions for example very different than that i don't fully understand i think it's insane possibly the professionalization of the field that then separated it from people who were represent who were advocates and representing various groups but the members of the board are still advocates that's right but i think that they give in in some sense to the scholars and the academics and the professionals and they'll distance themselves and say well i don't really know that much about this but why didn't they do that earlier that's right the question is what outlets because now those same groups when they're not on the board of directors have you know their their organizations in washington that go to the press and release reports on all these different issues but they don't seem to view this as the arena for playing out that that in a way they apparently did the time right in the 40s of course the bureau has has become so much larger it's it's there are many more publications per year right i think it may also be that this was still in the period when the bureau served an extremely important role that was in between the world of academics in the world of government which it does not play now so therefore this became a huge contested area and what the bureau said what the bureau did was far more important that may be why maybe and so therefore the what you were saying the bureau put its imprimatur on this and therefore the people on the board of directors said do we want this to be viewed as the opinion of the bureau and now all of our books say that they have a disclaimer that in fact the bureau has nothing to do with this and and and i don't know when that was when that was added but maybe that's part of it but um i think it's an important part of the history though right can do you have anything that you want to say apart from what you've said elsewhere about the relationship between independent professional practice in the theory of the consumption function that that you view your work with simon as being quite pivotal in your work that came after on the course oh yeah i think so sure um i think the the uh income professional from professional practice uh was very important in the future certainly the consumption function is derived almost entirely from it the whole notion of permanent income versus transitory income comes from the professional income study now but i think that's inevitable you take any scholar and his work is going to be cumulative what you've do what you did in your first first study undoubtedly influenced what you did in your neck and it's been influencing what you're doing now one way or another so uh now what's interesting about this perhaps the role of the bureau in my own case is much more important in a different way it's the main reason why i ended up spending most of my time and money see if you go back professional incomes wasn't about money i started out as an i started out as a pure price theorist in in jacob mincer's terms uh and from pricing then i went on to consumption function that had nothing to do with money now i'm not sure the bureau was not solely responsible for my interest in money of course because i wrote about it when i was i got interested in that largely as a result of being at the treasury during the war and being concerned with inflation and so i i wrote my first pieces in the field of money during that period before i came and got involved in the bureau but then it was the the the request by arthur that i undertake the money project for the bureau that was responsible for my devoting so much tension over the next 30 years or so to the field of money and so that's the moment that's certainly the main way in which the bureau influenced me right um let's get into that so arthur came to you and um it must have been around 49 do you remember a little bit earlier than that i would say and and said to you that the the bureau wanted to do in its usual way putting money in including money in the grand scheme of business cycles that's right but was it also that that arthur and mitchell in their own work had realized in their empirical work that every single major downturn was accompanied by uh banking distress enormous banking distress was part of it then well if you go back to mitchell's initial business cycle volume the 1913 volume that of course stressed the role of banks and money after all business cycle theory for two for well going back to hume was really uh very heavily centered on banks and money so all along the the plan mitchell's plan of uh starting from his 1913 volume and essentially then his what 1926 his business cycle his second book which was not much of a book the first book was a real book that was his idea was to develop each chapter of it each section of it so he had as you know more on inventories and the thread mills on prices and so on and one of the missing elements was money and in view of my own interest in money see as they say i developed the interest in money uh as a result of that my work at the treasury orchestra asked me if i would be willing to take over right the money chapter right of the other of the takeover because angel had been working on it i really don't remember i really don't know anna said that she had begun it um she had done this work in 41 with jim angel yeah she had taken a course from columbia in trade and and she and angel worked on it um and of course she was the person who was collecting the data collecting it in the as she said in the bureau tradition that monthly was what you had to do everything had to be monthly and she had a set of series that she was supposed to collect and she would work in her little cubby hole up in columbia on this work and she was you know a paid employee of the bureau not a research fellow not a research assistant as you had become and um and she she labored at this and then angel wasn't that interested in it and left the project she never she didn't say exactly how much she had done but she had worked for a very long time but in addition she had worked with gayer and of course on the other project that's right right and that's what gave her um a sense of what you had to do to do the bureau business to do it in the bureau business cycle fashion right and then you're right to bring that up of course when arthur came to me he told me that anna had been doing the work you know and essentially offered me the to have the services of anna and to start from her work so she was an essential element in the that she was in a way the bureau's contribution to me absolutely and um and in many ways vice versa because uh as you must know from anna her view of economics was never the same after the two of you met well i suppose that's so but in many ways it was a very good collaboration there's no question we complemented one another i really never would have had the patience to go through the uh accumulation of all the data which anna has she's a real economic historian which i am not and on the other hand i think i complemented her in terms of the theoretical aspects of the subject so it was a very good collaboration and you know we worked together for what 25 years or so or 40 well from 1948 or so to 1985 about it that's pretty good yes right and as i say it was a very good collaboration we never had any fights never had any argument right i don't mean i don't mean to say we didn't have any differences but we never had any personal arguments but as anna said if you had any differences of opinion they would have been expressed in writing that's right because there were two different places you were two different places and telephone calls were somewhat expensive that's right no but you know it's it's it's interesting uh one thing that interests me currently is the extent to which there is multiple authorship apparently nobody ever publishes anything on his own a few people yeah very few very few why is that now now i mentioned that because i think collaboration can be very useful at a distance but also it seems to me it's being much overdone i can't believe that it's that these three four or five person papers make any sense how do you explain that is that simply because more people want to have a longer well i think that uh one has to ask whether the quality of the papers is very good and whether people are putting out papers because they feel that uh that this is part of the sort of grand game and graham scheme and therefore they're sort of going down the you know marginal benefit curve and so they're hitting it much too low now and people are getting more than one-fifth the credit if they're writing with five people is one possibility see i would think that when i look at somebody's vita they look for the papers they've written by themselves right they're the only ones you can really judge about it right and we spend a lot of time in meetings trying to figure out what this person's contribution was and by golly if you want to support the person you take all the four authored papers and you give them full credit for and in another meeting in another city author number two is being given a hundred percent of the credit so if you add it up there's 400 percent well i think two authored papers are still more sort of the norm has gone from one to one there are a lot of three we we do a fair amount together and our meeting somewhat like your meeting with anna was a sense of of you know an edgeworth box and gains from trade appearing and that's the way i view my work with with larry i don't view uh these four authored three ortho five authored papers often as having very much uh additional benefit it's often that author one published a piece on axe and author two on y and now we have x plus y and we've gained nothing um let's talk about uh when you first met anna and uh what you talked about perhaps i know that we can't reproduce that moment but the uh the vision that that the two of you had do you remember anything about the first meeting or the early meetings you went to new york i think right i think so yes uh i think again it's if anybody is really seriously interested in that it's all documented in the letters and papers that and i changed with one another right because it was mostly done by correspondents rather than in person i think i may have made one trip or one or more trips to new york certainly as of that time would have been going to new york on and off and of course whenever i was in new york i spent some time with anna but my memory isn't good enough to answer your question right but let's talk about ideas the the vision that that anna had for the project at first it wasn't necessarily her vision it was what the bureau was going to do what jim angel what arthur had wanted what wesley claire mitchell had wanted years before but when you stepped in when did you suddenly see what the vision was what the project was going to be i don't know because it certainly it changed in various ways sure it changed but the change had nothing to do with money right it had to do with the fact of a theoretical approach as opposed to an empirical approach and the uh the fact was that the mitchell's approach see mitchell was not really a theorist no i uh i listened to in the year i spent at columbia as a student when i did graduate at columbia i uh attended mitchell's course in business cycles and i thought it was kind of a dull course because there was no theory in it there was no it was it was really all empirical pure empiricism uh and so any subject you know my natural tendency was to approach any subject whether it was consumption or professional income from a point of view of economic theory and similarly if i'm going to deal with money i want to look at it what's the demand for what is the demand curve what's the supply curve uh how do they interact et cetera that's what naturally occurs to anybody of a theoretical band uh now i always felt i felt then and i feel now that the bureau's great virtue is to combine the emphasis on the empirical side with a theoretical approach that the see if we go back to the early days when i was involved there i didn't have much use for the work that fred mills did because i thought it was holy almost wholly empirical and didn't really have any any theoretical understanding so i don't know if there was any grand plan at all we just started out to uh well one thing that influenced us very much to begin with as we i'm sure i've described it in the uh two lucky people is uh going down to princeton and talking to uh what's the matter with me um was that where walter stewart was walter stewart yes talking to walter stewart he was a very very wise fellow and had a great deal of experience has been as you know at the at the bank of england and also at the federal reserve bank and the original understanding that was that we were going to do a statistical analysis and he really persuaded us that we needed to precede it by doing a history and it was really water steward who was responsible for getting us to go on the historical side right and well i really don't we if we if we were going to do this seriously the thing to do would be to go back to the papers that ann and i exchanged at that time i think they're all down into te hoover in the archives and uh i hesitate to try to reconstruct that that's okay because uh um i think that uh my dear friend who rockoff would love to do that and we'll do that yeah because this is uh one of the questions that he's here hugh rockoff who was his boy rocco who was here exactly is he still in rutgers he still is they have a very good group of uh economic historians who do uh financial and banking history three of them well rockoff michael bournemouth and jean white that's a very very very good group um i've been kept in touch on and off with mike bordeaux much less with the others right um so walter stewart suggests to you that the book have what you and and he must have called a narrative a historical narrative and and i believe that that that date from what um what you've written about it was in about 1953 that you spoke to walter stewart uh maybe a little bit earlier i don't remember yeah i think in in the acknowledgments to a monetary history you you begin the acknowledgments with um a bit more than a decade ago uh walter stewart expressed to one of us and i i didn't know which one i it was obviously you uh that we add a narrative and and you said we had written uh several chapters and um and i i think you had almost completed the entire um core of the of the volume without the narrative and then he said add a narrative and you added a narrative to one chapter and then it looked good and you added a narrative to another chapter into another chapter until it developed into the book that it is well let me see 60 that would have been 63. so that's right the acknowledgement was written in 63 so this would have put it in about 50 152 right so it was fairly soon after you stepped into the project uh yeah it was very soon after so uh of course anna you you you stepped into the project and anna probably already had a lot of it had all the data right well not all the data but she had a lot of data right you know she had done the major data work before that right and and had could show you various aspects of them you could make sense out of it you couldn't you could put it into more of a theoretical model and the book began to gain shape and gain take form but let's talk a little bit about this narrative because as an economic historian um it it it is a superb and important book in history and um it must be hard for for one to say at some point you realized that you were writing a great book of history no oh no of course not you never do that you don't ever you don't ever think of your own work in those terms no you're just doing your right you're doing what seems right but you must have switched on in your mind a different mode of writing for example in the great contraction volume which became a volume part of it is is brilliantly written it's it's compellingly written um did you have that sense it's written in a very different way than than the dreyer bureau books and and even your own work that you've done for the bureau was written it's it's some of it is is great writing did you have a sense that you were writing a a an important compelling narrative no oh hold on yes there's no doubt i had the incentive the feeling that the narrative was important not that the writing was important yes but the narrative was important i had no doubt whatsoever that the point we were making was an enormously important point and that it would have that had major implications for economic and monetary policy that it was certainly clear to me at the time that the bulk of the profession regarded the great depression as uh having very little to do with them with the as being a failure of the business system and that the thesis that it was a failure of the government under the monetary system was against the grain of what was taken to be orthodox standard value so that i understood completely there's no question but it wasn't the narrative it was the events right the the story that was important right well i suppose sometimes when the story is important you write from some other part of your brain that makes it a very compelling writing as well well it they're you know ann and i more or less we have no record of who wrote which yes that's interesting um how did uh going back to your times at chicago before you went to columbia can you tell me how your courses and and studies with mints and simon's influence the monetary history i never took any course with simon simons i knew him i got to know him personally and i read what he wrote and undoubtedly listened to them in lectures but i never took any formally took any courses with them but there's no doubt and i would say that viner as much as men's even though i took a course from viner in in international economics and of course from mints and money and both of them of course were quantity theorists and both of them emphasized the role of money and so undoubtedly my basic theoretical understanding owed a great deal to both weiner and and mints but and so it influenced them it influenced monetary history primarily by providing the theoretical background the framework theoretical framework in terms of which we try to analyze the problem that is after all the whole structure of the book is one of supply versus demand right and the statistical core of it is a date on the supply of money fundamentally right using that test looking at money demand yeah is there i know you'd worked as a research assistant for um schultz schultz on estimating demand sort of functions of that yes is that part of the intellectual heritage of thinking of then the sort of empirical work there or was that a sort of did you make any connections between well i suppose it had some connection i have to admit that i'm not very much given to introspection but i suppose it had some connection the but it really didn't in a way because it all goes back simply you know what really what really opened my mind was a one quarter of pure economic theory which i took with jacob weiner and that was really the real eye-opener that gave you a different framework in which to see things it's it's like what you described of jacob minster that you suddenly see a light and i think viners course opened up that light in my mind and that that applies to everything money anything else all really the same principles right um anna and uh has told me that she views a monetary history one of the key aspects of it is that it pioneered the role of money in the real economy others and i believe you're on record for saying this say that it it expanded that view but it didn't pioneer it can you comment a bit on this slight difference of opinion well you can go back to to david hume in his famous essay in which he clearly indicates that the effect of money on the real economy when he talks about the fact that what's necessary is it it'd be a slow and steady right increase and that at first essentially he has a modern analysis of it so it's hard to say that anything that was written in 1960 or 1950 would have pioneered the idea of money having a role in the real economy on the other hand what is true is that that way of looking at things had gone out of fashion right right and so this was a reminder and a re-repeat of it right but it surely did not pioneer it right but i don't know you know you know when you're writing something you're not thinking in those terms when you're writing something you're writing something and that problem now i just saw your piece in the uh in the jpe on the uh what on the tele yeah and now before you sat down to write that did you think about what anybody else what what the current state of thinking was about or whether you were pioneering something or anything no you just had a problem and you when you tried to solve the problem so i really don't have anything to say about that right one other thing about the use of history when you began to restructure the volume with history did history uh did the uh and you you someone you and anna both sat down and read an enormous amount of mainly secondary literature okay some of the greats some material that you later found lacking some material that you had to accept because you weren't going to go back to the primary sources did the um historical work what we'll call the historical narrative uh change um what you were doing in any way did it turn on lights did you see something that was different can you remember any of the episodes uh historically in which it had any grand effect or was it to sort of make it more interesting i find it very hard to answer that question okay because once we got started on the on the line of making it a narrative everything developed together as you came to the episode and trying to understand them i really don't know how to answer you that's a that's too hard a question right it must have been enormous fun reading all these secondary sources yes sure it was sure anna did most of the historical work i read what she told me to read she but she did a much broader reading than i did well it's always very good to have an extraordinarily good research assistant or colleague who will read everything and then say this is what's important and then you go out and you look at it and then it turns lights on for you and that's that's extremely good well she was a she was a collaborator and a colleague not not a research assistant absolutely that's why i i was thinking of my own research no no that's right i i remember in one state phil kagan was my research assistant and he did exactly what you've described i had him read a whole lot of stuff and tell me what i had to read right right do you have any questions but i guess in if i think of your the three major projects you did with the bureau income from independent professional practice theory of the consumption function and monetary history they all have they're all different they all seem to have a style of a strong analytic theoretical framework organizing them but then rather than going out and getting one body of data and doing a specific type test of the theory i would sort of say there's a collage of evidence of a wide range of implications of the theory you know looking at whether it's budget studies and time series size consumption function cutting the data different ways and in professional practice looking historically as well as contemporary monetary history do you have i mean much of empirical research you know no no i understand that's because i understand when you're on a specific test you know i've always been very i've always been very skeptical of narrowly based because of the fact that statistical tests of significance are really of limited use because they're always the best of so many and you take if you take if you you if you massage one body of data you can always get some good statistical results but it's useless and so i've always tried i've always had the preference for trying to see if you can get a broad range of material try to get different countries or try to get different periods of time or something else but don't depend on any single analysis it's good to have the statistical analysis but it's it's a very very shaky basis on which to stand so i think what you're describing is has always been sort of part of my modus operandi a good lesson for economics today many of these four authors papers are on very narrow questions i know i think so much of today's i find i can't read more to what comes out today because it's so narrow and and so much of a of a detailed uh of a of a over analysis over statistical analysis i've always i've thought that the journals today are making a great mistake they ought to insist on relegating more of the mathematics to the appendix and having more of english in the right in the article and then they would see that they didn't have much of an article and then they would demand more yes then they would have thinner journals yes right but they have actually the the number of articles has not increased in a typical journal but the number of pages per article despite the fact that they seem to be more narrow right um just in conclusion um uh you you said in in your book with rose that the bureau opened a new world for me and uh and you said some wonderful things about the bureau about the attitude towards research about the fact that and you said it was it was a role uh it was one that was to play a large role in shaping the rest of my academic life that's a very strong uh very complimentary statement well but surely the fact that these money monetary studies that i did the the professional income and consumption functions were relatively limited in both size and duration but after all i spent something over two or three decades on a monetary study and it had it not been for the bureau i would not have been doing those right and had it not been for the bureau i would not have had the collaboration of anna so it's clear that it did play a very important role in my academic life right and it all begins with your undergraduate days at rutgers it all begins with your arthur burns whom you greatly admired as a as a teacher he was a splendid teacher yeah arthur that's a very that's a very difficult subject yes but arthur was a great teacher and certainly one of the major educational experiences i had was these the seminar in which there were what two or three people are two of us i think only two of us going over arthur's doctor's dissertation on production trends and that was a real education um but as you know the problem is i got into some difficulty with arthur when he was in washington right over his support of price control right one one last thing i i but you know yeah i don't know did you know arthur at all i met author um on one or two occasions that i remember i didn't know author so much as an academic and scholar than as i did as someone who would deliver comments at conferences um when when he was you know it was probably in the early 1980s um because arthur was really he was an excellent teacher and he was he was he was a first-rate economist in every respect his book production trends it was an important book measuring business cycles was an important book though it was a it was subject to criticism as not having enough theory in it right but arthur himself interestingly enough was capable of theoretical analysis he was very much of a of a of an admirer of marshall and i was first introduced to marshall through or by arthur but on the other hand he was in some ways more interested in the politics of the things than he was in the economics of it that's i think was he was not a good chairman of the fact unfortunately right when he was appointed i wrote a column in newsweek saying the right person at the right place at the right time and i was just wrong um of course you were close with simon you were close with author do you have anything to say about their differences at the bureau no i observed their differences they really were not compatible personalities and they did differ a good deal i guess that's why or simon really left the bureau on that account but i never got involved in their personal discussion i never but how would you summarize briefly their their their differences their very different personalities do you think they were largely personal or do you think they were also substantive over what research direction the bureau should should be going i really don't know i don't think they were personal though i think that we're over the what the bureau should be doing because well i shouldn't say that i really don't know you know i'm i'm not very good at that kind of thing but and um they didn't as you know at the time i knew them simon was living in philadelphia and arthur of course was living in new york so there was not a great deal of personal contact their contacts were mostly at the what's happened to rose excuse me let me get this one pretty close to our arthur and helen burns in a way that we were not that we were close we were right intimate we knew very well simon and edith but we didn't have the kind of contact with them that we had with a burger and burned us and we spent the summer up in the same part of vermont new hampshire every summer so we saw a lot of them and so i never observed very much the personal interaction right between arthur and simon right i think that the major break came earlier in about 47 when simon wanted the bureau to go in a more comparative direction and arthur stayed more with the original mission of the bureau which was the foundations of the u.s economy but um let me just conclude this by thanking you enormously absolutely glad to do it pleasure to see you okay thanks
