I will attempt to place field experiments and lab experiments within cross-sectional reduced form and instructional approaches to start then I will talk about the types of field experiments that have Arisen in economics and I will talk about how these field experiments have been used to think about testing theory for speaking to policy makers Etc and from there I I don't want you to leave here without having a few thoughts about design so if you would go out tomorrow and run an experiment I want you to have a few things in the back of your mind about how you would design your experiment okay so I'll probably end this morning with a few design insights in this afternoon I will bring forward something I call opening my laptop which will include several examples of the different types of field experiments that I'll talk about this morning okay I'll I'll break down the types of field experiments into something called an artifactual field experiment a frame field experiment and a natural field experiment and along the way here please ask any questions if you have them I don't want this to turn into a University Chicago seminar um I'll only get through three or four slides if we do that but by all means please ask a clarifying question or if I say something that you don't agree with just call me on it and we can discuss it okay so let's get started so in light of the fact that the last few methods lectures have been about things like reduced form models and structural models I I've been thinking about how to place generation of data into some sort of schematic and the way I think about it is on the one end we have ways of modeling interesting data or ways to look at naturally occurring data and of course we have a lot of different methods over here which which we've been playing around with for years and and when you step back the simple goal here is to create the proper counterfactual now all of these approaches have different ways to create the proper counterfactual and we debate whether the assumptions that we make using these approaches are valid or not but essentially that the Crux of it is we cannot observe the proper counterfactual so we have to develop a technique to construct that proper counterfactual to estimate a treatment effect okay now on the other end of the extreme we have something that has arisen in the last several decades called laboratory experimentation okay now here obviously the most important assumption for most lab experiments is that you have proper randomization this is your identification assumption whenever you're dealing with these types of experiments or most of the experiments is that they're using randomization as their instrumental variable okay once you have proper randomization and a proper sample size this is of course what gives you the proper counterfactual now lab experiments have been around for a long time the way I look at it I've traced experiments in economics all the way back to Daniel Bernoulli who ran essentially the most famous St Petersburg Paradox experiments back in 1738 and interestingly his resolution to the Saint Petersburg Paradox was something that looked a lot like expected utility Theory okay from there you can trace economic experiments to Thurston which was published in the Journal of Social Psychology and here he's essentially trying to construct indifference curves in this 1931 paper now within the economics literature the first real Market experiment that was published was actually published in the jpe in 1948 and it was written by Chamberlain not by Vernon Smith Vernon Smith gets a lot of credit for being the first to run Market experiments but Vernon Smith was actually a student of Chamberlain's and he was a subject in these experiments um that's of course what motivated Vernon to think harder about running Market experiments it was Chamberlain's Market experiments which he ran in the mid 40s which we eventually published in the jpe now Nash of course ran a lot of two by two simple experiments as well testing his uh theories of games okay now it's clear however that the experimental method did not really pick up very quickly within the economics literature and what I have here I have a number of Publications on the y-axis and I have time here you know you have Chamberlain back in here Vernon Smith published two seminal papers in the jpe in 1962 and 1965. Charlie Plott came in around here but there still was not a lot of action within the economics literature until around the 70s and 80s when all sudden we have this explosion of research using the laboratory experimental method now I've updated this and partly refined it in this particular time series and what this shows is the number of experimental Publications in top 15 journals from 1948 to 2006. and as you can see where 98 left off we have a huge increase in the number of Publications within economics there's only one major journal that has not followed this path Derek can you name that journal the very Journal that was publishing Chamberlain's work in Smith's work the JP is the only Journal that has not followed this particular path in publishing lab experiments but the JP has been extremely sympathetic to field experiments so all seems well and maybe we should just stop with lab experiments is that right tell us how you really feel major top four I apologize for that Jolly um now what hit home for me when I was working at the Council of economic advisors was you know I do a lot of laboratory experiments myself and I was arguing that when we revise the benefit cost guidelines we should be taking account of the results from condom and diversity and thaler on the endowment effect we should be thinking hard about why willingness to accept is five to ten times larger than willingness to pay and think about using that fact within benefit within the benefit cost guidelines okay and this is a Verbatim quote from I can't tell you his name but it's fair to say he was a top ranking White House official even though these results appear prevalent they are suspiciously drawn by methods similar to Scientific numerology because of students who are not real people okay now whenever I present lab work this is the first line of defense that you give me look John these are students they're just playing around they're not real people it's exactly what the White House thought back in 2002 as well now there are more criticisms than just the representativeness of the population so there was a discussion a brief discussion in 1980 which was begun by cross who notes it seems to be extraordinarily optimistic to assume that behavior in an artificially constructed Market game would provide direct insights into actual Market Behavior he's taken a shot at what Vernon's working on throughout the 60s and 70s and a state a broad statement like that makes you step back and say well what exactly are the differences between that environment that particular domain and the domain of of interest to theoreticians and empiricists of course a commodity the stakes the environment Etc might be different now Vernon responds to this in his AER paper saying sometimes experiments are criticized you know people suggest that there are differences between lab and field Behavior but so far today there there's no data to show that so therefore the criticism is pure speculation this is about where we are still in the economics literature we're we're Gathering data in part Via Field experiments to help to inform this particular debate about the generalizability between lab behavior and other markets okay so I argue that one important component of field experiments will by necessity be this idea to answer the first order question does behavior in the lab generalize to behavior in the field okay so now now we go to field experiments and let's step back and think about some of the early field experiments and I've just written a paper about the three what I call the three major waves of field experimentation and I'm defined in field very broadly as you'll see what in this first particular wave which I'm calling the dawn of field experiments this is a paper with Steve Levitt that was just published in the European Economic Review we call the Donna field experiments literally the manure experiments that nyman and Fisher were running in the teens and the 20s okay they were literally in the field randomizing different manure types over plots of land but interestingly enough this has had profound implications for not only lab and field experiments and economics but experimental methods throughout the Sciences why because through this Fisher developed What's called the tripod of experimentation where he put forth randomization block design and replication is three of the important factors that lead to appropriate conditions for good statistical analysis okay this was essentially laid out in the 20s by Fisher and nyman now what we call the second wave of field experiments would be the wave of social experiments who do you think should get credit for being an early Pioneer social experiments in economics not not in life more generally any guesses it's a person who received her PhD from MIT and she's currently working at resources for the future Heather Ross so Heather Ross was instrumental in running the early social experiments that were testing Friedman's proposed negative income tax at the time these experiments cost roughly five million dollars I think it's fair to say that this could have been one of the most expensive doctoral dissertations in economics still today at right around the same time in Europe there were some electricity pricing schemes in Great Britain that were were being executed that would fall under the guy's a social experiment now social experiments have not only led to some some very interesting policy results which I think of the development experiments that that Michael will be talking about later is a kind of social experiment and I'll be calling all of these framed field experiments in a minute but of course they presented some really new and interesting questions as well for example plots of land cannot excuse themselves from treatment and they cannot select into treatment so this gets at the selection issue that that Heckman has taken on now and others of course have taken I know more broadly this this issue touches off this debate which some people tell me there's a debate between structural econometricians and experimental advocates being at the University of Chicago I don't see that debate because we all agree but some people say that that there's a debate between these types of of researchers now the the third wave which I'm arguing that we're in right now are the more recent field experiments and this is what Harrison and I when we came up with this classification of types of field experiments so we can think about the lab as being a very sterile controlled environment where sometimes we use randomization to achieve identification some lab experiments don't recall that most of Vernon Smith's experiments do not use randomization to achieve identification they're called experiments because he has control okay so what we call an artifactual field experiment is something that I don't really consider a field experiment at all but nonetheless it's an important step from the laboratory environment in that a lot of people believe that representativeness of the population is an important variable when thinking about generalizing Behavior so we call an artifactual field experiment one where it's identical to a lab experiment but it's using a non-standard subject pool okay so if that's the only problem with the lab method then the lab method is not in in any trouble at all frankly because it's not very hard to go out and recruit Farmers to go out and recruit CEOs to go out and recruit Chicago Board options Traders and stock Traders I've done all of those things myself it's not that hard to recruit those types and bring them into the lab okay now the next step in this new wave of field experiments we categorized is go ahead foreign I'll talk about that a little bit later essentially it's blocking out a characteristic and then randomizing over that characteristic so you put you'd block on you'd say women and then I'd say I want half women in treatment and half in control that's what a block design is in in um You can compare that to uh a factorial design where you're just randomizing each person coming in a factorial design then you might not get the variation in women or in men or in in any other characteristic that you're interested in but we'll talk a little bit about that later that's a good question though okay we denote at a framed field experiment is one whereby you begin to add naturalness in the environment such as the stakes are the same as the environment that you're thinking about the information is the same the task is the same the commodity is the same the timeline is the same however people still know that they're taking part in an experiment importantly they're still signing consent forms they're still selecting into an environment in which they know that their behavior will be scrutinized okay now what I think of is the final frontier in this experimental wave is what we denote is a natural field experiment and this is going to an environment randomizing within that environment without anyone knowing that there's an experiment going on so they're acting in their environment as naturally as possible of course by definition but yet the experimenters going into that environment overlaying perhaps a randomization and that's how the experimenters achieving identification by looking at treatment and control for example so now you have randomization which is the beauty behind experimentation and you have realism by definition you're doing the randomization in an environment where no one even knows that they're taking part in an experiment I think I consider this the best of both worlds now it's not always possible to run a natural field experiment on a lot of the interesting and important economic questions that we can think about so where I depart from my experimental colleagues is I don't think lab and field experiments can answer every question that we face as a society but it can answer a lot of interesting questions okay any questions about this classification scheme yes sure and if I don't please bring that up by and large a lot of even though I have IRB approval for all of my natural field experiments I'm beginning to learn that a lot of it is IRB exempt um but we can discuss that later and I've written a little bit on consent in Social experiments a few recent science papers where there's a there's a give and take because that's when I wrote this paper for science a letter was written back into science saying list uh gleefully says natural field experiments are great and the fellow says what happened to inform consent so then I had to write a long response back but um we can we can talk about that later any other questions on this okay good good so in development the way I think about it is there are a lot of development field experiments that fall here I'm not sure if Michael's going to talk about those but I can talk about those this afternoon some fall A Lot Fall here and a few fall here okay okay so the underlying idea now is pretty simple we have some ways to generate our own data we have lab we have lab experiments we have several different types of field experiments and we have models that can can look at naturally occurring data now the argument here is that it's worthwhile to think about sampling these environments over here even though they're small scale field settings many times we can ask and answer questions over here that are impossible to answer over here and I'll give you a few examples in a few moments of course these aren't the most important markets so then we have to think hard about how we can generalize results from over here over here okay and that's exactly what theory and further empirical testing can do for you so what are some uses of field experiments no no for me most of the time I'm going out trying to test Theory either one of my own theories or Theory that's out there okay but there are many other uses of course measuring key parameters if you reject the theory collecting enough information to construct a new theory for example speaking to policy makers which Michael will talk a lot about and most recently I've found that field experiments can actually make firms a lot of money so in in talking about natural field experiments I'll talk about some of my experiments with Charities and with firms near the end of this afternoon okay now it's been raised a few times and naturally it will be raised and that's this these methodological questions and what I've argued is the most important question facing lab experimenters and that's whether behavior in the lab generalizes to behavior in the field I'm not going to talk much about these methodological considerations number two I think is a very important question facing behavioral economies many behavioral theories today are written based on results from the lab to date we have little idea what overlaying a real Market setting does to those anomalies and we have little idea about how market experience whether diminished attenuates or diminishes or exacerbates these anomalies there's not a lot of empirical evidence on that okay and then in general are we making proper inference from lab and naturally occurring data and that's exactly what Levitt and I talked about in our recent Journal of economic perspectives paper okay so let's talk a little bit about inference and a useful place to start is probably right at the right at the center of the wave of Behavioral economics and that's the endowment effect can someone tell me about these famous and dominant effect experiments mugs and candy bars Devin if you're going to be here I'm going to call you okay okay so in a series of experiments Kahneman can National ran both willingness to accept and willingness to pay treatments but they also ran trading experiments in the trading experiments at Cornell they would bring uh bring in students to sit in a classroom they would give half of them a mug they would give half of them a candy bar and they told the students if you were given a mug would you like to trade with the experimenter your mug for a candy bar if you were given a candy bar you can trade with the experimenter your candy bar for a mug what they found is that ninety percent of people who were given a mug kept the mug 90 of people who are given a candy bar kept the candy bar okay so they argued in a jpe paper in 1990 that this was strong evidence of an endowment effect or once you have the good in hand you place an attachment value on it because neoclassical Theory would say if if P percent trade the mug for the candy bar then one minus P percent should trade the candy bar for the mug right that's what neoclassical theory has a strong prediction there so let's take that to heart and go out to a naturally occurring environment where people engage in trade and that's exactly what this uh this set of studies did is that it went to several small-scale markets sports card markets pin trading markets Etc open air markets Etc and it essentially replicated the mugs and candy bar experiments now it replicated it in the sense that I have proportioned that trade here of course neoclassical theory if they're equal Goods it should be 50 and I'm binning people here really inexperienced people really experience people so it replicated it in the sense that this little bar right here about one out of ten people trade so the really inexperienced people in these marketplaces look a lot like Cornell coffee mug and candy bar Traders but as you randomly give them experience or as they gain experience endogenously the data has both Behavior approaches exactly what neoclassical Theory would predict okay roughly not quite half but nearly half of people trade they're randomly allocated good now what does this mean some people have interpreted this as saying well that shows that the lab experiments are somehow wrong I I think that's an incorrect that's too strong of an interpretation I think the way to view this is that you have results from the lab equally as valid results from the field and together these two pieces of information can lead to a much deeper understanding of human behavior and of course that's what theorists have now taken on to challenge these various theorists forachenko kazaki and Raven Chambers Etc have taken on this challenge to try to model exactly what's going on in both the lab and the field data now empirically of course it's important to First replicate my my data which thankfully these data have now been replicated several times and to go back to the lab and think about what are the factors that attenuate or exacerbate these types of effects that I'm finding and then go back to the field for more testing and naturally occurring environments that's exactly the way that I Envision science evolving to maximize exactly what we learned using Theory lab experiments in data from the naturally occurring world okay so that's something on inference now another idea we can think about is is causes so one particular vaccine problem in some walks of research is that we observe a pattern in the data but we're not exactly sure what are the underlying causes for that pattern and I think the Discrimination literature is is a good example of this so when we observe discrimination in the real world what are major models for why that discrimination is occurring I think of it as two major models one was developed by a guy at the University of Chicago in his dissertation and it was published in 1957. I had a Becker's taste for discrimination people might be discriminated against because there are bigots out there who derive utility from discriminating against them and the other major model would be what pagu called third degree price discrimination or statistical discrimination right an entrepreneur in her efforts to maximize her profits discriminates against agents right under Becker's model the entrepreneur can four goal prophets to cater her bigotry under third degree price discrimination in an effort to maximize her profits she's discriminating it's very hard to parse is you've tried it's very hard to parse these two types of discrimination in naturally occurring data I'm going to argue that with a series of field experiments in the spirit of this paper in the in the qg one can make some Headway to determine what is the major model at work it might be a little bit of each of course okay so let's talk about that discrimination experiment and this should be familiar to all of those who are familiar with the literature this is these are paired audit study field experience okay so what I have here to begin I have 12 disabled agents and these are agents in wheelchairs paired with 12 non-disabled testers who are not in wheelchairs but who are driving The Identical vehicles to various repair shops in and around Chicago now there are there are dozens of this of design decisions that you need to make when running these paired tester experiments whether they should have a script whether they should both wear red baseball caps whether they should both have hair to the shoulder Etc what I'm going to argue is unless those variables importantly interact with my two treatments here all they're affecting is the level they're not affecting the interpretation that I'm making on what's driving the discrimination but you can call me on that and please do if you don't agree with it okay so they're driving identical cars to repair shops and they're at they're telling the mechanic today I would like to get my front bumper fixed so this will not be an experiment based on the mechanic telling them there are five things wrong rather than two things wrong that's interesting too but nonetheless here we're pinpointing the front bumper needs to be fixed okay are there any questions about the general design I know I've been very vague yes this is kind of tricky because my testers know that it's an experiment and the mechanics don't uh yes uh Loosely I've called this somewhere in the area of a framed field experiment just because my testers do know but they are acting in a natural environment okay it wouldn't be artifactual and natural it would be framed or natural right so I'll just I'll just take the bad one or quote bad one if you want to call it that okay any other questions on this okay what do you think happens Joe what do you think do better yeah you could see a model like that actually to disabled actually received they do do better they receive much higher offers but I could certainly see that the the sympathy argument but in our data the disabled receive roughly 30 higher offers in the repair Market okay but again you're left in the world of what does this mean right so we can start begin let's begin to Chisel away at this because my intuition is with yours I could have easily seen it go the other way um so let's think about running a survey which we did yes go ahead yeah let's uh let's hold that and see if we can take it out with uh with the next treatment but I certainly agree that whenever running these audit studies given that the audit pair knows they might give the experimenter exactly what they think the experimenter wants to see or what they want to signal to the experimenter I'm I'm perfectly sympathetic to that and I think it does happen in a lot of cases let's see if we if we can take that on maybe it does interact with treatment yes yeah what we what we end up doing is we choose the lowest offering body shop and we give them 350 dollars then to go and get their car fixed with that body should that's to avoid deception um otherwise it's just deceiving people so that's that's was the incentive yes exactly so so the mechanic might perceive these two types to have different willingness to pay distributions so I'm with you there but I immediately went to the willingness to pay distributions were different based on search costs so so then that's where the surveys went we surveyed disabled and what you find is that they do search less you survey mechanics and they also believe that the disabled search less so that's some evidence that this is statistical discrimination based on differences in willings to pay distributions yes exactly so that it goes the other way I think here this is I'm just trying to show you that if you pair two field experiments you can disentangle these I've not written down a taste-based model but you can see how it could work but my initial intuition's in the other direction as well yes they were actually in wheelchairs it certainly might be and I don't have data on that I do have data on sexual orientation where people are fainting that and there's a difference in data there okay now just looking at the survey evidence of course that's not strong so what we need to do is think about new treatments that can potentially provide more insights into what's going on okay so first of all what we want to do is get a new tester type set send those people out and see if we can replicate our results because it was a small sample and then we want to send out the pairs running another treatment where both agent types simply say I'm getting a few price quotes that's the only thing that's changed is both disabled and non-disabled make the statement I'm getting a few price quotes okay so when the replication treatment we get exactly the same result albeit it's smaller now it's only 20 percent difference between the disabled and non-disabled what do you think happens on the next click okay by that by that one statement what happens is the disabled and non-disabled now you do see the disabled having a slightly smaller um off but of course these these two aren't these two aren't different but nonetheless it's slightly smaller now you can see that there's no difference between the price quotes across disabled non-disabled I think that gives you some evidence that what was going on is it was statistical discrimination based on a heterogeneous search cost or heterogeneous search Behavior again we don't have it sealed tight you need to have a Ken with just two treatments and and not a not a good theory these are still pilot experiments but nonetheless you can see the power of pairing two field treatments together and one being driven based on a theory that would subscribe here's how behavior um should actually change going from treatment one to treatment two okay so you can think of a lot better examples on black white in in cars and across different cities that were going there but but we have not gotten there yet I think I think I hope what this illustrates is the power of pairing different field experimental treatments and the power of parsing the different theories that might be described in the behavior the motivations that might be underlying the behaviors yes it was set in the design I told the story okay any other questions on this okay let's move on there's a lot a lot to cover okay let's get back to the basics I want to give you something that you can go home with and this is my idea that if you're going out to run an experiment tomorrow what mistakes would I want you to avoid if you're designing your experiment okay and these are common mistakes that I observe every day when I review papers or read colleagues papers I'm going to break this down into four four different types and and Michael will be talking about intra cluster correlation coefficients a little bit so if I don't get to that that will be in my slides and you can have you can have my slides of course okay I'm going to start by saying this idea of a zero one treatment you either get the pill or you don't and we have equal outcome variances this would be the standard neoclassical t-test type of idea uh letter B will be again zero one treatment but now we have unequal outcome variances the variance of the treatment might be double the variance of the control what if I suspect that what should I do in my design that's what the that's what this will answer letter C treatment intensity we're no longer in uh realm of pill or no pill we're in the realm of should we have the incentive set at one three five seven or nine and exactly how should we design our experiment if we're allowed to pick over this range you know it's interesting and interesting uh set of rules of thumb in that case and then inter-cluster correlation coefficients are just a way to tax yourself so the idea is if randomization occurs at the Village level but the outcomes are at the individual level and if there's correlation across individuals we need to essentially tax ourselves and get get a larger sample because of the correlation of behaviors within the within each Village and I'll have an example here that will show you the the very large tax that you might have to impose on yourself the idea is why not impose it on yourself before you run the experiment rather than afterwards when you have to address the issue of independence of observations so it's just trying to get your sample to be optimal at the very beginning okay so I don't want to get caught up in this but let's let's start with letter A and make some standard assumptions here assume that the outcome of the control is distributed normally with mean mu naught Sigma squared variance X1 the same for the control group I'm going to define a minimum detectable effect of Delta and that's going to be important okay we have our null and alternative now we're going to Define two things a significance level of course probability of type 1 error Alpha and this is a standard equation that we're all familiar with equation two is a power equation this is something that will likely be new for most of you if you have not designed experiments this is of course just one minus the probability of type 2 error and that equals this these look very familiar and you should know know why okay I want to talk a little bit about power before solving these two equations so let's think about the standard case the standard cases we have the null distribution here we have the alternative distribution here and Alpha as we know that that's our typical definition of alpha Now Beta of course is the area of the alternative that will overlap with the area of the null when basically we're not rejecting the null when really we should be type 2 error so in essence what you have to set is you have to set Alpha and beta and you have to have a minimum detectable effect before you go out and run your experiments okay now power here of course is the area to the right of beta under the alternative distribution that's what we call power of the test okay now power is interesting because I think most of our intuition stems from this typical regression model where we think about it under a true null what is a probability of of observing the coefficient that we observed that's usually where all of our intuition comes from but now power is a little bit different it's exploring if the alternative hypothesis is true then what is the probability that the estimated coefficient lies outside the 95 confidence interval defined under this you should say no defined under the null that's exactly what we're talking about with power okay now if you solve those two equations and let's assume variances are equal like like I mentioned you get this simple equation and this tells you exactly what your sample sizes should be right we have we have the typical critical values here this is a minimum detectable effect Delta and that's the standard deviation that gives us some insights about how the necessary sample size changes with these variables for example it increases rapidly with the desired significance level and Power that's intuitive and I'll show you some rules of thumb on that in a minute it increases proportionally with the variance of the outcomes higher variance optimal sample size necessary sample size increases proportionally decreases inversely proportionally with the square of the minimum detectable effect size okay now you can see that the sample size depends on the ratio so so many times when I'm talking about sample size people always ask I'm running an experiment how many observations should I should I get this tells you that if you want to detect a one standard deviation change this will tell you if you want to detect a half a standard deviation change this will tell you a tenth of a standard deviation change I'll give this all this stuff on the next few slides okay so let's start with that now I'm not going to take a stand on why convention is this way but the convention in the literature is to set Alpha equal to 0.05 and power equal to 0.8 and we all know what that means and we all know that there will be trade-offs okay so as I mentioned if you want to detect a one standard deviation change now we have the answer you need 15.68 observations in treatment 15.68 observations in control that will give you an 80 power and a significance level 0.05 so if you just want to detect very large changes you don't need large sample sizes okay likewise half a standard deviation well now I know you're getting the idea now that it's 15.68 times standardized effect right so 15.68 in this case times 4 because it's 2 over 1 squared and now I know if I want to detect a half of a standard deviation change I need 64 observations per cell there seems to be a magic number in our literature where people go out and and get 30. I'm not quite certain where magic 30 comes from but 8 out of 10 experiments that you um you read about in using mostly lab data is the magic number is 30. well yeah not not perfectly generalized over to what we're talking about right foreign what Derek thinks about macro and we've learned what he thinks about lab experiments [Laughter] okay what is a magic Theory well it's it's 0.7 standard deviation change that's what you can detect with 80 power that's what magic 30 is nothing magical about that okay and it comes simply from that that equation now here are some rules of thumb that give you an idea of how the necessary sample size sizes change when you change type 1 and type 2 error what I'm doing here is I'm simply changing the power from 80 to 95 percent and I'm leaving the significance level the same necessary sample size goes up by 65 percent leave the power the same go to go to a significance level 0.01 now necessary sample size goes up by 49 from the Baseline do them both 2.27 times n 127 increase in necessary sample size yes yeah I mean I mean it's it's clear what you're doing and you're if the alternative is true you're not rejecting it 20 of the time and if you want to have more power if you want to want to not reject it 10 of the time then you need a power of 0.9 now why this is develop I I can't determine why it's developed to be point a divided yes not all let me say a caveat yes unless costs are not prohibitive what I what I haven't mentioned here is the cost of obtaining each observation I'm assuming the cost and treatment and control are identical in in let's say reasonable enough to where we at we want to get a sample size that's necessary but we have to consider costs so I will I will bring in cost too but my first intuition is to go to point a yes see what I do a lot on that is I I will block on those observables and then that's a way to reduce residual variants which is similar to afterwards than running it through regression I'm blocking on those up front many environment yeah so let's talk that's a good segue to to having unequal variances and then I'll give an idea about how I how I get some intuition about the variances which my answer is basically to run pilot experiments but there's a cost right each pilot I run that that's fewer data points for the real experiment but remember I'm I'm always a I'm always still about how many standard deviation changes do I want to detect so in that world it's if I wanted to detect a tenth of a standard deviation change I know I need 1568 observations regardless of how big the variance is now that that might beg the question of well well look if the variance is really small and you detect one tenth of it it's not very interesting so that that's right but so what I typically look at older literature or run my own Pilots That's how I get an idea of what the variances are going to look like yes foreign that depends on the situation and uh in the previous literature what they have found so if I'm in the area of Education I think a tenth of a standard deviation is a pretty big is a pretty reasonable change to try to detect if I'm doing gift exchange in the field it might be like a half of a standard deviation because that's where the literature seems to be so a lot of it's driven on on the previous literature that's sort of something you know when you see it but it's it's hard to generalize across situations because many of the situations are very different when you're doing pricing experiments um it's same sort of thing we have a feel for what an elasticity should look like and what a big effect would be okay now when you talk about unequal variances a very simple rule falls out of this and the very simple rule is that the ratio of the optimal proportions of the total sample and control and treatment is equal to the ratio of the standard deviations so if the treatment has double the standard deviation then of course we need to adjust the samples the optimal proportions equivalently now with equal variances that's why everything was equal in treatment and control and here we just adjust them based on the variances that's a very simple rule of thumb in many studies you see that the treatment and control will always have the same number of observations that might be that we just don't know that we didn't know that the variances were were unequal a lot of times Theory will give us some indication that the variances will be different and what I'm arguing here is just take account of that because you'll increase your power if you shift the sample accordingly okay so what about treatment levels I hear what I'm thinking about is let's say we're interested in the number of ads various price levels various incentive levels and let's stick with homogeneous treatment effects so that the outcome variance is equal and let's think about in this particular example how we want to allocate our sample so let's say that The Firm tells you you can allocate the sample across incentive levels one three five seven and nine and let's say that the firm tells you that you can have a thousand subjects how do you want to allocate those subjects across the five cells go ahead okay so you're thinking say 20 let's say 40 here 40 here and the rest in the middle let's say that I assume it's linear the relationship is linear the outcomes relationship is linear over the incentive space that's what the pointerest thing 99 of people will say what equal 99 of papers will say equal none of you wanted to say it right why don't you want to say it because I wouldn't be asking the question that'd be too obvious all right but all of your intuitions are correct and that's let's back up and and consider exactly what we're doing here we're still we can rest on the regression model and we can think about one of our goals here is to derive a very precise estimate of beta so let's consider then what is the formula for the standard error of beta what's important here is that I can gain precision with increasing the variance in my treatment variable in the same manner that I can increase Precision by increasing n doubling n is the same thing as doubling the variance in x that's what the that's what the standard error formula tells us so if I'm making a stand I have a strong prior that this relationship is linear what should I do with my thousand this isn't hardly ever done even if people make a strong stand on being linear and even if they estimate a linear model they will still have representation in the different cells and most of the time it will be a fifth to fifth the fifth or fifth or fifth but certainly you should put half on one end and half on the other end I was just saying that you just get one to nine and that's my that's my group but yeah you have this Baseline which is everyone else in the world but they haven't selected in so I still have a selection problem on those those folks but you can still say well wait a second I want some I want to at least test whether it's non-linear if not for the economics of the problem just to keep the referees off my back what should you do then now it gets a little dice here use your same intuition but then add that you want to test linearity versus quadratic put everyone at five but some at five what do you want let's just I'm just saying quadratic and we'll go to cubic and cortic but this will give you the general idea and we're thinking it's in the middle of the incentive Zone okay there's a rule quarter half quarter okay intuitively this gives us a test for the quadratic you're comparing the mean what the mean out comes at the extreme and it gives us our variance as well yes Justin sure yeah I have variance in an end right ah okay okay do I have a do I have a typo so then I understand in my case right right the case is even stronger but I have this right though standard error right thanks no in cubic how many cells do you think you should have for cubic if linear two quadratic three cubic four that's just a general rule and and you can you can find this in any any design booklet as well but the general idea is if you're at the same time you're testing the the turns you're also you're also taking into account variants okay so this is just a quick rule of thumb on intensities that you can keep in the back of your mind so let's end here I'm going to have a little bit of time about intra cluster correlations and here what I want to mention is that this arises I would I would guess in in a lot of development developing work and it's it arises in a lot of work in firms and also in the lab when you have sessions so the idea is is when the level of randomization is different than the level that you're observing the outcomes at you have to account for that difference via something called an intra cluster correlation coefficient and you should account for this of course before you go out and run the experiment now let's go through an explicit example that hits home for me we convinced United Airlines to run some incentive experiments and in those incentive experiments they insisted that randomization occur at the city level okay they allowed us four cities to run the experiment in with each City receiving let's just say forsake either high or low incentive but we're gonna we're gonna disregard the zero case thus we're interested in the outcome how many tickets are purchased by our various individuals in our experiment and we're interested in how these high and low incentives affect those tickets purchased and just for simplicity's sake let's say each City we run the incentive experiment on an equal number of consumers but the response of of consumers might be correlated within the city this is the inter-cluster correlation coefficient idea okay so what I'm going to introduce here is the real sample size so when you have inter-cluster correlation coefficients that matter or that are non-zero you have to in effect penalize yourself by what I'm calling CE or the cluster effect okay so MK that's our typical number of observations that we think about in experiments m is number of subjects in a cluster case number of clusters this correction effect will be 1 plus rho multiplied by m minus 1 where rho is your intracluster correlation coefficient okay and that's the variance between clusters divided by the sum of the variance between and within clusters that's a definition of an inter-cluster correlation coefficient so essentially I need to think about how many clusters do I have how many people do I have in each cluster and what is the inter-cluster correlation coefficient equal to and that will dictate how many observations I need in this particular setting okay so let's just think intuitively what does row going to zero mean well that means there's no correlation so we don't need to adjust optimal sample sizes we're back to our model that I presented earlier essentially 15.68 times uh standard standard deviation divided by the minimal detectable effect squared okay we're back to that model when rho is zero on the other hand when row goes to 1 now all responses in the cluster are identical but there's a big tax now right this is a very large adjustment because the real sample size is reduced to the number of clusters of course in practice now this is a hard coefficient to obtain in many settings in practice it will be somewhere between zero and one but closer to zero than one of course so in our particular experiment doing some pilot testing we find that rho equals 0.04 . so it must be the case that I'm not going to have to penalize Myself by much right because the row is so small what do you think the part of the equation that I'm leaving out is Justin would say I'm understating now which you'll see why let's say they wish to detect a 1 10 standard deviation change and we want to use a standard approach so I know right away that under the under the old approach a 110 standard deviation would suggest that I need 1568 at each level okay so in total I have 3136 divided by 4 and that's what each City gets that's under the old approach under the new approach we have to think about what the real sample size is now in this case I can run it through that simple formula and I see I have 784 of course that's um this number divided by four times four and then the the adjuster I find that the real sample size in this case is 97. that's how big of a tax that a row of 0.04 How could a rose 0.04 have such a large tax because the number of clusters is only four right that that hurts now if you run run this all the way through we think about what is the required sample size put it in the necessary sample size equation in what we end up with is before of course we had that now we have 15.68 times 3232. with 32 times the sample that we needed before or 50 over 50 000 at each incentive level yes number of clusters is given exactly that's a different kind of problem but if if United tells me you can only have four cities then I take it and I proceed like this the other way is I can determine the optimal number of clusters and the number within that and it's the same it's the same sort of equation that's right that's a richer problem and one that you can easily do with these equations what's the trade-off between the number of clusters and the number within each cluster on a on a given row and the cost per observation too yeah all these with all this now you can do that yeah that there that that there are Peery facts that you these are things that you can estimate but the randomization occurs at the at the student level then I can explore if I treated him but not his three friends versus if I treated him and his three friends what are the differences in outcome variables that seems to me like an empirical question after you set up the design and your design might want to test for these pure effects that there are spillovers so to speak that's right right but the treatment variable there is the number of kids in the classroom and then they used probably did they use the classroom as the observation or did they use the kids in the classroom is the observation it probably varies depending on study exactly that's causing that 0.04 and then we can explore what that is yeah yes I think it I think it is that way what are the the potential costs when you do it at the individual level it's easier to do it at the city level and you there might be some contamination this is what you're kind of talking about earlier was a contamination I don't think of it as contamination I think of that as kind of a rich empirical question but but yeah that's that's one of the trade-offs uh if you had to make the decision in the end about cluster or individual there might be good reason why you wanted want to do it at the Village level a lot of good reasons instead of at the individual level yeah and this tax will be one of the variables that that helps you determine that yes you know it's the same thing and I just wrote that I'm glad you asked that because I was thinking about that this morning when I was watching Mark Burley of the White Sox pitch a perfect game um and here's exactly what I wrote down the ratio of sample sizes is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative cost so it has the same sort of flavor as the the variance does okay so let me read that again ratio of sample sizes is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative cost now that was something that I was doing this morning you can check me on that but I believe that's correct I'm confident that that's correct ratio of sample sizes is an inversely proportional the square root of the relative cost but that's that's a consideration that that I haven't had in here yet um and in some sense you might be thinking wow there are a lot of things now that are going on because I have to consider cost I have to consider what level to randomize I have to consider Rose hard to Rose hard to detail too like what are some rows in your world a lot of times in education I think about .05 or less or 0.1 are you getting higher rows than that yeah if it's school well I think classroom yeah yeah that's what I was thinking then okay okay if you can do multiple classrooms within a score exactly but then you get into this issue of one kid that's what we have at Chicago Heights which I'll talk about this afternoon where we're randomizing at the individual level and then one kid has it and the kid next next to her and class does not have it it presents some good things and some bad things you can see the good things um but of course you can think about the bad things too you want to add something to this okay exactly okay good so let's end by talking a little bit about block design and factorial design and fractional factorial design so what I have here is a depiction of a fractional factorial design wherein I'm thinking that there are three experimental variables and if we want to talk about United or Walmart we can think about price being one we can think about number of ads being one and we can think about rebates being a third variable and as I as I have on this on this figure you know let's start over here and move this way this way or this way I only have two levels of each particular variable so each variable can either be low or high and what one approach could be in this case is to run a full factorial experiment what does that mean when I have three experimental variables that can either be low or high how many how many cells would I need I need eight right two to the third and all you need to do is count these that's that's if you I'm not sure why anyone would do this but sometimes people do this a lot of times people do a full factorial design right you want to get every interaction when two or two are turned on one's turned off etc etc what would be a more efficient type of design that also maintains balance and I've given you a hint up here turn them all on or turn one on at a time that would be what would be considered a balanced optimal fractional factorial design I'm not going to get into to why that's the case we can talk about it afterwards since we're running out of time but in that case you have why because you have each of the each of the individuals and you also have all three turned on you do miss something here don't you right you're making an assumption on some interactions you are you might be missing some important interactions but nonetheless you're running half and you're doubling your sample size if if you have a set budget or a set number of observations you can gather okay so I'll leave this as a homework exercise but let's compare this to block design okay so on fractional factorial literally think about as a student walks in I have a set number of observations that I want in each of these cells and then I just give them to people randomly as they walk in and then when these cells are filled up they're filled up that would be a factorial design a block design what I'm doing is I'm saying I want men to have an equal equal number of men in treatment equal number in control so I'm blocking on men and that guarantees that I have representation of men both the treatment and the control why is that nice well that's nice because then I can look at heterogeneous treatment effects for example afterwards and I have some some degree of power to detect whether my treatment is different across men and women in a fractional design that's not necessarily true I might not have much representation in one of the important observables so even if I do run a regression afterwards I might not have a lot of power to detect heterogeneous treatment effects I'm increasing these cells here and then I'm making assumptions on the interaction terms remember I have the I have the three though I have all of them turned on one by one and then I have all three turned on price of the presence of the advertising um but then you have two variances there you're getting a noisier estimate go ahead right your example here has three different treatments in your example with the word um you know in the experimental literature people many times do take gender as having experimental variation and then they they look at that you know think of it as a sex rather than gender but it is true though that in one case you have experimental variation the other you don't so that's how in fact you should interpret the the results from them as well I think that that's the main difference but when you block on an observable characteristic whatever all you want is is some kind of representation that will satisfy a necessary power test but and in that way they're intertwined because I have I remember I still have to back off and say how many treatment cells should I actually have right in the optimal design given a fixed budget it gives you an idea if you want to type one error of 0.05 and type 2 error of 0.2 that also dictates your number of cells that you can have in an important way but it it dictates it in a lot different way than the than the blocking when you have something endogenous coming in any other questions on this yes they're just two different ways to randomize one I'm going to take a stand on blocking so I'm going to make sure that half men and half women Half Men get treatment half half men get control this design does not ensure that a factorial design does not because it's that's based the randomization is based on timing or whatever or coin flipping I can block I can block within a factorial design yeah I can certainly block within that exactly them a black man group s exactly that's kind of where we've gone I agree yeah I agree okay so I have three minutes I'm going to briefly introduce what I'm going to be talking about this afternoon hopefully to get you back um I will start with one type of frame field experiment which will be the Chicago Heights classroom performance experiments that we've Run for the last year and essentially what these are are a few different incentive schemes to try to enhance a performance of students at Chicago Heights High School okay B will be what I denote is an artifactual field experiment and that will be hopefully complementary to what Michael talks about in that we go to a developing country but run an experiment in a different way than the way Michael usually thinks about running experiments in developing countries literally going into a village and having them play games lab games essentially is what this will be about okay and see will be composed of natural field experiments which a large part of it will be on the economics of charity so these will be with non-profit firms and the idea we'll be trying to maximize the level of contributions to the charity or try to maximize the level of total contributions that people are making and then we will also touch on experiments in various firms United Airlines Chrysler Zappos shoes and few other firms I'll talk briefly about some experiments within those firms and what we've learned so far in running natural field experiments for them and hopefully they've gotten something from us in many cases they've made a little bit of money so that's where this afternoon will be going I will be talking primarily about examples in the field experimental literature so I want to use this morning for let's think about what a field experiment is let's think about why they're useful and let's think about if I wanted to run a field experiment tomorrow what are some of the design considerations we've only scraped the design considerations I mean I I'm thinking very hard recently about Bayesian sampling I think that I see that as the future of experimentation within economics because it's just so much more efficient but I just don't know enough about it yet to to talk to talk with you in a reasonable manner but I think I think that's where this area is going and I think it's going there for um in some sense a good reason there will also be clear I mean classical will remain but I see the future is is moving into that area for optimal design okay and I said well there is no error in the equation and it's true there is no error in the equation but the sentence above it there's an error so you like to be internally consistent in your slides this is a variance right this isn't a standard error that's why I kept looking at that saying no I'm saying variance divided by n times variance of X that's okay but what Justin was saying is you're you're better off but because he was thinking that I had the right standard error that's not the standard error that's a variance so um that's why what I was looking at I was like what is he talking about I didn't really understand but I didn't put it together with the sentence the sentence above is wrong that the equation's right fair enough fair enough okay I wanted to come back to that that um the trade-off is still end in variants of X but you certainly if you do the trade-off with and standard deviation then you have exactly what Justin was saying okay good so let's go on to something more fun and that's actually talking about the applications of field experiments and there's a little variety here and what I mean by variety is I've tried to pick out three particular types of field experiments to maintain consistency with the idea of having an artifactual field experiment example a framed field experimental example in a natural field experimental example but to be honest they're at very different stages and um and how confident I can talk about the results okay the first framed field experiment I'll talk about is classroom performance we're still literally getting data from this as you'll find so it's very preliminary but we can talk about what the data are saying so far the artifactual field experiment has been around for a little while I'm now revising it to go into a journal so this idea has been around but exactly what we learned from it is still up for debate so I wanted to throw that out to you and we can argue about exactly if we've learned anything from that artifactual field experiment and and it's nice in the sense that I'm not obtaining identification off of randomization in my artifactual field experiment okay and then the natural field experiment I'll start with a discussion about the economics of Charity and give you four or five different papers and and just a line of research that I've been thinking about since 1998 and then after that we will talk about experiments within firms for for-profit firms as I promised okay so let's start with this framed field experiment using incentives to improve educational achievement this experiment actually started last September September of 2008 and people in Chicago Heights Chicago Heights is a community it's a suburb just south of Chicago so it's very close to where I actually live I live in Flossmoor Illinois Chicago Heights borders Flossmoor and in fact the police officers speculated that the people who robbed my home on July 4th were probably from Chicago Heights so as we'll find this is um this is a community that needs help giving back to the community literally giving back and at the end we'll see that um I just secured 11 million dollars to give even more back to Chicago Heights why not keep giving right laptop here laptop there what the heck okay now in this particular experiment what we're going to be doing is comparing long-term incentives to Short Run incentives and I'll explain that in a minute and we're going to cross those with who actually receives the pecuniary reward it will either be given to the child or the parent okay and we have certain theoretical predictions of if just from a simple household bargaining model which I won't go through today but we're testing some of those implications and we also think that we can speak to policy makers through this particular frame field experiment as well okay in the end what we're looking at is some cost-effective ways to improve student performance okay so a little bit about Chicago Heights there's a lot of immigration from the Chicago housing projects okay middle class families are tending to leave Chicago Heights percentage of low-income students in the public high schools has increased from about 39 and a half to 68.7 in the decade from 99 to 2008. they're very low achievement so the two high schools that we're working with they roughly have a thousand kids enter ninth grade every year and about 470 of those kids end up receiving High School diplomas the rest drop out and they typically drop out right around the ninth between 9th and 10th grades okay so it's a it's a serious problem that they wanted us to attack at the ninth grade level okay this whole ideal is under this Chicago Heights promise I was approached about two years ago with you know basically asking me do you have ideas to help Chicago Heights and it was based on trying to improve High School graduation which we're talking about here trying to bring families back and trying to stimulate economic and Community Development I won't talk about two and three those are other types of experiments that we're running I'll just talk about bullet point one right now okay so what are our treatments in this particular case the treatments again are whether the student receives their financial reward or whether the parent receives a reward and we're going to cross that with whether it's a piece rate or a lottery okay now the piece rate provided that you satisfy four outcome variables which I'll Define in a minute at the end of every month we will give you fifty dollars in cash that's a piece right the lottery is provided you qualify you have a chance we will pull out 10 names and it's roughly one in ten one in ten chance to receive 500 in cash okay your name can be pulled out and we will announce your name and then you will get the money or not depend on whether you've qualified so we know those people who whose names were pulled out at the end of September and who received the money and who also did not receive the money okay all the names are put into a fishbowl all the names in that particular treatment and I'll give you the the numbers in the treatment cells in a minute and we will pull out one in ten ten percent of the names and if you qualify you get a check for 500 if you don't qualify you get nothing but you know that your name was called and if it's in the parent treatment your parent knows that your name was called and now she does not receive the five hundred dollars now I'm very careful in saying she because a lot of these kids have a one-parent family it's the mom not all a lot okay so what are our outcomes on the grade Dimension you cannot have any D's or E's that's not a misprint in in this school district and E is an F okay in any class at the end of the month that's outcome one Behavior no all-day suspensions in school or out of school attendance no more than one unexcused absence okay standardized test performance meet grade level reading score or improve on your fall test score we don't have a lot of these observations as you can see because we're only observing this in February and May yes this was all based on how many people we thought would qual we had four hundred thousand dollars for this study how many people we thought would qualify which how many people would you guess would qualify per month you're going to be shocked if it's roughly 30 percent to start after a month 30. um we overestimated that and and then we we put that with these and then we wanted these to be equal and that's how we we simply did that I have no general theory about whether 75 is a lot better than 50. but of course I'm going to have a baseline so I'm going to have 0 50 and then this Lottery okay now remember we only have two schools so we can't randomize across schools what do you think we should do we're going to randomize at the individual level and then we know which school they're from now that presents some issues that we talked about earlier but that's the world that we're in here okay so randomizing at the individual level here are the numbers for student rewards so remember that student receiving the cash piece rate we start with a 187 in the end there ended up being 193 because some kids moved in some kids move out some kids move in 193 in the lottery the student Lottery 199 total parents remember this is if your child qualifies then at the end of the month you are given fifty dollars in this case here if your child's name is drawn you receive five hundred dollars and then we have a baseline of 188. yes so so the teachers don't know but I'm I'm not I wouldn't be surprised if they found out yeah and we have data before the program and it looks to us so far that the control is a lot like the data were before but it could just be that our kids were worse this year and then they opt them to look like before I'm not sure but that's that's our check from the pre-experiment okay okay so let's start by looking at the data September this is a month go ahead go ahead if I lakh one one five I haven't heard anything like that but I did hear one anecdotal story that a parent was calling a teacher that they presumed would otherwise not call I don't doubt that there are other stories like that too I don't doubt that I don't doubt that I don't doubt that um so then you're going to be even shocked more because our results will be really tiny Justin Bieber no this is full factorial design why because I don't have levels of the of the payment I I just took the stand that it's going to be 50. yeah I think that I thought that could be important interaction effects between parent and Lottery and that's what our Theory says too and that's predictions on that yes yeah I mean that's a that's the thing when you do this you have spillovers but I looked at it as we have we have a survey at the beginning where we get an idea of their friend base whether they're in a gang etc etc in a treatment like this then will help us to answer those types of questions but it will lead it could potentially lead to when you say spillovers you must be in your counterfactual is randomizing at the school level and changing the ethos of the school so I'm not going to claim that this particular intervention would be a good model for that it might be it might not be but what this will be able to answer are certain theoretical questions about when you put some people in treatment and some of their friends not what can you expect for a specific treatment effect and in testing some household Theory and social interconnectedness theory there but I'm perfectly willing to to say that I'm not going to now take these results and then go to the government and say we should be randomizing that the school level based on these results because I'm just not that's that's a compromise yeah that's right okay so let's look at the a little bit of the data this is proportion of students meeting these are just grade standards so after a month you can already see only about 35 to 45 percent of these students are qualifying on grades is after just a month okay and what I have here this is a control and as you can see right around here we're thinking we're in pretty good business and we're not sure exactly what happened at the end here but for some reason at the end the control between April and May went from 26 to about 27 and a half or 28 percent Betsy that was the point of the answering before I'm not sure but when you look at previous data from previous years freshmen who are not treated it looks a lot like these trajectories that I'll show you but again that's that's not solid evidence that there's not something else going on here no doubt I mean the the literature will stay both ways right John Henry effect I'm going to work even harder further forget this effect I'm just going to quit so it looks about like the control in the previous year's data exactly I mean you get more chances if you have more chances to fail in a given month that should make sense now what happens here then on the student Lottery as you can see that dipped up as well parent peace rate parent Lottery and as you can see here this is student piece so there's there's I'd say there that there's some evidence of a treatment effect here not strong but some evidence let's say let's look at meeting all the standards now and as you can see same thing most of this most of the time when you don't meet all the standards it's because of grades that's the typical Mark now you see the same thing this during this time period you can guess that we're thinking this program is having a big a big effect and then again we're not clear what what happened here but the control just has a huge jump at the end okay so I'm you got to decide whether you want to talk about you want to integrate these or you want to look at the final final points of course we can do both now that's the end of the school years right yeah so we're still not sure so I can't comment on on exactly what happened at the school so I will have measures for you of how many people in treatment and control went on to 10th grade or are scheduled to go to 10th grade we're not sure if they're going to show up exactly we need to find out the story about about this and I don't have the story right now but I think there will be either it's uh an air or there's something else going on that I was not aware of in the school okay the problem is it's hard to get administrators attention after this I'm not quite certain why okay so here what all I've done here is meet all standards and I've put the treatment group I've pulled that and I've pulled I just placed a control group on it and and you can see why we have some enthusiasm about about this particular result that there should looks like there could be something going on okay so what I've done here is I've summarized looking at the absent standard this is a control dark is always controlled light is the treatment pooled now suspension grades all standards and currently passing to the ninth grade currently passing the ninth grade going to the 10th grade okay so if we summarize these things what we find is that we're spending about a hundred and sixty dollars per student on 700 students to get about a five to seven percent boost in ninth grade passing rates so this equates to about 35 to 50 extra passing students because of our treatment okay or between 2300 to 3 300 per past student to put that into perspective about Chicago Heights they're spending seventy seven hundred dollars per student 13 000 operational okay or 13 000 per past two and that's not exactly a fair comparison because we're on we're on a nice margin and they might not be but nonetheless this this puts into perspective I think exactly what our program's trying to do and gives you one metric of of its success we have other metrics like did you get thrown in jail um did you quit a gang et cetera et cetera we don't have any of those um coded and ready to talk about Frank overall this I would I would rate this as a modest success yes that's exactly right what I call a peer cheerleading effect and that's exactly right we're doing that the second year now um we did not do that here what I would say here is this is a cheerleading slash incentive effect and we just didn't have the sample size to parse out the cheerleading effect now we will in the second round but but you're exactly right I think that's an interesting quit that has not worked in the past in other areas but I think it's it's worth looking at now that we see this that's a could be a very cost effective way to index yeah I'm worried less about that because as I'll show you will also have standardized tests and we'll have a result on standardized tests too I'd be more worried about that this is just a cheerleading effect somebody cares about what you're doing and you've responded that way and the money just is a nice ad I don't think that's true I think cheerleading will do poorly and the money is a big reason for this particular Community but I I can't I can't speak um too swiftly about that right now yes no so now we will follow these people through and look exactly at how this this notion affects going through and we will start to treat other other students as well look it might be the case that we've just prolonged the inevitable and we've kept a bad person in the classroom causing trouble who should have never been in the classroom but we've gotten them to 10th grade but then after the money's gone they're gone by Thanksgiving that could be true we'll find out yeah and that's one reason why we want to let them go now yes so the one that's significant is is this point is significant at about the seven percent level these were all significant at better than the five percent level okay yes they're paid at the end of each month we have a meeting and in the lottery the names are picked and they run up and jump around and and get their cash yeah and also the composition of failure so is it true maybe in the treatment you're only failing one more in the others you're you're failing two three or four um none of that data work has been done or if your name's called and you didn't qualify then are you a star student afterwards which is I kind of did the teaser at the beginning I don't know that result exactly exactly it just prolongs it and then maybe there's some value in keeping them afloat right even though they failed in the end there's still value there yeah yes yeah yeah so so you can do it in your head right now right I told you a half standard deviation is 64. right so you and then I gave you a tenth is 1568. so you can see that we still need pretty large effects okay I mean not not lab large but large enough yeah okay so how did we tie in one-time incentives we also went into the East Coast so we have access now okay through all the K through eights and the two high schools we have access to run experiments in we ran some incentivized experiments just on standardized tests for the 8th and the 10th graders we don't we didn't want to go in mess around with the ninth graders because they're incented in the long run in our long run program but what we did with these groups is we simply walked in the morning of the test and if you were in the one dollar group you were told if you improve on your score from last fall or if you're over the standard you will receive a dollar we have the same statement for 10 and the same statement for 20 and we also have a control which is don't even enter at all go ahead no if we had to get active consent I think it would have been very hard to do this so we give a consent form that says if you want to opt out sign this form and send it back in and then your son and or daughter will be opted out of the experiment so we use an opt-out consent form and I I think this sort of thing should fall under a different type of of review than giving somebody drugs or something like that I just these types of experiments seem to me to be relatively innocuous but nonetheless we had a reverse consent form that we ran through the IRB and that's what they did okay what do you think happens here when I go from zero to one and one to ten ten to twenty just announcing it in the morning so they could have partied all night not knowing that the incentive was coming in the morning what do you think happens can I get the same oomph just from this is what I'm paying all that other money for if I'm just interested in standardized tests do you think so let's see okay let's start over here this is a Baseline and this is improvements in standard deviations test scores between fall and spring Baseline you can see they improved roughly 0.28 standard deviations over that time period if we give them a dollar for the 10th grade reading incentive um it only happened with 10th graders though it did not happen with 8th graders as you can see but give them a buck and the school administrators were really happy we did that right why were they happy because they get in trouble when they have I'm speaking facetiously of course they get in trouble when their kids do poorly on the standardized exams so they weren't too happy with us giving a dollar and as you can see the average went down 0.4 standard deviations ten dollars in that case was flat twenty looked pretty good now in the eighth grade you can see here does not look so good for math for some reason the 10 is higher here everything goes up and what I put in over here is the treatment and control for the ninth grade that's that's our our long-term project so now you can put these dollar values 10th grade reading scores from 0 to 20. it's fifty nine dollars per standard deviation Improvement if you're just about standardized test scores then it's this tells you something clear because at 59 is a lot cheaper than 253 dollars which is the regular Chicago Heights Miracle program right and here of course we don't have any effect this one is about a hundred dollars per standard deviation Improvement he's just walking in the morning of the test in paying a meaningful incentive if you're into standardized test scores these data would at least suggest between what we did in the miracle program and what you can do walking in it's walk in in the morning of course you get much more bang for your buck I'm not advocating this of course I'm just saying I'm making a positive statement here not a normative one in our data this is all about effort I think it's all about effort millions of dollars are given to schools based on these tests that's why I was arguing that I'm sure the administrators didn't really like that because the money that they receive in their school district depends on how well their kids do on standardized test scores that's why they care this shows you exactly why you might not want to use such a thing unless effort yeah once this cool season except it's not meaning sort of uh some of the manufacturers increase the size of cost increase his effort any questions about this yes yeah it is huge and my initial thought is that this could happen in all of the treatments there's a there's a little not yet a stylized result in the experimental community that if you incent people at a really small rate you crowd out intrinsic motivation with the extrinsic motivation and then it deludes effort so this would be under now it could be several models these guys are telling me that the standardized test really isn't that important where before I thought it was important so I'm going to try harder but now they're telling me only a dollar I'm not going to try I mean that's one type of model um there are other models in public goods where if you think about every morning if you take a a bag of cans out to the the curb and you're receiving no Financial incentive your your neighbors might call you an environmental steward but the minute that they put a nickel a can of monetary incentives and you take the bag out I'm sure your neighbors are not calling you an environmental Steward anymore they're calling you a greedy something right so that's consistent with that but it only happens here with 10th graders not 8th graders so I if you looked at the distribution for that is it these are reasonably large samples so this isn't a small sample issue when exactly I agree that's why I didn't try to spin a story when I was asked a question I tried to give a reason why that could be the case clearly this isn't a general result in our data set okay good where are we going now I talked about the 11 million dollars that's going to be going to some Early Education interventions our thoughts right now are in the realm that if you really want to make a difference most of these 9th graders are reading at a fourth grade level or a fifth grade level it's very hard for them of course to catch up so maybe we should be focusing our attention on Pre-K programs that's exactly where the Early Education and intervention program is going in the teacher incentive program is something that we're thinking instead of incentivizing the students maybe we should be incentivizing the teachers and it's hard right because you get into these this outcome space that you might not want to be in and standardized tests are one thing and you can think about that particular outcome but the rest of them um you might have some trouble implementing it in a clean way and get clean data but that's where this particular set of framed field experiments uh the line of research is going okay well let's go down a different path and let's think about an artifactual field experiment that might complement some of the work that Michael will be talking about this afternoon and that is in this area of gender and competition which I'm not a creator of the the original creators include Yuri ganese and Aldo rustakini and Muriel neederly Lisa westerlund they're doing very interesting work that is at least suggesting that women shy away from competition okay so one stylized result from this literature has been that it appears that women tend to select into competitive environments with a smaller probability than counterpart men I'm not going to take a stand on whether that's risk aversion true competitive preferences Etc let's let's leave it here for now okay so what do I mean by that let's add some flavor and this is so this is the one of the studies from the group so I have on the y-axis the fraction of people who choose to compete okay so what does that mean they bring in a group of students and they tell them today you will be solving anagrams for five minutes and to pay you for the anagram number of anagrams that you correctly solve you can either choose a piece rate scheme which will pay you say 50 cents per anagram solved or you can choose a tournament scheme which if you solve more than the anonymous person next door you will receive a dollar fifty per annogram solved if you sell fewer you'll receive zero and what they find in these particular studies is regardless of whether it's a say a female dominated task and what I mean by female dominated task is that females tend to do better than males at solving anagrams in this case 40 percent of men choose to compete 25 percent of women choose to compete shooting basket this should say basketball roughly 52 percent of men choose to compete in a roughly 15 percent of women choose to compete this is the the result that these authors have been pushing in the literature no okay so when I read the literature I started to think about what could be causing these differences in Behavior right away you can go to risk aversion you can go to several other other potential explanations which Lisa vesterland and Muriel in part took off the table with their recent qje paper but for me I was thinking along the lines of what of sex versus gender because remember the experiments here you're looking you're looking at something that has arisen endogenously gender and then you're placing the controls around that variable that is Arisen endogenously and you're trying to interpret what the data are telling you you're not get you're not achieving identification off randomization unless you would say this is all sex right now by sex I mean what you're born with by gender I mean what you're born with plus what Society tells you you are and what Society tells you is appropriate behavior okay so I was thinking about a straw man hypothesis and just entertain me for a few moments a straw man hypothesis of the form on average in every society men are more competitively inclined than women now if I want to test that straw man hypothesis one first step would be to think about going to two distinct societies in trying to choose societies that are all the way from let's say matrilineal to patriarchal there are no matriarchal societies that I know of okay so that's exactly what this artifactual field experiment will try to do okay so where is my patriarchal society Michael can you tell me what tribe I'm dealing with here I'm just south of your your stomping ground this is Messiah the Messiah tribe okay that the red robed my side tribe are women treated very well anybody know about the Messiah in this area are women treated well they're not in fact they're treated like property in fact if you own 11 head of cattle that gives you the right to have one more wife and the long and short of it is is that this is a very male dominated Society so think about this as a cross-country regression we couldn't get shouldn't get too excited that's the way I think you should think about this particular line of research so far okay so now I want to go all the way to the other side to a matriarchal society and I'm going to go here and this isn't the the safest part of India and anyone recognize what what society would be up here that's matrilineal because it's a Cassie Society all of the wealth in the Cassie Society runs through the youngest female in the family if you send one child to school it will be the female in the family men have argued for years that they deserve equal rights in equal wealth ownership it's not quite as far as a patriarchal society but some men have felt that they need to develop groups that ensure that they have the proper rights within the society I agree with Michael that it's too hard for me to keep track of all these societies so I just choose two and then I just stick with them so we've been back now to India five or six times to try to figure out exactly what's going on in these data it's just easier for me to to try to think about what's going on in the society rather than be all around the world now I'm not I'm not an anthropologist but I'm told that these two quotes do a reasonable job in dictating exactly what's going on in these two societies my favorite is from the Cassie man we are sick of playing the roles of breeding bulls and babysitters um of course the Messiah women think they're treated like donkeys but now what in the world do you do do you go here and and solve anagrams no why because the Messiah women and the man will refuse to pick up a pencil so that's hard but what tasks can you think about using they have a very hard time thinking abstractly as well so whenever you see experiments run in these types of societies when it involves abstract thinking be very careful we ran several experiments and you can see there's just a lot of noise when you tax these types to think in an abstract way okay so what did we do you're going to think I'm crazy but it's the best idea we had we had men and women throw 10 tennis balls in a bucket and they ran through the exact same experiment it's three meters away they're told you have 10 shots 10 attempts if you choose the peace rate you are get you are given roughly 50 cents which at that time I believe was a few weeks worth of wages she's a pretty high high stakes if you chose to compete everyone you made if you made more than the anonymous partner you received a dollar fifty and we simply did the exact same type of experiment with folks in the Messiah tribe and with folks in the Cassie tribe okay okay so what I can tell you though is that the distributions are not different across men and women in either of these two societies what they're good at is this what they're not so good at is this even though when we went back the second time the Cassie were really good at this but the first time they'd so we wanted a first inclination of of like competitive tendencies what I'm saying is that when you look at the distribution of when you look at the distribution of mix in this particular game they're similar I'm not going to take a stand on what are the underlying motivations if I see let's talk about the results when you see them so it's something about Society that's giving women more ability the way you define it than in the Messiah tribe that's the whole idea isn't it I'm trying to get at this idea if it's straight biology and it's and Society cannot overcome the biological differences I'm not going to foreshadow my results but I'm testing my straw man hypothesis and it would be a cross-country regression I feel like I'm on firm ground there okay go ahead yes they're in a no they're these are done in classrooms and they're in a different classroom throwing at the same time they never learn who that Anonymous competitor was and they're all paid in private but we don't know what they do with their cash when they leave it might be the case that the Messiah women they're they're forced to give the money to the husband we don't know when they did we said we can't tell you the second round of experiments we told them explicitly the gender of their which I don't have here but when they were when they asked we did not tell them yes exactly and this might be a case of just trust that the initial results are all based on men tend to trust the experimenter more than women in the U.S and it's all about that exactly what we did here to account for that is we had them play these trust games and then we try to control for that so if you believe you're you're getting something like that it it at least the result stands even after you control for quote trust the way that we measured it in a standard trust game but short of that you're exactly right it's the same as risk aversion isn't it uh with the lottery you have a higher variance right so then we we did these little Risk games and then we try to control for that too right so we try to take on a few of the major obstacles but certainly we we have not taken them all on in this first experiment um so I I take Michael's Point earlier that this is a good way to to look at behavior in high stakes games and you can vary Stakes easily this particular result we did not vary Stakes here but in the second third rounds we did the results more or less hold up but um I think that that's a big use an important use in the end of these types of environments for artifactual field experiments that you will be able to liberally vary the stakes and then look at Stakes effects in that society and then you hope of course it doesn't interact with something in the society that would frustrate any generalizability but you don't know without a theory and more empirical work okay so what do you think happens go ahead I'm going to show you this I'm going to show you the Gimme yes in this round no in the second and third rounds we did and then we had feedback so we said you're playing against a male how many do you think you will make how many do you think he will make do it then we tell them and then we have them make the choice again to see if men and women respond differently to feedback you can see right away when you set this up that there are then a million other experiments that it leads to and that's exactly right that's in a way it's seductive yeah okay so Tanzania well that looks like America I don't know if that's good or bad Luigi but nonetheless it looks like America when you run these in the U.S this is about what you get men compete at a rate of 50 women at a rate of 25 percent okay now for those of you who have not seen this let me ask you what do you think is going to happen when I click Elizabeth you probably haven't seen that are you paying attention Okay what do you think is going to happen I like to do this because if I put it up there everyone says oh that was obvious but when I don't I usually get a room of about 50 50 split and then we can argue about what it means okay why would that worry you though because Wayne right in front of you saying I hope it looks the same no not that he would but Luigi even worse oh reverse I thought you said even worse okay good we have one on each side and that's exactly what does happen those two these two are significant different from each other these two are as well these two are this is close okay now we can let our imaginations run wild but let me just put a few controversial things up there for speculative interpretations Cassie Society May remove social barriers that prevent naturally competitive women from expressing their true personalities that's consistent with this it's also consistent that it may allow competitive women to earn greater rewards for their effort and pass on wealth to their daughters right and I'm sure you can spin on a lot of spend out a lot of stories as well but it does I think begin this discussion at least we're we're trying to think about in this sense how powerful is socialization how powerful can socialization be it at least opens up the opportunity to look at other quirky things maybe in the U.S or other areas where people are randomized again these people are not randomized into societies either so I'm putting control around the society and to refine this type of finding what we're doing is we're going to biological route now and we're going over and taking testosterone and blood to find out if the bot if the biological markers are fundamentally different and the the blood ran into problems because it a few of the Chiefs thought that we were going to take the blood and feed it to the snakes and the snakes would then come back and kill them so with that got shot down after a few Villages which are our person on the ground there promised us that these Chiefs agreed to give blood so we ended up getting a bunch of saliva which is fine for testosterone okay now I think it's fair to say that we should be thinking hard about replicating these results and we should think hard about other types of experiments that can help to refine the interpretation of these data I'm willing to go that far any questions on this is that okay now you were skeptical is that not is that an all right interpretation okay that means no I'm in trouble any other issues with this yes go ahead I agree I agree I could look at CEOs and and I think women would be very competitive CEOs and foreign I'm with you and I wish I had one more set of bars here because right next to these Cassie societies are some patriarchal Cassie societies they look like this so right next door you have this uh this large difference as well I think that's where you're going with that that's right that's our new control group now the patriarchal societies and we we haven't gone back to the Messiah tribe we've just focused on the Patriot matry Societies in India they're right next to each other and they have very little crossover very very few people will go from One Tribe to the other so then it's you were born into it right okay good that's a good question thank you natural field experiments and I think I have what 35 minutes 3 15. my identification now will all arise from randomization and I will be in the world where people do not even know that they're taking part in an experiment okay so if you want to now along the way bring up informed consent or how I'm able to do this we can we can think about these questions I'm going to start by being in the not-for-profit world give you a few giving facts and then tell you a little bit about some of the research and then I'm going to go to the for-profit world so let's go to the charitable Market this is the way I think about this particular Market I see three major players the government of course sets rules on the Charities and they set marginal tax rates and rules on how donors can write off perhaps the 10 million dollars that they give to a charity there and within the NBR itself there there's been a lot of research Marty feldstein clot felter Etc looking at that relationship when you change marginal tax rates how do people's behaviors change in terms of giving very little evidence here and what I mean by this is when the government sends a 20 million dollar Grant to the YMCA how do they react do they then go out and raise less money do they use that as a gift to raise more money and then provide more of the public good so that's an interesting question that still is not sorted out my own research I'm going to focus down here the relationship between Charities and specific donors okay so why is this important I'm looking at individuals it's roughly in any given year now charitable givings roughly two to three percent of GDP so I think it's it's a big chunk of GDP that we know very little about why people give it I think that's fair to say empirically we have a lot of anecdotes individuals take up about three quarters of that corporations foundations bequest the rest I'm not going to look at these at all I'll be focusing on individuals okay over time how has individual giving changed it's sort of interesting as you can see the pers as a percent of personal income it's kind of jogged down and then the late 90s you have a sudden jump and you can speculate why and so can I of course yes what's that a gift to a 501c that you can write off on your taxes in the giving to a charitable foundation not time monetary gift pecuniary okay so I so I sufficiently understate the importance of Charity by not including volunteerism yeah it knows we'll see that's going to be a big chunk of this I'll have that in a minute exactly that's the end that's good intuition okay so what I have here and this is from 95 so I apologize I don't have something later than that this gives you a sense of how people give over income ranges over age and over education levels okay in total percent of households that give back in 95 was about two out of three now it's close to 90 percent so more people give money now than they did back in 95 they gave about two percent of household income here a thousand dollars on average as you can see here as a percent it goes down and then back up is a total it just makes sense so if you're mostly if you are in here you should be giving if on average 95 about 3 500 a year I'm sure all of you are given much more than that I mean the reason why is because you're a college graduate or more so you're down here as well um this is a little bit funky I'm not sure exactly what's going on here we can have different stories which I don't have time to go into right now uh but this gives you a glimpse of how giving varies over the life cycle okay now where does this money go a big chunk of it's to religious organizations 59.4 percent of total household contributions goes to religious organizations that's because it's overweight it's overweight in the poor and you know education you have a little bit here nine percent and then you can see the others okay I am just now starting experiments with this group and it's only because I've given talks at these Lutheran organizations the lutherans are trying to raise money and as part of the agreement I I get access to their entire database to run experiments but as far as I know I don't know of any experiments with these religious groups okay so I can't speak to that in my own data right now yes yeah now when you say in anything back you you can't you won't be in here if you get some good in return some tangible good in return yeah so if I'm in the YMCA and I have to pay for my kid to be in basketball I do not think that would be in here but if I give a thousand dollars and I can write it off then they will be in there I will not dig deeper into this but that that's right okay so why should we study this I think theoretically thinking about why people give to Charities and what models best predict their behavior is uh is a useful Avenue for research you know measuring the key parameters of these models is also useful it various elasticities can be important from a policy perspective collecting information to construct a theory so that's where this particular research agenda is going now on a practical side I think this quote picks up exactly what's going on in this industry there's an extraordinary amount of money available the lack is of good ideas on how to get the basket Under The Apple Tree and that's exactly right so besides Theory and policy the the demand side of the economics of Charities is ill understood and I've I've learned that in the last 10 or so years about how little the fundraisers actually know um in terms of making being able to make causal statements okay so let's let's start at the beginning and why in the world am I involved in this particular activity so if you're an administrator the administrator the dean at the University of Central Florida did something that probably most administrators would never do I was an assistant professor in 1998 in the economics Department in the business school and the dean visited every department and said I realize that we cannot be good at all kinds of research activities even though you have 26 people in the econ Department I know you can't compete in i o labor environment et cetera Etc so I want you to choose one area and when you've all decided the area come back and tell me and then I will put all the resources into that area laughs that's exactly what happened so we argued and argued and argued and the area that the department chose was a specialty in environmental economics with a sub-specialty in experimental economics and that won something like 25 to 1 in our department so of course I was the advocate of environment and experiment and the dean then visit my office and said now that you have won this battle I want to give you five thousand dollars to start a center for Environmental Policy analysis congratulations on being the winner I talk about a Winner's curse I thought about it for a long period of time and thought I will do this provided I can use that five thousand dollars in a field experiment and I I think now you see the way that I roll I'm I see the world I see it as an experiment and I look at how I can use the variation that I observe and the variation that I can put into the world to learn something about economics everything that I am presented with in the back of my mind I think can I turn that into a field experiment that's how I've always been since I was an undergrad at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point okay so that's why these field experiments at sports card shows and pin markets Cassie tribe et cetera et cetera that's where these these arise he talked to the the officials and they said yes you can let list go ahead and run this as a field experiment okay so what I did then as I looked in the literature and tried to learn what are the best ways to use seed money and what I learned was that this sector was filled with anecdotal evidence people used it University of Wisconsin's call center they raised 27 million before they went public in their drive to raise a total of 72 million they raised 27 million in private fundraising schools and booklets will tell you authoritatively you should raise between 40 and 50 percent between 20 and 50 percent these are the right figures and you ask where did these figures come from what's the underlying mechanism at work show me the data in 1998 you would receive nothing it's just a gut feeling that's exactly what it was back then happened to be an interesting theory that Jim andreoni wrote about how seed money can exclude bad equilibria in these giving games when you have a threshold public good fixed cost so his idea was seed money can exclude for example the bad equilibrium of everyone giving zero and that in and of itself can lead to more money being raised that's good that's an interesting theory that we have same thing with refunds what I have in mind here is that I announce we need to raise five million dollars which this Beyond this particular study but just isn't is an example we need to raise five million dollars but if we don't raise it we will send the check back to you okay Magnolia and Lipman have a theory in 1989 in the re stud that uses the same solution concept more or less is what Jim used in his seed money paper in the qg it works the exact same way you can exclude bad equilibria by using a refund okay and there are also some examples of that in practice but what am I to do I only have one charity and I can't deceive people and tell them I received 20 seed money in one case 50 in another that's against the law in experimental economics so what am I to do Christine what do you think here's what we did we split that Capital campaign into six smaller Capital campaigns saying that we needed to raise money for computers for cipa for the center for Environmental Policy analysis and then in those six cells we ran a three by two with three seed levels 10 33 67 Crossing with a refund no refund treatment okay and what we found in that study is that seed money worked very well in fact on both the Intensive and extensive margins those improved as seed money went up I don't think this is a general result but it was a result over our range and when you look at the fact that refunds did not work well in the way that they interacted we could reject angione's theory about seed money being used as a device to exclude bad equilibria what these particular data are more in line with is that you can use seed money to Signal the quality of your charity and since these results were published there have been a few papers now developing theory on using seeds is a signal of charitable quality okay so that was paper number one now it raises the the question of given you have upfront money maybe you should use it as a match rather than just announcing that you have it okay and a lot of you probably hear this on NPR send in your hundred dollars now we will match it one to one for the next hour so your hundred dollars will look like 200 and effectively they're trying to vary the price they're cutting the price in half of giving that's the idea okay so that's exactly what Dan Rondo and I were up to when we worked with the Sierra Club and this is another male solicitation just like sipa we sent out several thousand letters to donors the Sierra Club is the same way sending out mail solicitations we have a few controls We compare seed to matching and the match rate was one to one and again what we found in that particular paper is the power of seed money seed money did very well matching did slightly worse but they were both much better than both controls okay so it gives us an idea about using upfront money now you can ask that wasn't a fair test because you're using the wrong match rate and fundraising strategists will tell you exactly what Kent Dove tells you never underestimate the power of a challenge gift obviously a one-to-one match every dollar that the donor gives is matched by another dollar is more appealing than a one to two match in a richer challenge greatly adds to the match's attractiveness this looks like the law of what in economics it's exactly what we say about private Goods isn't it if you can get one Snickers bar for a dollar that's better than one Snickers bar for two dollars but if you can get two Snickers bars for a dollar you're really doing well I mean Dove is just reminding us that the law of demand is at work here but the question is is that model is a private Goods Model A good model for charitable fundraising so go ahead out and look in this industry at the time and look at what people are doing including Drake which received 50 million dollars and the donor said you need to use this to raise more money in two to one and three to one matching solicitations but there is no empirical evidence that that is true you ask people where's the empirical evidence on simply looking at a match and a pricey fact in charitable giving this gets at how we should be modeling charitable gifts no evidence of that at all in fact the best evidence was one guy running a one-to-one match in July and then he decided to run a one-to-one match in December and I mean pardon me a two to one match in December and he found that he raised more money in December than July so he said the match matters we all know that December is the best time to raise money tax considerations end of the year cheer so Dean Carlin and I ended up writing this paper on amongst other things on looking at match rates okay so you can try to guess what this is National liberal non-profit in the U.S political and socially oriented anybody want to take a guess I Can't Tell You by the way but I'd love to tell you but I'll let one person take a guess I'll let you read the reply card first actually they send letters to regular donors what they're going to have us do is they're going to give us one run one one month to run our experiment so we can send out roughly 50 000 letters and we sent those out in August of 2005. and we got all this money from an anonymous donor so this is all legitimate what we're going to do is change the match ratio from nothing one to one two to one to three to one maximum amount available 150 25 and unstated and there will be an example a string an Ask string which I'll show you on the card of low medium or high okay so exactly how did we run this natural field experiment this is how by putting these cards these reply cards in every letter okay so here's what the card said troubled by the continued erosion of our constitutional rights a concerned member this concerned member was trying to go after one of President Bush's Supreme Court nominees a concerned member has offered a matching Grant of 2550 100 or blank to encourage you to contribute to blank at this time to avoid losing the fight to defend our blank this member has announced the following match one dollar two dollars two dollars for every dollar you give so for every this is the ask string this is highest previous contribution times one so we looked in the last several years and took out their highest previous contribution highest previous contribution times 1.25 times 1.5 you give blank will actually receive X let's not lose this match please give today yes in this drive so if you go over 25 he only gives 25 if you give 20 he should be taking five back if in this cell that has 25 do you understand what I'm saying okay there's one concerned member that will see we'll see has offered a matching Grant of 25 000 and let's say it's one to one okay sometimes sometimes yes sometimes no uh we'll find that that that dollar value here did not matter um and I'm not going to take a stand on what charities really do I can just tell you that the Charities that I've worked with have been honest and there's a real opportunity cost of a match dollar but I'm not I've never heard of that yeah yeah but I've never heard of it happening that if you get up to 25 000 a guy just says I was just kidding I'm not really going to give you because that's in the contract and then that's given but yes if you don't get if you don't get to 25 he can take that's in the contract I don't know we didn't we didn't have that problem here I know some cases where the guy has taken it and I know of some cases where the guy said use it for other things at the charity empirically the captain manner and what I mean by that is when I look across treatment cells that vary 25 50 100 blank that did not seem to affect the way people behaved in this experiment okay yes just I think it matters the underlying motivation is for giving and I think that gets at some of the underlying motivations of giving and I don't have any Theory or data on on that but I can certainly see the potential problem with that and it is I think reference point could be an interesting consideration there exactly yeah yeah so when I say price elasticity I mean it in a very narrow sense in a particular charitable Drive because it could be the case that they think it's a scam they think they're going to get the money anyway so it's in that in that light it's different from the elasticity that you get when you look at a change in the marginal tax rate but this is exactly the elasticity that I want though right because I don't know if what happens in the in the other literature it spills over to this but when I think about cheating I think a lot about the collusive model it's it's almost the insights that you learn in that literature is similar to whether a charity wants to cheat the donors in this environment I think a lot of of those predictions would would spill over to this particular environment about when to cheat etc etc right right yeah yeah I am exactly yeah when I said cheat I was trying to go back to Luigi because I think that's where you were going these guys are just all cheating that's kind of the elasticity that I want if they are then there should be no effect of match we'll see if there is actually when I when I go at Devon yes yes what happens is when you do that you in this the sample sizes were so large here that we didn't gain a lot in power so we it's harder to do that when somebody else is doing the envelopes so it's easier to give them uniform in the benefits did not exceed the cost of doing that here but I do have that calculation in the in this follow-up working paper about what you'd exactly gain you don't gain much that here but I do wish that I would have did something else in this experiment you'll see why in a minute okay so let's talk about some data if you just compare treatment versus no treatment when I'm talking treatment I'm I'm talking about either one to one two to one or three to one you raise about close to 20 more money and we're talking about in total I think we raised 75 or 90 000 in this drive okay but where this actually comes from is interesting this actually comes from entirely on the extensive margin so it's the fact that more people are giving the people who we think would be giving more they're not giving more in fact the response rate increases by about 22 percent in the matching treatments when you look at then across the ratios those ratios perform about the same three to one and two to one are a little bit better no my they're statistically the same this gives you a sense now you can see what what treatment I'm missing because I never imagined that this would happen over this particular range so I didn't worry about doing a one to two or a one to three obviously this isn't going to be a general result but it is a result over these match ratios that are typically used and if this is a True Result a stylized fact then you can imagine a that we're thinking about the model of giving in a slightly wrong way in B Charities are wasting a lot of money if they're being fair about what they're doing right because the opportunity cost of a match dollar means something go ahead yeah so I have that right I have give as given a hundred thousand has given 50 has given 25 and has given blank ET yeah that's my Baseline right and then I have all I'm crossing all those right Justine yes the total dollars given not including the match the dollars given are the same across three to one two to one one to one so this does not include the match money so three to one doesn't raise less money than one to one it raises about the same if you included The Upfront money it would raise more right but there's an opportunity cost of The Upfront money in in seed money so the Sierra Club we clearly you want to match but what I just showed you with the Sierra Club you would want that announced is somebody gave a hundred thousand dollars in seed money now we need more that performed better than a one-to-one match I'm not sure but in all these we met we met him so I'm not I can't speak to and that will be charity specific and how many letters he sent Etc okay now what I say about General result clearly we have done now one to two with the NAACP and one to two outperforms one they perform about the same as one to one and both do better than the control so now going to one to two is good but is going to one to a hundred good likely not right yes yeah we did and in this particular study it's not so it's not intertemporal substitution there is now a study that has come out that has found similar results but has found some inner temporal substitution in in this data set we did not we looked at the next year 's worth of giving we did not find any of that going on but to be intellectually honest there is another study that has found some crowding out from the future yes this is a warm list this was a warm list this was not an acquisition mailer sometime in the last five or ten years they don't give every month right and then that's a good question about are you just moving it up a month so that's why we needed to look at contributions before that period and after and and in ours you never you didn't have it was surprising I thought you would but you didn't have intertemporal substitution in our in our data this is a it's a first step exactly it's a first step now my first guess will be that this will hold and it has held in other types of groups to me it's more about religion versus non-religion because I think when you give to a religious cause which is a big chunk you're buying something different than what these other folks are buying uh it's just a speculation but I certainly agree I don't I don't know if there's will be one several Silver Bullet in the end there might be bins of knowledge and then we have to think about an overarching theory that can help explain all of those data and we're just getting started right now but you're certainly right yeah of course yeah yep exactly and the ones that don't there'll be no match effect exactly that's that's right I don't that could happen again my first guess will be this and then we'll have to adjust when we get other data okay so let's move on I only have about 15 minutes here wow five minutes okay there's other work um some of you probably saw Stefano and ulrika presenting our our paper on door-to-door fundraising where we're trying to we're trying to really dig into this idea of social pressure versus altruism in a door-to-door fundraising Drive we've of course lotteries are another thing that you can you can contemplate a fundraising Drive donor gifts of course are interesting as well okay we won't comment any further on those ongoing field experiments the only thing I want to talk about here is that you know a lot of this game is larger donors but it's very difficult to experiment with larger donors why because the fundraisers won't won't let me near big donors okay I've just happened to convince a few of them now a few universities are allowing me to name some classrooms and to run experiments on naming classrooms so that's um the naming rights and there's a a really Visionary business school in the midwest that is allowing me access to a very rich data set in which their models predict that these people can give between 5 10 25 million dollars and they have not been approached in a very long time so I'm going to be taking some of this to them as well so you could you could have said the same thing does it generalize to larger donors I hope we'll find out right phonathons in a pretty cheap way that we're doing experience with Smile Train Etc okay Lessons Learned I'm going to go quickly smaller givers do not seem to be buying a private good when they donate and this is hedge smaller seam upfront money is important most effectively used so far as a non-seed money non-price incentives can have very strong effects on givers so when you look at donor gifts that having a donor gift that can actually substitute for a warm list which is sort of an amazing result because the Charities all tell you that it's always about getting a warm list but a very small donor gift can make a cold-less person look like a wormless person but that leads to the next question that it's very critical how you initially get a person to give the incentives that you use up front and we talked a little bit about crowding earlier some types of incentives might crowd out reasons for giving later signaling charitable quality seems to stick okay so let's talk about experiments of for-profits for a few moments and I'm going to begin by talking about a Chrysler weight loss experiment and this is an experiment whereby Chrysler allowed us access to all of their employees who are interested in a wellness program across their roughly 32 plants and we went in and developed a scheme whereby there are some teams that were set up they were Anonymous teams some piece rate schemes and some of the team mechanisms would go as follows there are three other people on your team you have an incentive of Acts and you will be paid based on the largest uh loser of weight in your team that's called uh Best Shot mechanism weakest link mechanism there are three other players on your team in your financial incentives will depend on the person who performs the worst or loses the least amount weakest link so it has predictions on on weight loss and effort across that setting um I think it's fair to say that we've been finding it's it's preliminary but there's some evidence on the team incentive schemes being very powerful and being very close to what theory would suggest Chinese manufacturing plant there's a Chinese manufacturing plant that was interested in how to give bonuses and they produce things like big screen TVs computers DVD players Etc I became interested in whether the simple frames that we find in the lab that are very important what I mean by that for example is uh framing a bonus is a positive versus a negative you find very large effects in the lab and I was very skeptical about whether that effect would manifest itself in the field over a long period of time so we have these Chinese Manufacturing plants participate in an experiment whereby we frame the bonuses as losses or gains and we do it over a six-month period and amazing to me what happens is these simple framing manipulations matter a lot over the entire six-month period the loss frame leads to roughly one percent higher productivity than the gain frame they're both much higher than Baseline roughly three or four percent higher than Baseline Okay so to me I think that shows the power of these simple ideas that behavioral economists have found in the lab can actually have real effects in the field and Devin has a very nice paper on this with um Tiger Woods and how he's lost a verse when he's putting although a tiger's not really he's too experienced ambassadors group this is actually combining field experiments with naturally occurring data and what we're looking at here is they allowed us to run pricing experiments ambassadors group travels high school students overseas and they allowed us a few years of running pricing experiments and they also gave us all of their naturally occurring data I think this came up a little bit earlier it shows a power of combining naturally occurring data that does not have exogenous variation with data that has exogenous variation we're pretty close to having a paper written this is with Levitt that that shows a complementarity of in this particular environment okay so I would say now watch for an experiment near you I can't tell you the airline but there will be a major airline pricing experiment starting next Wednesday um so watch for that there's a large insurance provider that's now randomizing rate quotes again I can't tell you the large insurance provider but that's going on as we speak and then there's kind of this busy website that is allowing us access to some of the people who answer their phones and we're running experience that's where I want to end and I I've set up these guide posts for field experiments you know artifactual frame natural field experiments and I understand that all field experiments won't fit into one of these three guideposts I'm I'm just thinking about this as a way to guide our thinking about what a field experiment looks like and I've taken it upon myself so to speak to have a Clearinghouse of papers that in the roughly risen in the last 10 or 15 years that include artifactual framed and natural field experiments and it's free on this website you will find paper titles authors and a pdf version of every paper and it's it's free it's just it says.com but I think that's for no given reason there's no ads this is just something that my team has put together there are I think roughly three to four hundred field experimental papers on this site this isn't data but at least it gives you a source to find papers that have data and if you have a field experiment that's not on this site please send it there's a there's a way to submit your field experiments to this particular site now I've already argued that I see this as a high growth industry you might be convinced you might not be what do I see as generation next exactly that last slide about working in collaboration with private firms you see this explosion in development economics you know these Partnerships with governments and ngos and that's it's not surprising that they're there's a lot of interest and enthusiasm for that area and you can understand why historically that we've gone that route now going this other route where firms will open up and we have to be careful of course I understand confidentiality in IRB it's available and it's possible to overcome those barriers and when you think about it working in collaboration with firms profit or non-profit there's a lot of low-hanging fruit there and you see this is a is a large potential chance to learn something important about economics okay so I'm going to stop there I have a few more slides but I know that I'm I'm 10 minutes over so I'm going to stop there and entertain any questions if you have them or I can I can finish these slides it ends on a methodological note one of my favorite ways to end this slideshow but I'm not going to tax you that much okay so if you don't have any questions we can call it a session otherwise I'll entertain questions in public or private okay
