so the price of oil went up dramatically in 2005. uh spent much of a decade above 100 a barrel and then uh collapsed equally dramatically beginning in uh summer of 2014. so what the heck happened and and what does it mean for the u.s economy here's a graph that uh captures a fair part of both why oil prices went up and why they then came down so significantly this is world production of uh field production of crude oil going back to 1973 monthly and from 2005 to 2013 world production barely went up and yet that was a period when demand particularly from china and other emerging economies was growing rapidly so how can china consume more oil when there's really not more oil being produced the answer is that people in the united states and japan and europe had to consume less oil what persuaded us to do that a higher price and then it's only within the last few years that world production has broken out of that plateau big increase in supply and now we've got more oil than we need so why did uh oil production uh finally go up well the united states was where the story began this is the u.s production of crude oil there was a decline for over 30 years in in our production and then as we developed this new fracking technology on the shale formations a spectacular increase in the the u.s production of crude oil that increase continued through the first couple months of 2015 and then started a decline and it's going to decline more and the reason is because this is very expensive now the cost of producing uh through fracking has been coming down significantly uh through productivity gains uh and also through cost savings because all these oil servicers are are going out of business willing to cut prices to the bone but even so uh here's a here's some estimates of the uh the long run break-even cost you're talking about 60 a barrel or higher way way above where we are at the moment or here's another uh kind of practical indication of that uh so i took the five companies which have been biggest in the shale oil production between them they account for almost a million barrels a day and between them they lost over 32 billion dollars in 2015 and in 2015 the price of oil was almost fifty dollars a barrel there's no way the current situation is going to be maintained that decline in u.s production that began in 2015 is is going to be continuing uh but even though u.s production is on the way down world production still continued to increase significantly in 2015 and there's an answer to why that happened and it's one word iraq world production was about up about 1.2 million barrels a day iraq by itself accounted for almost 1 million of that and here's a graph of the monthly production of oil from iraq i like this picture because it kind of has the history of the middle east in one picture you can see the iran iraq war in 1980 you can see the first gulf war in 1990 the second gulf war in 2003 and you can see what a hectic place this has always been and whatever you want to say about the modern government in iraq at least it was successful in bringing western companies in uh to produce more oil and that's basically what we see going on now it's a similar story in iran under sanctions for years and problems persist but those sanctions are being lifted a lot of people expect a big boom a big increase from iran so i never thought i would say what we've seen is peace and stability have broken out in the middle east and north africa and they certainly have not but in relative terms those places have gotten past some of the problems they had and that's the other reason that the production has gone up dramatically but that's not the whole story not fracking not opec and and here's a graph that should persuade you of that the first picture is the price of crude oil what i've been talking about the dramatic slide this goes back the last 16 months dramatic slide down in the price of crude oil the second graph is the price of copper and darn if it doesn't look like the same graph they both have a very significant uh decline overall over this period they both had a little rally last spring another little rally this year very similar behavior and something like that has happened to all the commodities whatever you look at silver lumber uh you name it commodity prices overall have declined quite a bit uh in the last year now that similarity between the first two graphs oil and copper uh as i say it's not because of fracking it's not because of opec what do oil and copper have in common well they have in common china the growth and demand from china came to be the dominant factor in the market for oil the dominant factor in the market for copper and what we see on a daily weekly basis is that news about the world economy in general speculation concerns about china in particular seem to be moving all the commodity prices in a similar way well the last panel is the the value of the uh uh the euro compared to the dollar and the appreciation of the dollar is is part of the same story so i i have a little regression that summarizes uh some of those connections i took the weekly pers change in the log of the oil price and for the period up to june 2014. so this regression is estimated before any of these dramatic declines in the price of what we're talking about regressed it on the weekly change in the log of the price of copper and the basic observation is that in a week when the price of copper went up the price of oil probably went up as well the second variable in that regression is the value trade weighted value of the dollar the observation is that in a week when the dollar appreciated the price of oil tended to go down and then the third variable is the change in the nominal interest rate on a 10-year treasury security and the observation is that if long-term interest rates go down and on a weekly basis the main factor in that has been again concerns about the world economy when the world economy is looking weaker interest rates in europe are coming down interest rates in the us so those three variables are what are in the regression and you can see up to 2014 it has an r squared of about a third about a third of the the weekly change in oil prices over 2007 to 2014 can be explained by the weekly change in the price of copper the value of the dollar and uh long-term interest rates well then i took the fitted the coefficients from that regression and asked what would you then expect to have happened to the price of oil since 2014 given what we've seen in terms of the decrease in the price of copper since then the decrease in long-term interest rates the increase in the value of the dollar and the answer is this regression would say we would have seen the price of oil go from 105 dollars a barrel in the summer of 2014 to a number like 66 dollars today and i'm interpreting that to say that a significant part of the decline though by no means all a significant part of the decline is related to what's happening on the demand side as manifest by the co-movement between oil prices and and a number of other commodities so what's all this mean for the u.s economy well to the extent that oil prices and commodity prices have come down because of concerns about a slowing world economy possibly even a recession in china that is not good news for u.s gdp to the extent that the dollar is very strong that is not helping the competitiveness of u.s manufacturing now it is true that the lower oil prices are a huge benefit for consumers and in the latest numbers u.s consumers are spending 180 billion dollars less at an annual rate on energy goods and services nominally at the end of 2015 as they were in the summer of uh 2014. that's about one percent of gdp now uh on the basis of the historical correlations we would have thought gee people are probably going to spend that extra uh effective income on other stuff and we would have seen a a boom in consumption spending uh in practice we we didn't really see that and and here's one summary of that i used some a var that edelstein and killian have used again this is just estimated using data now through the summer of 2014. it's a var of the change in real consumption spending and a measure of energy prices uh and the black line is the actual path of consumption the actual percentage change since the summer of 2014 in uh real consumption spending the red line is what you would have predicted based on that historical regression if you just took data through the summer of 2014. it's basically just projecting a trend and as you'll see we're more or less on this the same trend that was that seemed to be in the data before energy prices went down so much the blue is what that uh regression line would have predicted if you fed in the exposed knowledge that energy prices were going to come down as much as as they had so that's just one confirmation there's been big savings for consumers but not showing up in in consumption spending of gdp on the other hand there's been a very significant response of the oil producing sector here for example is mining investment again this is this is nominal uh and that came that's followed by more than half for the u.s from where it had been and that's a number uh like about half a percent of gdp and as uh as long as we continue in this situation we're going to see it see an additional uh drag on gdp as we actually start to decrease production of u.s oil that's that's really not in the data yet but i i think it may well come uh in the in the coming year so so to summarize uh we'd think the consumption spending should decrease when oil prices go up and increase when oil prices go down we haven't seen that ladder effect very much in the data so far but we know in general that a sudden increase or decrease in the price of oil leads to some sectoral dislocation an increase hurts autos a decrease hurts oil producers and that's a reason why even an inc why in an economy that maybe had no oil imports at all it wouldn't be a pure wash if you have a a change in the price of oil that benefits consumers uh uh hurts producers and a finding of a lot of studies has been that increases in oil prices would lead you to predict a lower value for future gdp but uh in terms of a forecasting model a decrease in oil prices doesn't really uh help uh predict a boom in gdp and the the biggest single fact data point in that conclusion was the 1985 collapse in oil prices we saw no national boom in the u.s coming from that but you did see significant problems in the u.s oil-producing states well that will be a hard act to follow but i can thank you for the organizers very much for inviting me it's a pleasure to be discussing such an important and interesting issue uh with such a distinguished group of scholars uh i should know it at the outset the usual disclaimer that these views are my own and not those of the federal reserve now you might be wondering why is somebody from the federal reserve talking to you about commodity prices but the answer is pretty obvious uh commodity prices especially oil but others too affect both legs of our dual mandate obviously the big fall in commodity prices recently has has lowered inflation and made it more difficult to achieve our two percent target and as and as jim has already discussed and i'll be talking about too uh changes in oil prices certainly complicate or at least add dimensions to our quest to for maximum sustainable employment so for all those reasons many people in the international finance division uh here at the fed uh have done a lot of work on commodity prices this is just a listing of some of the papers and i'm going to try to jam as many of those as possible uh into my remaining nine minutes uh so what i want to focus on is is something that jim also talked about but what i will call the you know because it's often called that the commodity price super cycle and by that i refer to the run-up in in oil prices the black line and non-oil commodity prices the red line and the 2000s followed by their plunge more recently why is it called a super cycle because it has the general attributes we think about a multi-year upswing in prices as commodity production lags behind increases in demand followed by the downswing as demand slows and the production finally catches up now this can be identified in a purely statistical fashion your left panel sure the black line is real oil prices since 1980. we fitted a trend through it that's the red line and then deviations around that trend can be estimated at a business cycle frequency that's the panel on the far right and which goes from you know looking at a frequency of zero to eight years and then a super cycle frequency show in the middle which goes from 8 to 30 years and as you can see looking at the middle panel the blue line you know the super cycle shows oil prices rising in the early 2000s and then falling thereafter the same thing is evidence in metals prices again looking at the middle panel and upswing in a downswing identified by this purely statistical method now question is what is the intuition behind the super cycle is it follow a regular dynamic and we think that it does now this should look familiar to many of you from econ 1 or 101 the so-called cobweb theorem or hog cycle and and basically the story is as follows a a downward shock to production say of hogs put puts you at an equilibrium at e1 low production very high prices it takes time for hog producers to ramp up their hog production at the same time hog producers assume that whatever high prices are prevailing this year will also prevail next year so they expand their production pushing the equilibrium to e2 at that point plenty of hogs but in fact prices are now much higher than hog demanders want so the prices fall to e3 and then at that price which is very low hog producers don't want to produce so much they contract production and that is the super cycle in action so this story depends on two key assumptions one of them is that supply in particular but also demand are in relatively inelastic in the short run with respect to price and we think that certainly applies to a lot of commodity markets and then secondly that expectations of future commodity prices are something close to random walks or at least it's very difficult to identify the equilibrium and that too seems to apply to commodities markets looking here at prices the black line of spot oil prices uh you can then what we have is extending out of the that of the actual uh spot oil prices are the series of red dashed lines those are the those are the forecasts of the commodity of the oil futures markets and as you can see they're a bunch of flat lines basically fairly extrapolative expectations uh the same is true of copper prices again it's very hard for uh for the markets to know exactly what prices are going to do and they tend to just extrapolate so does that mean that commodity markets and producers are irrational no it's just that it's really difficult to identify all the shocks that are going to be hitting the commodities market and to identify the equilibrium level and that's certainly been true of this most recent commodity price super cycle so looking at the factors that drove up prices in the first part of that cycle obviously and as jim has talked about a key aspect was growing demand from for commodities from china and uh and that was indeed a shock or a surprise to everybody this picture shows chinese industrial production growth the black line and the uh and the forecast by consensus economics at different years during the upswing period obviously chinese growth will outstrip expectations this this shows a regression of changes in oil prices on various determinants and as you can see the main determinants of oil prices changes in oil prices was eme gdp that's emerging market gdp growth surprises clearly very influential the same is true in explaining changes in copper prices but besides growth and demand for commodities the other factor that of course is integral to any super cycle is a slow response of commodities production and in fact during this upswing commodities production fell short of expectations you can see this with oil production where all those red dash lines are showing expectations of more oil production than actually emerged and i think jim you alluded to that flatness of oil production during that period and then of course it's even more evident looking at the behavior of copper production so that's all about the upswing in the super cycle you can see the same factors going into reverse to explain the downswing obviously chinese growth the black line has fallen well below what market participants started to assume after 2008-2009 the same applies to industrial production in other emerging market economies it's also true that this is around the period when finally commodity production started to ramp up and accelerate in response to prior high prior high prices and you can see oil production now the black line moving up much faster than market participants anticipated a lot of that as you've talked about due to fracking which of course was a hard to anticipate thing and a little bit more limited evidence of a production surge in copper again beyond expectations so that's basically the story of the up and down and i don't have time to get into our var decomposition but i do want to note just in reference to some of your comments that uh by our estimation of using a var approach uh supply factors seem to be much more important than the slowing demand factors in accounting for the decline in commodity prices but people can argue about that i want to use some remaining minutes to talk about the other aspects of the commodity price super cycle which you've also talked about which is the impact on gdp and as as we've discussed in general we would think that lower prices for oil are a plus for economic activity they lower production costs they shift income to higher marginal propensity to consume consumers but we haven't seen that happening how come one possibility is that at these very low oil prices falling oil prices are a negative rather than a positive for economic activity and certainly we've seen that in drilling again like you've mentioned with huge declines in mining and drilling lowering gdp and it's also likely uh that falling oil prices have negatively impacted oil firms and oil reliant governments but there is another possibility which is that even at current low levels falling oil prices are still a plus for economic growth but that the but this plus is small it's slow to materialize and it's being offset by other headwinds and using a different different var analysis looking at the top right panel world gdp what it shows is an impulse response for a 10 decline in oil prices with world gdp rising but very slowly and only to a 0.2 percent above baseline peak so not a lot there positive but very small similar analysis looking at different countries with different oil dependencies shown here and looking at the top left panel for the united states which is you know an important oil producer now but still a net importer of oil increases in oil declines in oil prices actually lower gdp slightly in the first year year and a half before rising uh moderately so small effects that could be overwhelmed by other things uh to wrap up the futures markets see non-oil commodity prices in red in real terms being about flat going forward and oil prices moving up some but as you might have gathered my faith in these markets is not great and many different things can happen some of the big questions are what will happen to chinese demand for oil will fracking change the dynamics of commodity price of oil price super cycles and what about climate change what will that do to the long run trajectory of demands thank you what i want to talk about actually is a little bit about what's going on just below that macro level and why this probably isn't 98 over again right because a lot of what you've just heard would suggest this has a lot to do a very similar in structure to what happened in during the asia crisis where we also saw similar price dynamics and i want to talk a little bit this graph is a little different probably than something you've seen before it's kind of a bunch of supply curves what this is is the break-even oil prices for the top projects this is the sort of microanalysis of roughly the largest 400 oil development projects in the world aggregated to give you a sense of the shape of the development cost curve of oil and how that has been evolving over this recent period and it's actually changed rather substantially in some ways that i think are often missed yes shale matters yes it has somewhat lowered the cost yes it's made the u.s the producer it's actually also fundamentally changed the structure of the equilibrium in the oil market if you start out at 2009 you see a very steep slope this was at the heart of the super cycle period this gets you if you are a dominant player the way saudi arabia is a fairly classic sort of supply restriction dominant player equilibrium where you will smooth small shocks you will allow large shocks to pass through and your behavior is reasonably strategic okay and you tend to keep your investment levels fairly low as this curve changes shale is a learning by doing technology it has an extreme scalability to it so what you're watching is this curve flatten and go down with the learning by doing and where the marginal players elsewhere in the world exist because shale essentially is always at the cusp going up it's the marginal supplier at the back end of that curve and other people are filling the oil in between there very different scenarios and now if you're saudi arabia and you're looking at that 2014 curve or that 2015 curve you have a very different game theory problem in front of you right you're now an infra marginal producer you're now essentially facing what amounts to a competitive equilibrium strategic behavior simply surrenders market share on a permanent basis and so your actual optimum now is to maximize production and what we see in the marketplace is essentially a radical separation in the behavior of players of sort of high cost standard producers you see their their investment driving diving where for the low-cost producers those infra marginal producers who've historically been supply restrictors we've actually seen relatively high levels of investment activity during this period i'll do a sort of saudi comparison relative to 97 2000 where you see this dynamic where their recounts are actually going up not down they have been reorganizing saudi aramco as an enp company they are about to start doing ipos on a lot of their infrastructure in order to speed up their development projects and opening various parts of their economy um we i don't have graphs for this you actually see something similar in russia although a different dynamic where the currency revaluations have allowed them to become an infra-marginal supplier and so again you're actually seeing investment activities go up where in 98 they drop like a rock right and so what you've actually seen is a split in the marketplace where the high cost producers are essentially dying here the low cost producers are actually upping activity levels and shale is the margin in between it's become sort of a separating hyperplane for the oil world and so in this dynamic we've actually seen very different strategic behavior that's likely to operate going forward where the kind of smoothing we have seen from opec is leaving the other thing that isn't evident just from a quick look at this graph that is worth talking about is one of the this is an investment diagram which means the time to market is not very explicit right at the beginning of this graph in 09 most of those projects had a three or four year development cycle the bottom end of that graph in 2015 and 16 is got less than a year in terms of its delivery to market so you've also radically changed the structure of this market in terms of its supply and dynamic and inventory equilibrium and so you are likely to see a much smoother market and i'll also make the obvious point from econ 101 really steep supply curves give you a world where supply determines quantity and demand determines price really flat supply curves gives you a world where supply determines price and demand determines quantity so this market has truly flipped on its head in a very deep level and we actually expect its dynamics to be completely different going forward than it has been historically within different parameters the one last thing and this is the one disagreement i had with with the comments earlier about where the new equilibrium is shale is an extremely dynamic technology i think it's misunderstood just how much learning by doing there is the marginal the marginal cost structure in shale has actually fallen dramatically you have to remember you only care about the stuff at the bend okay so a lot of the shale properties right were important when you were in the massive ramp-up phase now you care about sort of mostly the low-cost ones where you have done a fair amount of learning and so what you've seen in the last little while is all of the development resources are concentrating on the highest marginal product zones and in those areas we've actually seen and people be able to raise capital with break evens that are below 40 that doesn't mean the average of the entire field on a physical basis is below 40 it does mean the likely to develop areas are probably sub 50. because you've seen that expansion of saudi oil you've seen the expansion of kuwaiti oil you'll see expansions of rush of oil so what the marginal point is in the shale zone has essentially shifted in and the marginal cost curve has come down more than people understand and so we actually think that the historic role of oil as being a major driver of volatility in the market is probably actually fading we think it's going to be smaller as a part of the budget share going forward we think its volatility is going to be lower and we think that is going to be a progressive process for the next decade whereas shale becomes larger as the dynamics of this equilibrium become clearer as shale becomes more diversified across regions because it also has a pretty large reach one of the next places you'll probably see it as argentina it can also be back used in a number of areas like louisiana that that's going to generally cause this to become a less volatile driver of economic activity and that's my remarks you
