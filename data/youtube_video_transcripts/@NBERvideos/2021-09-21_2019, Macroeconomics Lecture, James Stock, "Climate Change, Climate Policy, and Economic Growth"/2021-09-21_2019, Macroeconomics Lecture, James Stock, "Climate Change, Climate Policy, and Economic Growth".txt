since the 1990s i've had a sideline of looking at climate models the science side of of climate you from sort of a data analytic perspective and i'll show you some of that in a minute but when i went down to washington and i served on the cea from 2012 to 2014 i had the client the energy portfolio of which was at a time that the president wanted to take some serious action on climate uh because waxman markey had failed uh in the previous in his previous term this action was all through administration through administrative procedures like uh administrative authority through the clean air act so i spent a fair amount of time uh doing work on the clean power plan which was the regulation for the power sector and on other areas of climate policy and i'll talk about some some of those in passing so i got quite interested in the topic i decided it was important i thought gosh my graduate students are better than i am at proving theorems in econometrics so why don't i do something useful and i've been spending more than half my time in this area since then i'm going to start with some climate basics climate change basics so i think this is you know it's kind of tough because some of you probably know a great deal about this and some of you might know less but i'm going to start with where i started from which is just what are the data say so i'm just going to take a quick look at some of the data and hopefully in a way that is informative okay so here's just a picture of what temperatures have been uh for the last since about 1860 uh in um uh global mean temperatures so they vary you know from place to place you can see that uh during the before like world war one they're pretty constant they started to go up uh around the 19 around the 1930s they were constant until about the 1970s or 80s and then starting in around 1980 they've been taking off in a serious way temperature rise has been about one degree celsius since the late 19th century basic a starting point in understanding this is thinking about what the i'm going to spend a little bit of time on the climate science here of only a little bit and i'm going to do it from an econometrician's perspective a natural question is what's causing this now one approach to what's causing this is you you've maybe some of you have heard this say phrase 97 of climate scientists agree that this is anthropogenic and for for some of you that's probably going to be good enough but for others of you that might actually set off alarm bells and you and it's like you know you're not totally persuaded by people who say hey i'm from mit i've got a model trust me so uh if if if you fall in that ladder camp if you fall in that ladder camp i'm going to do some really simple stuff so the the basic starting point of climate of climate science is just an energy flux concept which is that the temperature change the temperature on the earth's surface of the earth is proportional to the energy flux that's hitting it and so that energy flux comes from a couple of places it can come from the sun or can come from uh of radiation warm body radiation from the earth that is then absorbed and re re-emitted back to the surface of the earth by greenhouse gases and so those are the two sorts of sorts of radiative fluxes here's what those radiative fluxes look like so i'm going to go from the top to the bottom the top is the radiator flux from carbon dioxide it's called radiative forcings that's the jargon so it's the radiative history of radiative forcing over this period of carbon dioxide uh forget about the green dotted line for a second the one that's uh next below it is the radiator forcing from methane which is also a greenhouse gas below that the gray line is the radiator forcing from trace gases such as hydrofluorocarbons uh which are really potent there's not many of them but they're very potent greenhouse gases the wiggly line is solar insulation it's radiated forcing from the sun and so it's bumping wiggling around because of sunspot cycles and then it's kind of interesting the negative line is from sulfur oxides sulfur oxides actually have the opposite effect what happens is sunlight hits them and because of their spectral characteristics they they re they re-emit it they they basically block the sun's radiation and bounce it back to the to the uh back back into the atmosphere back into space uh so they have negative radiative forcings the sum of those things which is aggregate radiative forcing is uh is is is um is there in the dashed line so so here's a project that i did back when i just got started i said okay so the theory is supposed to be that radiative forcing is related to temperature how does that work these things have trends we know how to handle trends so back using data from 1994 uh i did some co-integration stuff and some other stuff sort of time series modeling at the time and uh and then and then just fit a trend so here's the here's the trend from uh that we fit back a long time ago back in a paper that was because of referee torture wasn't published until 2006 but it was estimated through uh on data through 1994 and that's the that's that's the underlying trend this i want to stress that that red line is only a function of the radiator forcings there's no temperature in that red line this is just a fitted value based on the radiator forcings taken from table two of this of this paper and the nice thing about this is since it was fit on data through 1994 you've got 20 years of a true out of sample experiment so one question you might ask is is this theory any good like how much does should we put any weight on this at all does this seem to have any predictive content and there's two interesting episodes in this out of sample period one is that long flat period there starting around 1998 which is called the hiatus uh that's been used as arguments why we haven't you know don't have any climate change or whatever the other uh is then right after the hiatus this thing really bumped up so the question is how does this work so if i take that that thing from table two of this that was our preferred specification in this 1994 data set that's the predicted value okay so this predicted value is just based on radiative forcings and those radiative forcings have this remarkable feature that they track the hiatus well the reason for that is twofold one is that the solar insulation are kind of into sunspot low and the other reason is that there were there were a lot of uh coal plants burned built in china that started emitting sulfur oxides in that period and the sulfur oxides in that period subdued the warming effect of the increasing co2 so anyway it seems to fit pretty well if you'd use this model then ask the question which is a common question which is how much of warming is anthropogenic you can actually back out how much is anthropogenic because you can look at the solar component of it that is the natural component of it and you can hold the other greenhouse gases constant at their pre-industrial period averages and you can estimate what the contribution is of of the of the solar of the natural component and then the residual is the uh is the human is the anthropogenic so here's the natural component of solar warming of global warming and you can see that it tracks the predicted really well during you know up to about 1920 but starting about 1920 there's this divergence and then that diverges really goes in spades starting around 1980. so the answer is how much of solar we by the way i should say we haven't used there's no global circulation models in here there's no supercomputers in here there's like a co-integrating regression and then and then some basic really basic stuff that everybody accepts it's basically almost all anthropogenic okay so i i don't know whether i i find this supportive for me this is helpful and persuasive in terms of thinking about do i really believe those mit guys with their models and the answer is it turns out i do okay um so so a question then is if co2 is really what's driving this what's the does it give you some facts about co2 here's the history of co2 in the united states i'm now going to focus on the u.s which is what i understand best um so this is co2 in the us and you can see that co2 peaked in about in 2005 and ever since then it's been declining there's a narrative associated with this decline which is that well you know what we've actually really turned a corner and the reason we've turned a corner is because of energy efficiency and people are aware of the problem of of greenhouse gases and we're doing a lot of a lot of things along those lines to mitigate that and we have more fish fuel efficient cars uh and so forth and that we're on and renewables are becoming more and more uh uh cost effective so we can put solar photovoltaic panels on our roofs and so forth so we're on our way that is a popular narrative among environmentalists who want to say that it won't cost very much to eliminate to deal with greenhouse gas to decarbonize the economy it's a popular narrative on the right because they'll say markets are solving the problem anyway it's a popular narrative among the green finance community because they say we don't care if there's any climate policy we've got a great product for you to invest in unfortunately it's wrong uh the the what's really happened you will not be surprised i bet everybody in this room can take a guess as to why the big drop was in 2009 what you probably what you might not know is that after that we had this remember there's this fracking thing in cheap natural gas and what's happened is that a lot of the coal plants have closed the inefficient coal plants have closed and now we're using natural gas well if you take those factors into account what's the future look like this is what the u.s energy information administration thinks the future looks like it thinks that we're basically going to be in the same place unless we do something unless we change policy a business's usual thing is that all of those paths and energy efficiency and renewables and so forth are going to be offset by economic growth and emissions are going to be roughly constant emissions being constant means that concentrations are increasing if you use estimates like we saw before oh here's some really short-term estimates so this is something i just have been doing with some graduate students here's some short-term estimates the impact effect of these omission emissions over the next 10 years during those 10 years so this is a really short window on a global scale is an increase of of 0.13 degrees celsius so the long-term effect is much bigger than that what's really striking about this is that there's meaningful quarter of a degree fahrenheit meaningful impact effects of uh of uh of uh of um of of global emissions at the current rates even over a very short human uh life lifetime what are the consequences of these well i think you've probably seen a lot of the sort of the scare stuff so i'm just going to show i'm not going to go through any of that i'm just going to show you one interesting set of maps oh i'm going to talk one thing the one thing i'm going to oh i should say that this temperature increase has generated some great data so there's a large literature documenting what the effect of effect of this warming is on crops and what the effect of it is on even asylum applications and on political stability and on consumption especially consumption among poorer countries and not surprisingly it's not so terrific um so what i am going to show you i'm just going to show you one thing which is uh which is the sea is something related to sea level rise the sea level its water expands as it gets warmer so the sea level is going to rise that's one reason another reason for sea level rise is the glaciers will melt and maybe a little bit of ice sheets will melt too um so i'm just going to illustrate it's kind of interesting an interesting illustration okay so this is a map of where we are so you can see i don't know if i can actually if there's a pointer here i don't i don't think i should probably don't want to touch the wrong thing can you see where the sonesta is it's like this nest is you see where this nest is sort of this is yeah directly up from the blue dot oh those blue dots if you go there it's great you can click on it and they'll show you the hatch cell or harvard university or something this is a this is produced by noaa national oceanographic whatever administration that's the current map you can see harvard up there in the corner near the bend of the charles and then mit is down there in the in the middle and maybe oh yeah so okay can you see that is that working no i'm not getting all right doesn't matter it turns out sea level rises in uniform and it depends on local like local gravity but also on local currents and it happens to be the case that the northeast is a place even if sea level rise is about 70 centimeters or 90 centimeters which is a business as usual scenario by the end of the century it turns out that's like almost maybe one and a half times maybe even twice as much in the boston area so sea level rise here by the end of the century in a business as usual scenario might be one and a half meters this is what one and a half meters looks like which which mit is not doing great uh lidtower center is in good shape lidhower center is becoming beachfront property harvard's recent investments in alston those don't look so terrific i have to say for those of you who know this map now i don't think this would actually occur because all that this is is that those are regions that are actually below sea level but of course lots of the world has places that are below sea level so you could keep that water out by building sufficient dams or dikes if you start to see more severe what are called abrupt irreversible events that could change the situation so if you start to see say partial melting the west antarctic ice sheet or even very partial melt in the greenland ice sheet that could increase it by a substantial amount many many many meters if you even go from 1.5 to 3 meters this is what three meters looks like and i think that would be much harder to to mitigate so you can imagine trying to solve problems like this by building dikes and so forth but that is um i think like literally just like throwing money in the ocean and uh and certainly not like the the most efficient way to to to proceed probably so with that let me let me switch gears and let me talk a little bit about costs and policies and and approaches so um so first of all let me just remind you that there's a number of externalities to address it's not just the carbon pricing externality there's also a research and development externality for certain aspects there's going to be a network externality so for example think about electric charging stations on electric vehicles sort of a chicken and egg deal and then there's other other externalities that one can think about as well but those are the three that i'll be keeping in mind um so let me and let me summarize my bottom line okay so the conventional wisdom in the profession is that by far the most important element of a suite of climate policies is a carbon tax my own view is that we also need to take technology pushing policies very seriously and more seriously than we have been this view is informed by positive political economy what politicians seem ready to do by empirical evidence and by some complete complete key success stories and by a small but insightful literature on carbon prices r d subsidies and induced technical change here i'm thinking of recent research by drone asmoglu felipe aguilan heidi williams van renin akajeet stancheva mellitz lemoyne and and others and i'll come back to this at the end the usual the usual measure of um of a climate pilot of the cost of a climate policy is something called the social cost of carbon it's a what the social cost of carbon is is it's a the monetized net present value of the damages from emitting a marginal ton of co2 uh the estimate there is the 2016 estimate under the obama administration it's about 50 a ton there's a lot of evidence this there's a wide consensus that this this number has like got an enormous standard error and a lot more research is needed there's a big research program going on but with resources for the future there's people involved uh in there's a big involvement from the uh from the chicago group in uh from michael greenstone's group in chicago there's a big involvement from saul shang and marshall book brooks burke's group in um uh in berkeley we've even got some uh some time series econometricians from princeton uh putting their shoulder to the wheel on this one as well so um but for now i'm just going to use this uh 50 per ton okay so uh to so so now i'm going to talk a little bit about policies climate policies in the u.s fall broadly into four categories so the first is what i was working on when i was in the obama administration which is regulatory approaches i'd argue that we put a lot of thought into the clean power plan clean power plan was pretty efficient it would have reduced emissions by a meaningful amount at quite an inexpensive value estimates are like 11 per ton other regulations are not as efficient so there's a big literature um pointing out inefficiencies in the fuel corporate average fuel economy or cafe standards which are what control which would regulate mileage and automobiles there's an awful lot of things about that design that really cry out for improvement costs for those can be anywhere in the fifty dollars to even three hundred dollars per ton depending upon the depending upon the estimate and and exactly what's going uh going on a big problem with regulatory approaches beyond just the potential cost and the cumbersome is that they actually have pretty limited scope you just aren't going to solve the climate problem only through regulation there's other problems too they're obvious they're not durable so all of the regulations that i worked on have all been reversed by the trump administration uh and uh and moreover uh at least in the united states if the authority is clean air act authority it's very unlikely that the supreme court with the most recent appointments is going to be sympathetic to a to an expansive interpretation of the clean air act so my view is that basically the regulatory approach is off the table so we need to think of other approaches the second approach which we've had a lot of experience on is i don't know what you could call it but maybe the sort of the the the near i'll call them narrowly focused policies and so examples in this include weatherization programs mandates to use certain renewable fuels in our fuel supply state level renewable portfolio standards and other things like that the costs of these policies are all over the map there are a few cases like putting corn ethanol in the fuel supply up to 10 that i would actually argue is a negative cost policy it's something that's done by the market without any any need but that is really the exception if you look at biodiesel for example that cost between 150 and 420 dollars per ton a lot more than that fifty dollars per ton depending upon how you treat the uh by the incidence of the biodiesel tax credit um these policies also have the problem that they interact in sort of complicated and typically just expensive but not very effective ways with other policies so by and large these sort of narrowly defined policies are not ones that that economists tend to think are very efficient or effective and at best are a small part of a broader package of solutions the third set of policies of which we don't have in the united states are economy-wide carbon pricing policies now um although efforts for cap and trade did fail with waxman markey other company other countries have adopted a carbon tax and so it's worth thinking about what what those costs might be the dominant tool for analyzing a carbon tax is analyzing the costs and economic macro effects of a carbon tax or computable general equally general equilibrium models a recent example of that is a book last year by larry goulder and mark hafted where they examine a variety of carbon pricing models in carbon pricing policies including including a carbon tax for a lump sum transfer tax so it depends it depends how you recycle the revenues in terms of the economic effects but for a lump sum recycling which is the framework considered by the carbon leadership council and supported by that letter that probably many of you signed that janet yellen spearheaded for that they actually find pretty darn low costs so uh for a 20 carbon tax that increases at four percent per year they estimate that that as that takes a hit to gdp of one percent uh over the period between now and 2050 so that's like roughly speaking or 24 20 50. so roughly speaking that's like three or four basis points per year so that's a very small a very small hit to gdp in work that i'm doing because some countries have actually adopted a carbon tax you can actually ask empirically what's the effect on their economies and so i'm doing some work on that with um with gib metcalf and so far we can't seem to find any measurable effect actually our coefficients are positive which doesn't make any sense uh but they're not statistically significant so that's consistent with this small effect that met that that goulder and hofstede estimate the thing about a carbon tax though and we think that that's a you know we that's clearly a very efficient policy i think it's important to remember that it's a limited policy and some people who don't know a lot about the way that the energy energy works in our economy might not really realize this a carbon tax at low levels will essentially decarbonize the power sector and it will certainly get rid of all coal in the power sector because coal just becomes too effective too expensive but a 20 carbon tax is 20 cents a gallon and nobody's going to go out and buy a bunch of evs just because gas has gone up by 20 cents a gallon or even by 50 cents a gallon takes more than that to really transform the transportation sector and it takes even more than that to make any serious dent in the other third of the economy which is buildings and commercial and residential so a carbon tax has a big effect at first and then it kind of peters out so then the question is what are you going to do with the rest of that and that gets me to the final set of policies that we have investigated here in the united states which is these technology pushing policies and basically the story line of this of this family of policies is induced technical progress so it goes under a number of other terms you know learning by doing or moving down the cost curve and stuff like that but basically it's induced technical progress i'm going to give you four examples three of them are success stories i i would argue success stories although this is anecdotal and one of them it's also anecdotal but it is definitely not a success story and so i think there's policy design issues that we can learn from there so the first of these policies is um is photovoltaics so there is a big uh push in germany through the energy vendor program and their net metering program or their their their by their feed in tariff program uh which is like net metering uh there's uh there was a big push in the california solar initiative and then starting around 2008 we introduced a uh income tax credit for purchases of solar panels to put on your roof and between all of these programs there was really a big spur a big big increase in spending on soda solar photovoltaics well what has happened is that sort of solar photovoltaic panels have really come down enormously in price to the point that they're actually in some applications like out in the deserts in arizona uh cost competitive with natural gas and with other fossil fuel uh generating facilities now the thing is you prob you should be thinking to yourself so what he just told me is that the price went down and consumption went up and somehow that's supposed to be this like great insight that's going to solve the energy economy and i think that this basically points to the identification problem in empirical studies of induced technological progress there's a little bit of work that gets at this so there's a nice paper by a guy at cornell todd girardin who is gives some pretty solid identified empirical evidence that learning by doing uh and and that this demand pull concept made a difference in the price coming down but a lot more work needs to be done i'll give you a second example the second example is in battery electric vehicles so here too there's been very substantial um there's been very substantial demand pull uh policies that have been trying to stimulate uh production and consumption um you can and essentially what you see here the main driver of battery electric vehicle cost is the battery cost and essentially what you see here i've plotted a frontier which is marginal uh which is um the range on the x-axis and the price the margin on the y-axis and what you can see is that over time this frontier is marching to the right uh which is to say you're driving more for you're driving farther for cheaper and we're now getting to the point that the chevrolet bolt which that's which is my car uh is is really quite a cost-effective vehicle now um there's implicit subsidies behind that because of the subsidies under the cafe standards and also there's probably some plays for market share that are driving sales prices below marginal costs so i think you can't take these literally as l as estimates of marginal cost but it's pretty clear what the pattern is an important driver in this has been subsidies through the um through the uh through the income tax credit into regional which amount to ten thousand dollars at least for me i got ten thousand dollars back when i got my bolt uh so those are substantial subsidies and i think those play a role there's no research at all documenting that i think that this would in terms of like getting the supply and demand and identification right and i think this is a really great topic to study incredibly important in this area and a final one is wind and you see offshore wind is a market that simply wouldn't exist i mean it simply wouldn't exist if it weren't for like crazy policies that required you to go buy this expensive thing and what's happened is we've seen that the wind towers have gotten bigger and bigger they've gotten more efficient it's gotten cheaper to install them and the price has gotten down have gone down and down and down over time to the point that they're almost cost effective a slide i don't have is a big failure which is second generation biofuels the policy there the renewable fuel standard failed to give failed to give reliable support and uh and i think we can learn a lot from that policy i studied that policy in considerable detail uh but i'm not and i'm not going to go in i'm not going to go into it here okay so let me just make a final comment here um so i think my my my so if we think about now what what's the revealed preference among politicians so doing a little tiny bit of positive political economy we've actually had substantial programs that have pushed these major technological things forward we aren't able to have a carbon price i don't see a carbon price on the horizon we've tried two times to get a carbon price once through waxman markey a second time through the clean power plan for that sector both of those have failed there's substantial pushback so just from a political economy perspective the the programs that seem to be the most effective and that politicians are willing to support are these technology pushing programs i think we cannot underestimate these political economy considerations so um multiple there's a substantial vested interest in existing capital to not see success in this area multiple large oil companies including exxon and bp officially endorse a carbon tax yet those companies combine teamed with other companies to spend 30 million dollars to defeat the recent washington state carbon tax initiative i mentioned that a key reason for the failure of the renewable fuel standard to develop second generation low ghg biofuels was its programmatic uncertainty well that programmatic uncertainty to no little extent was due to ongoing litigation and lobbying by by the refinery industry so this isn't this isn't surprising but understanding it is important to assess what climate policies might be feasible going forward so let me just conclude by saying that from my perspective the most important papers in the environmental economics literature are actually by macroeconomist one of whom is leaving right now and who are not really and who are not really in the environmental economics field there's a lot more work to do policy is moving quickly and improving our understanding of the design and effect of technology pushing policies in this area could have a really big payoff
