basically let me just give a very brief overview of what what the ideas are obviously from the uh from the title of the paper what we want to do is say something about the uh the great gatsby curve in other words this uh this politically uh salient and uh i think uh uh substantively interesting observation that uh there seems to be a relation that argument there's gonna be some positive relationship between measures of uh cross-sexual inequality and measures of intergenerational persistence uh the the argument of paper essentially is going to be that there were reasons to believe that gatsby-like behavior are a component of of the american economic experience and and so in that sense what will distinguish this paper from the conventional discussions of the gatsby currently some of them is that our focus is on an intertemporal gatsby curve in other words you look within one country and make an observation that changes in inequality will have particular consequences for for intergenerational mobility uh in thinking that way we will emphasize first of all the argument that there's a causal relation right i actually i have a five year moral term in the word causal given problems in econometrics there is a mechanism that maps trend across sexual inequality to uh to mobility and and i'll delineate both uh a a very stylized theoretical model and and some facts that hopefully are suggested by that all right now really the argument the papers is going to be quite simple in terms of what what the mechanism story is going to be and that is that it's going to take an explicitly social perspective on on on the international transmission process which is not to say families don't matter but rather to add it at a piece to it and so the thought experiment in the paper is just think about environments in which there's some set of ways in which we model across sexual inequality and then ask what happens as the tails fatten out so to speak and the mechanism is going to be that as in cross-sectional inequality increases certain types of segregation in the economy are enhanced and so the focus and the uh the twine model is neighborhoods and there the idea would be no deeper than saying if you spread out the distribution of incomes one sees enhanced segregation of uh of uh neighborhoods by income and so once you want to build that into the model you can see immediately you get a gat sweep like behavior you increase cross-sectional inequality the consequence is going to be increased segregation and once you have increased segregation one has increased disparities in the factors the influences on flowing children versus lesser-known children once you put those together you have a slowdown of of the conventional measures of mobility and so by implication the gatsby curve emerges as an equilibrium from this mechanism in which inequality begets segregation segregation begets immobility all right now in saying that um i want to make a couple of comments the first is that it's taking ideas in some sense uh uh it's fortuitous that this was in the paper before the identity of the discussion was revealed and that is that the serious point is that you know roland in particular pioneered many of these ideas in the 1990s in terms of trying to understand how different types of social influences social interaction spillover effects lead to implications for degrees of segregation and so it's it's drawing on an older theoretical literature and and there's a background there the second comment i want to observe is even though the discussion in the paper will largely focus certainly in the theory entirely in the empirics largely on issues of income segregation and neighborhoods the general idea is broader in other words that if we think about many facets of the economy be it neighborhoods be it schools new colleges uh be affirms changes in inequality will can will under plausible theoretical uh conditions and uh with associated empirical evidence that's reasonable enhance segregation and hence become a mechanism by which uh persistence is enhanced so in other words one could tell an analogous story for changes in the degree of sort of matching of students to colleges uh skill levels to firms etc and so i have some work called that the memberships theory of inequality all right so what the the way that the uh the paper proceeds is first there's a toy model that's supposed to his entire purpose is to sort of give theoretical coherence to certain claims and then three pieces of evidence or three dimensions of evidence were put on the table the first uh uh were very broad empirical facts they're consistent with this vision of increased inequality increased segregation decreased mobility and so that's going to be drawing from different parts of literature everything from the work of uh chevy hendren co-authors to uh uh to uh you know findings in the sociology literature that's gonna be one set of exercises i'm gonna call those big picture facts consistent with the theory i was told i'm not allowed to call them stylized facts by one of the editors but the second the second so that's going to be one dimension of empirical evidence the second dimension of empirical evidence will be some some intergenerational mobility regressions in other words looks uh models you know standard regressions uh that estimated in general last gen inter-generalist yeah can't talk anymore it really was a long flight intergenerational elasticity of income in which uh certain non-linearities are allowed to occur and certain uh neighborhood type effects are allowed to occur and then ask the question one is there some empirical evidence supportive of the the mechanisms of the theory focuses on and second what are the implied gatsby curves from those types of uh of exercises and so there there'll be some evidence not wonderful evidence but some evidence of gatsby-like uh behavior then the final part of the uh the empirical pieces is going to be a calibration exercise which uh will take a structural model of neighborhood effects and human capital formation will be it will be in a rich model and sensibly multiple time periods of life etc and sequential choices by both parents and individuals in human capital formation and again go through an exercise asking if you take this environment calibrated uh some of the parameters estimate other parameters and run counter factuals on inequality what will be the implications for the gasket curve and the upshot of the empirical work of at least flavors three and four will be we have modest evidence of a gatsby curve and in other words uh the claim that this is going to explain the full uh of a 0.15 changing or generally elasticity would be false unfortunately but the state it explains 15 might be a possible statement okay so by way of the background of the theory the way that we want to think about this gatsby notion is that we have some transmission process from parents to offspring that's just a stochastic process and once you have a stochastic process you can ask questions such as what if you change the variance of one of the inputs of the process in this case parental income and see what the consequences are for the associated measures of intergenerational ability and so thinking about it this way obviously the standard model in the literature is the linear model if you regress offspring income a parental income and offspring income and if i thought that the variance or some function of the variance of income is the notion of cross-sectional inequality and i treated the intergenerational elasticity the ig beta as the measure of persistence there's no gatsby curve other words the whole point is that this type of exercise taught a logically treats uh has an object that is invariant with respect to changes in parental income and so in thinking about the paper and the observation of the gatsby curve these are statements that say that you have different cases where i see a variance of parental income or some function of the variance i have measured the ige i'm getting a relationship between them and just as a trivial statistical matter what's going to be happening in the generalized models is that the argument is that the first equation which generates the mobility measure is misspecified once one accounts for certain richnesses in the process of uh the transmission of parental socioeconomic status offspring and so a general way to write that is simply to say that the coefficient itself beta is not an invariant but it depends on things a trivial way to make it depend on things is it depends on parental income in other words the actual process is a non-linear process a different way to think about it is that it could be that it's non-linear and that there's other variables that are that are intermediate intermediaries between the parental income and the offspring income and obviously the philosophy of the paper so to speak is an argument that the social factors help mediate those relationships and so the upshot is that any any affirmative argument about the nature of the gatsby curve at least from the vantage point of trying to explain why variance of of of parental income is our variances of income and mapping into interdirectional mobility is really from the perspective of the underlying statistical analyses a statement that the conventional way of measuring mobility has some misspecification in it and that's the thing we need to somehow tease out in the analysis all right so what i want to say is that the model we're going to present is not it's uh it's just derivative from from from older stuff and what it's really going to do is it's going to take the becker tomes model and in certain ways uh make create a social analog to it and so what i mean by that is it and you know there's a bunch of algebra which leads to very little in terms of that's absolutely surprising but the way this environment is going to be set up is the following and that is that you have these adult labor market outcomes that's going to be offspring income that are going to be determined by human capital that's uh that's accumulated earlier in life or i can call it skills if we want to be a little bit more corrupt so that's a triviality the second point is that the human capital accumulation in this model is going to be socially determined and what i mean by that is that i'm thinking about the environment individuals are raised in objects called neighborhoods which will be equivalent to school districts and so in this thought experiment it isn't a matter of thinking about independent dynasties of like a character becker tomes in which there's some transmission directly from parents to offspring via a parental investment or rather parental incomes are going to determine the neighborhoods that individuals grow up in or put differently the schools that they attend and so the model will have built into it by assumption two mechanisms that map the distribution of incomes in a neighborhood to offspring educational attainment one of them will simply be the local they will be local finance of education of course that's an artifice of american political economy which has been praised uh at lunchtime earlier and then the second comment idea will be they'll be built into it direct social interactions and so the model itself will be a black box in terms of saying that there's a mapping from the characteristics of the parents of the uh within a community and the and the consequences for children but there's of course associated with that a deeper uh micro micro literature micro theoretical literature on the mechanisms that's going to be the thought experiment and so once that's true there's going to be incentives in the model the way that the assumption you know we think about things either exhibiting complementarities or something uh being increasing in certain arguments for parents to prefer more successful more affluent neighbors all right in other words i want better quote-unquote more desirable role models for my children i want a more affluent parents to tax so on and so forth at the same time there will be incentives by assumption of the model for larger communities and so the upshot in the model is going to be that the equilibrium degree of segregation is a function of the interplay between incentives for high-income neighbors and sentinel centers for many neighbors and cisco and so again it's kind of rigged the models rigged to have that in it and so one automatically gets the result that as income inequality spreads out we get increased segregation uh neighborhood by neighborhood once that happens we get this mapping from inequality to uh to persistence and so the model itself will have some very stark features to it in the sense that uh it's going to be built into a groin environment in other words incomes are growing across time and we can get you know the model at least in principle can generate things such as permanent decoupling of subsets of the population from one another those are obviously stylized exaggerations but the upshot is one that the model at least formalizes the idea that one can move from an environment in which their social determinant of a determination of skills in education to segregation is the intermediary between parental income and offspring income and hence gatsby-like behavior now let me just say that this is not a unique way to set the model up there's in fact two other you know sets of models that could do exactly the same thing one of them is due to casing mulligan and so these would be models that are family investment models and once you build in things like credit constraints i can automatically get a non-linear relationship between parental income and offspring income and generate gas behavior often non-linearity the second set of models would be things that becker commoners murphy and spencer spence have worked on and there what they do is they introduce a heterogeneity in the ige coefficient this has to do with the level of parental human capital so the idea is the parents that are highly educated their investments and their children are more are more productive than than otherwise and so there's not a uniqueness in other words between taking an overlapping generations model building in certain types of mechanisms that deviate from becker tomes and mapping that into gatsby-like equilibrium all right there's a very long model i don't think it's interesting so i'm going to skip all of that and i just want to give two propositions at the end of the paper the two propositions of interest are what i'm calling the decoupling proposition and that is that in this environment in which essentially what's going to be happening is you have uh you have families all exhibiting positive income growth that might be smaller maybe large in essence what can happen in the model is it's positive for permanent inequalities to emerge and what that means is if you get sufficient inequality at a point in time there's a positive probability that the incomes of the descendants of the highest income family and the descendants of the lowest income family they never converge the trick essentially is that in these growing economies there's this space for permanent inequalities generationally to emerge that you simply don't have in stationary environments stationary environment almost all the probability is going to be in this com is going to be in this nice bounded set so eventually when you trace the dynasties of over time they're going to crisscross that's right that's the intuition to the convergence results in stationary environments those break down in the growing environments the second theorem is maybe the lamest theorem ever at least i've ever written that may be saying a lot and that is that the model can generate an a an air temporal uh generational great gas speed curve and what i mean by that what we mean by that is that there are configurations of parental income such that you spread the income out you will get monotonically an increase in an estimated inter-generally intergenerational elasticity of income now the reasons for that are twofold one once the ig coefficients are differing across neighborhoods that means that we no longer it actually matters with the distributions of the families relative to those ig coefficients or they spread things out and get new answers that's mechanism one mechanism two is the ig coefficients themselves change because it's changes in segregation as i spread out the parental incomes so those two mechanisms can generate the gatsby curve however i want to be clear that does not logically that's not logically entailed and so the point is the ige coefficient in something such as the variance of income those are very radical dimension reductions of the actual high dimensional stochastic process of these family dynasties and so one can construct particular distributions of incomes of parents where you don't get the gathered phenomena even though kind of the model has been rigged to generate the potential for gatsby via this heterogeneity and the coefficients and so i just want that on the table that the the the theorem is weak because the dimension reduction necessary to talk about a gastric curve is quite draconian all right so that's what i want all i want to say about the uh about the uh the theory itself now what do i mean by evidence in favor of the proposition how am i doing on time besides poorly five minutes i'm sure 15 minutes thank you okay so there's three propositions i want to put on the table in terms of the evidence the first proposition is there actually is some evidence of energy of a gastric curve and what i mean by that is if you look at the inner temporal gasping curve and so if you take work for example that bash mazam dar uh what he and ko and daniel erinson and other co-ops have been able to do is establish things such as that there's some relationship between the 90 10 wage ratio and changes in measures of persistence across time and so what the paper does is it uh basically reproduces some of the thought experiments in the mezumdar type work all of which are direct suggestions of a gatsby curve and so i'm just going to skip those very quickly the second thing i want to say i think you've done a really poor job of putting these slides together the the the second thing yeah this is really uh i'm glad my co-author's not here because he would really mock me all right the second comment the second comment which i actually omitted from the slides i apologize is that there is a nexus between location mobility and inequality and that was really just the statement of the what the chetty famous chatty diagram tells us which is that if you look across the united states there's something spatial about changes in in mobility so um that's the second sterilized fact the third one is that income segregation is pervasive and growing so in other words what chatting all do is they say there's something about space what i want to say is something about segregation and so examples of that would be the spatial distribution of poverty rates another example would be what i might call the fractal nature of income segregation to steal a line from a famous new york times columnist and as we look at an individual city for example sister chicago you see this hyper segregation by income so in other these different levels there's very substantial segregation what is a particular interest for this paper is work by uh sean reardon at stanford who has looked at the dynamics of income segregation across neighborhoods and finds interestingly that income segregation is increasing the united states over the last several decades even though racial segregation is decreasing and so the argument that these income type mechanisms are important and are via contemporary inequality growing is is is something that comes out of the real world all right now i can push this harder and make observations if we look at senses the the census tract income uh measures over time once again we see this uh increase in uh in the variance across neighborhoods and we see similar things at the state level fourth thing i want to say is that there is spatial heterogeneity associated with the factors that matter for human capital formation for skills formations if you think about the picture i have in my head is i have income that's creating segregation of neighborhoods but the issue is what the consequences of that are for actual skill formation human capital formation here there's two things i want to put on the table one of them is as you well known by everybody in this room very substantial spatial variation in per capita public school expenditure across school districts i will add parenthetically this does not adjust for what the money is spent on and so there's a literature of course on whether or not money matters and i think the upshot of the literature is very simple i think it matters we spend it on stuff that's relevant for education and so leaving so this so this is the least primary fashion evidence of the mechanisms we talk about uh you say the similar thing again what i call the fractal structure you look within a notorious egalitarian state and even there you see very high levels of differences in per pupil expenditure final comment i wanted to make was that if you think about social interactions in the role of segregation one of the examples of social influences which where the evidence is extremely robust is the adverse effects this won't come as a shock of exposure to violence on learning and so enormous heterogeneity and exposure to violent crime the distribution of murder rates in chicago is uh you know just simply a simple example of that so upshot of that is you sort of think about the pieces that went into the theoretical model in a very big picture sense i i i can one can pull out evidence that these phenomena are are exists second thing we do in the paper as i said was we run sets of ige regressions and the way that to think about these these experiments is we first think about some non-parametric models then we think about um some some let me see some parametric models the distinction is that the non-parametric model doesn't say is non-linearity of the source of the gatsby group nothing new to say the parametric models are introducing in a structured way obviously with loss of generality neighborhood as in census tract and state measures of them of uh the district of characters of income first and second moments and asking to please tell us something about the ig process okay sorry how about oh yeah i'm just going to take two minutes all right okay i'm just gonna skip uh everything just to say the only question you might want to ask is can these things generate the gatsby yes i okay we present tables and evidence these neighborhood effects matter state effects matter so on and so on state income matters what one can then do is actually take these equations and by implication ask what what what is the gatsby curve that the stochastic process that we estimated look like and so if you look at the non-linearities in the ig process we get the opposite of a gas speed curve in other words the gas material is supposed to be upward sloping that's a positive relationship it turns out that non-parametric uh estimates themselves would not give us that phenomenon in contrast if you looked at the uh the uh the the census tract behavior we get mild i should say gentle curves in other words if you look at the particular non-linearities not in the non-parametric family sense but the nonlinear as built in by dependence of the transmission process on the census tract characteristics we get the phenomena that we were looking for all right so when we go through a set of exercises of that type as i said i think of that as gentle evidence now gentlemen it's reasonable evidence there's not some smoking gun but the gun is not it's not stone cold the final thing we do is go through a fairly uh elaborate calibration exercise which i will just show you one result as i guess you know i i i'm a graduate of the james heckman school of slimes all right so okay the only point's the following and that is you take this calibrated model you go through uh the full analysis of the model at the end you can ask questions such as what happens if you were to expand the variance of parental income and the answer is that as you go across a different levels of parental income you start with the baseline variance you increase the standard deviation by 10 20 we get we get about a a two percent change in ige in other words it goes from point three five to point three seven that sounds very modest but remember you gotta mentorize things correctly and that is all of the action on the big change in mobility is point one five so we get we're getting something about 10 uh 10 to 15 percent of what is the object that's been interested of interest in terms of decreased mobility so upshot is uh i think that there's plot we tried to identify plasma conditions for a gatsby curve i think that we were able to provide some modest i said moderate maybe models is a better word evidence of that and then what we do in the conclusion which i will skip is gibson policy uh speculation so let me leave it to that thank you
