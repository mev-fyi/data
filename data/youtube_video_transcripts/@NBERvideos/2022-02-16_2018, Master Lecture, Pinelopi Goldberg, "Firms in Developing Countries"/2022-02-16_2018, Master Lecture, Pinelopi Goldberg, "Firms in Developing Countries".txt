so let me start with um giving you a short justification for the topic of my talk so a short motivation if you want uh so as duncan mentioned on the first day of the meetings uh i have agreed to take the position of the chief economist of the world bank and but i agreed to give this talk before i knew about the position at the world bank and ever since i took the position at the world bank everyone has been asking me what my plans are and what the world bank intends to do and i suspect that there's a lot of interest in this question in this audience as well and i'm afraid if that's the case i'm going to disappoint you because uh first i haven't started yet i'm not starting until the fall and so there are many things i don't know yet um and the things i do know i'm not at liberty to discuss uh so by the way i should i should say i should start with a disclaimer that whatever i say here does not represent the views of the world bank that said i do know some things that i can share and you know what i'm going to say now is is public information and one of these pieces of public information is that the latest focus of the world bank is on people so for the past two years the world bank has been engaging in the so-called human capital project and the idea there is to invest in people so the the motivation of the world bank is as follows so there is this thinking that governments and policy makers are very interested in investing in physical infrastructure partly because this is something that you can show and partly this is something where you can see in the short run you can see the returns so people are willing to invest in bridges and roads and so on and of course physical infrastructure is very important but sometimes there is less willingness to invest in people because the returns may occur over the long run and so they are less visible and so the the point of the human capital project is to induce governments to invest in people and what people have in mind by that is invest in health and education and of course i think this is wonderful i think most of us think that because human capital is an end in itself so we would would be in favor of that independent of questions regarding growth and development but also from a purely academic point of view i think one reason this is great is there's so much work in development on health and education so i've always thought of development as you know i came from the trade side i always thought of development as being a people-focused field you know there's a lot of work focusing on the decisions microwork focusing on the decisions of people of individuals now one might say this is partly because in many developing countries there is hardly a distinction between individuals and firms and that will come to that later in this talk but at any rate this is a very people-focused uh field so you know i think this is this is a great opportunity for uh you know synergies between the focus of the world bank and research so i can i can actually advertise that right now uh but that said i think there is a risk that while we are pushing this people-focused agenda we sort of forget that people don't really live in a vacuum uh in order for people to deploy their human capital uh they need to operate within proper institutions and proper markets so people offer usually at least in developing in developed countries they offer their services within firms they exchange both labor services and products in markets and general institutions are of the country in which they live are very important for their well-being now in development there has been plenty of work on institutions it's not clear that we always know what the best policy prescriptions are that come out of this work so yesterday for example we saw but yesterday we saw a paper in liberia for example that that's specifically the question how do you deal with cases where you have to provide services important services like education in cases where the institutions are weak so there's a lot of interest in institutions my claim is that relative to the work that has been done on institutions and on individuals on health and education and so on there is relatively little work in development on firms and markets with few exceptions and i should stay i should say right at the outset that the emphasis here when i make this statement the emphasis is on the work relatively there is of course work on firms or rather i should say farms in many cases in development and there are many people in this room who have worked on firms so we saw a paper for example yesterday by kaivan uh and dilip and and other kotors on on firms and you know there is work by i cannot see everyone here there is work by david or eric hogan or uh you know chris woodruff and many other people in this room there there is work on firms but again compared to the number of studies we have on health and education i think there is relatively very little on firms in developing countries and whatever there is in this area tends to come mostly from trade or macro so it's a more macro perspective if you want than the micro perspective that developing economies adopt when they address other questions so um with that in mind i want to talk a little bit about the opportunities i see for doing research that's firm focused i think there are many interesting questions uh when it comes to firms and development and that have not been addressed yet and uh i would like to to uh talk about them uh here in the hope that this will encourage several of you to either do research in this either to start researching this area or to continue the research you are doing okay so this was a somewhat long-winded introduction of why i wanted to talk about this topic so now let me delve into that and tell you what i'm going to talk about specifically so one question you may want to ask is you know why is it worth studying firms in developing countries specifically so what makes them different of course i think one message that comes out of the development literature and i think this is i don't have to try very hard to sell it here is that its context uh deserve deserves its own attention it's its country and its setting tends to be different and that definitely applies to firms and markets but still there are some commonalities some common elements that apply to many settings across many countries and the first one is that in many developing countries we see a very large share of small inefficient and informal firms there is some work on this topic and if you want to read more if you want to read overviews there are two excellent papers on this topic by shane tolkien and laporte and schleifer in the same for you side by side uh in the journal of economic perspectives in 2014 just to give you an idea so i took this graph from ben's paper i hope he doesn't mind but this you know even if you see this graph from afar it can give you some sense of what we are talking about here so each row in the graph represents a different country india is the top row indonesia the middle row and mexico so these are three very different countries in different stages of development and what the graphs represent is the firm size distribution as measured by the numbers of workers so if you look at the first column this uh it shows the uh firm size distribution for firms that have employee employment sizes between 0 and 200. ben and um enchanted they they group the firms into beans that have 10 workers each and as you can see you know from the first column there is almost everyone is in the first you know in the first bin uh zero to ten workers to get a better idea of what is going on also they show different cuts of the data so the second column uh has all firms with 10 between 10 and 200 employees the third one 20 to 200 and so on so the last one is uh is 200 to 2000. and you can see that pretty much uh in all of these countries most firms are have have very small employment sizes between zero and ten okay so i think this is a a an indisputed fact in many uh in many contexts in developing countries that despite having this huge mass at the low end of employment size there are still pockets of market power in many developing countries and um some examples of of this pocket so i'm going to talk about those later today are seven monopolies in africa uh and then there are various cartels in many important markets for example food markets sugar is a is a classic example but also in fertilizer and inputs agri inputs in services especially telecommunications and transportation and also in pharmaceuticals so these are all sectors that are important to an economy a developing economy but in many cases they are especially important to the poor so when i make this statement i would like to say you know right at the outset i'm not making any statement here about duality and again i'll talk about this in a moment the second statement is just a statement about pricing power of firms so it's not a statement about the the firm size distribution okay so the first issue so the fact that we see so many small and inefficient firms most of them informal has received a lot of attention lately mostly gained from macroeconomists and this is partly because the positivity of big firms is considered to be a big impediment to development um but because there's there has been so much focus on on the first issue the second issue tends to get completely forgotten of course there is no reason that the presence of a lot of small firms should preclude the emergence of monopolies you just need one firm for a monopoly you just need one big uh seller right so so there is nothing you know logically inconsistent with seeing these two things side by side but but intuitively when you are preoccupied with trying to explain when you have this mass of small inefficient firms you just don't worry about market power and i think that's the attitude with which many economies approach these developing countries uh uh so partly it has to you know to do that the expectation is uh is formed by um this um this this work on these small inefficient firms but i think partly the this this uh neglect of of market power and and um and uh the power that big firms have arises from a very particular view of development that is known as the dual view of development the dual view simply put states that there is a strict separation between small inefficient firms that serve specific markets in developing countries these markets are completely segmented from other markets that are served from big efficient firms these big efficient firms by the way also serve export markets and these two sets of firms are completely separate they don't compete with each other so the small firms never challenge the big ones and because they never compete with each other directly they're irrelevant to each other's existence so then you know there's no uh reason to consider them within the same framework with the same within the same literature um so so i think you know this operation in in research reflects a certain extent also this this dual view of development so uh the reason i decided to to talk about both in this uh you know in this talk is that i despite the fact that in in research to the extent that there is any research on the second issue they're they're considered completely separately there is a common link from a policy point of view between the two uh and this is a link you are often exposed to as a trade economist and the link is that very often people propose the same solution to both issues so to the extent that you think these small inefficient firms are a problem and the solution is called free trade okay deregulation and trade liberalization so specifically it's positive that the lift deregulation so the lifting of entry restrictions and regulations can help small firms become bigger so it can promote growth and efficiency at the same time free trade trade liberalization uh increases competition so it's going to drive out the small and inefficient firms and shift resources in an economy from the small firms to the big firms okay so that would solve the informality problem or the inefficiency problem if you want at the same time trade might also solve the the market power issue i should add that in many developing countries uh the the monopoly the the market power i talked about is associated with state monopolies so then the idea is if you open up these economies to foreign trade imports are going to expose the states to more competition and drive prices down so then free trade is going to not only lead to growth to small domestic firms but also contain the market power of the very big firms uh by the way i should hear i talked about state monopolies uh i should that you don't really need a huge firm to have market power there's also collusion right so you can have many medium-sized players who collude and that's an issue in many developing countries so trade is viewed as the solution to both of them and one thing you often hear is do we need in the context of developing countries this is something that's never actually this question is never asked in the context of developed countries is do we need competition policy in the first place or is trade policy sufficient and there is a actually a sizable fraction of developing economies who think competition policy in developing countries is completely superfluous free trade is going to do the job okay so um in this talk what i'm going to do is i'm going to talk about these two issues and for the most part i'm going to talk about these two issues separately and again this reflects the fact that they've been so far they've been approached by completely different literatures but periodically i will come back to the question of whether both issues both problems can be addressed through deregulation and trade liberalization so this is the the common link between the two so you can think of this talk as having two parts um part one is going to consider the small and inefficient and part two is going to be about the big and powerful okay okay so let me start with the first one uh the small and inefficient okay so it's fair to say that i think that there is consensus in the literature the developing countries are dominated by small firms i just showed you the graph by chiang tai and ben and these graphs are replicated for many other settings on top of that most of these firms are informal um meaning they're not registered with um with a government and they don't pay taxes and you know for for discussions of informality gabriel luisa has two very nice papers one in the journal of development economics one in the ar and la porta and schleifer in the jp paper i just mentioned they also explicitly talk about the importance of informality for many developing countries so one natural question to ask is why don't these firms grow why don't they become bigger and so one answer that comes immediately to mind is because in many developing countries there are policies that favor the small businesses so the country that comes immediately to mind is india that for a very long time has had policies that favor small or medium-sized enterprises including uh having product reservations so certain products could be were reserved for production by by small firms only so it's very clear that such policies would contribute to the growth of small firms however you also see them in settings where you don't have such policies or whether these policies are not so strong and let me again borrow a graph from another paper so this is borrowed from laporte and schleifer from their jpe paper and there what they show is the the gdp per capita on the horizontal axis you know in purchasing power parity and then on the vertical axis you have the percent of the labor force that's self-employed now self-employed you can think of this as being a proxy for informality uh you can see that there is a very clear negative correlation uh between the two and that uh so in the context of what i just said uh the main message is that the best predictor of why um you know in a correlation sense the best predictor of uh of the share of informality is the per capita income so it doesn't really matter what policies the what particular policies regarding small small size enterprises the various countries have uh some people go a little bit further in interpreting this graph also in a causal way namely that all you need to eliminate informality is to to promote growth and then these firms are going to disappear automatically and this is just to be clear this is not the message that i want to send by this graph but i do think it shows that there is a very very strong negative correlation between per capita income and informality okay so it doesn't seem to be driven by by just policies favoring these uh these enterprises alone so that raises you know several questions so we're back to the question so what why don't these firms grow um and is this a problem in the first place uh and what i mean by problem is are these firms really the reason or are they an impending growth so do they uh constrain a country's capacity to grow and if so why do they persist so what prevents firms from growing and finally you know if you believe the answer to the second question is yes that also raises the question what are the appropriate policies to promote growth and efficiency okay so let me start with the first question are these small firms less efficient and um the answer to this question is actually not as clear-cut as one may think so the the literature on these issues is quite mixed and the let me mention two papers that that uh take the view that these inefficiencies are perhaps not as large as people sometimes think the first paper is by jim tybalt in the journal of economic literature in 2000 so this is you know long time ago and a lot of things have changed in developing countries since then uh but still i think jim's perspective is quite interesting there so jim gives the answer no so despite what people think you may have the small firms they're small but they're not necessarily inefficient and he provides three arguments of why this is the case so the the first is the first claims is there is no evidence that firm productivity is more dispersed in developing countries than in developed countries uh the second piece of evidence is that there is no evidence if you try to actually measure efficiency by looking at productivity in most cases this is just labor productivity but in some cases people also have measures of revenue productivity there is no evidence that small firms are inefficient and finally you know he makes the statement that small firms operate at the optimal scale given the markets they serve so you know the essence of his argument is the following so first of all why does he say that small firms are not inefficient so for them to be inefficient one would have to assume that economies of scale are important so the the size is really preventing these firms of taking advantage of economies of scale and so talk thaibout mentions various estimates in the literature that do find economies of scale in several industries but these economies of scale are very modest so it's very hard to argue that these economies of scale are substantial and they would make a big difference in firm's efficiency moreover uh he points out that and that's that's where this dual view of development becomes important he points out that most of these very small firms operate uh in markets that are very small and completely segmented from the bigger markets that big firms serve many developing countries are not urbanized uh that's still the case so you have many people living in small rural communities um there are in villages uh there there is no scope for for scale economies there is uh the production is very small to start with most of them buy basic goods so food basic apparel and textiles and you don't need fancy technologies to produce these goods you produce them with very basic technologies where economies of scale are completely irrelevant so the whole point of you know his whole point can be summarized as for the kind of markets these firms serve economies of scale uh have no relevance i think that okay so andy's here so she can call me out if he doesn't agree i think it's to a certain extent a similar sentiment is echoed in a recent study by foster and rosenstrike that focuses on farms not firms and here the a is capitalized on purpose so they focus on farms not firms but the issues are very similar and i think that they also make the point that farms tend to be efficient when they are very small you know at that scale they're actually they operate just fine usually just the you know the the the farmer himself or herself uh who does the work and and uh uh they operate at the optimal scale given the scale of production uh then there is a you know that come that comes the middle and that's where the problem is because there the mid-size firms don't don't take advantage of economies of scaling then you have the very big farms that are again efficient so they see the problem in the middle but not in the in the tails of the distribution uh so so there is there is a view in the literature um that that small doesn't necessarily mean inefficient so that's one view the second view is that that small firms do imply inefficiencies and i think there has been plenty of work uh uh in recent years on that theme uh so the first paper that comes immediately to mind is by the the paper by shane clino on misallocation and the follow-up literature um so you know first they document in contrast to what jim tybel showed they do document higher productivity dispersion in developing countries uh now the sources of this productivity can be numerous and that is something people have pointed out but nevertheless you know jim himself jim tybaud based his conclusion on the fact that he couldn't document productivity dispersion and it seems there is product uh productivity dispersion um and second they also document that the small firms which they do find to be inefficient by measures of labor productivity or revenue productivity uh they never grow when they never die so there is there is no creative destruction in many developing countries some other evidence uh comes from from talking in the jee in the the general economic literature piece and uh i'm sorry general of economic uh perspective piece so that should be a p and not an l and there they compare the average product of capital and labor between small and mid-sized firms and bigger firms now they they're very upfront in pointing out that they they can just look at the average product not the marginal product and for efficiency considerations you want to look at the marginal product but in many cases we wouldn't expect it to be that different and what they find systematically is that the average product of capital and labor tends to actually be lower in small firms than in mid-sized firms so this argus against this view that small firms are actually efficient and finally i think there is some evidence also that comes from some recent work by anne harrison and martin rothenberg that looks at the effects of a 2006 policy change in india that try to relax the constraints that medium-sized firms faced so in the sense that they they relaxed all these policies they changed the policies that applied only to the very small size enterprises in india and they extended them to also bigger enterprises and what they find is that this policy change actually shifted resources market shares from less efficient to more efficient plans uh or firms that again indicates that the firms that were constrained prior to this policy change prior to the reform were if anything they were the medium-sized firms they were they were the bigger firms it was not the small firms that uh that were constrained and finally a third piece of evidence comes from a very large literature in trade on heterogeneous firms and one finding that i think it's it's fair to say is as robust as the gravity equation results in trade is that the bigger firms that the larger firms tend to do everything better and uh including being more efficient now someone would object that so i've made this point several times myself in my own work that when we talk about efficiency here it's efficiency in the revenue sense so all we're saying here is that these firms are more profitable that they perform better but i would say that in the context of this particular discussion which is why do we see these very small firms surviving and not growing to be bigger the relevant metric and the relevant uh variable you want to look at is really revenue productivity right so you really want to know why firms that don't perform well by whatever measure maybe you know it's because they don't charge very high prices maybe it's because they don't they don't produce high quality products whatever the reason is why is it that these firms are not driven out of the market and replaced by better ones and or why is it that those firms who are that actually do a good job that they don't grow to be bigger right so um so you know without without uh i would say this this evidence is very strongly suggestive that uh the smaller firms that again here i'm talking about firms not farms tend to be less efficient than the mid the mid size firms on average there's a separate issue that goes hand in hand with the issue of size and this is the issue of formality now most of these small firms tend to be informal and informality is in general considered to be an anathema to development so most policy makers in developing countries are trying to shut down informal firms and ironically i think this is happening at the at the same time when in some cases in developed countries we're embracing informality if you want you know every time we use a ride sharing app like uber or lyft or you go to airbnb this is in some in some way this is a form of informality you hope this these firms pay taxes but in other ways they share very many common characteristics with informal firms in developing countries most importantly that the workforce doesn't have benefits and they have much more flexibility so this is the important part of the sector it's very flexible and can immediately respond to changing demand conditions so but at any rate so i'm digressing here so so uh no matter how we view informality in developed countries in developing countries uh these these informal firms are considered to be a serious impending growth and this is because they are not just small and small in most people in most cases also implies inefficient but on top of that they don't pay taxes and what this means is they also constrain state capacity and the provision of public goods right on top of that the workers who are informal so there is a distinction here between firms and workers you can in some cases in developing countries and again gabrielle has worked on that you can have formal firms that employ workers informally uh and uh it's been shown that workers in these informal firms have no security they have no benefits uh they can be fired anytime so if you think that people are risk averse this is an additional cost to them so when it comes to to these informal firms there there are three main views in the literature and again these are very nicely summarized in gabrielle's paper uh the first view is that these firms are survivals uh what i mean by that is that there are these are the the firms i talked about before they are small and inefficient and for them informality is a means of survival and actually the only reason they can survive is precisely because they are informal and they don't pay taxes and this corresponds exactly to the dual view of development and informality so you have these firms they operate in this segment of the market low quality goods invisible to the government small inefficient uh but but somehow they managed to survive by invading taxes then there is a second view that i will call the mckinsey view actually again this comes this this is not my term this this is used in the literature and this is because it's based on a mckinsey report that found that informal firms could actually in many instances uh they could break even as formal firms uh they could actually make profits but still their profits are much bigger if they don't formalize and they don't pay taxes so they choose not to pay taxes in order to to make higher profits free riding on everyone else and so that's why they're called parasites and then there is the third view that i will call romantic view and the romantic view is that this informal firms are really held back entrepreneurs so some of these informal firms tend to be good firms having entrepreneurs who are talented and they would formalize if they did not face high scores high costs of formalization and what people usually have in mind when they call when they talk about cause of formalization because of entry and cost of registration of registering uh the business so uh which of this view is supported by the data is actually quite important because each view has very different implications of how you deal with informality so let me you know summarize some views and some related evidence so if you read the la porta and schleifer paper in the jp there answer is uh it's absolutely clear that most of these firms are survivors um and that corresponds to the dual view of development just to give you an idea what this uh view is based on this is the graph they show in their paper so this this graph uh shows the ratio of the value added by informal firms relative to the value added by formal firms and this is without conditioning on size but if you condition size you get pretty much the same picture simply because most firms are small to start with so it doesn't make much of a difference and you can see that this number is very very small right so for congo it's a 0.01 so it's really a tiny number the median is 0.15 okay so so uh informal firms are orders of magnitude less productive than informal for than formal firms and that that of course is just a graph but yeah in their view this is evidence that um that these are two separate these are two completely different markets and there is no question that these these survival firms could never compete with the firms that are formal uh she and all can have a much more nuanced uh answer i think they they they state that no view is entirely supported by the data it's true that this there are many firms that have the survival characteristics uh they're much less efficient and their their investigation of the of the average uh product of capital and labor supports that there are many firms that are inefficient small and inefficient but at the same time you know there's also very little evidence that bigger firms are constrained by by regulation because they see very little bunching in their data around thresholds around regulatory thresholds so they i think my take away from the paper is that there is evidence that this share of survivors is very large but this is not this does not suggest that this dual view of development is actually valid uh and then there is the the work by gabrielle ulissa who finds for in his study on brazil that all three types actually coexist uh and they just reflect the fact that firms are heterogeneous and each type of firm reacts optimally to the institutional environment they face so let me show you uh you know gabrielle's graphs which i think are very um uh very helpful uh to this debate with the one important caveat they apply to brazil and you know you may worry that brazil is different from congo so this is one thing to keep in mind but nevertheless you know there are also many countries in latin america that are very similar in the rest of the developing world that are very similar to brazil so so these two graphs show the productivity distributions for the informal versus uh formal firms uh so this is value added per worker and this is uh this is revenue and i mean the first the the one thing you can see very clearly no matter how far in the room you see it is that there is overlap in the two distributions so yes it's true that the informal firms tend to be less efficient uh over the distribution is to the left of the distribution of the of the of the formal firms but there is also a range in which these two firms over these two types of firms overlap and this suggests that uh this complete segmentation this dual view of development is not supported by the data so this is uh you know one graph the second graph i find even more interesting and so this will take you know a few minutes to explain so let me let me tell you what this graph shows so first of all what elizae does is he develops a model of firms of firm entry into formal or informal sectors in brazil and estimates it using micro data and then in the end uses this model to perform counter factual simulations what would the you know the the entry patterns look like into the former and informal sector if one change for example the entry and registration costs or if one changed other policies regarding information in these developing countries and then she uses this counterfactuals to characterize these three types of firms so what this graph shows is the following so on the vertical axis you have the firm's uh value function net of entry costs so you and then on on the horizontal axis you have a firm's productivity productivity so forget the pre-productivity signal for now so uh the firms face the decision whether to enter in the market in the first place and if they enter whether to enter as formal firms or informal firms right so for the firms to enter first you want the value function to be above zero so the red line represents the value function for the informal firms and so informal firms uh you know have values above zero and then for the formal firms the value functions are shown in black so first look at the solid line so this is the baseline scenario so um you know all firms that have so for for a firm to enter the formal sector it has to be the case that its value as a formal firm is higher than its value as informal firm right uh so this is the solid line and then what he does is these are the baseline scenarios he considers the case where one policies would reduce the entry cost to the to the formal sector through let's say through getting rid of registration costs so that the entry costs into the formal sector are exactly the same as the entry cost into the informal sector okay so this would make you know the entry decision uh between the two sectors very similar and then he calculates what the value function of firms would be in that case and this is this dotted line here so then you know you can use these three lines to characterize the three types of firms so let me walk you through that so first you have a range um where even if you reduce the the registration costs so right so even if you make it very cheap for firms to enter the formal sector still these firms cannot make profit in the formal sector so this is this line here this broken line here so these are the firms that can only exist as informal firms so if they remain informal that's the the red line here then they make positive profits they can operate on the market but if there are formal firms even if you uh if if they don't face registration cost if they don't face entry costs they stay out of the market so these are the survivals okay this and in the terminology used in this literature and he finds that the survivors are approximately 40 49 of of his sample then there are these firms let me go to the other extreme there are these firms in this range here and these are firms where in the status quo are informal why are they informal because the red line is above the black solid line right so it's you make more profit you make more money uh by being informal however if you got rid of the registration costs if you made the entry cheaper for these firms then these firms would actually operate as formal firms and this represents the romantic view that these firms are held back by regulatory costs by registration costs so if you just reimburse them for this if you just got rid of these registration costs these firms would enter the formal sector this is the shortest view on peru and it turns out the percentage of firms who fall into this category at least in brazil is only nine percent okay and then there is this middle range here that it's perhaps harder to read but these firms are the firms where in the current status quo uh uh operate as informal firms and so this this is the red segment here and this is because their profits as informal firms are higher that the profits they make as formal firms now suppose you get rid of registration costs and you reduce their entry costs then their profits are going to increase okay they're they're going to be profitable so their value function is above zero it's not that they cannot survive uh but still because they don't pay taxes they're more profitable as informal firms so therefore they will prefer to stay informed so these are the parasites right in the terminology of mckinsey and so on and it turns out these parasites are about 42 in the data okay so the one take away from this figure that actually surprised me is that actually the parasites are quite uh the the the share of the parasites is quite considerable in this setting so you know to summarize what the evidence is across all studies and i i think i uh what i'm going to say is fairly uncontroversial is i think there is the evidence is that the share of survivors is very large you know in gabrielle's case it's about fifty percent uh i wouldn't say it's one hundred percent as uh schlafl and la porta claim but it's a very large percentage uh there is uh also strong evidence that the share of these held back entrepreneurs is very small they exist it's not that they don't exist at all but it's a very small share but there's also some evidence that the share of parasites is very substantial and that's perhaps more surprising okay so what does this imply for policy uh so there are two potential policy responses um to all this um so i would i will group them into two groups domestic and trade because as i told you at the beginning i want to keep uh coming back to the question of whether free trade and opening uh trade liberalizations can actually address many of these issues so in stem in terms of domestic policies you can consider a variety of of policy responses so i just showed you that the parasites at least in our setting in brazil they seem to be quite sizable quite substantial so one obvious response is to force the parasites to formalize and so one way to do that is by stricter enforcement and in fact my first reaction when i saw these graphs is that this is perhaps this is what countries should be doing and this is not something i ever anticipated uh thinking uh so uh this given you know uh the results i showed you this suggests that enforcement structure enforcement would increase efficiency so if your primary objective is to increase the efficiency of the economy it would make sense to um to engage in stricter enforcement for example more inspections this would get rid of the small antenna efficient firms it would shut them down and it would force those firms that can be profitable as formal firms to formalize however it would also eliminate the survivors at very high social and welfare costs so if you are just worried about efficiency that's perhaps perhaps that's the thing to do but if you are also considered if you also consider general welfare uh that that uh maybe not the the first base the first best policy uh second there are many policies that support small businesses so given the results uh suggesting that the small firms are inefficient again to be clear not all small firms are inefficient some of them are not you know some of them do conform to the sort of view that they are held back entrepreneurs but this tends to be a very small fraction uh so if this fraction is very small then all these policies that promote small businesses are not going to achieve much a third possible policy response that actually has been considered and advocated by many is to reduce the entry cost to the formal sectors so in terms of registration so in reduce the registration costs so um if you think that the main issue that a sizable fraction of these firms are parasites as was the case in ulises study of brazil this would this would make a very small difference and in fact his simulation suggests exactly that uh so given that these these firms can make profits um anyway um and their prime their primary motive of remaining formal is to evade taxes getting rid of registration costs makes a small difference so it's interesting that ulysse gets this conclusion through a structural model now it's a structural model that uses a lot of micro data but a very similar conclusion has been reached by at least two experiments i know of uh that two field experiments that try to look explicitly at the effects of easing registration and the first experiment the first of these experiments is actually on brazil which is very nice because it's exactly the same setting as in gabrielle's paper and this is by the andranda henrik and bruno and mckenzie in 2013 and what they did in this first field experiment is they chose a control group and they chose four treatments for informal firms the four treatments were treatment number one just give firms information treatment number two just reimburse them for their registration costs so address the registration cost treatment number three send an inspector to make sure that formality is enforced so policy number three treatment number three was strictly enforcement and policy number four was um strictly enforcement of your neighbors in order to have in order to investigate spillover effects okay and what they found is that the only treatment that made the difference so the only case where they actually did find effects on formalization was the third treatment where you send an inspector so stricter enforcement so nothing else worked so this is very much consistent with ulysses results that you know if you think that the sizable fraction of these firms are parasites the only thing that works is really strict enforcement information and registration costs are not going to help the second study is from sri lanka by the mel mckenzie and woodruff and again they conducted a very similar experiment where they tried to give informal firms various incentives in order to formalize and again nothing worked except for one treatment in which they offered firms uh a sizable fraction of their profits so one month or two months of their profits and then they actually found very large effects on formalization you know reimbursement of registration costs again made absolutely no difference there so what this suggests to me is not necessarily that incentives don't work and the only thing works enforcement to me what this suggests is that registration costs are perhaps not the most interesting margin of informality in this case and reducing other regulatory and bureaucratic costs may be in fact more important so uh if you compare formal and informal firms they differ not only in terms of the of the initial entry cost of the sunk costs they have to pay in order to enter the markets they also differ in their variable costs importantly formal firms pay payroll taxes um they face and again this is all documented very nicely in uh oily sales work it's not just the taxes they pay the bureaucratic costs of paying these taxes on an ongoing basis are huge they're what two to three times larger than in the united states so there is this ongoing cost of paying taxes there are other regulatory constraints for example firing and hiring restrictions that are quite important and perhaps this would be the most promising way of inducing formalization so far you know this kind of scenarios have been exploited only through structural models and counter factual simulations and as far as i know there are no experiments on these issues per se so that concerns domestic policy uh let me say let me talk a little bit about trade now and again there the hope is that if you have intensified competition if you open up an economy let's you let's say you open up brazil to foreign competition um exports will grow and this growth is going to shift resources to more efficient to larger and more efficient firms so this is a quite interesting mechanism i think because it's it you sort of get this get the the reduction in informality for free you don't have to engage in any domestic policies if this works and also because there have been many trade liberalizations in many developing countries so one can try to look for these effects directly in the data so what's the evidence on this channel the evidence is perhaps not surprisingly surprisingly is very mixed and i would say uh you can get opposite effects in the in in different studies so let me mention two of them that get uh completely different results so the first is a study by mccaid and palchnick in vietnam and vietnam implemented a bilateral trade liberal trade liberalization with the u.s essentially what happened is that u.s tariffs vis-a-vis vietnam were reduced drastically and as a result exports of vietnam to the united states rose substantially okay that led to a major structural transformation it was not just trade so vietnam in general experienced the major attraction destruction transformation in the last 20 years and what they do they document is that there was indeed a very sizable movement of resources from the informal to the formal sector it was a classic case of structural transformation where agricultural workers left small inefficient farms to move to big industrial enterprises okay so they find very strong evidence of this effect one actually finding in this paper that's very interesting is when they compute productivity effects they find that the productivity effects are much smaller once you account for heterogeneity okay once you account for selection effects if you just look at the raw data then the productivity increase from this reallocation is very substantial but once you account for heterogeneity in the workforce and they can do that because they have micro data the effects are much more muted i think that's very interesting but um the second study is by the carnero and kovac on brazil and brazil uh also liberalized in a very different way it was a unilateral trade liberalization that increased imports what they document is that there was a very substantial increase in in the most in the more exposed areas there were there was a very substantial increase in unemployment in the short run this increase in unemployment was replaced later by a strong increase in informality and uh you know if you look at these results one interpretation of what happened is that the informality uh sector acted as a fallback sector it absorbed unemployed workers who otherwise would have been employed for much longer periods and so one concern that often arises in this study is maybe these results are driven just by agriculture because brazil also experienced a very important structural transformation this during this time that was driven by the mechanization of agriculture they have a second paper that actually looks specifically at the role of agriculture and without getting into the details uh you know it they provide very strong evidence that this is not this does not reflect just agriculture uh these results are not driven by agriculture so if you look at these two sets of results it's very hard to draw a clear conclusion of how trade affects informality the first case is the dream case this is what people's intuition would suggest the second case is exactly the opposite of people's intuition and of course you know a very uh easy response is to say this is all happening because in the case of brazil the liberalization was unilateral inputs increased but there was no guarantee that brazil's trade partners would also reduce their their tariffs um you know the exception of the us in most countries inputs and exports are linked through the trade balance so in the long run when imports rise exports have to rise to and in fact in brazil this happened i mean in brazil exports did rise so if you take that into account uh you should actually even in the cases of these unilateral trade liberalizations you should be seeing the same effects of of relocation to the formal sector and yet in brazil you don't see that so um you know in a paper we're actually working on with the carnero maguire and tulisia we're actually trying to make sense of of these patterns and the one mechanism that we're investigating or we're positing in the paper is that what happens uh is that when exports grow there is of course this you know this uh tendency towards more stability because larger firms tend to be more stable but at the same time the revenues of exporters tend to be much more volatile uh and that means that at the steady state you get more unemployment uh if you have frictions in an economy and you have an informal sector that um that's facing fewer frictions than the formal sector then this unemployed are going to be absorbed by uh by the informal sector and perhaps this is what we are seeing in brazil okay so um this is the mechanism we are exploring in this paper but uh i don't have a final draft yet and uh it's not clear that uh so i cannot i cannot say that the evidence of that this mechanism is at work is convincing is is uh is robust yet so at any rate the conclusion from all these is that uh there is no evidence that openness per se that just opening up to free trade is automatically going to eliminate informality in fact in some cases we see exactly the opposite we see informality increasing not going down it's very likely that the results are context specific and they depend on the particular trade policy that's implemented but it's also very likely that what happens when the trade policy regime changes depends very heavily on the labor regulations you have in the developing country so there is an interaction of labor regulations and trade there my bottom line is i i think the claim that trade without any consideration to local labor market realities that trade by itself is going to to address the issue of informality or small firm size there is no evidence to that effect so uh let me use now the remaining time to talk about the second part the big and powerful and there i'm going to be more speculative because i think that there is literally uh very very little research on these issues in developing countries and so first let me try to speculate a little bit of why we see so little work on the subject by the way everything i've seen tends to be case studies produced by the world bank or other organizations there is very little academic work on these issues and as i said before i think this is partly because the focus on the small and inefficient informality distracts from the fact that there are also issues important issues of market power in many of these countries another reason may be that the priority in many developing countries is investment and growth even if this happens at the expense of consumers or workers so this is not people don't consider to be the first other concern even though i would claim that because some sometimes these cartels are present in sectors in in in products that are consumed disproportionately by the poor they have actually very important implications for poverty uh in many countries uh there is no anti-trust legislation there is no competition policy there are no competition authorities so in many countries the landscape is very very similar to what we had in the u.s in the 19th century and perhaps this is an area where one can draw many interesting lessons just by studying u.s history uh and finally i think uh in many developing countries there is no state capacity so why do you want to even think about competition policy if nothing works in the country so uh it seems uh you know it seems a waste of time so i think these are all reasons that uh people don't work a lot on these issues but perhaps this is one reason that academics should work and finally you know i i will mention you know a final reason that often uh is important when people choose research topics that uh you know i think pretty much in everything in economics uh the issues and the results are context specific but this this is especially true uh in in uh issues regarding markets and firms and industrial organizations they're uh they're the the both the issues and the data and the the policies tend to be very context specific and sometimes the research one does on these issues tends to be thankless it's hard to publish when you know you write a paper on sugar or mace rather than the economy at large so um i told you before that i think these these issues are important partly because they are present in in sectors that that are important uh so some sectors where you do see uh cartels or market power include food cartels and so allegations of cartels or some documentation has been in the markets for wheat maize poultry so all these cases have been documented mostly in african countries several cases in pharmaceuticals especially in south africa ugly inputs especially fertilizer there is a lot of work in development on fertilizer or why farmers don't adopt fertilizer but but i've seen very little on the fact that actually the price of fertilizer is very high due to the presence of international cartels that raised the prices above competitive levels cement their well-documented monopoly there's a monopoly in africa in nigeria and then there's a service sector that's particularly important for delivery of goods transport and telecommunications and then there are many cases where that's you know where there has been some work in development in many cases you see issues of market power among traders and intermediaries and these cases have been documented in development uh there is a case of cashews and mozambique that i will talk about in a moment in natkin and donaldson they look at traders in ethiopia and nigeria in lauren burke we study she looks at mace traders in kenya so these are all these are all empirical studies uh there has also been some theoretical work in this area on intermediaries and traders in particular but these are empirical studies that actually do find evidence of some market power among traders and intermediaries and these are traders of agricultural products again to put things in context in textbook textbook models of agricultural commodities we always assume that these commodities are homogeneous products where there is perfect competition it seems a very plausible assumption but once you take intermediaries into account the results can be very different so needless to say that these are all products that especially food or pharmaceuticals that are consumed disproportionately by the poor uh so there are there these products that could potentially have very uh monopoly power in these products could potentially have important implications for for the poor in developing countries then in addition to that uh there may be issues of monopsony power and so just you know to to talk about uh two cases where this monopsony power may arise so uh working trade has documented that in many countries when it comes to international trade and especially poor developing countries trade is driven by so-called superstar firms and so there is a paper in the review of econo of statistics of the review review of you know nominating sorry [Music] okay by front end pierola thank you that shows that so the top one percent of exporters accounts for approximately 53 of exports the top firm in most developing countries accounts for 15 to 23 of all exports right and so some examples that come to mind is samsung in korea or intel in costa rica uh so these are you know startling cases but this pattern is not confined to korea or costa rica is more general and you know if you think about what this means uh you know for for consumers or workers well these firms may have a large share of exports but it's unlikely that they have that they're they're big enough in the global landscape to influence world prices so samsung they may be an important exporter for korea but it doesn't have uh it's seriously seriously constraint in its pricing behavior by rival so it's not the case that korean consumers face higher prices because of samsung same thing with intel in costa rica however there could be implications for monopsony power because in many cases these firms are the biggest employer in developing countries many such issues also are arise in the case of commodities coffee for example where farmers are often faced with buyer cartels there is one option in power on the other side okay so the current state of affairs as i mentioned is that competition policy is non-existent in many countries although there has been some progress in the last few years uh competition authorities wherever they exist they tend to be underfunded and understaffed the staff is overworked there is very strong enforcement against lobby very strong lobbying against enforcement and fine because of that enforcement is very lux right so so um against this background i think there there is scope for uh academic work to you know at a minimum actually raise a flag on this issue so that there is more work there is more more policy work and with that in mind let me uh you know talk a little bit about how one could use various tools to diagnose the existence of these cartels or market power so in many cases precisely because there is no anti-trust or competition policy you could actually read about uh about collusive agreements or you could actually collect data and actually see them very clearly again the experience there the experience here is very similar to what was going on in the united states in the 19th century where you know prior to the sherman act firms would openly discuss collusive agreements and now you know today we can actually study these collusive agreements and see what these firms were doing to a certain extent you can do this in many developing countries or you can you know look at look at the price patterns and the price patterns themselves tell you what is going on so this is you know at the minimum you know one can start there but there are some other ways in which you can diagnose market power and i'm going to talk about those briefly so again this is all uh prospective because as i said there have been very few studies on these issues in some cases almost none so the first so i will order them in terms of um both how much they how much work they take to implement um and uh but also to a certain extent uh how convincing how how credible they are so i will start with cross-sectional comparisons of prices then i'll talk about incomplete cost pass-through what i will call the production side approach for estimating markups and then full structural modeling and i'm not going to give an in-depth discussion of these approaches but i will mention them very briefly so the first thing you can do is uh cross-sectional comparisons so there the idea is to look for price discrimination because if you have let's say two different consumer groups or different regions that pay very different prices uh that's suggestive of the existence of markups if price was equal to marginal cost there should be not a price difference so you know this is very straightforward of course the challenge if you implement that is you need to control for cost differences the usual argument is that the price difference counter argument if you document price differences is the price differences arise from cost differences and not from markups not from the presence of market power so because of that this argument this kind of price comparisons are most convincing when the differences are really large so in some cases they are so large that one would be hard-pressed to claim that there is something other than price discrimination going on there and the few cases in africa for example that have documented market power the result they use this pure price discrimination argument i think it's partly because these price differences were huge as i will show you in a moment but also because in many cases uh people did not have the tools to do anything more sophisticated maybe it was not even needed maybe there was no need to do anything more sophisticated even that no one cared in the first place but if you look at cement prices in africa so cement is controlled by a nigerian monopoly so on average prices in africa are 183 higher than in the rest of the world so this is a huge number it's very hard to you know to to justify it based on cost considerations alone another example is sugar in zambia where again it's been documented that it's 41 more expensive than in other countries in the great lakes region and again the differences are so large that it would be very hard to to argue these are just cost differences so that's one way the second approach is to document incomplete cost pass-through and this is actually the one approach that has been used quite often in the development literature partly because this is an approach that's quite popular in agricultural economics and many developing economies are agricultural economies and it's also very popular because of ease of implementation and because in order to implement it you usually need a well-defined shock and exogenous shock and commodity price shocks usually serve this purpose if you have a weather in many cases if you have a weather shock that leads to changes in commodity prices you can use it as a as a source of exogenous variation so that said i think there is enormous confusion about what can be learned from incomplete cost passed through and uh i think this is the one case where it would be really instructive for development economies to consult the very large literature in international need on an exchange rate pass through uh to to get some guidance of what is learned and what is not learned from incomplete pass-through so let me just give you a very you know a very brief overview the time the remaining time and i apologize for i'm going to use hand-drawn graphs and i apologize for that actually my initial plan had been to draw them in real time because then i can make things more clear they're very basic but i didn't quite trust the technology so i think that the confusion comes from something very basic which is there is a difference between the demand facing the firm which should be horizontal under perfect competition and downward sloping under imperfect competition and the market demand which is always downward sloping always you know under our usual assumptions so let me you know this is very basic and i apologize if i appear to be to be condescending but there's an enormous amount of confusion on that when it comes to incomplete pass-through so this is the case of perfect competition and this is if you have perfect competition then the demand curve facing an individual firm should be flat okay that's the point so then if you have a supply shock that is specific to this one firm and only to this one firm then the implication of imperfect competition is there should be no pass-through at all okay zero passes so zero pass-through in this case means uh perfect is consistent with perfect competition in contrast you know very the econ 101 graph if you have a downward sloping demand curve facing the firm again that's the important thing then uh the important implication is that when you have a supply shock a supply shock that's specific only to this one firm that you're looking at then there would be incomplete pass-through okay there would be some parcel so that would suggest imperfect competition uh and if you think the reason this is sometimes uh confusing is uh in this case uh let's say the firm has a positive shock a positive supply shock so for some reason its costs are lower in the case of imperfect competition you would share that with your client with your with your buyer right you would reduce the price that the buyer face and this means that there is imperfect competition so in most people's minds this is a good thing you are exposed to a positive shock a positive supply shock and you share that with your customer but you share it only because you have a markup to start with right if you have perfect competition you don't share it because you had zero and you still have zero so it's it's very basic so the reason i'm saying that is because so this is the idea but now here's where the confusion arises this all presumes that you have something something that shocks just one firm in the data you almost never see that there is you can hardly think of a shock that is going to affect just one firm uh so maybe that's one case where there would be scope for interesting work in development because that's something you can induce for experimental variation maybe you can do that in development but in observational data you'd be very hard-pressed to find anything anything like this and the same applies by the way to uh monopsony right it's exactly the same thing that uh you know again if you if you are a monopolist then you face and the you know in the market for labor then the implication is you have an upward law your face and upward sloping labor supply curve so again if you have a positive shock a positive revenue shock you share the range with your workforce it sounds a good like a good thing but you share only because you were exploiting them in the first place beforehand you know if you were not you have nothing to share so but again think about cases where you can you can find such a shock that's specific to one firm you almost never have that right so uh the theory is clear but in the data it's very hard to to to find the analog the right variation that would allow you to draw this inference in the data so what we have instead is you have shifts in market demand so usually you have shocks if you take a commodity price shock or exchange rates or anything like that it's going to shift the the curves for the whole market so then you get into the business of trying to make predict try to analyze the implications of incomplete pass-through when you have a shock that shifts all all uh the costs of all firms and there what's the implication well consider the case the classic textbook case econ 101 or econ 115 at yale downward sloping demand upwards locking supply if you move the supply curve you are always going to get incomplete pass-through by virtue of the fact that you have a downward sloping demand curve with an upward sloping supply curve it has nothing to do with monopoly power nothing to do with market power this is just by virtue of the way the demand curves look on the other hand when would complete pass would be meaningful if you had the long run industry supply being totally horizontal again that's the textbook case we have long run uh the long-running competitive equilibrium with constant returns the long-run industry supply is horizontal and then in that benchmark case if you had a shock affecting the whole market then you would get complete password so what does this mean is that if you actually have these shocks that this is actually what we see in the data what you need to do is you need to control for costs without controlling for costs you cannot make any inference you can make any statements about incomplete pass-through so this is then the challenge that all these studies face the way around it is to make the assumption that the costs are flat if you make this assumption then you are fine because if you make the assumption that the supply curve is horizontal then complete password means perfect competition and any deviation from that means imperfect competition with variable markups okay so i i felt you know compelled to actually clarify this because uh in my experience it causes an enormous amount of confusion okay so if you um if you try to consider the the general case where you have an upward sl upward sloping supply curve then you need to control for these changes in marginal costs that is often done in the international literature but it's quite challenging so therefore what's the way around it so the most convincing applications are the ones that use multi-market data in order to control for marginal cost in order to control for the supply and that leads us to the so-called pricing to market approach so the idea there is if you look at uh firms selling to multiple destinations and if you make the additional assumption that no matter where you sell you always face the same cost then you can look at the differential price response across markets to identify the presence of markups that's what's called pricing to market and they're the important assumption is that the marginal cost is common across markets where i expect eric is immediately going to object and say or you know iran in brumbidia and say well actually there is evidence that exporters sell different qualities to different markets and that's what accounts for incomplete password uh bottom line um so the nice thing about the the this approach is uh it seems you don't need to put a lot of structure on the problem to you know to draw some inferences but actually you need to be quite careful about what the nature of the shock are is it a shock to a firm or to the market and what the implicit assumptions are regarding the cost curves approach number three this is an obvious approach to someone who does not come from the io tradition so in its simplest form what is markup is price divided by marginal cost so we observe prices in many settings one would think we can use data on marginal cost and then we can calculate these markups and how would we get data on marginal cost perhaps we can use accounting data and get measures of variable costs marginal cost is not the same as variable costs but you know given all the assumptions that we have to make under different approaches perhaps using variable cost is not such a bad approximation what has killed this approach in the industrial organization literature is that it's very hard to measure the cost of capital with labor or materials you can do okay but when it comes to the cost of capital that becomes a binding constraint again in development i'm not sure this is a binding constraint so this is something to think about uh an alternative way is that because it's based actually on the macro literature origin uh originating with uh hall and then the logger and vertical that more recently this paper that we've authored is you do something like that but instead of instead of trying to get accounting data on marginal costs you do the following you you use production level data and then you compute the revenue share of the variable input which in many data sets is very easy to get and then you control for the output elasticity of the variable input so uh let me put it this way if you read this literature markup is defined as the ratio of these two variables if you think about it what this does is it computes markup as markup being equal to price over marginal cost making an adjustment for different technologies so this output elasticity accounts for different technologies so if you think about the cope douglas where the elasticity does not vary across firms or across time so these you know in comparisons across different firms or across time periods this stays constant this approach would be equivalent with this but you would be using different data to infer it and uh the advantages of this approach is that the conceptual assumptions you need to implement it are minimal um it can be implemented with publicly available data the disadvantages are that it sounds very nice but the actual implementation is quite hard if you have multi-product data and the the approach is also descriptive in nature uh so you cannot do counterfactual simulations okay uh and the final approach is what has become popular in io you can use uh the structural i add demand side approach so in the development context this is one example we applied it to the pharmaceuticals market to estimate uh competition in indian pharmaceuticals and then address the effects of trip and the basic structure is the following you assume a utility function or a demand you use this approach to you also assume a particular market structure and firm behavior and i'm sorry this should be b c d and this set of assumptions are going to imply markups and once you know markups you can also know you also know marginal cost they're identified by the identity marginal cost is price over markup when you implement this approach the advantage is you know everything you model the entire market is partial equilibrium but you know everything and then you can do counterfactual simulations and what's the advantage the advantage is that you learn everything about the market the main drawback is of course that the results depend on assumptions uh but there are two sets of assumptions here so there are assumptions about market structure and firm behavior and these assumptions often can be informed by studying the the particular market or the particular setting there is another you know issue that's um trickier and this is that in this approach the results depend very critically on the demand system you assume and more importantly on on your demand estimate so identification of demand becomes very important here that's i think another area where experiments could be used to identify demand there has been a lot of progress made in demands in suggesting demand systems that have nice properties and you know david and ben talked about this a little bit yesterday uh but still you know how we identify the price elasticities of demand is still a big challenge uh this is another area where i think there will be a lot of work in development so let me you know uh finish you know this part with asking again the question can trade now act as competition policy given that we really right now there is uh there is no competition policy in most developing countries and in the places where there is one it is not enforced uh in principle yes because trade implies more competition however there are four caveats number one the non-traded sector is not covered and you know some of the big issues arise in the context of transportation and telecommunications and their opening up is not going to help second you need to take into account market structure uh i don't have time to go over the case of more of casuals in mozambique but the the summary is that cashews in mozambique the trade of cashews was characterized by double marginalization so when mozambique got rid of export restrictions what actually happened is the the export prices went up but uh the the gains were not passed through uh i'm sorry the uh the domestic prices went up but then these gains were not passed through to farm to to to the farmers because most of the gain was captured by intermediaries so actually the parcel was of in the order of 40 to 50 so it was much lower uh very often the entrants have market power themselves so you can open up one african country uh to to to more competition in cement but then the very same cement monopoly is going to enter all african markets uh this won't help and finally the context and the trade policy specifics uh matter in an important way and let me give you one example of how they matter from from my work with yandere locker and amit kandel wanted nina pouncing on the indian trade liberalization by the way there were many complaints about 115 page papers in the last two days and this is a paper that started as 115 pages but i can summarize the main takeaway in one page and perhaps you know one lesson is that many of these papers after if you wait for three to five years eventually you can summarize them in one page so there is hope so the the this was a very large trade liberalization in india and you would expect it increased competition if you if you look at the data you would expect this trade liberalization to have reduced markups what we found is actually that the increased markups why did this happen the story is very simple i can put it in words now the liberalization reduced not only tariffs on final products but also on intermediate products okay that means what it did is it primarily reduced costs to producers so now we are back to the passive questions the the reduction of cost was not passed completely to consumers in the form of uh proportionally lower prices price prices did go down but not in full proportion to the cost decrease and as a result markups increased okay so uh again it's a it's a story that uh can be perfectly rationalized within economic models but it's not what you would first what you would have thought at first as being the relevant mechanism when you open up an economy uh to uh competition and just you know to show you some figures um that go along with this story this these are raw data from india okay these are the these are not data that were produced by us they saw a very clear increase in profit margins around 91 that's the year when the trade liberalization was concluded and of course there are many other things going on in india this is not uh this is only suggestive these are on road these are only raw data but what we are saying is that there is we have an explanation a partial explanation of this increasing profits that you see in india during that period and this partial explanation is that all these trade reforms ultimately reduce costs to producers this is a good thing by the way i mean i don't want to be misinterpreted consumers do enjoy lower prices and in many cases more variety and also higher quality so there are gains from trade but this does not mean necessarily that profits go down to put you know to again here i'm going to be very speculative but to tie that to some big picture questions this is a graph from jan de locker and jan eckhaud that has received enormous attention in the last year showing the markup evolution in the united states and you can see that there is a very sharp increase around 1980 so markups start going up in the meantime they have produced graphs like that for most countries of the world and they all look very similar so you have this tremendous increase in markups across the whole world and um you know you may wonder what the you know they don't take a very strong stand as to what is driving that it could be technology many people suggest intangibles so these are this is all based on measures of variable costs but it's clear that companies now invest in infrastructure they invest in in branding and marketing and so on and all these are not taking into account here when they calculate costs another factor that may be driving that and i will just put you know mention that and put it out there is uh the globalization of markets so prices this is a point by the way that a student who was in the job market monica morlaco made just to give you a specific example if you take the retail market for clothing take zara or h m or banana republic the prices did not go up for consumers for these products they are still very very low and this is partly because these companies face stiff competition they compete with each other they cannot raise prices yet their profit margins have gone way up and why is that it's because their costs have gone down so it's not that price is increased it's just that costco went down and the cost savings were not necessarily passed through in form of lower prices to consumers so profit margins increase as a result i think this is a story that you can tell about many markets and it's a story of both market power and incomplete pass-through it's particularly relevant to developing countries because many of these products are sourced these days from developing countries so i will conclude uh and i think i'm right on time by saying the following so i think firms in developing countries present many uh questions that are very policy relevant many of them are unanswered and uh many of them are under-researched as of now especially questions that regard market power the approaches and answers tend to be very case specific and very context specific but i think precisely because of that this is a great opportunity for development economists who come from this mindset of paying attention to the particular context and the specifics so i think empirical work especially in academia could play an important role in helping answer these questions in the future so thank you very much
