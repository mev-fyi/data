this is in africa which is one of our ideas starting off in this project um so what are we talking about in 2001 uh zambia began a large-scale program of malaria control and treatment there was a very large commitment of domestic resources and donor resources i'll show you some of the numbers in a bit the goal was very ambitious a 75 reduction in malaria incidence and 20 reduction in under five mortality so why did they do this why zambia and and why did they do in the early 2000s and not a lot of not some other time so there's a long history of malaria control in the post-world war ii period it was kind of the golden age of malaria control with this magic weapon of ddt the world health organization uh went around the world uh controlling or eradicating malaria in very rapid fashion in a lot of countries india sri lanka a lot of countries in latin america at the time the who viewed africa as simply too difficult the mosquitoes were too well entrenched the infrastructure was too uh hard and at some point the who kind of called it truce on malaria said we've done as much as we can do and that's where things stood for many decades within zambia itself there was a very tragic cycle in which post-independence and when the price of copper was high they did a very good job in controlling malaria and then there was massive backsliding the worldwide ban on ddt uh institutional uh difficulties lower price of copper and as we discussed in the papers zambia malaria came back in zambia toward the end of the 1990s a couple of trends came together first of all there was just a maturation of new technologies for fighting malaria things like treated bed nets and new medications and secondly there was a change in donor focus aid donors decided they cared a lot about disease there was a global fund for for aids tb and malaria malaria was kind of the marginal case in that global fund but malaria made it in and so people in the business kind of got this idea that now was the time for a new assault on malaria and there was an explicit desire to have a big win to have a test case where you could show what putting all of these technologies and a lot of money and effort together could do in terms of fighting malaria and zambia was chosen as that test case because it was viewed as a country that had the institutional capacity to carry out a successful program it was political will and there was a favorable climate so so mosquitoes are not as bad in zambia as they are if you move further up in sub-saharan africa so that was the background of the initiative and how did they do um so here's some data i'm going to talk about much more later on but this is just some raw data on malaria deaths in the hmis it's a database in in zambia and you can see that there's this this rapid decline both in under five deaths and in over five deaths by a factor of something like 50 percent over this uh seven or so year period these are raw deaths and this is a period in which population grew by about 30 percent so there's a more than 60 percent reduction in the death rate in this data so that seems like a big success that's something to study um in addition to this hmis data we have data from the dhs the demographic and and health surveys um in 2001 2002 the fraction of children under five who had fever in the previous two weeks uh fell by more than half and under five mortality fell from 168 per thousand to 119 per thousand so a difference of of five percent in under five mortality in a fairly short period of time which is really a huge improvement and that's as i'll discuss later on that's not all due to malaria control but it's nonetheless a striking improvement in health and here are just two ways of quantifying um the improvement one about 25 000 children's lives saved per year so that's a a kind of awesome number and then perhaps a little frivolously i thought about making something economic out of this um so in a lot of my work i'm kind of interested in in issues about health and how you do a linkage between health improvements and economic improvements and and that's very hard in terms of utility and stuff like that but i have a little shortcut which is to just use the human development index the human development index weights income per capita and health according to a formula it's all in our footnotes and so you can take any improvement in health and translate it into an income equivalent terms so i don't necessarily endorse the weights that are used in the hdi but they are something people look at so if you take the improvement in mortality in zambia over this uh period it's something like 25 growth of gdp per capita so that's a big number so what are we going to do in this paper well a lot of this paper is really about kind of exploring the data and exploring what you can learn from from the available sources so i say here we apply our skills so you know we're not epidemiologists we're not public health people we're we're quantitatively oriented economists and there's a lot of stuff we don't know and a lot of things that we should be humble about but we do have some skills in terms of data analysis and stuff like that and so we want to take those skills and apply it to the data to see if we can help in this process of understanding what's going on in this big health improvement and that's really what most of the effort in this paper is about just sort of understanding what's going on part of that is understanding the relationship of inputs to health improvements with outcomes so we want to you know sort of ideally assist in learning what works well where do you get the biggest bang for buck in the different treatment modalities uh that are being rolled out as i say we we need a lot of caution in doing this because there are a lot of econometric problems uh in in using the available data to infer what works and what doesn't work and again you know we're sort of treading in the territory of real doctors and we don't want to kind of look at the data and jump to some conclusion that we know better than them and then finally what we like to do as part of the larger project but it's not in today's paper is use the zambian initiative or experiment to understand more about the economics of disease and the economics of malaria in particular so we want to learn about the economic health i'm sorry the economic effects of health improvements okay so what data do we have well one thing we have is this very standard demographic and health survey you know nicely cut up for us already by by the folks who collect these things it's actually very good luck that there's a dhs in 2001 before the initiative and dhs in 2007 after it's mostly gotten going so that that's going to make our our work a lot easier secondly we have data from the zambian national malaria control commission on spraying bed net distribution distribution of anti-malarials rapid diagnostic testing and all the the commodities uh they put out there and again there's some good luck here because the nmcc in zambia takes an extremely strong hand in coordinating the distribution of health inputs and in some countries that's not the case and kind of everyone's distributing what they feel like where they feel like it and in zambia they really centralize everything and they collect data as it goes out and then finally we're going to use this thing the health management information system which we've spent a lot of time about so i feel quite close to it so let me tell you about my new friend so the hmis was started in 1995. in 2009 in january 2009 a new system was introduced so we're dealing solely with the old hms hmis that runs through 2008 data is collected quarterly there's data on inpatients and outpatients by disease diagnosis you get outcomes like deaths there's also parallel information on service delivery nets and spring and so on the data comes from all ministry of health facilities so these range from big hospitals in lusaka to um to little i'm sorry big hospitals except for these very special referral hospitals in lusaka that are not in the data set so from hospitals to little health posts that would be staffed by a single community health worker uh it's a kind of pyramid structure so data is passed from the facility where there are log sheets and kept up to the district level and then it's passed on to the province level and that's passed on to lusaka the data is cleaned and checked at the district level and then again at the province level and so when we read about this we're like okay you know this is this is going to be great we can really learn a lot from this um and then we started learning about all the different opportunities for error uh that there are in in collecting this data so um first just at the facility level there's enormous heterogeneity in the quality of record keeping um sometimes it's done you know by very responsible people as the patients come in sometimes it's based on end of the month recall and kind of guesses or it's filled in by people who are semi-literate there are problems with data entry data was entered once there were no consistency checks no screens no nothing it just it just kind of got in there and then what turned out to be a huge problem was when the data got to lusaka only the most recent quarter would be appended to this national data set meanwhile any late reports or any corrections that happened at the province or district level would update those data sets but not the central data set in musa so these things just completely didn't match each other and it was extremely frustrating so what we did was we got money to go out and try and fix all this so that involved recollecting data that never made it into the data set um a lot of what we did was sort of apply statistical tools to the original to the version of the hmis that they gave us scanning for duplicate figures scanning for huge outliers doing kind of quarterly adjustments and all sorts of fun things like that and then going back to district health officials to find missing reports and to justify irregular data and say you know is this really the number that's supposed to be here can you go back to the facility can you find out you know why this number is so different from that number um the kind of thing that might have been done at the time of input if they had a really good uh system and part of doing this we ran these provincial data workshops where we brought in um people from the facilities and the district level health org data officers and things like that um went over data um went over data analysis this was not just about improving data i don't want to give the wrong impression that you know sort of we spent two hundred thousand dollars um just making the hmis better for this paper um there was definitely a capacity building dimension to this teaching um the local officers to to kind of get a better handle uh on their data and we hope in the process improving the quality of this hmis so we filled in missing observations you can see a whole table in the paper of the number of corrections we made and just to sort of show you the most striking example in the original hms hmis as we got it if you looked at under five malaria deaths they rose by 13 between 2006 and 2007. it's kind of a bad thing to be happening in the middle of a massive anti-malaria campaign uh it turned out that there were three districts that just had completely screwy reports for 2007 you could kind of see them as as massive outliers went back found the right data corrected it and you find that malaria went down okay um there's still a lot of issues remaining to be concerned about with the hmis i'll just go over some of them briefly one is misdiagnosis it's very common in sub-saharan africa there was a tendency to treat a lot of fevers as malaria whether there was a diagnosis or not over the period that we're looking at these rapid diagnosis test kits these kind of molecular biology things that a not very well-trained person can use to diagnose malaria in 20 minutes were introduced and guidelines were introduced that you can't prescribe the um act therapies without first having done a diagnostic test and so that's going to make malaria diagnoses uh go down a lot and maybe bias the trend in what we see there's also stigma associated with hiv so a lot of hiv deaths we fear are being reported as malaria and then there was this abolition of user fees and rural facilities you'll see in some of the data later on there's a big spike in outpatient visits one of the things we do to try to minimize these biases is just look at serious cases so we look at deaths and we look at particularly under five deaths and when we look at inpatient cases we think we're more likely to be getting correct diagnosis because if someone is is actually in a facility long enough they're going to be seen by a clinician repeatedly maybe their blood will be looked at under a microscope and so we're more likely to get a correct diagnosis a second issue um and i think this is kind of the most troubling thing about the whole paper is that not all cases or even all deaths uh make it into the hmis and the worry might be that it's a non-representative uh set of cases and this is going to bias our ability to look at trends and health over time um so you might think that the hmis is going to do better in cities than in the countryside because people are closer to facilities so we might miss a lot of malaria mortality and also we think that a lot of these interventions were rolled out in the same places where there are facilities that appear in the hmis so we might be biasing the the magnitude of the effects from the malaria rollout so here's again this is this is um the place i'm i'm least happy with our data so here's just an attempt to assess what fraction of deaths of under five uh children actually make it into the hmis so in the first column you see um deaths that we record per 1000 children under age five this is from the hmis in 2001 and 2007. so you can see there's this 41 drop we're going to want to compare that to under 5 mortality calculated in sort of demographic fashion in the dhs the right way to do that is not just to multiply by five but it's a sort of rough and ready approximation so that's what you see in the second column and then in the third column is the data i mentioned on dhs under five deaths so the bad news here is it looks like we're getting between a quarter and a fifth of these under five deaths so we're really getting a fairly uh small fraction so that's going to make us worried the other thing is when you look at the change over the six year period there's a much larger decline 41 percent in the hmis relative to the dhs actually that turns out to not be so worrisome because if you think about the way the dhs calculates under five mortality it's a survey done in 2007. they ask about all children born over the past five years and the ages at which they died if they died and then do a lifetable based on that this was a period in which mortality from malaria was falling very rapidly so the number you get in the dhs is some kind of weighted average of the period 2003 to 2007 whereas what you get in the hmis is just the data for 2007. and as you can see here if you recalculate the hmis change in under five deaths taking the average of 2003 to 2007 you get 29 decline so it exactly matches the dhs so that's some good news for us oh come on give me 15. um all right so here's just a little more comparison this is the number of uh deaths by province in the dhs and the hmis um and there's this huge outlier of lusaka the hmis records far too few deaths in lusaka we actually solved that problem it turns out that there's a referral hospital in lusaka it's not in the hmis because everyone who goes to that hospital has to be referred from somewhere else and the data is supposed to be flowed back to the place that referred them we're pretty confident this is just an issue of the data not being flowed back to the places that referred them here's the change in mortality by province it looks somewhat better i'm going to skip over this finally there may be a lot of non-reporting facilities so we create a sample of always reporting facilities what we call the high quality sample that looks a lot like the regular hmis data except in 2008 you can read about the paper for the problems in 2008 and here in nbr tradition is a chained index comparing adjacent years for facilities that always report and that tells a fairly similar story and finally just in case you were worried that the whole decline in malaria that we're seeing was just that the hmis was capturing fewer and fewer deaths over time here's the ratio of malaria deaths to non-malaria deaths and you can see that this falls significantly over this period as well so clearly there is a big reduction in malaria mortality going on here one thing that we can do with the hmis that you can't do with other data so we're very interested to to see what this looks like is since it's quarterly data and this is the nbr after all you have to run a regression with season dummies or quarter dummies and so this is what you get when you look at the full data set so red is malaria deaths and blue is is um all under five deaths um the first quarter is the quarter of high malaria mortality that's the rainy quarter and so every other quarter has a negative and that's the reference group in this regression so every other quarter has a negative dummy and you can see about half of the seasonal immortality is driven by malaria we then take the sample and we divide it into just two halves which we call pre and post so really this is kind of a continuous roll out of an anti-malaria initiative but you can see that the seasonal and malaria mortality uh declines uh by about half over this period so this is kind of a good check that we're really getting malaria mortality because this is what the seasonal for malaria mortality is supposed to look like and then here's the decline in the seasonal uh for all-cause mortality so that's largely although not entirely driven by the decline in the seasonal for malaria mortality so that's kind of a neat thing that you can do with this data that you can't do with other data as a test all right so very briefly the the elements of the program were kind of if you read about health in africa you know all these things treated bed nets um in 2008 more than half the budget of the malaria control commission was was designated for bed nets uh indoor spraying act therapy diagnostic testing and treatment of pregnant women it's very important as you saw in this previous data to note that stuff was going on besides the malaria initiative so there were big initiatives in hiv tb and child health generally so not by any means all this decline in malaria immortality is due to malaria and that's going to make sorting things out somewhat more difficult here's just the data on the on the roll out in the initial design of the program spraying was going to be restricted to urban areas where it was viewed as cost efficient the thrust was on bed nets you can see that there's this ramping up of bed net distribution though definitely not monotonic so you get a big decline in bed net distribution in 2004 as far as we understand that has to do with problems and supply of nets from donors you then get this very rapid ramp up through 2007. in 2008 the planning documents in the budget called for 3.5 million nets to be distributed and again problems with supplies from donors led to less than a million deaths being nets being distributed and at the same time there was a reorientation of the program towards spraying and we don't fully understand what happened here whether this was kind of based on analysis of data from the field uh or or what they got from the donors but there was this shift from primarily focusing on nets and doing spraying only in a few select districts to expanding the number of districts where spraying was done so that by 2008 half of the districts were being targeted by spring and if you look in the paper i didn't put it in the slideshow there's a nice little graphic showing you districts covered by spring over time this is just a table looking at at net distribution according to the dhs and i'm sorry net distribution according to the nmcc and net usage according to the dhs and there's a relatively good correlation between the two of those and here's the same thing for spraying so there's you know we're basically just checking that the places that the nmcc thought they were deploying nets and spraying or indeed the places where people report that they're using nets or being in sprayed structures all right so the last thing we want to talk about is this assessment of the role of the link between output inputs net spring and so on and outcomes like death and disease and so the natural thing to do is some run some regression of outcomes on changes in these inputs and of course this is very dangerous territory because these inputs are not randomly applied and so it's going to be very difficult to get a structural estimate of the effect of applying one or another modality um treatment on outcomes right so what are the problems so resources are pushed to areas that are in need where malaria is high or malaria is forecast to be high what is pushed where is chosen at least somewhat in an optimizing fashion so there are people in musaka thinking about what would be best in what places those those are kind of two obvious things the third thing is something we really learned from our field work which is that the efficacy of the local staff is hugely important so there's just enormous differences we can't quantify these but but but they they appeared they were they were apparent to us um in the quality of the local health staff um by district so some places you have district health officers who really have their act together they're getting their their inputs out to all the people who need them people are being tested properly before they're given a cts and by the way good records are being kept and in other places you have the opposite of that there's kind of huge variance in that and that's going to be an extremely important omitted variable in determining what happens to health inputs over time so we can sign these biases some so if inputs are pushed to places that have bad current conditions of high malaria in a district triggers more nets or more spraying um of course everything we do is going to have district fixed effects but if we think that there's kind of some time variation in this then temporarily high malaria is going to trigger a lot of inputs in an area and then malaria is going to come down possibly it would have come down anyway so that's going to bias upward our estimate of the efficacy of these treatments um kind of the same thing is true for this health staff efficacy so places that have good health staff also get better inputs and so that's going to make it look like the inputs are working and then this kind of forecast conditions goes the other way if you think that really people can forecast where molars can be bad and push the inputs there then that's going to buy us downward the estimate of the efficacy of inputs so do we have any fair identifying variation whatsoever thanks i think we do i mean we have identifying variation to the extent that there's a deviation of what was actually done from some optimal plan and you know luckily this is africa where all sorts of unexpected things happen in terms of the distribution of inputs so we think there's a lot of those and then there are all sorts of discontinuous responses so for example in this roll out of indoor residual spraying the number of districts that were targeted was kind of changed in a discrete fashion from years to year from year to year and districts were either targeted or not targeted there were also stock outs of a cts over the course of this period and apparently of bed nets in 2008 so things like this are giving us more identifying variation so it's kind of um to the more random is the treatment the more likely we are to to estimate uh what it's doing okay um so what we're going to do is basically look at the link between inputs as we get them from the nmcc and outputs and we're going to do that both in the dhs and we're going to do this in this hmis data so here's dhs data we're looking at regressions of child fever over the last two weeks i'm not going to talk about the first columns because they're not identified so in the third column we're regressing on bed net distribution per capita there's a full set of year dummies here and of district dummies and we're controlling for all sorts of household demographics and you can see that you get the coefficient you're supposed to get which is distributing more bed nets and here bed net distribution is over the period between the two dhs's so it's cumulative over that period reduces fever in the last column we actually instrument for whether the household owns a bed net with bed net distribution per capita in the district and you get a negative and significant coefficient perhaps larger than it should be i don't show it here but we do a placebo test with diarrhea over the last two weeks it's another important health consideration but it's not affected by bed nets and it gets a zero coefficient so that's good news for us one of the things we worried about as i mentioned before is that sort of things are being pushed to places that have high malaria prevalence so we just control for previous malaria prevalence and that actually reduces the coefficient on on bed net distribution though it still remains significant and here we do the same thing with child death over the last five years and once again you get a negative and significant coefficient so what that coefficient says is that full coverage by bed nets in a region in a district would reduce child deaths by 4.4 percentage points that's about one-third of the child mortality so it's a significant amount now we're looking at the hmis where we have this data on a much finer time scale so we can compare to year by year roll out of bed nets so we're looking at regressions of malaria outcomes on nets per capita in the current year one lag of nets per capita which is what we expect to be the most significant uh input because these nets are distributed generally before the rainy season the rainy seasons at the beginning of the year um and two lags and you get basically um what you would hope to get which is you get this reduction in malaria inpatients and deaths um and so on uh from net distribution uh coefficient that we're not so happy with uh is this coefficient on other deaths of children under five so you might think that this is some kind of comorbidity or that there's something wrong with our estimate there we do the same thing with spraying and for both the dhs and the hmis we get somewhat weaker results so when we just do a regression of child fever in the last two weeks on the percentage of the district population sprayed you get a positive coefficient that is the opposite of what you would expect to get and and the same if you look at the household sprayed in the self-report when we restrict the sample just to looking at the second wave of the dhs we just get insignificant estimates and in the hmis we get somewhat more of of the expected effect of spraying um so when you look at when you include both a dummy for whether a district was a target in spraying in the previous year because the spraying is done late in the year before the rainy season and one leg of bed nets the coefficient on bed nets comes in roughly the same as it had before and the coefficient on spraying comes in negative and significant and if you look say in column five comparing the coefficient on spring being this is now a dummy for whether your district was targeted having your district targeted for spraying has about the same effect on mortality as distributing 100 000 bed nets so that's sort of the beginning of a cost benefit calculation that one could think about doing when we do all that adjusted for population size so we look at the fraction of households sprayed rather than a dummy for whether the district was targeted for spring and we look at nets per capita the nets per capita remains significant and the fraction sprayed now becomes insignificant although the the coefficient is not uh i mean it's not that far from significance um and finally i'm not going to talk about that map all right so let me talk about three different sets of conclusions so first just regarding the the the campaign itself um it's been a huge success um so you know the the the international community and the zambian government set out to make a big dent in malaria mortality in zambia and they succeeded so that's um that's the first thing to say at the same time there were huge successes in other dimensions of health as well that had nothing to do with the with the malaria program and from our own point of view this cleaned up hmis sort of this this new data source that we put all this effort into turns out to be a pretty useful tool for tracking uh the impact um tracking the rollout of these anti-malarial programs and looking at their impact to the extent that we can say something about this mapping from inputs to better health to outcomes we have very very very tentative evidence that we see nets working and we don't see as strong evidence of spraying working but i don't want to push that because as i say that there's real doctors out there who work on that um in terms of directions for future research um but this is the part about your work okay so um you know what got me into this um was the question of the economic effects of malaria or of health more generally um so we have this literature by macarthur and sacks and various papers like that that show that there's this huge effect of health on economic outcomes and we know there are a lot of problems with that we know that there's kind of this huge omitted variable bias um that things that might have a positive impact on health would also have a positive impact on on economic outcomes where there's endogenicity of health improvements we have this brilliant paper by assam ugly johnson that takes an iv approach and looks at changes in health technology in the mortality transition after world war ii to instrument for changes in health um and the first stage is very successful and the second stage basically shows zero so they show that improvements in health have no effect on economic outcomes and we have my own work with a different ashraf not the not nava um that kind of takes a more micro based approach trying to estimate the effect of health improvements on on on economic outcomes so those are all fine well the both simon and my papers are fine papers in this literature but they're not convincing to everybody um and it seems like zambia is a really great case for studying the economic effects of health improvements because it provides good identifying variation most importantly you get this largely exogenous increase in health so the world community decides that now is the time to make big progress in health and zambia and they do so then you get the of course that just at the national level that's just one data point so that's somewhat problematic um you get these big regional variations in the roll out and there's some randomness to that um and we think it's possible to identify other shocks so some of the things we want to look at kind of the natural suspects um demographers and economists have written a lot about the effect of health improvements uh and mortality reductions on fertility so sort of your standard model is that when mortality falls net reproductive rate goes up um and then eventually fertility falls perhaps in a more than compensating fashion malaria is an unusual disease in this respect because malaria has big effects on fecundity especially for first births um so it's something we want to study more just looking at what we have in the dhs in fact rural total fertility rose over the period 2001 to 2007 which is when this big malaria eradication was going on so there's certainly something interesting going on there we want to look at labor productivity and we're actually working with a company in zambia to get data on how hard uh workers can work when they do a big eradication and we want to get data on we have data on education as well that's sort of a natural place to look at the economic effects of disease control and so that's all for future work finally i i think it's important to kind of remind ourselves you know this this is mostly not about economics this is mostly about health improvements so what else can we say well zambia didn't set out to eradicate malaria so this is not the sri lanka model where you go you spray every household you get paracetamia in people's blood down to almost zero and at that point you can really kind of pull back on your control efforts and keep malaria at a very low rate so the old model the post-world war ii model was you do a big push against malaria and then you kind of do monitoring and control well you can't do that if you're only doing a three-quarters reduction so zambia is still full of vectors and zambia is still full of infected people who harbor the paracetamia um and that means that maintaining that low rate is much harder than it would be if you got rid of the thing so kind of this big push model is not right and in fact the resource demands in maintaining low malaria mortality are going to remain high for the foreseeable future we all know kind of the history of africa in terms of health and in terms of other economic things as well is one you know as bill easterly would tell us of you know kind of high hopes and big accomplishments and then huge backsliding and there is that danger there's no reason to think that's happening in zambia now they're doing a fantastic job but that's a depressing thought to end on thanks
