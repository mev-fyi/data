it's a tip my clock tip 10 so i want to welcome everybody to the 36th annual macro uh econ nbr macroeconomic conference um so we have participants who are with us here we are live on youtube uh as well so i welcome all the youtube people um to the program um what we're gonna do is our usual nbr macro annual stuff so please mute yourself if you're not talking i'm hearing a little bit of feedback sometime um we're going to go 20 minutes for the authors to give their paper we're going to then immediately go into 20 minutes from each of the discussions the discussions will go in the order they're listed on the program and then we're going to go immediately after that into questions from the panelists um and people who even on the youtube if you email me some questions i'll try to sprinkle those in as well so the authors will not respond um after the the discussions will go directly into questions and then maybe a minute or two at the end the authors could could wrap up anything else that didn't get addressed through the through the questions we will have breakout rooms after the so we have three uh kind of pan uh program uh uh blocks today we have two papers in a panel 15 minutes in between each of those and then we're gonna go uh for breakout rooms at the end and i'll talk a little bit more about that and we're gonna have three breakout rooms uh active one for uh each of the papers and then a general discussion if people just want to hang around and talk about other things as well so i think that's everything i'm supposed to say marty was i supposed to say anything else i think that's everything okay so we're going to go into our first paper uh and so i'm going to uh welcome bob hall and mariana cudliak to talk about why has the u.s economy recovered so consistently okay thanks very much um we have to start of course as usual since mariana works for the fed that the fed disclaims any responsibility for uh anything that's said in this paper and that's probably particularly necessary in this paper um okay so i'm gonna spend some time presenting the very core of the paper uh and then that will take about half the time then the rest of the time i go back over some of these establishing some of these points more fully in terms of evidence but our first claim is that we demonstrate that the unemployment recovery process is similar in all past 10 recoveries where the takes the form that the annual reduction in the unemployment rate is stable at around 10 percent of the current level of employment so that's the first claim and the central evidence for this is visible to easily to the naked eye if you just plot unemployment which is the indicator that we use throughout this study and to make clear that we're talking only about recoveries here uh the the basic posture of this research is that we we have a state variable in a model unemployment um something happens bad uh unemployment zips up and we don't consider that process it's not part of the deal it's not part of the model we're conditioning uh starting the model at the point where unemployment is high because there's been a recession and then what we're interested in is the path of unemployment uh until the next recession so it's a it's an event-based rather than time-based uh framework and you can see that this is log unemployment is very close to a straight line in each case and with just occasional small blips plus a pretty uniform rate of decline so that's that's really important to this entire research um our second claim is that uh recessions involve displacement of large numbers of workers but that the number of workers and the their likely path uh to personal recovery is totally insufficient to explain the behavior of unemployment after uh recovery begins there's something contagious about unemployment and tracking doubt and understanding that contagion is the main topic of this of the second part of this paper after we take care of these points and here's one picture that shows the cumulative contribution here that comes from displacement and the much larger and more persistent bulge of unemployment uh that follows so this the direct channel of unemployment is certainly there but it's not there's a lot of contagion too which is basically measured by this white area here the third principle claim is that self-recovery this recovery that's not motivated by any outside driving force occurs in the dmp model without any external force but the recovery [Music] in the dmp model with the standard parameter values such as rob's calibration is way way way too fast and we show a phase diagram which is actually i was surprised to discover this but it's there it's it's in pizzeridis chapter one uh so so this idea that that we want to include a phase diagram and thinking about this is is very well established not not something new in this paper and if you compare the actual recovery path which is shown in orange here with the models the dmp models recovery path you can see that there's just a grotesque difference a shortfall and and this has been known uh in the literature uh in a well-known paper by cole and uh that and rogerson that basically explains this in a much more complicated environment fourth principle claim is that if you add a feature to the model which has been added in quite a few different papers for different reasons that characterizes negative feedback from unemployment to labor market tightness then that will slow down the it alters the differential equation that governs the evolution of unemployment in a way that's consistent and you can actually simply solve for what that must be numerically in a phase diagram and it all works out very nicely instead of the the path of tightness being a horizontal line moving to the left it's a an upward sloping line not too far away from the point of the orange curve which is the constant unemployment uh curve so so that means that that this movement up this path is very slow it takes 10 years uh instead of three months and that's that's what you get if you uh if you follow this idea that tightness is contingent on unemployment okay so now now let's go over to so those are the claims that's the basic paper i could stop there but i have some more time so um and now we'll go back and and first of all try to answer this question of why the u.s unemployment rate has recovered so consistently first of all recoveries are endogenous there's a natural force within the dnp model that causes job seekers to match with available jobs and lower unemployment so it doesn't take it doesn't take changes in driving forces to get unemployment back to normal it's built into the model and as i mentioned it's it's sort of model overdosed that in its simplest form and the bulge of unemployment created by a crisis at the beginning of a recovery creates a negative feedback to lower market tightness which endogenously slows that recovery so that's the basic new feature of the model of the paper and the policy implications which we don't push too hard but uh i think it's something that we believe which is that there's little response of unemployment to demand disturbances instead we just follow that path no matter what happens in the economy until there is another crisis so this is a crisis to crisis model and we use the crisis to crisis statistical model to leverage that um now of course we're in a we're in a recovery today uh and you might ask well how does today's recovery fit in and the answer is very differently we've worked on that but we're not going to talk about it so the sample period ends in february of of 2020 as far as we're concerned in in studying this process and we we make no claim that um that you could easily transplant uh what's uh what would be described for 10 earlier recoveries for a recovery that has a very different character that is underway today um okay so i mentioned there's there's two key papers in the literature that uh uh we we build on uh i already mentioned colin rodgers in 1999 um that launched this observation that recoveries occur much more slowly than than jobs when people find jobs and of course there's been some some literature on that including things that i've written the other important paper uh which uh involves um characterizing uh the the downward slope of that relationship as opposed to the horizontal slope in the in the phase diagram is fujita and rainey's paper uh which which identified the high elasticity of a vacancy creation as the cause of the problem that colon rogerson had identified and uh figured out one mechanism involving a you know a natural one which is the adjustment costs um and that that fits into this framework it generates a phase diagram that that has the same character as i described before okay so so then we've done work uh on statistical work based on on this observation i won't say much about that except that it involves two approaches one is building a chronology uh and the other is using a hidden markov so there's a mark off there's a an event controlled by the switching process which causes the economy to move the unemployment rate to jump up and then what we're interested in that model is not the whole model but just the piece of it that describes the gradual decline of unemployment until the next regime change occurs and jim hamilton has created the model that we use actually in his original form from that from that research we find a great uniformity in starting around 1960 in the slope of the recovery and in the three earlier periods three earlier recessions the recovery occurred predictably along a straight line but but the line is steeper so there's it looks like there was a one regime change within the regime process that resulted in a diminution of the of the rate of decline um so in this there's a very big literature uh studying the time series processes of of unemployment uh just mentioned a few of the papers including this recent paper by du promise and all but we want to make it very clear that we're not we're not creating making a contribution to that literature that literature emphasizes that the recovery occurs at a rate that's lower than the expansion we don't make that comparison and you won't find anything about rising unemployment we just don't touch that subject this paper is entirely about recoveries um and and so what we focus on is the the extremely slow recovery rate and the uniformity of that extremely low recovery rate which we take to mean that that there's some interesting process not described by the simple dmp model that that we could learn from uh okay so so now we ask what accounts for the what we call the inexorable recovery of of u.s unemployment um and we we spent a lot of time identifying the sources of this initial value of the state variable unemployment here's just one picture from that showing the spike of layoffs and and jolt's data okay so but we look at a variety of sources of displacement of workers um you can't add these together uh but you can consider them they're all relatively small compared to the total amount of unemployment and again um it's one of the the so this direct contribution is part of the story but there's much more uh contagion so we need we need them the alter the dmp model to incorporate contagion of unemployment um okay so so here's the emp model as it arises uh in our work uh the focus is on this differential equation uh and we're gonna crank this differential equation um from a from a high starting point and it's always going to go downward uh but the rate of down how much it goes downward if if this parameter if this term uh is uh well it's not no sorry this is just the regular differential equation um so this is a standard dmp model we're going to add a term to this diff to the differential equation and then the relationship we look at normally what's emphasized in the in the dnp literature is that that we have we have endless study of this p minus w the present value of productivity minus the wage we're going to we're going to say no let's let's take that to be a constant let's let's look at how this so we're going to focus only on the differential equation we're going to treat initially we're in sheet theta as a constant then we get this phase diagram straight from pisa readies and and this implication which i already discussed um and then then we consider feedback uh from unemployment to tightness so so this is the contagion effect so we add a term to this theta function which reduces it by an amount that depends on the unemployment rate so this is an in galas an increasing function there's more there's more so leaning against tightness making tightness lower as a result of the presence of unemployment through some kind of effect um uh so then first of all if there is such a function uh the function can be computed directly out of the data so so in terms of modifying the dmp model this is this is the target if we're right that unemployment has this negative feedback effect then we can test that idea by computing the how the model would work uh and we're asserting that there's a functional relationship described by the blue line and we claim that that does look a lot like a functional relationship with a little bit of noise um if if this idea were worthless then the great the blue line which is which consists of a very large number of dots free one for each month in a 10-year period then then the blue line wouldn't would be a scanner the fact that it's really a line is very strong uh confirmation of the notion that there is such a function for something is going on uh so there's a function to be discovered here and we we assert that there's actually a very big literature uh that helps understand this from many different possibilities um and we certainly include uh fujita and raimi that just appears at the bottom of this line but there's lots of other work some of it some of it directly aimed at this topic of of the the extreme persistence of of unemployment and recoveries not so much emphasis on recovery in this but but then there's people who've written on the subject not aiming at that topic but nonetheless identifying mechanisms that would fit into the streamer so so we we don't have a sort of a definitive single model to present at this point but we do have this which i think is is a very strong indicator of where to what to think about and think about how to the extreme difference that in in in the dmp model um in chapter one uh remember that this is a horizontal line something is twisting this blue line to make it much closer to the u dot equals zero and therefore have much less action in unemployment okay so so that's the um i think i've said almost everything that's in this slide um but there there are other possibilities uh the more traditional idea is is that the driving force of dmp uh does change over time and and that so that means that there's an exogenous mechanism governing the recovery rather than relying entirely on the mechanism identified in the dnp model so we're moving the dnp model to a more central role in unemployment volatility and i think i'm just about out of time so good so if you said well what about these other forces so we write down just a set of forces here we won't go through them all but for example tfp was was the standard driving force in the dmp mode for years and people still write models but the the fluctuations in tfp which are very important uh in terms of the the volatility of say gdp are not correlated with the fluctuations in unemployment at all correlations especially recently has been almost exactly zero so so the dmp community's pretty much given up on on tfp as a driving force other things are there including papers i've written um but uh there doesn't seem to be these outside forces don't none of them seem to be particularly good uh explanations for the extreme persistence so the persistence seems to come from internally from the dmp model now so those are our conclusions um we can we can just very at the sort of highest level say this is a theory of of the gradual increase in labor supply that occurs during recovery as opposed to what we'd see as the dominant here in macro which is that the recovery is the result of of demand returning to normal gradually over time so so it's a it is a major change in uh macro theory if you block if you buy it okay that's it thank you bob and that's what you get with a veteran that was exactly 20 minutes i don't think you had a second despair um thought on that was with trimming the slides and perfect that's a veteran veteran our first discussion is going to be rob shimer uh rob will have 20 minutes let's go with that uh bob can you stop sharing so i can start oh no i insist on keeping there we go is that all i need to do yeah i think so okay uh so this is a a very uh interesting provocative and uh and long paper they look at a lot of different data sources and and try to argue for sort of a fundamental shift in thinking about what the driving forces of slow recoveries are there's i'm not going to try to go through everything which is here there's i think 33 figures in the paper pretty much 33 different data sources and 33 different ways of looking at this and so i decided that it wasn't going to be a useful discussion to try to summarize all of those different uh things but instead to take on this question about why the us recovery have been so stable over time except for the last one the current one and uh and to offer some new uh or my perspective on thinking about those facts i'm gonna come to a somewhat different conclusion i'm not sure we're ready to throw out um the some of the work that for example bob has done uh in the past or that we have strong evidence for this feedback or really any evidence for this feedback from unemployment to uh to slow recoveries um so the you know bob didn't emphasize this part so much but i like to say i don't plan to rise like a rocket and falls like a feather the falls like a feather part is the part which this paper really focuses on i'll show you some figures on that you know for for the us i'm gonna show you less than uh than what what bob and marianna show the i'll say the fact that unemployment declines slowly in the us that's clearly there in the data whether it's constant across recoveries i think is in the eye of the beholder and so if you go back to the first three post-war recoveries it was clearly faster and then you know we got six in a row that were slower and then they wrote you know came up with this fact and then we got hit by a pandemic and the fastest recovery we've ever seen um and so who knows what's you know what things are constant and what things are are not constant i'll also look at other countries and you know maybe the us doesn't uh is a bit of an outlier on some of these things um so i'm also going to do this quite informally though then the second part of the paper which bob didn't talk too much about is trying to rule out some explanations for slow recoveries and i think of this as going back to a really nice paper that bob wrote in 1995 called lost jobs or the brookings paper and i think trying to argue or one of the conclusions they reach in that part of the paper is that this sort of explanation that people lose their jobs early in a recession and take a long time to get back into stable employment that that story can't be uh driving things and i'll agree with with part of that and the reason is i'll show you using worker flow data that the slow recovery of the economy is due to a slow recovery of the job finding rate uh rather than the fact that workers keep persistently losing their job that's there in the data but it's just not nearly as big i'll demonstrate this here just in a three-state model with employment unemployment out of labor force it's also true in a simpler two-state model and so that's going to restrict some versions of the lost jobs hypothesis as it shows in the paper so following that what the paper does is just abandons uh this uh the framework that they're looking at in the early part and then goes into this long discussion of many different extensions the diane mortensen pistorius framework and in particular makes this argument that i don't think is really backed up that unemployment creates a feedback to unemployment the fact that there's a lot of unemployed workers means it's hard to to find a job so i'm not going to try to tackle that part instead what i want to do is to offer an extension to the i shouldn't really say an extension of the lost jobs framework bob's original paper at 17 states um and i'm not going to try to extend that to 18 states but i'm going to offer an extension to the version of it which is in this paper uh that shows how so the basic ideas which are in that framework might be useful in thinking about slow recoveries and i'm going to interpret this back in terms of lillian's old ideas on on sexual shifts so that's the roadmap for what i'm going to do my discussion so first of all you know this is the recent history of the u.s both recessions and uh and recoveries and you have the you know well-known fact that unemployment rises very quickly and prior to 2020 declines very very slowly and these numbers you know it is remarkable how smooth those declines in unemployment are uh during the period say from two from 2009 to uh to 2020 and you know it looks like if we hadn't been hit by pandemic who knows how low that number was going to go it's just inaccurately tracking tracking down when you look at other countries uh you know canada is kind of a country that looks like the us i could go a little bit further back in some of these countries and canada looks like the us with fast increases in unemployment and slow declines maybe not quite so inexorable you know you look at canada uh in the i guess the mid 20 teams and and things kind of slowed down for a while and then got going again you look at a country like france and i don't know it doesn't look to me like this is some inaxiable fact about how labor markets function that unemployment just keeps decreasing i'd say for france it's just unemployment just keeps staying high except for during the pandemic pandemic i think led to very different response of unemployment depending on policies the government's pursued which is also one thing we're thinking about differences in policies can mask unemployment and make it show up for example as workers who are furloughed from employment but continue to stay employed uh you know for germany maybe an extraval declines are there but it doesn't rise like a rocket it rises slowly uh so different countries different stories and i think that's one thing we have to keep in mind is it's something which is there in the background like it doesn't really matter what happens what policy is you're always going to get these inextricable declines in unemployment well countries that pursue very different policies than the us get different results on the behavior of unemployment so this may not be such a inexorable fact okay so the second thing i want to talk about is on uh worker flow data and i'm just going to run through very quickly uh what's you know it's called a three-state model workers moving between employment unemployment and non-participation and i'm going to measure i'm not going to show you how i do this but standard ways to measure the transition rate monthly transition rate of workers going from some state x say employment to some other statewide say unemployment using match cps files i'll recover the average transition rate within a month and for the six different possible transitions and then i'm going to evaluate the importance of those transitions unemployment and i'm going to do two things one thing i'm going to do is take the six instantaneous transitions and just compute at a moment in time what the unemployment rate would be if those transition rates stayed constant forever so basically what the transitions are telling us we're converging to and i'll tell you in a moment why i want to do that but what i do what i get when i do that is the gray line here the blue line is the unemployment rate in the u.s uh that i showed you before and this gray line the label ut star is what the unemployment rate would be if we followed these transitions inexorably out into the into the future and the two are very similar and actually the main reason why they're different here is because of differential selection i can only look at workers who i can follow from month to month in the cps for the gray line and that selects a slightly lower unemployment rate pool but overall i would say these flows tell you something about where unemployment is there is one exception here again which is the pandemic the peak of the pandemic the second quarter of 2020 uh the gray line is way off the the chart there and the blue line is is right at the top uh that's the biggest gap between between these numbers okay so the second thing i want to do is a version of this gray line so i'm looking constructing the flows between these six different states but now what i want to do is one at a time allow one transition rate to vary and keep the other five transition rates constant and ask what that steady state would be and each of these six panels the gray line is that steady state unemployment rate if they were all varying and the blue line is just allowing one of those things to vary and so the top left figure is the transition rate from unemployment to employment how much impact that has on the unemployment rate and you see for example during the great recession uh this decline in the transition from unemployment to employment pushed up the unemployment rate and then it led to as it the as the transition rate from unplanned employment started increasing slowly that leads to a gradual decline in the in the unemployment rate the bottom the the one below it the red line below it that's the transition rate from employment to unemployment and that also led to a spike up in the unemployment rate and to a gradual decline but it's uh smaller in magnitude the pandemic recession is very different and that's one reason i want to include it together pandemic recession i think as we know a lot of workers suddenly lost their jobs and this was initially all a story about job loss not about about workers having trouble finding jobs now as you get to the last quarter to have here which is the fourth quarter of 2020 you start seeing it get looking harder for workers to find jobs than something else we're trying to do but there's four other figures in here and it's hard to summarize all these figures together um when you look at when you look at all these and but the other ones actually start to matter and notably while on the the red lines the employment to unemployment figure which i have here that this is going up from uh because of implant unemployment it's actually going down a little bit because of employment to non-participation so workers aren't dropping out of the labor force during recessions they're moving to unemployment uh and likewise unemployment to non-participation flows those actually decrease uh during recessions as well and that pushes up the unemployment in the sort of accounting sense so when i combine these things and try to just get how much does it matter that workers aren't exiting unemployment that's what's the top figure here that really is the bulk of the movements in unemployment the middle is how much does it matter that workers are exiting employment at a faster rate they're separating either to unemployment and or to non-participation and yeah you can see this pushes up unemployment by about one percentage point for example during the great recession and then uh to six percent and then it's falling back down to five percent or maybe to four and a half percent just before the pandemic uh hits and then there's also movements out of non-participation the extensive margin the the the participation margin the labor force uh and that also matters and actually matters more than the the red line does so we're missing something in ignoring that non-participation margin but my take from all of this is a take that i've had for many years which is with the exception of the pandemic recession the bulk of the reason why unemployment rises and stays high through the recovery is because the pro that unplugged workers stay unemployed for longer and that process only recovers very slowly okay so i do all this in a two-state model i'm going to skip over that it's a similar story but i'll say the two-state model blows up in the pandemic just doesn't produce credible results in the second quarter 2020. um so what hypothesis does this rule out i want to talk about a simple version of bob's 1995 paper lost jobs i want to imagine there's workers who move between three states there's unemployed workers employed workers who are in uh unstable jobs call that b1 and we're employed workers in stable jobs call that b2 unemployed workers are all going to transition the simplest version of this they all transition into unstable jobs these are new jobs you're figuring out whether you're good you're a good match for that job or not sometimes you find out you're a good match your unstable job becomes stable that's a great gamma and then there's transitions from unstable jobs at a high rate back to unemployment and from stable jobs at a low rate back to unemployment and so this is the paper the model which is articulated uh in the paper this are three different sections three four and five and a bunch of these 33 figures in the paper that go through kind of explaining the pieces of this model not quite in these terms and why it is unable to explain the the slow dynamics of unemployment so i want to try to do it a little faster than those figures so the basic idea is we imagine that there's a one-time shock a great recession which moves a bunch of workers into the unemployed state and to get back and most of them were in stable employment and so get back to the steady state of the system it's not enough for workers to find jobs again that's going to be a fast process but they need to find stable jobs and if gamma is small then it's going to be hard for them to not to do that it's going to take them a long time to do that okay so the story can explain persistently high values of separation rates and the reason is the separation rate is a mixture between the separation rate from unstable jobs s1 and separation rate from stable jobs s2 too and as you have a lot of workers and unstable jobs coming out of a recession you get a high you get a high separation rate into unemployment but the bulk of the explanation for unemployment persistence is the job finding rate is persistent uh and in the model the job finding rate is exogenous and constant so it's just a it's a non-starter it's not going to be able to explain the bulk of the persistence and unemployment now what's the key limitation here i want to argue the key limitation is uh well either treating the job finding probability as being exogenous or staying inside this framework is the assumption of the unemployed or all identical and i want to come back to that point um in a moment before i do that i want to say after going through this stuff in three sections and uh whatever with 16 figures the paper really changes and uh what they do what uh bob maria do is explore uh diane morton's and pass reedy's model where a key assumption is that workers conditional their employment status are are homogeneous and then try to explain from that model a slow recovery in the profitability of hiring and they do this in a breakdown into a couple different types of explanations there's exogenous stories about slow recoveries the profitability of hiring because period profitability is very low that's kind of the tfp shock story that bob briefly talked about there's also things that i think are really you know really interesting that bob has worked on on discount factors and and other papers on credit market frictions that could potentially explain from other driving forces outside of the labor market let's say why firms don't find it profitable to hire workers early in recoveries and then there's a bunch of endogenous stories that they refer to and you know each of these they're referring to a bunch of papers each of these things are fleshed out in their own 40 to 60 page paper there's no way this paper can do justice to each of these stories there's no way i can do justice to what this paper does on each of those stories but one of the themes that they you know they reach and i think here it's where the paper needs more evidence is that these endogenous stories are really promising and uh moreover that they show that there's some feedback where when unemployment is high that makes it difficult for firms to hire a lot of workers and endogenously creates this low job finding probability and that's where i don't see that the evidence is really there i'm not saying it's wrong but i'm not seeing what the evidence is for that beyond sort of ruling out other culprits so i want to bring another another suspect back into uh into contention um as a you know as a alternative to the stories that they're telling here so i want to extend this my little three-state lost job story in a very simple way i want to imagine employed and unemployed workers who in addition to being employed or unemployed can have two statuses they can be stable employed or unemployed or unstable employed or unemployed and the unstable people are going to rapidly switch between employment and unemployment the stable people are going to switch at a very slow rate and they're not going to be unemployed a lot of the time so if you look down at these four equations at the bottom if you didn't have the stuff in red you would just have a model where type 1 workers switch between employment and unemployment rates s1 and f1 type 2 at rates s2 and f2 switch between employment unemployment but there's these gammas also and the gammas are things that move around whether you're in stable jobs or uh or unstable jobs there's a lot of free parameters in here you should be wary of economist bearing free parameters be wary that i'm not giving you evidence in here for any of these things as well there's more to be done on on thinking through whether these numbers these types of numbers are reasonable but the basic idea is i'm going to stick some numbers in here which say these type 1 workers half the time they're unemployed and their jobs last like a year and then they spend uh they spent a while looking for uh for new jobs it takes them like another ten months to uh to find a new job and then type two work two minutes rob two minutes yep uh i'm gonna get there type two workers uh are doing the um they're in a very different situation they find jobs quickly and their jobs last a long time it's like 50 months these are monthly calibrations and uh so the result is you get most of the workers from these stable states and there's a four percent uh unemployment rate and now i want to shock the model uh what i'm going to do is take 10 percent of my workers who were in stable jobs and move them or disable states and move them into unstable states and for the employed ones i'll also dump half of them into unemployment immediately half of those workers who moved into unstable so five percent of workers move from stable jobs to unstable unemployment and five percent from stable jobs to unstable jobs their jobs are at risk and what comes out of that is a long slow process of recovery uh both the job finding probability and to a lesser extent of the separation probability and why is this happening it's because you have a lot of workers who are in these unstable jobs don't really know how to get back into stable jobs and they have trouble finding jobs and they lose jobs at high rates and i want to say this figure qualitatively is like the kinds of figures that uh that bob and mariana are trying to hit on slow recoveries of of unemployment and being driven primarily by the job finding probability of recovering slowly so what is this story i just wanted the last minute that i have the words into into what's in the those equations so the normal process of job loss for many workers is just not that painful a thing when a worker loses a job think about you know you're working at a restaurant as a waiter critics pan the restaurant the restaurant closes down you get a new job at another restaurant next door that's not that's not a hard process for them it's part of the normal process of employment for many uh for many workers uh but some job losses are due to other things the steel industry is going into decline uh you're a steel worker there are no steel jobs that are that are left um and for those workers they need to find something else to uh to do and it's uncertain where they're going to find something else to do it's uncertain you know what sector what what location of the in the country they're going to find those kinds of jobs and those are the kinds of sectoral shifts that lillian talked about those shifts are i think we know concentrated in uh in recessions they don't lead to immediate opportunities of going someplace else but they lead to uncertainty about where those jobs might be and that's that rapid process of moving between employment and unemployment until workers eventually get a new job this is consistent with what we know about the fact that losing your job during recession on average is much worse it's associated with these kinds of events not with a restaurant closing but with the restaurant industry shutting down or maybe in the pandemic recession with retail uh shutting down and so i see you know this fast recovery in the pandemic recession is because we didn't go through the sectoral shift because for most a lot of the economy can come right back doing what it was doing before once the cove is less of a concern for some parts of the economy in particular for brick and mortar retail i think we're likely to see from here on out these more typical patterns in recovery as workers have to move into other types of activity uh and that's the kind of you know putting words on to what's in in those types of equations so uh very interesting paper i'm not yet ready to conclude that there's some uh effect of unemployment that makes it hard for unemployed workers to find jobs thank you rob you can stop sharing we'll have our next discussion come up uh icicle scene okay can you hear and see my slides i think bob made me nervous about sharing slides on mac so first of all i want to thank the organizers for inviting me to discuss this interesting and timely paper even though there's really no bad time to write a paper on unemployment this is probably the best time so what is the paper about bob and mariana start with this observation that the u.s economy recovered uniformly from every recession and what does this recovery look like job destruction subsides but unemployment remains persistently high and if you take a very stylized emp model like in colin rogerson we find a much faster recovery than what we see in the data and what they spend a lot of time on is that if you look at job losses at the onset of recessions these people will find jobs at rates that we observe in the u.s economy for job finding so we won't be able to account for this persistently higher employment and they have a rather mysterious takeaway that says unemployment itself inhibits the rebuilding process and then they put some names into this process that creates negative feedback and they summarize very interesting papers that focus on different mechanisms such as congestion or lower matching efficiency or impaired profit profitability of new matches so in my discussion first i'm going to talk about their first fact this consistent recovery pattern and what i would argue is that i see more heterogeneity than uniformity in the recoveries and then i'm going to leave that aside because i don't think consistent recovery patterns are important for the rest of the paper and i'm going to revisit colin rogerson's paper in a stylized framework and then i'll talk about key missing margins two of them the participation margin and quitting job-to-job transitions that colin rogerson already highlighted in their paper as promising promising extensions but i also i want to also add that i had another margin here that i eliminated yesterday it was about heterogeneity in unemployment risk and labor force histories that rob just discussed which i believe is an important part of the part of the missing uh missing stop missing part of the story and then i'm gonna end with whether uh there's a big difference between the traditional wheel and baba mariana's view but probably what i'll argue is that what um the traditional view that they talk about is a simplified version of what we have learned after colin rogerson's paper so let's look at the recovery pattern first so this is what they have in their paper replicated inexorable recoveries so when you look at this we're not looking at recessions because sometimes it's increasing more sometimes less but unemployment is always going down and if you actually start looking at this carefully you see kind of different slopes within the same recovery and then you see like there's some some part of it where employment doesn't go down etc so having worked at the fed the way i test the slope is to do spy directional metrics and put it in a spider chart because if the slope is the same they're just going to be on a line otherwise it's going to look like a spider and as you can see here there's some spider here and the pink one which is the recovery of the great recession is the one that's actually starting as a shallow one and then picking up later and the pandemic recession is here it's the one where unemployment rate goes down uh like a rocket so what i want to now look at is i want to look at the first four years of these recoveries because we have spent a lot of time as economists trying to understand this disconnect between gdp growth and the labor mark the so-called jobless recoveries so how come we are not seeing jobless recoveries if the slope is always the same so what i'll do is i'll look at the first four years and then bring every recovery one by one this is an early 1958. some decline and then there's a little bit of an increase so this is 1960s so this is interesting because you see a decline followed by a long period of unemployment not moving all that much this is 70s this is actually considered a jobless recovery is larger since 2005 paper you see that the slope is actually shallower and this is 1970s it kind of fits in the middle but there is uh again this kind of slowing down at the pace of the decline and this is 1980s what's interesting about this is stick decline follow this period where unemployment doesn't look and the so-called modern recoveries 1990s smaller slope but it continues to go down and 2003 the jobless recovery again steady but slower decline and greater recession bobby mariana focused on the great recession but actually kind of an outlier in terms of how shallow the decline was in the unemployment rate in the first four years and the pandemic recession i actually don't agree that we should think of the pandemic recession as a completely different uh different recession because unemployment is going down fast but we are probably missing is other margins that affected these recoveries as well starting with the temporary temporary layers but looking at this what i see in terms of a uniform behavior is that unemployment when it doesn't go up which means there's a recession almost always declines but sometimes the this progress slows down and the slowdown seems to happen in the early recoveries after rapid declines and looking at the pandemic recession and the great recession you can see that the 1980s expansion is actually somewhere in between so maybe we shouldn't discard the pandemic recession as a different recession but rather try to understand why 1980s it's kind of in between these two recoveries so my takeaway is that there's actually a lot of research originating in the recovery patterns that we shouldn't ignore because it's going to help us understand why we have the one at one side pandemic recovery and at the other side uh we have the great uh great recession recovery but i don't think consistent recovery pattern this rule of thumb about how fast employment goes now is a prerequisite for the rest of the paper that's what i'm going to talk about next so rob skipped this but let me quickly go over this unemployment changes because people flow into it at a rate st and people leave unemployment at a rate fd so this is the two-state abstraction and the paper of bob and mariana only focus on this two-state model and the steady-state unemployment rate that rob showed is shaped basically by these two flow rates and if you have a three-state model it's going to be richer but ultimately a whatever model you write you're going to have an equation like this because this is how unemployment rate evolves and i'm going to solve this uh equation forward and i'm going to write unemployment in a useful form so this is unemployment next month so it's going to depend on the steady-state unemployment rate that is determined by the flows and loss periods unemployment rate but here lambda t is going to be the rate of convergence to the steady state so if the rate of convergence is steady state just like in the u.s economy is fast unemployment is always going to be close to the steady state so why is this important so colin rogerson actually talk about this reduced form they have very different notations the 90s notation but ultimately they talk about this equation and they argue that the model can account quite well for the business cycle facts if there are two things that are satisfied and i think these are interesting this i read this paper at grad school and it's like watching a movie and not seeing new things so the first thing they argue is that it depends on the steady state where the model is fluctuating around and the second is that this outflow rate or the job finding rate it should be around one-third for a quarterly model to match business cycle effects and they're looking at very interesting job creation job destruction statistics in their model and now let's look at how this looks in the data so this these are calculated using rob's method from the cps so bob and mariana pick essentially this value for lean flow rate but one thing that we notice is the inflow rate even though we are focusing on the uniformity in the earlier recoveries we were really not getting much in terms of unemployment recovery while in the great recession this was helping us but despite that unemployment was persistently high which suggests something that bob also mentioned that the job finding rate was incredibly persistently low and if i look at the job finding rate this is the value that they pick again one thing that we see is that even though we are talking about one time shock neither inflow nor the influx flow rate are moving up and down there's a lot of persistence in both of them so i'm going back to colin rogerson's point so the outflow value that we favor is 0.5 that's what bob and mariana use and holland rogerson talk about one third for a quarterly model which is about 0.10 so now i'm going to start from 10 just like bob did and i'm going to assume that we are back to the basic numbers that we talked about but unemployment is just high and then trace the path of unemployment so what i find is that this is the figure that they have if i'm converging to a 3.5 unemployment rate this is going to be extremely quick but if i'm converging to a 15 unemployment rate because outflow rate is very low then this is going to be very persistent it's gonna take about two years instead of four months so this is what colin rogerson talked about that there's a tight link between persistent and steady-state unemployment in the economy and this again goes back to rob's point that if i'm looking at france then i am closer to an outflow rate of less than 10 percent and in that case convergence is going to be slow even if the shock dissipates it's going to take a while for the unemployment rate for the unemployment rate to recover but having said that we haven't seen fifteen percent unemployment in a possible period so why colin rogerson argued that this could be consistent with what we are saying so they are talking about two important issues one is we're talking about the two-state model but the world has three states there are some people who are non-participants so we have to be careful with this with with this mapping because even if when we talk about inflare it includes people who come from out of the labor first but when bob and mariana look at job losses they're distinctly looking at people who had jobs before the recession started so this is an important thing to consider when we are matching too late and the second one is they uh argue that temporary layers and quits are important in trying to in trying to match these facts so that's what i'm going to talk about role of participation we we have already seen a decomposition that rob showed but essentially now i'm going to look at the three-state world and this is a coming from uh my paper with mike aspie and bartoli where we decompose unemployment rate fluctuations into the components that come from fluctuations from different flows and what we find is that around two-thirds of the fluctuations in the unemployment rate is due to fluctuation of flows between unemployment and employment so the model again is a sort of a model of this part even though it's mixing up some of the flaws going into participation coming from participation and then the other one third is about this flows between non-participation and unemployment so now let's look at this for the great recession so this is the starting from march 2007 unemployment increased by more than five percentage points and it stayed persistently now i'm going to show you the contribution of each flow so this is e to you this is the one that is easiest to connect to job losses so this is peak unemployment rate and even though it's not back to where it started there is not all that much persistence this is non-participation to unemployment i don't mind i talk about people who are coming and who are entering the labor force but these are those people one thing is it's delay the second is it's more persistent so a lot of people enter the labor force every day but if they enter during every session they will have more difficulty because it's harder to find jobs so this is essentially here but on top of it there are some people who found bad jobs or who got discouraged who quit so this is this is some process that creates this feedback endogenously which is part of part of a three-state world and this is unemployment to employment uh rob already talked about this this is by far the biggest contributor and i also want to point out that this decline in unemployment rate that we have seen did not even come from the improvement in that margin for a long time and the other is unemployment to non-participation people who lose their jobs are more attached during recessions there's also extension of unemployment insurance benefits so this also keeps unemployment high during during recessions so this is one thing i think we should be very careful about and potentially incorporate into our mouths the other margin is quits and job to drop transition why does this matter so this is a nice paper from peter salvatrix red paper this is showing us origins of hires the black one hires from unemployment and even at the worst part of the great recession this is one-third people who are hired for non-participation are even bigger 45 and these are people who are hired from other jobs so the model takes a view that vacancies are posted for the unemployed and um unemployed are the only people looking for jobs so neither of these are correct true labor market tightness is not vacancy to unconcentration but it is vacancy to effective circulation and effective searches include employ and non-participants especially some subgroups of non-participants who are discouraged or who are who actually want a job but have not searched in the last four weeks so i think this is this is again highlighted in colin rogerson they speculated about us but this is an important part that we should think about because it also enlarges it creates this feedback mechanism so how does this happen so now i'm showing you minutes about two minutes perfect u2 which is a narrower unemployment rate this is the unemployment rate of job losers the reason i'm looking at this when maria spent a lot of time looking at different measures of job losses so this is this is a simple one so it goes up and recession ends it actually peaks and then goes up and the line is quits quits actually tank they they go down like a rocket and then they start going up slowly so why is this important because this tells me that when as a firm i'm posting a vacancy i'm almost all the time thinking about employed workers except for recessions so according to the se uh survey that we developed with jason faberman andy miller and georgia topa we find that 60 of applications that are sent are sent by employed workers and 75 of offers made by firms go to employed workers so if you really want to understand why vacancy creation is not responding fast or why market tightness or job finding rate is is very sluggish we really cannot ignore employed workers and as a matter of fact there's a nice paper by jan eckhart and leaderlab they compare the traditional tightness which this paper focuses on and effective labor market tightness that takes into employed workers and the effective one is the solid one you can see that the movement in that is shallower and more persistent so this is due to two things one is the composition of searches vary over the business cycle um also the effective tightness is broader than what unemployment takes into account so then i want to talk about this temporary levels quickly temporary layoffs is the opposite because they reduce the number of effective searches and they increase tightness so if you want to think about poet 19 recession we can actually do it in the same framework but we better understand on the job search and temporary layoffs better and going back to this figure you can see that i'm not seeing this prolonged pen top quick demand quits go down and up this goes up and goes down so i don't think there's too much mystery if we take into account these margins of quits and temporary layoffs into our framework so uh traditional view versus who i am crudely agree i think the tension is artificial because we are really calling a very stylized framework the traditional way and i agree with bob and mariana that there are lots of frictions that affect workers who are not job losers these are labor force entrants these are the type of workers that rob talked about they have to look for jobs every six months or so they so they will be always subject to restrictions and people who try to move from job to jobs and since most jobs are actually filled by employed workers if you really want to understand why these things persistently recover we really need to think about a model where we consider more than one-third of the workers who who feel fulfilled jobs and asylum i i i will argue that a model of this sort will not have to treat code 19 recession as an outlier thank you
