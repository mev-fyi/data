well thanks for inviting me and thanks thanks and thanks to the and jonathan and marty so this is about china's papers and since the 1990s both growth and technical fluctuation in china has changed their main characteristics so the macro policy a lot of the credit channel has been central to both growth and stabilization and the reason that we want to look at the technical patterns in addition to growth is because they're both deeply rooted in china's institutional arrangements none cannot be understood without the whole and this can be confirmed if you read various reports from state council people's bank of china national bureaus of statistics and the national federation of economic ministry so one thing i want to start it is the technical patterns this is very stark technical patterns of china's and this is the correlation between consumption and investment and this is household consumption and on the on the left left hand side is is annual growth of the consumptions and uh and investment and on the right hand side is hp filtered annual log series as you can see that this is a 10 year moving windows and this is very stark pictures before before 1990s is the correlation is about you know 0.9 so this is like typically we observe in the u.s and and then as time goes by and the correlations dropped very sharply and into the negative regions so this is a very very stark picture since the late 1990s because this is a 10 years moving windows that's why it started with the 1990s so something fundamental in china has changed since the late 1990s but what so the obvious answer is the consumptions to our investment rate consumptions to output ratios as you can see that in this chart the consumption to output ratios has been dropped very fast and since since 2000 and by almost 10 percentage points an investment to gdp ratios and rise by 10 percentage points as well but this pattern is very similar to uh many asian countries what we called newly industrialized countries and nic's in early period you can see in those early years and all those countries you have i over y which is investment over gdp going up and consumptions over gdp coming down so for korea and for japan for singapore and taiwan they're all the same in the very early periods so what's so different in china is this all about those stark very stark cyclical patterns we observed before but nothing new about the trend not so the key one the key variables is the labor shares of income so you can see that the first first row is still the consumption to output ratios and investment to output ratios but the bottom one has two measures is labor income ratios one is disposable income the household disposal income another is labor income and you can see that they all dropped very very very steeply and this is a robustness results from the various studies and for both disposal income and the neighbor incomes almost by five percentage points now if you go back to those nic countries i talked about before korea japan singapore and the taiwan and then we have a blue dashed line which is labor share in this graph and you can see that the labor share actually is going up and when when the investment to output ratios goes up and for korea and taiwan for sure for japan the correlations is not that strong but the labor shares incomes is basically flat the singapore ones we don't have data for it but the papers by young point out that in those years the labor shares in singapore is also flat as well so the main thing is that the labor shares in those countries are so different from china either going up when the investment to output ratio going up or flat at most so the two distinct distinctive chinese facts is that a simultaneous rise in the investment to output ratios and a fall in the consumption to output ratios and a decline of the labor share of income which marks a major difference from the other asian countries but there are ex there are existing explanations for those patents right i mean one i mean there's a list of it we just list two main ones one is the tfp stories in the two sectors model and that is requires if you want to twist those models require the tfu growth in the capital intensive industries has to be greater than tfp growth in the labor intensive industries that's the necessary conditions in addition to other conditions another another story is which is the relative price of investment stories and that requires the relative price of investment needs to decline but china is different so in china let's look at tfp so the tfp in china the existence evidence shows that the tfp growth in the heavy sectors and the heavy sectors mostly is a capital intensive sectors it's a sectors which i'm going to explain later on is is favored by the government and it's a large firms and most capital intensive sectors but not necessarily in all capital intensive sectors so in those you know in the heavy sectors the tip growth is actually slower than the tap growth in the light industries or at best there is no clear-cut evidence and if you look at the relative price of investment not declining china and the only thing declining is before the before the in the late 1990s and that's where where that's not where the action is taking place when action taking place the relative price by various measures investment you can use the fixed asset investment or gross fixed capital formations and you can use cpi's or you can use the price of the retail consumer goods and they are going up or flat and also you can use the pen web tables world bank tables by uh narpanonis and the niemens measures and they are also going up or flat so those two stories are not there to explain the patterns of china and of course you cannot separate that from the very striking technical patterns again here is an hp filters for the annual data and also 10 years moving windows of investment and consumption and you can see that since the late 1990s is mostly negative between investment and consumptions and more important is investment and labor income so you have labor income and you have a disposable income you have before tax income they all display very very weak correlations at most and possibly negative correlations and we can also use a very sophisticated time varying bvr to uh to try those series and we want six variables vrs with uh with consumption investment labor income gdp and two types of loans which is long-term loans and short-term loans which i'm going to come back to talk about why they're so important for central stories here and you can see that this is the trend patterns keep going up for the investment to output ratios and going down for the consumption and the labor ratios and the second component of the of of those two variables by we tried very various specifications we don't do bayesian tests we just run a bunch of models and they all point out to that the correlations is between 0.55 to 0.05 between the investment and consumptions and between the investment and labor income is minus 0.6 and minus 0.23 but in short negatively correlated or probably at most very weakly correlated so why has china's micro economy changed so drastically since the late 1990s so there are two changes it's very important related to the macro policies and connected to the banking sectors one is in 1995. there is enacted the people's bank of china's law and other banking laws with the decentralizations of banking system which ironically has led to the concentration of large loans to large firms because it's supposed to decentralize banking system but instead you get the concentrations of large loans to our firms which i'm going to talk about that later more and then the another one is in march 1996 which is the eighth national people's congress of china and approved this five years plan that's the first five years plans and since since china opened its market is having a strategic plan to develop infrastructures real estate basic basic industries like metal products autos and high-tech machineries and other heavy industries like petroleum and telecommunication and you can see that those are the what we call heavy industries and also very very capital intensive industries so the model we have in order to capture those institutional details is a theoretical model with an open economy without with a fixed fixed interest rate okay so so in this economies you'll see that what we have is having heavy heavy sectors with approximated by the capital intensive industries and you have light light sectors will have labor in there so it's a labor intensive sectors and those two sectors and taking as intermediate goods and form the final goods in the competitive final goods ones we take the um is having the ces technology so the interesting part here is the government so for the government is government is basically communicating with the heavy sectors and in other words the government owns or controls the heavy sectors so government is willing to put some net worth which is nt goes to the heavy sectors and heavy sectors and we turn all the profits back to the government and the workers is going to save and consume and in this models we assume that the workers cannot invest anything into uh into the um into the uh and then invest and then has to go through the bank which is more accurate for china than for the western countries so you can see that the banks has a long term so the bank actually has a two bank two types of banking one is what we call green banking another is called we call the yellow banking the green banking is the banks that make the long-term investment loans which is following this 1996 strategic plan and with the collateral constraint okay i'm going to explain why there's a collateral constraint in this in this screen banking loss and you have a yellow banking which is not green but they cannot make a long-term investment to uh to to to the firms and then they only can allow and and to the light to the light sectors they can only allow to the right sectors the short-term loans which is financing the working capital and with the convex cost of the known processing and we're going to explain why those those features are important in terms of chinese institutional details so this is a theoretical model we have and and with this model and one of the key parameters is the elasticity of substitution and we have to estimate it so typically what you're going to have is just following as a mugu and grace papers is looking at the value ratio and the quantity ratios and wrong regressions but also we're concerned about industries so what we do is that we put this frameworks into the restricted var as you can see that the the the second row here is basically is is this equations and then the first row is having all the lags in there so this is a restricted vr if you do the likelihood likelihood based estimation of this in dot you know simultaneous system the simultaneous system is that if you look at this contemporaneous coefficient there's no restrictions now simultaneously determined and one can prove that this is analogous to utilizing a large number of lagged variables as instrumental variables so we can actually even show this system is globally identified so no matter where you estimate it is identified uniquely identified and then if we estimate it the point parameters we use amongst the data either use a seasonal adjusted data or non-seasonal adjusted data you get point estimate is 0.2.32 with air bands are very tightly estimated they're all above one in fact we make draws of those basic straws and we don't get any of those below 1. so if you if you use these models and you'll see that c over y is declining and y over y y and i over y is increasing and the labor share is declining on top of that this model tells you that the bank loans which is the heavy ones and versus the the the light ones is going up the revenue ratios between those two sectors heavy versus light is going up and capital stock is going up are those are those can be supporting the data and yes it is there is a collaboration from the disaggregated data we are looking at the manufacturing data and the manufacturing data tell us that they have heavier and light and you can see that the growth output heavy and light ratios since late 1990s is keep going up same thing with capital stock is keep going up moreover you have loans the long-term loans to short-term loans is going up both in terms of the new loans lend to the firms and also loan under and outstanding so what is this green banking and the yellow banking business here so what's happening is that the green banking ones is adopt this preferential credit access by the heavy firms because the chinese government central government policy is saying that we're going to have a heavy industrialization policy so we are going to have a very very easy access rendered to those heavy firms but that's not all there's a local government the local government actually is going to place the implicit loan guarantees by requiring the capital why is that because the local government knows that the central government has the strategies to support heavy industries so therefore as a local government and knows that okay this is what central government wants so have implicit guarantees to uh learn to for the banks to make those large loans to those large firms but also requires the the capital as a collateral so that those firms will generate big revenues big taxes tax and why that's good because local government officials needs to get promoted so therefore anything big in china is a good thing for them so the bank will go to those bank relentless to the green bankings but anything left over for the yellow banking and then to those light industries is to suffer some targeted quotas in china and some other implicit costs which prevent them to uh to have a very easy access even for the short-term loans in fact if you look at interest rates and a lot of short-term loans oftentimes is at 18 just for the working capitals so that is the institutional details for the and for green banking and the euro bank is in fact you know if we look at the data you can see that a lot of like the median term and the long-term loans and uh it's it's about the shares the median turnout norm is about over 75 percent in the recent years and belongs to the heavy industry in those media and long-term loans is almost 90 percent and then as i said i talked already before that for the local government and they have implicit government guarantees so the yellow banking ones is very interesting because many small firms are concentrated in the labor intensive industries so if you read the people's bank of china's various reports on the chinese monetary policy its actual reviews reveal something very very interesting it's saying that the chinese government often increased medium and the longer term norms are the sacrifice of short-term loans because this is due to the overall loan quotas so that's why our first derivatives of this cost is really designed to capture this kind of cost you know and as well it's a very very implicit cost in there so if you generate this and you shock this credit once so this will be cyclical pattern okay the second pattern will say hey consumption comes down investment goes up because the crowded out effect okay you invest a lot but quite a lot those working capital loans which is supposed to be going to a very productive light sectors in china so you can have this opposite movement and you have labor labor income is coming down too and the long-term loans rises and short-term loans falls relative to output and that's the data the data says that in china that if you look at right after 19 2008 financial crisis you have this huge four trillion physical stimulus in china it's all put in the infrastructures and uh and long-term loans and spike spikes up and short-term loans actually is flat or even declining so that's precisely the data supporting it and then if you compare to the u.s data and in the u.s data the correlations is is about 0.6 and the chinese state is all negative so in short to explain the tr striking facts our framework does not rely on tfp assumptions or nor the relative price of investment goods but it does rest on institutional details by taking account of the credit channels this very very unique financial arrangement between the two sectors and also this preferential central government policy as well as local governments implicit guarantees so hoping that this framework will offer some constructive frameworks for studying chinese economy thank you
