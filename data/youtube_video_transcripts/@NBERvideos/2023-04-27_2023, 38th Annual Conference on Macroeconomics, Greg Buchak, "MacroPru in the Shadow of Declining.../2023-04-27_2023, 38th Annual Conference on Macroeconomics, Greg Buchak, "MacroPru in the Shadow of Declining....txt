right um thank you very much to the organizers for putting the paper on the program this is Joint work with tomek and Ahmed who are in the room and Gregor Matt Fosters at Northwestern and our paper we're thinking through how to think about macro Prudential policy in a world where Banks do less and less lending on their balance sheets so what do I mean by that uh currently Banks sell a large share of the loans they originate so this is true in mortgages this is true in auto loans it's true in credit cards it's true in corporate loans it's true in many many credit markets uh here and around the world uh in the mortgage Market Banks now sell about 50 of the loans they originate okay and it goes beyond this now non-bank lenders are getting into the game and they're originating a large share of loans as well it's true in the same markets uh and again in the mortgage Market non-banks are making about 60 percent of all the loans out there and so putting those two things together what you find is that bank balance sheets are financing only about 20 of of residential loans okay and what we're going to be after in our paper is thinking through how the failure to recognize what sort of call the aspect of this i o of the financial sector can lead to systematic errors in measurement and accounting in terms of aggregate time series patterns and Regional patterns and also will lead researchers and policy makers to sort of think through mispecified or misestimated macro Finance models so what are we going to do in this paper the first thing will be a measurement exercise and what we'll do is document a lot of time and Regional variation in what I'm going to Define shortly as a loan sale and Shadow Bank multiplier I'll show you that these multipliers respond endogenously to what is a key State variable in a lot of macro Finance models which is Bank capitalization and then I'll show you how failing to account for these multipliers will lead to some qualitative and quantitative errors in inference when thinking through the health of the lending Market overall okay then in the second part of the paper we're going to write down an economic quantitative model with a richer intermediation sector and we're going to use this model to Think Through impulse responses uh to financial shocks in a world with and without these margins of substitution and then we're going to do an exercise where we document the sort of inferences a a researcher or a policy maker would make if he or she had a mispecified model or estimated that model with data that doesn't fully capture these margins of substitution okay and and sort of the the policy and research implications here are that it's going to be very important to incorporate what we'll call the i o of the financial sector in a lot of these macro Finance models okay so our Focus here uh it's going to be on the 11 trillion plus U.S residential mortgage lending Market as you may know this is the largest private debt Market in the U.S and what's really going to be nice about this market for our exercise is the data is very good so we'll be able to observe every single loan origination whether it's financed through a bank balance sheet or through something else okay and these lessons are going to apply to other market segments where we know sort of anecdotally that this shifting away from bank balance sheet lending is happening but it's just harder to observe in the data that's available okay so let me first Define what we'll call the loan sales lending multiplier and we'll look at bank I at time T and that bank's total lending will be equal to this multiplier times the bank's balance sheet lending so bank balance sheet lending will be a subset of its total lending and just rearrange this definitionally we'll find that this loan sale multiplier is equal to one over one minus that bank's loan sales share okay so that's at the bank level we can also Define this as at a sort of aggregate level and measure total Bank lending as the aggregate loan sale multiplier times bank balance sheet Lending okay second multiplier we'll think about is the shadow Bank lending multiplier and again we're going to Define total lending or aggregate lending as this Shadow Bank multiplier which will vary over time times total Bank lending and again rearranging that you get that the multiplier is equal to 1 over 1 minus the shadow Bank share okay then putting these things together sort of total lending in the economy will be the shadow Bank multiplier times the loan sale multiplier times this bank balance sheet lending uh uh amount okay and so for various reasons regulators and academics are often sort of focused on this bank balance sheet lending component of that part of that is because sort of traditionally that's where we think of a lot of financing coming from and partly that's what's really easy to measure in a lot of data if you go and look at bank balance sheets call reports that's kind of what you'll observe so that would be fine if the world that we lived in was a world where Banks were doing uh everything with their balance sheet so if Shadow Bank lend if there were no Shadow Banks Shadow Bank lending multiplier would be one if banks retained everything they originated on their balance sheet the loan sale multiplier would be one and then measuring total lending with balance sheet lending is the right thing to do but as I'm about to show you this is just not the world that we live in so this is the composition of lending in the Residential Mortgage Market the red is the bank balance sheet lending this is what you would observe if you just looked at sort of Bank call reports the blue is what banks are originating but are selling very quickly and the green is so-called Shadow bank origination okay and what I'm going to do is sort of translate these into the multipliers I just defined and go through a couple important facts about these uh the Dynamics of this okay so the first fact is that there's dramatic time variation in these multipliers so what I'm showing here is sort of traditional bank balance sheet model if that's the model we live in then this multiplier would be one I'll lend it I'll uh I'll layer on the loan sale multiplier two things to notice the average is over two so it's a big quantitative number and there's a lot of Time series variation in this I'll layer on the shadow Bank lending multiplier again the average is well above one it's about one and a half and there's a lot of Time series variation there okay then multiplying these together you get the total multiplier the average is something like three and a half there's dramatic spikes it's very small uh there's troughs right now it's about four and a half meaning for every loan that's originated on a bank balance sheet there's about four and a half loans that are like really originated out there in the economy okay so the fact that there's a lot of Time series variation in this means that balance sheet lending is going to be sort of a poor proxy for total lending that's going on in the economy and the the exercise we're going to do is regress total Bank lending on bank balance sheet lending or or will regress aggregate lending on Bank total Bank Lending and we'll find that uh we'll do this either at the aggregate level or we'll do it at the at the county level we'll find that we're able to explain something only like 44 of the variation in total Bank lending with just balance sheet bank balance sheet Lending uh at the county level that that number is is about the same you can add in county and year fixed effects and you're still not really able to explain a lot of the variation then in terms of total lending total Bank lending can only explain something like 70 percent of total lending in the economy okay so there's a lot that's left unexplained if you're only observing the balance sheet so putting facts one and two together it's going to mean that there's sort of big inference errors if you're trying to get to Total lending from observing just bank balance sheet lending so with simple exercise you could do is just say okay let's scale up bank balance sheet lending by the long term average uh if you do that you'll get this red dotted line and what you can see because of this time variation you're going to get these systematic and persistent overshootings and undershootings in terms of how you measure this stuff okay that's true both at bank at the at the bank level and then it's true sort of an aggregate lending level that's going to suggest the fact that there are these sort of persistent overshooting and undershooting of this that there's some important state variable behind this that we want to think about and try to identify and we're going to identify that as uh Bank capitalization so what we'll do on the left is just regress the fraction of loans that are retained on balance sheet on the sort of aggregate Capital ratio in the economy on the right we'll do that within Banks and we can see that when banks are better capitalized they're retaining more on balance sheet meaning this multiplier is going to be moving up and down with a lot of uh with this kind of Key State variable okay and then sort of finally the last fact is I've been focusing mostly on time series variation there's also a lot of regional variation in this as well so in the upper left I'm showing you the launch the loan uh the sold share uh so what banks are originating and selling and on the lower right I'm showing you the shadow Bank share and again there's a lot of regional heterogeneity and if you kind of look at the demographics that this lines up with you'll see things like low income areas have large share of loans uh sold by Banks and they have a greater presence of Shadow Banks so to the extent that there's some concern about the differential risk of these people or different uh access to credit these margins are going to be very important to them okay so those are sort of the empirical facts uh that are going to motivate the model we've showed you that if you sort of ignore these facts you're going to miss uh uh sort of measurement and and sort of aggregate conclusions about what's going on we want to write down a model that will sort of let us think this through in the in the in the context of some policy counter factuals that uh that people will often do okay so we want to write down a model that will have this loan sale margin that will have the shadow Bank margin and then importantly we want this to be able to vary endogenously and realistically with the key State variable that's driving a lot of these models which is Bank capitalization okay so how are we going to do it we're going to add Dynamics to essentially an i o style model that me and co-authors have worked on previously the work that the i o is going to do here is going to tell us how Banks and non-banks compete with each other how good they are in terms of providing substitute credit for one another um and then uh what's going to be there is their their sort of endogenous competition and an endogenous Bank financing choice we'll add Dynamics to that by incorporating Bank Capital as the key State variable and that will evolve over time and drive the decisions that banks are making okay and then with the calibrated model we're going to trace out impulse responses to Capital shocks with these margins on and with these margins off think about what the margins are doing to lending responses in the economy and then as I mentioned we'll do this exercise where we'll sort of Pretend We're an economist who who isn't aware of these margins and tries to ca to calibrate a model without them and think about the inference errors you would make if you were running a model like that okay so the the model setup I'll talk through the within period Market first this is sort of like the i o part of the model there's going to be an exogenous loan demand people like loans they dislike interest rates and then they have some preferences over uh the lenders so they view Banks and non-banks as different for example what the i o is going to tell us is what these markups look like how Banks and non-banks are substitutable or not okay then there's going to be a loan Supply from short-lived Shadow Banks and they'll just be maximizing profits they'll set it they'll take other people's interest rates as given set interest rates to maximize that and then banks will be long-lived they'll have this similar profit function where they're setting interest rates and importantly they're also making a financing Choice which is given by fee so fee equals zero means the bank sells the loan fee equals one means the bank retains the loan on balance sheet that's going to make a difference for the marginal cost that the bank faces think of that as some uh as representing some securitization cost as being a reduced form uh for some selection that the bank might engage in when choosing which loans to sell and retain okay it's also going to have a capital impact which I'll talk about on the next slide which is where we go through the bank's Dynamic problem okay so Bank Capital will follow this law of motion we'll say that next periods capital is equal to a shock times this period's Capital plus investment that goes into the firm so I equals I is positive means we're raising capital I is negative means we're taking dividends out of the firm plus the firm's profit from lending okay now as sort of a shorthand way to capture a sort of net worth constraints or regulatory penalties that show up in a lot of these models we're going to Define an effective Capital ratio as um sort of what the regulator is paying attention to and it will be equal to the shocked Capital minus the capital that is deployed to finance the loans that the bank is retaining on balance sheet okay so uh with that in mind the flow utility for a period given the rate R the retention Choice fee and the regular the regulatory penalty row which is going to again capture Regulators punishing the banks for being poorly capitalized and investment I the banker uh will like consuming dividends and then they'll sometimes be penalized if their capital is too low okay and then what the bank is trying to do is maximize uh its its value function which is the the discounted sum of its uh period utilities choosing the path of interest rates uh retention choice and investment into the bank okay so that's sort of the the Baseline model that has these margins we're going to compare this with the uh what I'll call the neither margin model which will do two things it will get rid of Shadow Banks and then it will force Banks to retain everything that they own on balance sheet and we're going to sort of compare these two models so we'll calibrate the models uh uh with a sort of a bunch of moments in the data let me just kind of highlight the key things we're going to be matching the Dynamics of these multipliers so we'll try to get the levels of them right we'll try to get the variance of them right and then importantly we'll try to get the correlation between bank balance sheet capital and bank balance sheet lending right and the model is going to endogenously generate uh these moments okay so with the calibrated model I'll just walk you through some intuition with the bank's policy function the blue will be the Baseline model and the dotted red will be the model with the margins turned off the kind of key intuition that's going to be common across all of this is that with these margins shocks to bank Capital are going to cause the bank to substitute towards these other financing sources instead of of changing things around through interest rates or quantities without the margins the bank is going to have to finance things on balance sheet which will mean that there will be big increases in interest rates and big effects on quantities okay so what do you notice first as we plot responses along Bank capital in the Baseline model and in the neither margin model nothing is really happening when the banks are well capitalized this only matters when the bank is in a sort of region of the state space where they become impaired on their balance sheet um the upper left I'm showing uh the fraction of loans that the bank retains on balance sheet mechanically in the neither margin model they retain everything um but in the model where they're allowed to substitute off they kind of endogenously start selling loans rather than financing them on their uh expensive balance sheets so upper right that's showing the bank's investment policy the bank when they're well capitalized they're paying out a small dividend and when they're poorly capitalized they go out and raise capital how does that get translated into interest rates so on the lower left you see in the Baseline model when the bank is sort of poorly capitalized they have to substitute towards slightly more expensive off-balance sheet financing so rates rise a little bit but it's much smaller than the effect uh when Banks don't have the substitution margin they have to sort of Finance these things on balance sheet Capital which is very expensive and then of course that translates into big changes in quantities as well okay so with the model we're going to do these impulse responses uh the sort of policy experiment we're going to have in mind here is we'll give a big negative shock to Capital think of this like one of the assets on the bank has a big impairment in its value and we'll Trace out what happens across the scenarios okay uh upper left that's showing what happens to the bank's Capital with the same shock we give them the same shock the kind of important thing to notice there are a couple things to notice first the Baseline kind of steady state level of capital is going to be higher with these margins turned off okay so what's going on there well when the bank relies on the balance sheet to earn profits to sort of do its loan financing it's sort of uh that balance sheet space is much more valuable to the bank so the bank wants to be more conservative in the amount of capital it has on the other hand when this alternative way to finance loans and earned profits exists the bank can be a little bit more risky in terms of the steady state level of capital that it's maintaining okay and then you can see that in the response to the shock in the Baseline model with that big shock the bank can recover a lot more quickly because they can recapitalize through retained earnings that they get through selling loans in the secondary Market it's much harder for them to do that if they have to originate on their impaired balance sheet okay so how does this look in terms of lending quantities and rates the upper right shows what happens to interest rates with no margin there's a big impact on interest rates it's about one percentage point which translates into about a 30 percent increase over the the Baseline level uh and in terms of quantities it's about a sixty percent reduction in the amount of lending and you can see when these margins exist the size of these shocks as translated to The Lending Market are much much smaller because they can substitute towards other financing sources okay so in the in the last bit of the talk I'm going to walk you through this sort of miscal mispecified calibration exercise and the the sort of exercise we have in mind here is there's going to be a researcher who gets the measurement a little bit wrong and gets the model a little bit wrong and so what do they do in terms of measurement they'll measure total lending which is kind of the easy thing to measure from for example fed flow of funds and they'll measure Bank capitalization which is easy to measure uh from Bank call reports and then they'll put this together in a model that omits this loan sale and Shadow Bank multiplier okay and then we're going to calibrate a model like that to the moments we see in the data to show you exactly what we're doing in the Baseline specification that's what I showed you before allowing these margins to be active and we're trying to hit the correlation between balance sheet lending and Bank Capital ratios in this counter factual calibration we're turning off the margins and we're trying to hit the correlation between total lending and Bank Capital ratios which empirically is a much much smaller correlation because in the true data generating process these margins of substitution exist okay so this is the the result we get um so I'm showing the the blue is kind of the the Baseline model calibrated correctly with both margins the red solid line is the Baseline calibration calibrated correctly but we've just turned the margins off and the dotted red is the counter factual calibration that sort of forgot about these margins when doing the calibration and what we get is that the sort of predicted response of the mispecified calibration kind of Falls halfway in between uh the sort of true model with both margins and the true model with neither margin active so what's going on there well the mispecified calibration is kind of forced to thread this very uncomfortable set of empirical facts which are that total lending and Bank Capital uh actually have a pretty low correlation in the data because again the true data generating process uh sort of dampens that relationship however bank balance sheet lending and Bank Capital they have a high correlation because balance sheets actually matter so the model that doesn't have these margins has to sort of jointly rationalize these things and it has a very hard time doing that a model that does have these margins active can do that much more easily and sort of hit both of these at the same time okay so uh let me conclude we do two things we we do measurement we showed you that balance sheet lending is a poor proxy for Bank lending and total lending overall and that deviation is large in time varying and it's varies endogenously with which with a very important state variable in many of these models we wrote down a model that has that active uh we showed you uh uh sort of how a model that doesn't have these things active can make mistakes in terms of thinking through the impact of of shocks to Capital and uh I'll sort of end it here with just some big picture comments on measurement going forward hopefully we kind of underscore the limitations of only looking at bank balance sheets when thinking through lending it's it's important to collect data and make available data on these margins outside of a Residential Mortgage Market where we know this thing is going on but it's very hard to observe and then without incorporating these margins uh there's sort of a big scope for making sort of policy macro macro potential policy mistakes uh not thinking through these margins okay so I'll stop there
