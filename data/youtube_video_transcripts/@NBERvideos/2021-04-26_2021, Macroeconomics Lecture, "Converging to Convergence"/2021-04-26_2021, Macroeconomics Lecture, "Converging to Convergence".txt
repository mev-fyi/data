thank you so much um so uh this is joint work with jack willis of columbia and yang yu who's uh currently a grad student at harvard but who's going to the hku finance department next year and as you heard jack and i will be sharing the presentation you know this uh this paper got its start uh several years ago when i was teaching development economics to grad students and jack was the teaching assistant for the class and i normally start the class with some facts including facts on growth and i draw on the empirical literature from the 90s when when i was a grad student and when there was just a lot of empirical research on the determinants of growth and a key stylized fact from that time and that is you know put in textbooks and that i until several years ago i i used to teach was that there's no tendency for convergence um maybe we could go next slide and this is a uh example of of of showing that relationship from the 90s uh here's a here's a quote from barrow who did a lot of work on this area um you know if anything this growth this graph of growth rates against uh log gdp per worker is maybe slightly upward sloping um and pritchett has works pointing out that if you take a longer run historical perspective there's clearly been divergence from 1870 to 1990 the ratio of per capita incomes between the richest and the poorest countries increased by roughly a factor of five so that's um your one response to this is is is so obviously this is a challenge to the idea that growth is based either on accumulation of capital with decreasing returns or models where copying technology is is easier than developing it and one response to this is a set of endogenous growth models uh for example ak models that would would predict divergence so romer 1986 for example there are also people who have had poverty trap models at the country level um another response was the conditional convergence literature which argued that if you control for human capital or policies or perhaps institutions then you would get uh can you would get convergence conditional on that so there was very strong convergence within the oecd for example so we you know in updating the the things for the class you know but maybe that fact's not right maybe we should check it and indeed um there's the here's the here's the uh the relationship and for the decade by decade you can see that since the 2000s there's quite strong convergence um that's obviously very hard to reconcile with any type of ak growth model which would predict uh divergence um probably with uh poverty trap models as well we've done some checking for that um so we're going to focus a lot on conditional convergence models just because they're at least you know at first pass might be um consistent with us okay before we go on um this shows things uh uh in just a somewhat more more detailed uh uh year by year what the beta coefficient is you can see that there's a a a strong co trend towards convergence since the 1980s um you might even say that it's converging towards convergence uh since that period and this leads to about 0.7 uh convergence rate at the end of the period that's less than borrows 2 to iron law but still substantial change okay um the um okay um let me let me mention a couple of um of of and this is very hard as i say hard to recognize now with the ak models um you can let me mention a couple of other papers uh johnson and papa georgia look at this data they're somewhat they still argue there's convergence because they look at the whole period since 1960. we um we think it's worth breaking this out a little bit but you know we agree if you look through the hope for the whole period you you don't see a convergence more closely related i think are some papers uh um by uh royadol and patadol uh arvind subramanian is uh author of both of those and i think those find results that are are quite similar to the ones we have but we'll take it in a particular direction why don't we go ahead um one thing is we tried to break this out it doesn't look like um you know growth we find that growth has increased in all income quartiles except except the richest since the mid-1980s partly this is a matter of faster catch-up so growth increased in the first through third quartiles from the early 80s until the early zero zeros and then falsehoods um there's partly a slowdown at the frontier so the fourth quartile growth you can see dropped dramatically uh since the late 90s it was the fastest growth growing in the 80s and then slowed down so that that's when we we tried to look here is this some sort of threshold level of income you get above that and then you start to converge it doesn't really we we didn't find a lot of evidence for that type of story when we go on so one question is is this just you know maybe this is just a blip uh it's just a temporary uh a temporary fact uh thing you know roderick noted some related facts in 2013 they're pointing to high commodity prices i think it's getting harder not impossible to to tell that story now that trends been going on so long it also seems robust to removing research-rich countries it doesn't seem to be driven just by china and india or sub-saharan africa um you know the it it doesn't look like this is either driven only by the reduction in growth disasters although there's been a dramatic reduction in growth disasters or an increase in growth miracles you know if we're thinking about this in terms of the conditional conditional convergence literature uh you can think of two types of stories one would be that there's faster convergence condition on uh covariance like human capital policies institutions culture you know that could be due to globalization that makes uh easier for technology to flow across areas or trade and communication the other story would be maybe the determinants of of of income levels in the conditional convergence literature have themselves uh improved and converged uh so and you might it is interesting that a lot of this happened since the mid-80s or so you know maybe this has something to do with the end of the cold war the huge growth of democratization the fallen conflict uh and perhaps the rise of the washington consensus um so let me turn it over to jack to take it from here thanks very much michael um so so so digging a little into this the second of those of those stories so the the convert the convergence of the of the determinants of the steady state level of income um while the recent literature on sort of growth in institutions seeks to identify the causal impacts of institutions and culture on development through their historical determinants um emphasizing their stability and persistence we would argue that whilst their their empirical strategy sort of means that they have to focus on historical uh determinants this is not their findings are not inconsistent with the fact that other important determinants of growth could be changing potentially quite rapidly recently and so to study whether such correlates of income and growth have been changing and and and how uh we make the following imperfect classification of such correlates so we begin with the sort of solo fundamentals or enhanced solo fundamentals which are investment rate population growth rate and years of education those variables which are which feature in the in the solar model and and uh are in sort of all growth regression papers then we turn to short run correlates those for which we have time variation and we think may change on a on a short time uh period um typically going to be policy variables then we can think of long run correlates those correlates which are going to change very slowly or potentially not even at all and we're not going to have time varying data for them and these can be typically sort of institutions or or geographical variables and then culture okay and so we're going to first of all study the evolution over the last 50 years of of these groups of of correlates of growth and income so for the solo fundamentals and the short run correlates to avoid cherry picking we start from the correlates which are listed in the in the in their chapter on growth economics from the handbook of economic growth those those variables which are which are listed as as being in in important growth uh growth regression papers in the literature so we construct a panel of the variables which are available for at least 50 countries since 96 um we find 35 policy and institution variables um and we put them in we we classify them in five domains um this leads to an unbalanced panels of of variables which are in different units and so we have a number of sort of econometric challenges uh one thing we do is we start from 1985 for this for this analysis if possible um the first date which is available if if those variables are not available by 1985. we also go further back and report trends since 1960 but the data availability is more patchy we standardized correlates by their variance in 1985 throughout some other econometric issues we can send that measurement error might generate beta convergence through mean reversion and so we also look at sigma convergence um there's top coding discreteness this leads us to choose variables accordingly to try and avoid such issues and also to try and reduce uh the role of of noise we we we do exercises with different aggregates of correlates so the results of this of this first exercise so overall we find that solar fundamentals and short-run correlates have improved and converged substantially from 1985 to today so this is a table just summarizing the changes for some of the most important variables uh those in red are the solo fundamentals those in blue are other short short run correlates so 18 of the 20 variables that we looked at are highly correlated with income in 1985 that's that that's what the second column is showing of these 18 15 improved significantly so column three shows in units of the standard deviation in 1985 what was the average change from 1985 to 2015. here what we mean by improved we should be very specific we mean moved on average in the direction associated with higher income so at the same time there's this improvement there was also a convergence so 17 out of 20 of these variables converge significantly and if we look back before 85 from 1960 onwards this is a less careful analysis because as i say variables are becoming available over time for different countries but we find a similar but slower trend towards convergence and improvement so we also did a similar exercise with culture which i think we would tend to think of as fairly stable so we did this using the world value surveys um there we find out of 10 cultural variables that we look at we found convergence in innate at an average conversion beta convergence rate of of three percent and uh just to just highlight there's a substantial literature in in political science and sociology uh studying these trends and and their causes so overall pretty substantial improvement and convergence in these institutions across countries so then the next obvious natural question is to what extent are these two sets of trends uh related so michael showed you a convergence to towards a trend towards convergence in income and then i showed you a convergence in the correlates of growth in income since 1985. now obviously answering this question causally is going to be very difficult we're not going to aim to do that sort of causally the the the relationships could go either way so modernization theory would suggest that as incomes increase policies institutions culture modernize on the one hand on the other hand growth theory growth regressions which suggest that as policies and institutions improve then growth will become become faster so recent literature uses instrumental variables and historical approaches to try and identify both of those directions causally so daron for instance has has work doing looking at both directions for the link between democracy and incoming growth we're instead just going to update two cross-country uh regressions essentially um see what's happened to them and this is going to have the advantage that it lets us to think of it it allows us to think about what's happened to conditional convergence relative to absolute convergence so in particular so regression one on this page is what is what michael presented the sort of canonical unconditional convergence regression and we've seen a trend in that beta over time then we look at well what's happened to the correlate income relationships so just regressing correlates policies institutions culture on income then we look at what's happened to growth correlate relationships so classical growth regressions so regressing in our case it's going to be 10-year growth regressed upon income and then correlates which also is the same as the conditional convergence regressions and then the advantage of thinking about two and three together and trends in delta and trends in lambda is that just the simple immediate variable bias formula when when doing this one correlate at a time tells us that the gap between absolute convergence and conditional convergence is just the product of those two slopes the correlate income slope and the growth correlate slope so as we see what's happened to those two slopes this is going to give us a an inclination for whether absolute convergence has has has trended towards conditional convergence so i'll walk through those results quickly the main specification is comparing 1985 to sort of today um but we also present trends since 1960 although again before 1985 the data availability is more is more patchy so that's a sort of secondary analysis so first of all the correlate income relationship so regressing uh policies and institutions on income slopes since 85 have to today have changed relatively little for all of the classes of correlates that we consider although changes in income predict little of the changes in the correlates if we took those baseline 1985 relationships as causal so the levels of these relationships have changed quite a lot on growth regression coefficients they're relatively stable for solo fundamentals so in 20 in sort of 2005 to 2015 the coefficients look fairly similar to they did in 1985 to 1995. um so we view that as a success for for neoclassical growth model for the neoclassical growth model although this is partly mechanical for population growth um short-run correlates policies show much less persistence and their coefficients have have shrunk substantially long run correla long run correlates and culture cultural variables are somewhere in between so they they have also shrunk uh quite a lot but they show more persistence than the the short run correlates so linking those two trends together if we think about what's happened to the emitted variable bias from not conditioning on correlates when we think about absolute convergence or when we think about convergence so remember the the difference between the absolute convergence coefficient and the conditional coefficient conditional convergence coefficient efficient can be just written as the product of these two slopes so this is shrunk from 1985 to 2005. so what this plot is is correlate by correlate here i'm just showing you for the for the solo fundamentals and the short one correlates the that that the product of those two um slopes on the x-axis in in 1985 and the same product on the y-axis in 2005. and so you can see there's been a general flattening um and and reduction so most of these uh points are beneath the 45 degree line and you can see that the if if we fit a line to those to those points um there's much more uh uh the autocorrelation uh for the solo fundamentals than for the for the other short run correlates and so what's this telling us well if this if this difference is greater than zero then conditioning on these variables increases convergence if it is less than zero conditioning decreases convergence and so there's been a general reduction in the effect of of conditioning and so absolute convergence has in a sense uh converged towards conditional convergence uh this is to show you the trend in those average variables since since 1960 as i say this is more speculative because before or or less precisely done carefully done because before um 1985 uh many of the variables are missing for for many countries and so the reason there's a lot of lines is because we tried to do a balance panel exercise but similar results the if anything these are emitted variable bias leaders the distance between conditional convergence and absolute convergence sort of peaked in in around 1980 and has since reduced substantially although remained relatively stable for for solar fundamentals one minute warning sure thank you and so we the multivariate approach is is tricky because um because there's many ways in which you can do this but this is just to show that um overall we think that absolute convergence has has trended towards conditional conditional convergence so to conclude to pull those results together so there's been a trend towards income converters since 1990 convergence since 2000. policies institutions and culture have converged towards those of rich countries since 1960 faster since 1980 growth regressions for solar fundamentals have remained relatively stable while those for other correlates were largest in the 1980s and have since shrunk substantially um absolutely absolute convergence has converged towards uh conditional conversion since 1990. and so what changed we had this correlates were converging before 1990 but it's only post 1990 where their regression coefficients seem to have shrunk so is this to do with faster convergence conditional on on correlates which could be uh related to globalization or is this indeed to do with the convergence of correlates through the end of the cold war democratization washington consensus etc which is what our analysis is focused on are speculative narrative it is speculative i don't don't think we we fundamentally know um but it this is this has the advantage of parsimony is that our measures of policies and institutions are noisy measures of some fundamentals which which really do matter since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 and the adoption of the washington consensus there's been rapid convergence in policies institutions both in our measures of them and in the fundamental fundamentals remaining differences in our measures may not be indicative of remaining differences in fundamentals so thank you very much and we should apologize to the to the discussants because we were working on this right up to the to the wire and we're very much looking forward to that discussion thank you thank you jack our uh first discussion is rohini pandey you're on newt yeah thanks jack if you couldn't share good point great can you see my screen yes we can thank you okay so thanks very much for inviting me to uh discuss this paper it suddenly took me back to graduate school and uh this is joined with uh nails and so let me start by sort of summarizing the paper and then returning to my discussion which as you'll see is about trying to think about what how to link what they find to some of the issues that i would say development economists think about perhaps more in the micro level but i think more generally also in thinking about the welfare implications of gdp per capita so the paper is incredibly uh clearly written and i think michael and jack gave a great presentation and you know it's it revolves around a certain central fact which is that earlier tests of the neoclassical growth model tended to find conditional convergence you only see convergence after conditioning on human capital policies and institutions uh what the authors do here is they extend this data in most cases to 2015 and find a trend towards unconditional convergence since mid 1980s absolute convergence since 2000 and as michael mentioned this is sort of below the iron law of two percent but is quite substantial they also look then at the conditioning variables and find that the short run correlates culture and the enhanced solar fundamentals all seem to show some convergence towards beta 2 beta convergence i think the nice part of the paper is that it doesn't stop with just documenting this fact but then sort of tries to think a little bit about proximate causes so they show that this is not just because there are fewer disaster countries i think there's been a long history in development economics of thinking of countries that have say big civil conflicts and disastrous goods performance for a few years it's not just china that's driving it these results survive independent of that there is some evidence that the richest countries are slowing down post 2005 but again even if you remove the top quartile the convergence exists even though it's weaker there are some laggards and i think this very much reflects a lot of the discussion in development policy today is uh the belief that the frontier what needs to happen in development is really trying to understand how to increase the growth performance in sub-saharan africa um they note that that there doesn't seem to be what um patel i described in that paper in the same way is there isn't a appears to be a middle-income track and in fact some of the strongest growth comes from the second quartile of countries and this is going to be a group of countries um partly because a group of countries i've worked on quite a lot that i'm going to focus quite a lot of my discussion on i think it's a very impressive collation of data sets and i appreciated the stun the careful standardization of conditioning variables i think the authors are very careful to make sure on their correlates that they were not cherry picking and they're very cognizant of interpretation issues so you know as a discussion to you go and hoping you can make some easy comments on things like causality but the authors actually are quite careful in noting that their evidence is largely suggestive so that of course at some level makes the task of discussing somewhat harder but i felt what i wanted to do was um situate these results in where the development discussions have gone and actually broaden it out to not just being what microeconomists say versus macroeconomist but really what are social scientists talking about right now so if you think about how anthropologists are thinking about development sort of what are their concerns when they think about the economies focus on growth so i think that a lot of the discussion really is about when you take gdp per capita at the country level what if anything does it tell us today about the welfare implications of uh wealth implications at the individual community or regional level and so i want to first talk about what has been happening with the spatial location of poverty and why i think that makes looking at convergence just at the country level perhaps less interesting if what we care about is the poorest households um across the world i also want to talk about how the nature of structural transformation has changed and what that again means for um you know the the breakdown between if you want kind of productivity increases and the share going to labor of income and then finally kind of thinking about these policies as jack said towards the end he's thinking a little bit and they think a little bit in terms of some underlying fundamentals but i think as we are seeing right now through the period we're going through fundamentals change and i think it's important for us to think about what lies ahead not just in terms of covet but i think very importantly in terms of climate change which is going to affect particularly the type of growth that lower income countries are going to be able to engage in so countries are now converging let's take that as given and ask you know does it matter so you know paul collier a while ago wrote a book kind of talking about the bottom billion and i think now the number of people andy sumner is the leader in this area who described that really the spatial distribution of poverty looks very different so just to give you a very quick review if you look across the kind of the arc of centuries um you know colonialism was a huge influence and so what we see if you say compare 1870 to 2000 certainly what matters uh more is where you live and i can be fair to say that most of many people think that colonialism is a reason why um you know there's a substantive difference across countries but if you look more recently say since 1980 what you see is a larger part of global inequality is now explained by within country inequality so branco milanovich has done a lot of work here so and if you so compared 1988 you know 80 percent of global income inequality was across countries by 2013 it was down to 49 percent so he said so then you can ask well what's going on what is going on is two things so this is some work that i've done with others so you know one good news is of course that rates of poverty have hugely gone down so if you look in 1987 roughly 30 percent of the world's population lived under 1.90 a day by 2015 it was about uh 12 13 but what also happened is the countries that grew did not grow equally and these very often were large populous countries like india and nigeria and including china as well and so what you see is that by 2015 the majority of the world's poor no longer lived in the poorest countries so our idea that poor people live in poor countries is not true at least today in the data and we can discuss later whether we think this is a passing moment or whether covid has possibly made this more permanent and of course the the fact why we are seeing this that poor people are living in richer countries is because um there's greater inequality so there are five high poverty middle income countries which i've called my work as hitmes that are today home to roughly half of the world's poorest and mapping this to the authors data these are typically countries that will fall in the second quartile of the gdp distribution and so what's happening within these countries is going to have an outsized impact if you really want to think about the convergence as being that between rich and poor regions communities or households not just countries so this i think is a good illustration so on the left hand side these two pictures are of countries drc and ethiopia both of these are in the first quartile these are poor countries these are countries that in a convergence regression we say are getting left behind if you look at the two on the right these are regions between countries that are in the second quartile that's so fast growth and and you know so somewhat depressing fact is that if you took the state of bihar in india and you consider it as a as a country it would be the world's most populous low-income country today and that really is i think the nature in which uh we've seen inequality change this is just another way of showing you that there is regional inequality and of course there's also rising inequality in incomes right so in india if you look at the green line the share of income going to the top 1 of the income distribution in 1980 was roughly 7 and now it's over 20 and the pandemic has if anything increase this so what does this mean i think it means that i think it's important for us if you want to think about welfare to really ask what's happening within countries i think it's a good point to remind ourselves that one of the kind of classic convergence results which was uh convergence within usd across u.s states actually stopped being true in the 2000s so ganon and shroud show us that regional convergence in the u.s no longer holds and they argue that's again because of the nature of inequality and place-based inequality i suspect if you look in the data you're going to see something similar happening certainly for some of these bigger second quartile countries and would be interesting to know if that's happening more generally so let me turn to a second point which i think is important for thinking about welfare which is the nature of structural transformation so historically we think of economic development sort of as a decline in the share of agriculture in both the country's income and labor sorry and you know we thought manufacturing is supposed to have this great double advantage it both was more productive than farming and absorbed a large population share so in the 1970s countries like germany and the uk would have roughly 50 percent of their population manufacturing that's no longer true right so if you look at the data again at the second quartile higher poverty middle-income countries china's a level higher at around 20 percent uh manufacturing share but look at a country like kenya if anything this entire period has seen the share of population and manufacturing at least according to ilo data significantly declining what about services would that come in instead as we move out um services is productive but you know my colleagues uh fan peters and zillibotti have worked now on services in india showing that these are very urban oriented um they're good for consumers in urban areas but they're not employing a lot of people very limited employment gains and so i think what you're seeing now is some of this gdp convergence is certainly coming from productive output in manufacturing and services but this is not translating into increased labor shares so mcmillan roderick and others have some nice work using micro data from ethiopia and tanzania showing that you sort of have two sets of firms you have larger firms that have superior in productivity performance but are not expanding employment and then you have the sort of informal sector that's absorbing employment but lacks productivity growth and coming to the perspective of what this matters for policy i think an important point made by them and others is that some of this is this homogenization of global supply chains um which which you know is is leading to capital intensive technology at a much higher rate and therefore making the link between gdp convergence and household well-being so that i think is just trying to situate this facts of absolute convergence in terms of what does this mean for the world's poor or less well-off let me now turn to thinking about how we use these findings to think about predict predictions for the future so you know the optimistic view is in the long run you know there was absolute convergence it was shocked off that path possibly by colonialism and now we're gradually returning to it as the washington consensus happens as you know really bad events stop happening but let me actually argue that i think the world is one in which anomalies are common in the medium run and so when we look ahead and i'm not sure we can actually look at these sort of washington consensus policies and say what the first quartile needs is for these policies to be implemented the world from what we can see looks quite different which concerns me about the predictive power of saying that there is convergence in these policies so what are the what are the reasons for concern so i think in the near run one of the most important factors that we see is this not just culture convergence but political institutions convergence but even before kobed inequality you know has been terrible in many ways one of the things it has also done is i think there's a lot of evidence of democratic backsliding this may suggest that we may see policy reversals coming not precisely because um we're now beginning to see democratic backs sliding and then that is accentuated very often by covet and then as i said i think really the most kind of the it's not even the elephant in the room anymore is that climate breakdown so the kind of future of that neoclassical growth model uh is just less likely to be true going ahead if we want to all survive so this shows you uh one one variable it looks the same for polity i just did it for varieties of democracy because i use that a bit more in my work this just divides on the left hand side by the quartiles that the authors use and you can see convergence uh on this measure and most nations but now if you break it down by these big countries and you look at the trends you basically start seeing across a lot of countries post around 2010 declines so the red line here is india electoral democracy has seen very significant declines by this measure it's supposed to now be an electoral autocracy if you look at media freedom you see the same thing broad aggregate seem to be converging but there's a lot of breakdown and then if you look at what happened during the pandemic you actually see if anything this trend was accentuated so this is just looking at the share of countries which are violations of different democratic standards darker colors are more uh violations and i'd focus on type seven which is restrictions on the media and as you can see you know in their our share of countries a majority of them saw some set of restrictions on the media and this is all happening at the same time as we know we are now seeing the first rise in global poverty in the 21st century um imf's most recent world economic outlook just a couple of days ago predicted that the reason why the global economy will remain three percent smaller in 2024 is largely going to be driven by these sort of lower middle income countries we just don't have that fiscal capacity to respond and i think here one thing that's kind of interesting to keep in mind is that when uh in the in the paper um they sort of define some policies as development oriented actually tax policy doesn't show up so in 1985 apparently redistribution was not associated with improvements in gdp but you know it's very hard to look at the data today and believe that we don't need um kind of more domestic redistribution so let me turn to my last uh point which is really on carbon convergence so i think what we see in the data and at least from uh what i've read and talked to others about you know uh there may be technological leap frogging so there may be better technologies available but we're not seeing energy leap frogging so what this means is that as countries are getting richer they're getting much more energy intensive so arthur bentham has some very nice work here so this is a graph from his paper that shows that if you look at just energy consumption against gdp and you look at you know countries that are in were industrialized early or lower development less developed countries today it's a 45 degree line they may be using different technologies but they're all moving to become more energy intensive and combine this with the fact that if you think about just climate breakdowns some of the most exposed populations um are our countries in sub-saharan africa and south asia so if you just look ahead and we look at the kind of projections that we heard about you know mark talked about in her discussion on the last talk you know we're either just growth is not going to happen in a lot of these countries because we're going to have just huge climate breakdowns or if we manage to change things um it's going to be much more expensive and those policies are not the set of policies that we were even thinking about in 1985 and so you know there are many different futures but i feel they all need us to think about new policies and possibly you know not just think about development oriented policies but possibly also policies that are going to help with climate change let me just in the morning summarize yeah um you know i think this paper documents a trend as far as i could tell on absolute convergence using a particular specification and provide suggestive evidence that policy convergence played a role i think my my comments really i wanted to make two points first i think it would be very valuable to provide us some narrative in the paper on how to link this country level convergence to human welfare i think the time when it was written in 1990s there was i think a much stronger presumption that poor people were in poor countries and so if we have poor countries growing faster we're going to see um you know gains in welfare i think what we've seen in the last two decades and that's why i broadened it out to say this is what social scientists are arguing about i think has made people quite concerned about the impacts of growth for poorer households and then the second thing is i think kind of also be useful to interpret what we should think about these policies i don't know what the fundamentals are in a world where for instance climate change is a huge part of what we see ahead and so it'd be good if the authors can help us think a bit about that but let me stop here and thank you very much i really enjoyed reading the paper thank you very much for your comments our next discussant uh is the ronis mogul well uh thank you marty and thank you eric and marty for inviting me uh and this paper uh has been very thought-provoking for me and carlos uh who is a third-year uh phd student at mit and he's responsible for all the good things in the discussion and i'll take the blame for all the bad things uh and and i also really enjoyed rohini's discussion uh and i completely endorse all of her points and the nice thing is that there is one point of contact between us and then other than that they are very complimentary i think so i'm actually going to carlos and i are going to focus on the statistical framework that michael jack and yang have proposed and stay at the country level but i think rohini is completely right that within country material is increasingly important so i don't need to spend much time on this slide because michael and jack gave an excellent very clear discussion so they are revisiting the borough barramus either 19 convergence issues and there are three big results in the paper as opposed to what the past literature found 30 years ago there's a trend towards absolute convergence or unconditional convergence this has been accompanied with rapid convergence of some among some of the correlates such as human capital policies institutions some culture and the relationship between these correlates and growth has become flatter which may be because policies and institutions have converged or perhaps they matter less for a variety of reasons so carlos and i have downloaded the data and repeated all of the analysis that jack young and michael did and we have replicated all of their results so there's no disagreement on the results but we're going to somewhat disagree with some of the interpretation so obviously whether the world is getting more or less unequal is very important modulo rohini's comments and the authors are making an important contribution as a descriptive fact here but the question is how do we interpret this descriptive fact using more economically relevant relationship that really forces us to go to a causal framework i think the literature before the authors was rightly quite skeptical that barrow's growth regressions really corresponded to a causal framework and there's some fixes and and i think how you think what the underlying causal framework is is going to be very important and this matters because even though the authors are very upfront that they are providing descriptive results they do interpret it through some sort of economic relations for example convergence has converged so that institutions and policies matter less you know this is taken rather seriously by the authors and by rohini as well despite her great skepticism in general so people are going to mention this as an important result so i'm going to argue that this isn't really the right way to think about it in fact what we i'm going to argue is that the biases of the conditional unconditional estimates have behaved differently and those are the things that have converged and this for example doesn't say that we shouldn't worry about the retreat of democracy that's a big fact rohini and i touch on that one since 2006 in every year freedom house has many more countries going back on democracy than forward so if for example we have really converged on absolute convergence and the correlate growth relationship for institutions has become flatter we shouldn't worry too much about this from an economic point of view we may worry for about a media or political rights point of view but i'm going to show you that in fact we should worry about this from an economic point of view as well okay so let me start with uh a minimal causal framework that i think we need and i'm going to interpret things from that perspective and then i'll show you what we have found in terms of why the absolute convergence has converged and and what are the different components of it and then do the same thing for the correlate growth relationship so here is a minimal framework that i'm going to propose this is by the way exactly the model that we start from in my paper with pascua restrepo jim robinson inspiration i do on democracy and growth which i'm going to come back to as one specific application later on so the key difference here from what the authors do is this cross-country fixed effects so in the absence of cross-country fixed effects all of the differences across levels of countries are either going to be absent if there are no covariates in is in the unconditional cross-convergence regression or only going to be captured by a limited set of covariance and again my work has found that whether you include those cross this country fixed effects has phenomenal implications in terms of everything being very different when you do or do not include them in a variety of contexts and certainly when you look at the results of certain short-run institutions such as democracy and so on so i'm going to come to that so in what follows i'm going to maintain that this is the right data generating process and then look at what happens carlos and i are going to look at what happens when you into you estimate the models that jack young and michael are estimating so let's start with this model so uh this is the one that in the first half of the paper or the first third of the paper uh the author's estimate so critically the cross-country fixed effects are not present so let's suppose following what they do is that there are no covariates so i'm going to come back to the role of the covariates but i want to separate it so i'm going to assume that bcs are equal to zero but it's convenient to understand what's going on to go back and think that this convergence coefficient is country specific so i'm going to write that as rossi i apologize we are using different notation for it with michael and jack they use beta and uh for for the for the convergence one we use raw we followed the our democracy and growth paper so rho is the uh estimate that used to be positive and is now negative that's the convergence of convergence and i'm going to show you exactly that's the pattern in the data so there are the authors are absolutely right so here is one basic result so suppose that the right data generating process is in fact the model that i put up with the cross-country fixed effects but no covariates so that the cross-country fixed effects and the row c's being different are the only thing then you can easily show very standard analysis that the probability limit of the variable that they estimate is a combination of these rho c's country specific convergence parameters however it's not anything that can be interpreted as local average treatment effects or anything like that these omega c's can be negative i'll show you they are in fact in the data and they do not sum to one if you want to turn them into something that looks a little bit more like weights here is a transformation in the second part so these are the theta c's so you can write the probability limit as this term which looks a little bit like an average but unfortunately there is this bias term here and we'll see that this bias term is big and has its own dynamics and you can see that already and it's very intuitive if you take the effective sample size to infinity so the consecutive periods for each country to infinity then many of these things actually converge to zero and most importantly the plim of raw hat converges to zero why is that well you know the bias has a very simple structure here the source of the bias is that the country fixed effects and initial conditions are of course correlated they couldn't be otherwise that would be a really weird draw of the cross-sectional distribution but that bias completely goes into their rohat estimate but as i make the sample longer and longer that bias is so big because the only way you can understand countries being in very different parts of the income distribution in their model is to set the absolute convergence to zero because there's no other way for countries to differ in the long run okay so this has major implications and this automated variable bias might be quite big and might have its own dynamics as i'm going to show you and since time is short let me just jump into it so i'm going to show that in three steps first of all i'm going to try to unpack why they get the raw hat that they get here is again our model with beta c equal to zero this is like a time series model if you want you can estimate this country by country except that we have time effects so we estimate it all together so this is the distribution of the rhoses you see the distribution it has almost no weight on positives almost every country has a negative rho c is a time series pattern so how come when you average these row c's you're getting a row hat well that's the bias that's because you're getting really weird weights many countries have negative weight 37 of them and some like panama have a huge negative weight again this is just if the underlying model is the one that i showed with the cross country fixed effects the model without cross-country fixed effects has to twist itself into bits uh into knots in order to be able to match it and that's where this is coming from so here is a different way of doing it this is what they you would get in the full sample this is what you are and the full sample this is what the johnson and papa giorgio for example does it not by decade but the full sample this is what you would get as the average and here is the bias term which is much larger but more importantly i think for the discussion at hand about absolute convergence and what it means this bias is not constant this is the when i compute when carlos and i compute the bias for the full sample now here it is how it looks like this is their estimate this is some average of the row seas that is interpretable and this is the bias look at the orange this is what the average of the rose seas is doing it's hardly budging it's negative roses are negative as i saw up to the 88th percentile but they're getting this big green trend precisely because the bias has a dynamic that's very large again it doesn't question their descriptive fact it's a descriptive fact they're completely right but its economic interpretation is very different i think once you start looking at it this way what about the other outcomes well all the other outcomes converge from the beginning of the sample so the the bias issue doesn't at least change sign but it's the same thing here is the distribution for all the other outcomes and you see that in all of them up to the 75th percentile the convergence coefficient is much more negative than what they get as the pool coefficient so the problem is present for the other ones as as it is for gdp but it's much more consequential in terms of economic interpretation for gdp all right what about the estimating the correlate growth slope so this is the model now that they estimate so now they introduce the beta and i'm going to introduce the beta as the in the underlying data generating process but there are a couple of differences again most importantly this is the big deal this is alpha instead of alpha c no cross-country fixed effects no cross-country specific coefficients this may be important but it's not but it also uses this ten-year difference on the left-hand side rather than you know if you have the annual data perhaps it's more natural to model the annual data so here is their result uh in the original version that we had they were comparing 1985 to 2005. now they are doing it a little bit more like we were doing also so if you estimate this you see this decline now the first thing to note is well this isn't exactly a downward trend it looks more like a cosine here that already gives me some poles where is that coming from well we don't understand it exactly but if you estimate their model exactly again we're replicating exactly the results there's no mistake in their model in their estimation whatsoever it's just a matter of interpretation but if you re-estimate their model with the more interpretable in my opinion annual change on the left-hand side you don't see the same cosine there is some fluctuation and there are some correlated effects that you're missing because you only have one lag and gdp lags are a little bit more complicated and also quality is very error prone is not a great measure of democracy i'll come back to that in a second so so i think there's some combination of these things that's leading to this cosine pattern but if you do it it's annual it's already not super large but i think the more important thing i want to go back to thinking about this in a causal framework so to do that let me go back to my paper with suresh naidu pascal restrepo and james robinson and in that model this is exactly what we estimated it's equivalent to the model that i wrote except that i put level on the left-hand side rather than change but it's of course it's just a reorganization i put it this way because this is exactly the model in that paper the only x that we consider is this democracy index and we use a dichotomous measure of democracy constructed from multiple sources to minimize measurement error it turns out it matters a little bit you don't get anything different but you get much more imprecision when you have things like quality which have so much error and mean reversion themselves so what happens if you estimate this this is our we are replicating exactly the leading specifications from that paper uh with four lags on the right hand side it doesn't matter whether you have five or four lags or one lag but the four lags are important because of those dynamics that i showed you actually so if you do the standard panel estimator you get a democracy coefficient that's large and precise you can do ireliana bond different sort of gmm or you can do hausmann han kersteiner which deals differently with the non-stationarity issues they all are in the ballpark and then this is the iv you know not the world's perhaps most reliable iv but we developed one using waves of democracy that are regional a very different source of variation than the within one exploits and they are all very consistent so again there is no cons contradiction here between what we are doing and what the authors are doing they're finding these correlations as well but these are estimated from a model as i pointed out that have the cross country fixed effects now if you were to go back to this sample and estimate these models without the cross-country fixed effects and i didn't bring those actually perhaps we should have put them in here as well you don't get anything that looks like this the cross-country fixed effects are very important both statistically but they are also very important economically so now what happens if you take this model and you ask the same question that jack young and michael do but in this model that i think is closer to a causal framework has the effect of democracy change so i take exactly the same estimates and now interact democracy with a time trend and what you'll see is that when you estimate that all of these are positive some of them are significant some of them are not and they are quantitatively not small so there is i wouldn't say on the basis of this that democracy is becoming more important in the 2000s than in the 1960s or the 70s but i would certainly say that there is no evidence that democracy is getting less important i can't do this exercise for other covariates because we don't have enough of a exogenous component iv and and something that i can really trust and there's also a bunch of semi-parametric matching estimators etc that we did in the paper that gives me confidence but i want to now use this framework for my last point squaring the circle now let's go take this democracy model as the only x as opposed to the many x's that i think all the authors are of course right are relevant but let me just take that one single x and say now this is the full model and go back to evaluate the absolute convergence trends and that's this so here i'm showing you four numbers and their evolution over time the dark gray are kramer at all's as specification as they so they start positive absolute divergence and they become negative the orange green sorry blue and green are the models that have the cross-country fixed effects and they vary only to the extent of whether you allow cross-country convergence terms and whether the effect they allow the effects of democracy to be present and whether that's also cross-countries very variable varying across countries or not so you see that in none of those cases you have the dynamics that the authors find they're fairly flat there's a little bit of specification the fluctuation across decades but as you can see it's well within the two standard error bands very comfortably but most importantly you may be mislead misled from this figure thinking that we are in the ballpark when you do the cramer at all specification versus the specification no the block is on a different scale here is the black scale here is the uh the other scales just the black one is tiny minute warning okay i'm almost done so that's my point from the earlier on carlos and i uh carlos and my proposition one the raw hat is seriously biased towards zero if you're going to interpret it from an economic point of view rather than just a descriptive fact conclusion this is a very interesting paper it was very thought provoking for carlos and me to think about it and certainly there's a new interesting descriptive fact but this is a descriptive fact and we should not interpret it as an economic fact it's a statistical framework and i don't think it corresponds to an economic framework where we can talk of the causal effects i think if you're going to think about the cause of the effects you really have to recognize a the fact that many countries are on very different level differences and those level differences are not going to be undone during the sample period that we have even if you have some amount of policy convergence those are what the country fixed effects are and they're fairly stable as i've shown you again i didn't show you that exactly but they are fairly stable and you also want to take more care i think in terms of zeroing in on the relevant covariates or correlates such as democracy and think about their their effects and here endogeneity dynamics etc are going to be important when you do that and you definitely do not overturn the author's descriptive fact but you i think find a somewhat different conclusion unconditional convergence patterns at the country level haven't changed the role c7 change there's no evidence that the royal seas have changed the causal effects of democracy has not declined or disappeared in every way there is no evidence of instability in the underlying structural relationships this puts a somewhat different light on the dynamics that we have observed but obviously the authors are completely right that the inequality patterns across countries has changed and we have to take that at face value and it will have implications including in the domains that rohini already emphasized so thanks again to the authors for giving me and carlos an opportunity to think about these issues and to eric and marty for inviting us to do it
