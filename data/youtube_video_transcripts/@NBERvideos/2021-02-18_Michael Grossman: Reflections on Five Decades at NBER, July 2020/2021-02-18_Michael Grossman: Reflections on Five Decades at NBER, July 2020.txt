so i'm giving this talk to mark my stepping down as nbr health economics program director after serving in that capacity for 40 years and i'm going to take a page out of the george washington's playbook and i'm and make a partial farewell to my troops but don't worry i'm not going to take a second page out of his playbook and run for president and it's only a partial farewell because i'm going to stay at the euro as new york city office director and research associate so this slide just indicates main themes that i'm going to cover and you can just read that for yourself it's not very profound so it's so i started to work at the nbr in 1960s and this is a picture of the new york nber office in that year this was the only office of the nber at that time and for those of you who are below a certain age the euro is in new york corporation and until 1978 there was no cambridge office so it's june of 1966 and i had completed all my courses and exams at columbia i did not have much money and eileen and i were thinking about getting married so i was looking for a summit job at the same time as vic hughes was looking for a research assistant harry becker recommended me to vic and vic hired me for the summer thanks to vic i celebrated two 50th anniversaries in 2016. one was my 50-year association with the nber the second was eileen and i got married so dick hired me to work on his book titled the service economy and this is a picture of the uh uh for title page of the book and i worked on a chapter of that book which compares cyclical fluctuations in the service sector to those in manufacturing now thought that the book was published by the nber until around 1978 the bureau published all of its books and monographs with the help from a large in-house editorial staff columbia university press distributed them so so so um so uh this is an acknowledgement uh from the book by pick and uh and this is evidence that i actually did some work on the book and you'll see that uh that erv leveson was vic's pain research assistant and i'll say something about irv in just a little while uh like me irv was a phd candidate colombia now my work on a chapter of this book dealing with which compared cyclical fluctuations in the service sector to those in manufacturing led my short-lived career as a macro economist and rob kessler is not though old and i was a macro economist so this is the cover page of this journal annals of economic and social measurement and dick and i actually published a paper in the july 1973 issue of the uh journal and the title you'll see that he had the lead article um and it's a little bit hard to read the title it says intersectoral shifts and aggregate productivity change this journal was one of two short-lived journals started by the bureau the other one was ex explorations and economic research and in our paper he examined the effect of the secular secular shift in employment towards the service sector on cyclical fluctuations in aggregate output per person hour now here's something that i quote i actually wrote this in the paper and write it and there were some interesting reactions to it oh this thing sounds good it sounds not so good um so come back to my actual work in health economics at the nber so this is my first three years and then and it started in late august of 1966 when vic made me an offer that i could not defuse and the offer was to work for him half time and to work on my dissertation half time if i did anticipation in health economics and that's how i became interested in the field up until then i had no exposure to it fix offer was the partial cause of my specialization in health economics throughout my career and also the partial cause of my marriage in september of 1966 now i say it was a partial cause because there is a perverse causality issue the author vic made to me partially caused our just our decision to get married but our desire to get married partially caused me to accept his offer and that's only fitting for someone like me who spends a lot of time investigating with them or schooling really causes at a health but i always like to say that in retrospect in 1966 an investment in health economics paid me the best interest so in our october 1966 harry a topic for my hesitation and that topic was to you health is being demanded of course it is an item in the utility function and as a component of the stock of human capital it's also a determinant of earnings um um so i spent the next three years working on my anticipation and also working for vic i left in june of 1969 to spend two years as a research associate at the center for health administration studies of the university of chicago i received an offer from vic in the late fall of 1970 who returned to the nber as a full-time research associate i accepted that offer and returned for good in june of 1971. i began to teach at the city university of new york graduate center in september 1972 and spent the next 45 years doing that full time and working at the bureau part time so now from economic history so the first publication the first nbr publication with us with a significant health economics component was co-authored by who who co-authored it for a million dollars it was milton friedman and simon christmas and they published this book in 1954 and they dealt with medicine and tantestry as two of the independent practices but fit was really the first nbr research associate focus on health beginning in the early 1960s and i want to highlight three very early contra contributions the first one is vick's paper here which i have on the slide and this is a great unpublished paper and i mean that it is a terrific paper uh vic finds in it a negative effect of schooling on mortality somewhat surprisingly a positive effect of income and he did not try to publish it because he included health inputs as exogenous variables and was concerned about reverse causality and that led the second paper by irv levison and his two colleagues and as i mentioned irv was mixed all time research associate research assistant and he was a major contributor to this paper and the paper treated medical care as an endogenous input in two stage least squares estimation harry becker read an early version of that of this paper in 1966 and he was concerned about the lack of a conceptual framework and by the failure to distinguish between health production and health demand function and that led him to suggest that i do both and test the empirical implications in my in my dissertation and so the third paper is my phd dissertation which i've finished in 1970 and which was published as an nbr occasional paper number 119 in 1972. vick's paper irv's paper with his co-authors and my occasional paper led to a focus of much of the health economics research at the euro on the determinants of the health of the population and i want to emphasize anyone who says that i established health economics as an area of investigation at the euro is wrong also in 1972 vic started this nbr's enter for economic analysis of human behavior and social institutions i always thought he could have picked a shorter name so he founded it with himself as the director with uh harry becker as the research policy advisor and with five programs which are highlighted on this slide and thick and doing this through heavily on pioneering research by gary by jacob mensah i himself i irvin his colleagues and last and least of all by me these programs are the forerunners of a number of the bureau's current programs all right so as i said as i've already said my my uh nbr occasional paper was published in 1972 and uh i want to point out that contributions to the occasional paper series were too long to be eternal articles and and too short to be books a number of very well-known economists contributed to the series in including vic george stigler and milton friedman and keep in mind that my occasional paper was number 119 all right oh it's 1972 and why am i in some trouble well there was a critical editorial of my occasional paper in this magazine and you'll see what the editorial said it was not very flattering so take a minute to read it i'll go on so this is the picture of the cover page of that magazine and it turned out that my late father subscribed to it and he phoned me about the editorial because he was very upset about it and i told him dad ad publicity is better than old publicity and that became my first rule of research my second rule is to ever take myself too seriously all right so it's still so i'm still in some difficulty this is much later trouble for my occasional paper so here's something that was written in a very recent paper by two very well known economists and the paper came out this past march and they actually gave it at the aea meetings and you'll see that my occasional paper ended in the i occasional paper ended the series they weren't nice enough not to mention my name is the author of that occasional paper and i always thought that it was ironic that a paper on health on the test of the series so or recently i've gotten some better publicity and this is a meme that was created by alfredo hello who's an economist at the university of wallongong in australia and he put it on twitter and it is and it has migrated to facebook and i'll give you an in it to read it uh i invited him to come to the uh conference and um i hope he's here although it's 3am in the morning on uh tuesday in australia oh i'll go on so let me turn to what i was up to in the 1970s oh i did i did a fair amount of work on the issue on this issue here there's poor schooling early cause at her health and i had a paper in the 1976 nper volume and the paper was 65 pages and it was really long enough to be an occasional paper although the occasional paper series had passed away by then um so in this paper i set out a much more detailed conceptual framework than the one in my occasional paper for dealing with the cooling health relationship so i tell with reasons for expecting causality in both directions for the importance of omitted third be a third variables in empirically i estimated what one i think of is kitchen sink ordinarily squares regressions although i did think i tried to hold interesting variables fixed uh much more recently i have this paper on the same issue and this paper does difference in in differences and instrumental variables of applied to a quasi experiment so i finally adopted 21st century econometric techniques with help from my co-authors ted joyce jinyi chao and chintan poo and it was hard for them to help me because as tim welper once said about me i am a man of simple taste i like baseball peer and ordinary least squares him is a recent alumnus of this e-u-n-y graduate center so also in the 1970s i had a large project on the determinants of children's health and these are the areas that we investigated so we did a lot of work on the effect of parents cooling again um and uh this was a joint where work with linda edwards park chicago and fred coleman the paper by peter savrey lived now there's a lot of work in this area since uh since the paper by peter savarelev that he will present next is the latest example of this cooling health causality issue the paper that adam carney will present after peter is an example on of research on race differences the papers by that randy hatcher marsha and arieka bars will present tomorrow are examples of research are on other determinants of health outcomes but i'm still in some trouble and the reason is that tape is on whether schooling causes health come out every single year in a real good year 50 say that schooling does cause health which is what i've always said and found and that is like my padding average of 500 in new york state veterans of foreign wars leagues playoff competition in 1957 and that's based on a small sample of two at bats for those of you who do not love ace ball as much as i do a batting average of 500 means that you it hits 50 percent of the times that you are at back there's a much smaller percentage of papers that find that schooling causes health in other years that's more like my batting average of 154 during the regular season of 1957 and that's based on a much bigger sample of 39 at bats thanks to peter i think i'm hitting a thousand this year uh based on his paper although that's the only paper that i've seen this year because i hardly ever eat anything anymore um and this has led my third rule of research which is that it's headed to be the first or one of the first even if you're wrong all right so in 1978 nbr office improves to 269 percent straight on the campus of nyu this is a picture of the office in the same year marty feldstein becomes president he forms the health economics program in 1980 and appoints vic and me as cote directors my recommend he never asked me if i wanted to serve in that capacity but i was delighted that he named me a few years later i found i find out that pickers decided to step down and that marty has named me as director uh and without asking me so oh i started some research in the 1980s and i had a project on infant health outcomes and we focused on public policies and programs and these are the issues that we focused on and this was a joint work with hope corman ted joyce and steve kovowitz and much later with shiny chao and shin tang blue and in that latter research we focused on uh the impacts of national health insurance on earth outcomes in taiwan now it is a lot of subsequent research in these areas both inside and outside the bureau and the paper that maulani will present today is an example of that research also in the 1980s i began a second area of investigation on the economics of unhealthy behaviors and discussions and these are these are examples i am my papers in this area account for the largest percentage of my publications and the major focus of my research from the mid-1980s to the present i have worked on all of these behaviors except for the opioid epidemic my work on the economics of unhealthy behaviors began at the mercer street office and has accompanied me to the three additional locations of the office so from 1995 to 1999 it was at 50 east 42nd street and that's a picture of the building at the office was from 1999 through 2013 it was in the altman building at 365 if the avenue right opposite the empire state building and that's on the campus of this the uny graduate center from 2013 to the to the present it's been at 5 hanover square in the wall street area and that's a picture of the building the the euro has had six offices in new york city and i've worked in five of them and that ties a record i share with the late bob lipsy and the late anna schwartz now and i told vic that the office had improved again in 1913. so he said and listen with apologies guys and dolls and you can read what he said i love this so give you a minute read it all right so i've been spending a lot of time on the economics of unhealthy behaviors and i want to tell you a little bit about how i began on it so in 1978 code king who would and i decided to should at an nih proposal on teenage smoking and alcohol abuse and the at that time the u.s anti-smoking campaign was 14 years old and there was a much but also a real active anti-drinking campaign but the real prices of cigarettes beer wine and spilts and distilled spirits had been falling for an awfully long time mainly because federal excise taxes on these goods had been fixed in terminal terms since 1951 and so he was interested in seeing whether the or the downward slope sloping demand punctured eerily held this figure highlights that there were these big productions in the in these uh real prices so in the language of modern odd econometrics we thought that he had power to detect effects so his outcome of the proposal and you can see it was not funded and so performs all we decided to to submit a revised proposal we decided to do some field work i was the one designated to do the field work so here i'm investigating smoking cigarettes or marijuana i'm not sure which here i'm investigating the demand for alcohol and you'll see that ted choice is on the left he looks much older now i look the same here i'm investigating whether substance use causes risky sexual behavior so ultimately we were successful he funded encumbered nih grants dealing with the economics of unhealthy behaviors and we did them we we did a lot of work in this area and we continued to work in this area and hizzle is the people who i worked with there are 30 people on this list let me just highlight a couple of results so we find that the behaviors at issue are sensitive to price so for example that this paper and i did in 1981 and we find that teenage cigarette smoking price elasticity of minus 1.2 now there are much smaller elasticities have been reported since then but as a new nbr uh uh nber health economics research associate and reese uh reports and elasticity of almost exactly the same magnitude that hope who would and i got in this nbr working paper now i made the computation and does not report elasticities in his paper he gives other mag he gives other measures of magnitudes so i'm not sure if he would agree with my estimate of his either of the elasticity in his paper um i'll have to talk to him about that now there's a tremendous amount of research on the economics of unhealthy behaviors again inside the nbr outside of it the paper that nathan teff will present tomorrow is an example for many more of my results and those of others are in including some who do not agree with me see and this is my book which i did which was uh published in 2017 this book has 800 pages and at 80 dollars it's somewhat pricey but it has multiple uses henry safety uses it as a paper weight i use it as a seat cushion if i'm stuck hitting directly behind kit carpenter at a seminar and i've actually received some royalties from a book mainly because i bought a number of copies myself so in conclusion after 54 years of marriage i still love my two wives eileen and the nbr now i have passed the end of my slides uh i have something else to read and i'd like to thank some people so i owe a debt to the late gary becker that i could never repay i also owe a debt to the very much alive big fuchs that i can never repay i owe it ted to the leighton party feldstein for appointing me as health economics uh program director and for allowing me to direct the program in an independent manner it has been my privilege and pleasure to interact with impetus since she became nbr president in 2008 i especially want to thank him for all his help in finding and who offers when the euro was forced to leave the auburn building in 2013. i want to thank all my co-authors and i have had an awful lot of them for all their help i want to thank the nber staff in cambridge for all their help over the years i especially to thank rob shannon for helping me to organize a health economic workshop at the summer institute for a long time and i especially want to thank him for his help this year when i'm sure i drove him crazy because i was so paranoid about not wanting to mess up my swansong i want to thank marinatin marinella muscany for being the best business manager and administrative assistant one could imagine like my wife eileen she is a jack of all trades and a master a master of all i'm delighted that kit carpenter has a agreed to serve as the next health economics program director and i want to thank him for doing that i'm sure that he will be terrific and i also want to remind him that when he and i started to play tennis in 2010 the ratio of my age to his age was exactly equal to two since then that ratio has fallen in the long run it will approach warn and he will lose his advantage finally i have to thank eileen she and i are a real world example of the foundation of carrie becker's theory of marriage based on the theory of advantage and if other factors held constant it is optimal for a high wage individual and marry one with a much lower wage for many years her earnings in technology far exceeded mine that gave me the luxury to teach and to pursue research that while not nearly as rewarding from a monetary standpoint paid me a good deal of psychic income and finally i'm not a religious person but at the social hour at 5 00 p.m please have a glass of your favorite average handy here in my case wine is too much and join me in the traditional two-ish toast behind the life it would make my late father very happy i'm through
