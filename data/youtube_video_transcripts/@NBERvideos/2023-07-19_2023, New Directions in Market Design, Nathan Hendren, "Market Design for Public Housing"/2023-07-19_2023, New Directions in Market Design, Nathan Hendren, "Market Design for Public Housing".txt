everybody thanks for uh letting me be here it's a it's a pleasure so I'm going to talk a little bit about housing and the uh potentially Market design for for public housing we'll see how I do in that transition um so I wanted to start uh by just talking through three facts about what we know about neighborhoods housing and kids uh in the the United States and the first kind of fact I want to start with is that the US is highly segregated there's a whole bunch of different ways to see this in data my favorite way of visualizing this is these so-called racial dot Maps each dot on this map is showing a kind of a representation of a hypothetical person corresponding to different racial backgrounds light blue is white individuals oranges black individuals right as Hispanic individuals dark blue is uh Asian individuals and this is showing you for the New York City area and what you can do is you can see kind of neighborhoods popping out of different races and ethnicities living in different neighborhoods in a fairly segregated way now uh this is sort of one measure of looking at segregation you can do this with income segregation you can do this with education segregation it gives you different measures uh but really similar stories of concentration of people uh living next to each other one of my favorite ways of looking at uh differences and outcomes is actually to kind of think about this in a little bit of a longer run kind of perspective and look at in uh the outcomes of kids that grow up in these different neighborhoods so this is sticking in the New York area but using data from the opportunity Atlas to look at the average incomes of kids who grew up in low-income families so kids whose parents were earning about twenty seven thousand dollars a year and asking what other incomes in adulthood and again you see a kind of wide Geographic variation across neighborhoods at very short levels so you see in uh Brooklyn kids grew up to earn about twenty one thousand dollars a year contrast that with across the river in New Jersey sorry for those New Yorkers in the room uh but they earn about forty four thousand dollars a year twice as much and you see a wide variation even at fairly short distances for kids growing up in these different uh different neighborhoods across uh across New York now you see that not just in New York this is showing you a similar picture for kids growing up in Seattle it'll become apparent for what I'm going to talk about uh in about 10 minutes why I'm focused on Seattle here but there's also High degrees of variation and concentration of uh low rates of upward Mobility for kids growing up say in South Seattle and downtown parts of Seattle so people who grew up in the downtown central district area average earn about 25 24 000 a year if you go into kind of the queen and neighborhood or Normandy Park neighborhoods or in the mid 40s if you go out into the suburbs a Kirkland Bellevue Redmond uh either in the 40 to 50 000 a year okay so that's sort of the first fact is that there's a lot of segregation both in terms of the parental characteristics of people uh living in places or just individual characteristics of people living in different places and in the variation in the outcomes of your children that are being raised in those neighborhoods all right so the second fact I want to turn to is that these uh neighborhoods have a causal effect on these children's outcomes that's sort of why I was showing you a lot of these differences for kids outcomes you might think that you know on the one hand Geographic variation and where people live and concentration may not be so much of a concern to a market designer uh you might just think that people have different preferences for different types of neighborhoods and they're just sorting perhaps efficiently uh I'm going to start to peel that onion away and argue that's not at all what's going on and the first step I want to take on that is to argue that a lot of the geographic variation that we're seeing in these different rates of upward Mobility people who are raised in different neighborhoods reflect the effects of growing up in those areas okay so what's the potential uh other story that you might have in mind so this variation and kind of upward Mobility could be driven by a selection pattern of just different latent types of kids that are choosing to live in different neighborhoods and they would have had low rates of upward Mobility regardless perhaps of where they lived on the other hand you might might imagine that a kid randomly assigned to a neighborhood that has lower rates of upper Mobility might have lower uh rates of operability themselves so in our work we've looked at the experiences of kids who moved across different areas during their childhood as we looked at seven million children who move across these areas and studied how the patterns of their outcomes varies with the age at the time in which they move to try to document what fraction of that variation looks like it's actually reflecting the causal effect of the place and I won't have time to go through the entirety of of that work but I'll summarize the kind of main finding that we have if you envision a kid that was growing up in Harlem let's say and they considered a move to Hoboken New Jersey if they did that uh at age two you could imagine if they grew up in Harlem people who grew up in Harlem earn about twenty one thousand dollars a year people that grow up in Hobo can earn about forty four thousand dollars a year if they do this at age two we estimate that they pick up about two-thirds of that difference so they'd on average have incomes of about 33 thirty four thousand dollars a year when they grow up and if you move at later ages you pick up less and less and less of that difference up to about age 23 after which you pick up very little of that difference okay so what is this kind of suggesting it suggests that we are all a weighted average of the neighborhoods in which we grew up in where the weights are proportional to the exposure time we had in those areas all right and so if you're asking like how do we know that's a causal effect so in the paper we try to sort out this idea that perhaps there's Dynamic sorting that would be confounding this pattern in proportion to exposure time the simplest way if there's a battery of tests in the paper but the simplest way you can think about this is you can drop family fixed effects into this design and find zero attenuation in this slope where you then identified basically off of the age Gap in siblings so if you have a family with two kids uh say a four and a five-year-old and then another family with a three and a six-year-old both making these moves you would see that the difference in the outcomes between the three and the six-year-old or three times as large as the difference in the outcomes of the four and the five-year-old and the magnitudes are proportional to the difference between say in this case Parliament okay and so that's suggesting that these patterns are actually reflecting the causal effects of childhood exposure to these different areas okay so um this general idea that neighborhoods and kind of where people live determines outcomes later in life has now been documented and replicated in a wide range of different settings so we've uh personally been part of replicating this using the moving to opportunity experiment uh where it's a randomized controlled trial of giving families access to housing vouchers to move to better neighborhoods and I'll talk about that uh some follow-on work from that in a second but you basically find similar exposure type patterns where the earlier you move to a neighborhood with higher upper Mobility the higher your incomes are later on Eric chin has some work studying public housing demolitions so in Chicago they demolished in sequence a whole bunch of public housing projects over time and what he documents is that if you were that the younger you were at the time your public housing unit was demolished the higher your incomes are later on in adulthood with the idea being that when the public these high poverty public housing projects were demolished you were then exposed to lower poverty uh perhaps higher quality neighborhoods for your uh for your upbringing these patterns are documented and uh several other countries so I'm showing you similar patterns for Australia Brazil Canada and Africa we're not unique in having these kind of childhood exposure effects and this idea that you are kind of a product of of where you've uh where you've grown up okay so uh it matters where you you grow up and so now I want to kind of turn to the kind of question at hand uh how does that interact with the policies we have for helping families live in different places or choose where to live Okay the third fact I want to document in this setting is that the existing public housing programs that we have even the housing Choice voucher programs do very little to remove these patterns of segregation so just to set the stage and kind of step back there's two major forms of Public Assistance for housing in the United States you have public housing which you can think of as hard units so these are administered by uh local housing authorities so there's 3 300 local housing authorities across the United States each one of them basically was kind of created to manage and buy local buildings and create build local buildings that they then rent out to individuals that are eligible uh now this has been historically criticized for creating pockets of concentrated poverty uh so a lot of these kinds of public housing units were created kind of very large units especially in the uh in the 50s 60s and in early parts of the the 70s um interesting kind of side bit you know the federal government ended up funding kind of the construction of a lot of these things and then relied on more local funding for the maintenance because that's the anecdote you can imagine how that uh unfolds in a kind of a local political economy story for those of you that are interested in understanding kind of the history of public housing by far the best book to read and even just the first chapter or two uh is Massey and Denton's American apartheid it's one of the better books I think that's been written on this this area so it was partially in response to this kind of increased uh segregation that was being driven by public housing projects in 1974 the U.S created this housing Choice Voucher Program and this is I the idea behind this program was to give families Choice very much you know they now you can see the analogy to the school choice uh uh setting here and expand the opportunities for where parents could choose to raise uh raise their kids or just more generally if you were homeless so you'd have the opportunity to lease up in a uh in a place that uh was a private unit as opposed to relying on on public housing both of these programs are administered by local public housing authorities in a sense the fact that the vouchers are being administered by local public housing authorities is kind of an artifact of the public housing authorities originally being created to manage public housing where it's important to be geographically close to uh to where those units are being created um we're kind of left with the jurisdictional boundaries uh on the housing Choice voucher program as a result of those uh historical patterns housing in the U.S is not an entitlement right so applications for public housing and housing Choice voucher programs are dramatically over uh oversubscribed so people are allocated via wait lists uh sometimes via lotteries there's been some work exploiting those uh lotteries uh both in the US and abroad uh that I'm sure you'll hear more about okay so I'm going to focus a little bit more for what remains on the housing Choice Voucher Program both because uh kind of in the general discourse there's been a bit of a decline away from pushing public housing more towards uh housing Choice voucher and I know that also relates a little bit more closely to school choice and perhaps uh is of interest to folks in this room so I'll tell you a little bit more about the housing Choice Voucher Program there's just over 2 million families in the program in any given year the way you are eligible for this program is that you have your income that is below some kind of threshold that is determined uh based on each jurisdiction it's usually about 30 percent of the area median income if you qualify for that you can put your name on a wait list uh typically these wait lists are about two years uh depends on kind of how many kids you have you're homeless if you've been victims of a victim of domestic violence that can affect where you are on the wait list and each public housing authority uh handles these wait lists in a uh in a different uh slightly different way once you get off the wait list if you get off the wait list you then kind of come in for an intake with the public housing authority they walk you through the uh kind of the eligibility they verify eligibility and then they give you a voucher if you are still eligible for the voucher once you get the voucher you then can go have to go find a unit a landlord that is willing to rent to you a spot that they will be willing to rent to you and you usually have about four months to to do that I'll return to this kind of at the the end and once you agree with a landlord the landlord's going to say okay you can live here and uh uh I will accept your your voucher the voucher subsidizes your rent the tenant pays generally about 30 of their income and the voucher pays for the rest okay so then you might say what caps the total size of the voucher payment so in general it's got to be what the landlord was charging for the unit but there is a cap in each area based on uh either a fair market rent that is blanket across a metropolitan area or in some areas like Seattle uh they have uh rent fair market rents That Vary based on the location of the unit so if you're trying to lease up in a more expensive place you can generally use a larger uh the voucher will generally pay more but your 30 wouldn't generally change okay all right uh then lastly there's an inspection process that the landlords hate um that does some things that are reasonable like look for lead paint if you have children other things that uh uh one could debate but that's another process uh that occurs with this uh that's different from if you were just getting a private relationship with a landlord okay so I mentioned that this kind of policy is uh and housing policies more generally are not doing uh all that much to reduce residential segregation in the U.S um I'll try to make that more concrete and be explicit about what I mean by that so what I want you to Envision is a data set of every individual in the United States and attached to them the poverty rate of the census tract in which they reside and then plot the histogram of that that is what you are looking at on this slide and then we can do that for public housing recipients um and you can see that in on average public housing recipients live in higher poverty census tracts part of that is mechanical and that the public housing unit itself is comprising a large fraction of the census tract and we can look at voucher recipients and you can see that on average the poverty rates are about twice as high relative to the average population it is much lower than public housing almost mechanically by the construction of the the program but the key question uh that a lot of uh my work and other other folks have been focused on is sort of why uh don't voucher recipients pick census tracts that are perhaps more uh more representative or in general have higher rates of of upper Mobility for their kids better amenities things of those those natures okay so that's showing you patterns overall I'll zoom in on Seattle and I just want to show you the top 25 locations of where voucher holders reside in the Seattle area so this is just kind of making that histogram a little bit more concrete each Green Dot corresponds to a tract in which uh is one of the 25 most common voucher holder uh locations and if you kind of squint at this you can see that there tend to be concentrated in areas that say have lower rates of upward Mobility uh for their uh for their kids there's very few uh vouchers for example being used in Bellevue Richmond Redmond Kirkland those kind of suburbs but also some of the bedroom communities here the Normandy Park Community on the South Side um not many vouchers used in those areas so that sort of raises the kind of research question that this literature has been grappling with which is sort of why uh why don't families sort of move to areas that seem to have higher rates of of upward Mobility for their kids you can broadly think of kind of two classes of exclamations uh you know first just note that we've kind of ruled out the price story in and of itself in that the voucher has higher value if you were to move to to Bellevue uh for example and so we're kind of left with preferences type stories on the one hand where families might prefer to stay in in current neighborhoods they might have connections to family have shorter commutes uh all kinds of different stories one can tell on the other hand you might think that there's barriers perhaps in the search process lack of information landlord discrimination that is driving these these different products so I'll walk you through uh kind of what we think uh is driving these patterns so we did a randomized control trial in Seattle to try to distinguish between these two stories and what we did is we started with these kind of maps of upward mobility in Seattle and defined a set of neighborhoods that we called opportunity neighborhoods and we uh used just neighborhoods that had high rates of operability classified them as a a high upper Mobility area is basically it's the top third of census tracts in the Seattle King County area we then paired each family um each uh so somebody comes into the Housing Authority they have a child uh we then paired them in a randomized fashion so if you were part of the treatment group you got access to the following Services uh first was customized search assistance so we paired them with a rental broker which you can think of as like a realtor except they also help you with like looking through your credit history thinking about how you would navigate questions that a landlord would ask you about your past rental history a past eviction and things of that nature so it's a little bit more uh kind of one-on-one than a uh than a Realtors uh standard job on average these people spent about six hours with these these families we also uh the the rental Brokers did some direct engagement with landlords to try to say hey would you be willing to lease your uh lease your apartment to somebody in the public housing program and as a kid 47 of the rentals that I'm going to show you in a second came through that type of referral process and then finally we gave some short-term financial assistance we put a little grease in we also to speak where if the family had some type of small payment that needed to be made in order to lease up a a unit and be able to rent they would be able to use it on average this corresponded to about a thousand dollars okay so this program cost us about two uh twenty six hundred dollars per family in Seattle that's a lot of money if you just ask the housing authorities like per person that gets a voucher that's a pretty decent chunk of change on the flip side of that for somebody who gets a Housing Voucher those housing vouchers have a present discounted value of about a hundred thousand dollars um so on that perspective it's not all that much uh much money it's paying a good fraction of rent it's paying it for a number of years uh and so is it big is it small uh it is what it is okay one thing I'll just tell you when in this treatment we didn't require families to move to higher opportunity areas they can use their voucher anywhere in Seattle the thing that they got was this access to this rental broker and these services to help them uh move to these kind of designated opportunity areas and so what we saw is that in the control group uh basically 15 of families moved to uh opportunity areas very similar to the historical uh average of families with kids and then in the treatment group more than half of them moved to opportunity areas they've scattered throughout Seattle so each Green Dot on here is showing you a location of a family that moved in the in the treatment group the red is the control group and the point that we just want to make here is that families tended to not concentrate in any particular area they all had Fairly unique places where they ended up uh residing throughout these opportunity areas all right okay um you also could have imagined you know we paired him with a rental broker um maybe that person was just a really good salesperson and kind of convinced him to move to a place uh that uh that they might not have really liked um so we interviewed them six months later uh did some qualitative interviews that I'll I'll talk more about in a second but just asked him like are you satisfied with your neighborhood are you gonna stay there and it's actually you would have expected if they were steered in those neighborhoods they'd be like no I mean I'm gonna probably move back but then if anything you see the opposite they're more happy with the neighborhoods that they live in and they're more likely to uh to say that they're gonna stay in the three years since we've done the experiments they have stayed so this is showing you the persistence in those uh in those neighborhoods so they are not sort of moving away in kind of mass mass Exodus it looks like they're staying there and raising their kids in those new neighborhoods okay um so this suggests that there was some pretty significant barriers that these families face when choosing a pretty major decision of where to raise your child when you're just given a Housing Voucher that's effectively giving you a hundred thousand dollars to in kind to decide where to uh where to raise their kid and so we uh we've got some evidence and sort of what might be driving these different patterns so we did some uh quantitative a quantitative approach of trying to break down an experiment and break down the experimental components to try to understand what's going on and then some qualitative interviews with the participants in the study that I'll talk through so on the quantitative side of things we just broke apart the experiment into different pieces uh gave them Financial uh so the first piece is just giving people Financial uh support and information you might imagine if you just pay people to move to better neighborhoods that they would do it um and if you told them where those neighborhoods were uh you might see them uh do that it doesn't actually work uh turns out you have to really pair them with these rental brokers so then he was a kind of buttress that theory if you increase the caseloads of these rental Brokers and make their lives more difficult make it tougher for those rental Brokers to do more things for those families you see lower rates of moving to opportunity areas that said 26 there it's really only when you give them uh kind of the ability to meet all of the individual specific needs of the uh people that are searching for housing that you see these rates so we actually replicated in the second phase of our experiment our first uh experimental treatment effect of just over 50 moving to opportunity areas okay and then I want to give a kind of a brief discussion of some qualitative evidence that we have as well so we uh Stephanie DeLuca at Johns Hopkins LED uh basically a series of interviews with these families uh to to figure out like what was going on in the minds of of these families and really two things kind of came out of uh those lessons the first is really kind of a scarcity idea when making these types of choices uh most of these families have really extremely limited time and resources to be deciding where to live and that the rental broker was really helping break down a lot of those barriers uh the second is a customization story where the caseworkers were really able to solve the unique barriers that each family has when thinking about moving to different areas and so I'll walk just through some quick uh quotes here so Jackie wrote that uh about her uh her uh rental broker that it was this whole flood of relief this whole flood of I don't know how I'm going to do this I don't know how I'm gonna what I'm gonna do this isn't working and yeah I think it was just a supportive nature of having lots of conversations with Megan it was her rental broker uh there was a broken broken with landlords component that Leah noted which is the uh she said that you know when you find a place the rental broker said I'll come with you and we'll help you fill out the application I'll talk with the landlord so that Leah didn't have to and I'll help you do a lot of stuff that maybe sometimes will be complicated and so she thought the whole application process was was quite uh quite difficult on the short-term financial assistance Jennifer wrote that I'm not going to be able to pay here and then they're in this new apartment they were able to get me more money uh so that they would pay for my first portion of my rent because they understood the situation I was in so basically the rental broker figured out that if they could drop the first month's rent uh that this this deal is going to go through they made the deal and this person then was able to lease up in these these areas then we unpacked this in the second phase of the experiment and talk to people that only got a fraction of these services so for people and just that just got the ability to have some of the financial support and information um Sarah was pretty representative of a response to a question we asked which is what do you feel like was missing or might have been helpful in your housing search and the first thing she said is guidance support and help with the process uh they just throw you out there give you a bunch of information to begin with and see if you can swim uh within the time frame you're given and the reduced Services Group Joaquin said we dumped 300 to 500 just an application fees so far not to mention time and gas and everything to do look landlords just don't seem to want to budge and so Joaquin at the time we wrote the paper had yet to find a unit in a in a either a high opportunity place or a unit at all and then finally in the control group Christina uh wrote so she got no Services right from this experiment uh she says you know nobody really helps you find an apartment I I found this place which was a shelter that she was currently living in uh on my own I have sent emails back and forth begging to get in here my application was sitting downstairs approved for like two days while I'm still in cars and outside with my daughter trying to figure it out I feel like maybe if the phas the housing authorities could be more personal with your clients that they're accepting and taking on that I feel like that uh that I feel like that would help with the homeless situation a lot and at the time we wrote the paper she she and her child were still homeless and so you get a sense of kind of the constraints that families are under when making these types of decisions and so you know what do I think are the key lessons that we know in the housing space for what people are going through and making these types of decisions the barriers in the search process are huge they drive a good portion of the residential segregation that we see they have implications for the outcomes of their children later in life and so it suggests there's potentially High returns to Market designs that reduce these search frictions right you can see it uh in those quotes at least if I think you can see that if you can think about better ways of Designing this Market it could have really huge huge returns there's a lot of money that's being left on the table uh you know if you just think of the present discounted value of earnings for a child that moves to an opportunity neighborhood in Seattle versus not on average that's about an 80 000 present discounted value of earnings for that that child and so I think there's pretty significant returns um but the program we designed as I mentioned it's not that cheap we're doing a lot of different services for those those families the housing authorities consider it I think reasonably you know a reasonable difficult question of do we provide more housing vouchers or do we provide these Services um you know to put a quantification on kind of what we think of the benefits are here for every dollar we spent on the program it looks like we're getting about 2.6 dollars in kind of returns uh to that program which I think you could do a lot better if you were thinking consciously about designing it from cost-effective way but the thing I really took away from this work that I think relates to the market to design a public housing is that the search and matching process is the problem and the question that I have really for all of you is whether Market design is the solution um and so I'll put out just a few implications that at least I've thought about uh for the for the implications for Market design for public housing so first off I think working with housing authorities I mentioned there are 300 3 000 and 300 public housing authorities across the United States Each of which you could walk into and talk to somebody about whether or not they'd be willing to collaborate with you there's a lot we've done this we've chatted with our project this project started by starting to talk with Greg Russ who is the head of the Cambridge public housing authority at the time we ended up working with folks over at the Seattle Housing Authority it's a longer story I can tell it over lunch but getting to know these people they are interested in supporting their families are constrained and a lot of them are very uh very eager to do better to do uh to do good things with their uh their populations I think improving the matching process of tenants and landlords like you just see how difficult it is I mean think about how difficult it is for all of us to find housing now imagine you've got all of these other constraints in your daily life trying to find housing I think it's it's quite clear this is having a really big impact on uh children and on residential segregation some landlords don't like renting to Section 8 or housing Choice voucher holders so this is the third bullet point thinking about clever mechanisms clever designs to bring in more landlords into the system I think would be quite quite helpful so one thing we did in Seattle that proved quite uh quite useful at least when you talk to the landlords is to offer them an insurance policy so we said hey if the person damages the unit will pay up to a couple Grand to cover the cost of that they all thought that was fantastic especially the people who had never interacted with people in the public housing program uh for all the families we sent through the program over four years there were two uh filings of those insurance policies so it's as cheap as it gets for kind of vouching for the voucher holders so to speak so fourth I think mechanisms to improve cooperation across phas this structure was designed for public housing units but is now being used for vouchers in large part right it's not designed very well for that Market designers could help fix that can we create better ways for phas to work with each other to help do what's called Port vouchers across jurisdictions or work with other uh other phas to trade uh vouchers people that want to move into your jurisdiction Etc there's a lot of institutional details that kind of goes behind the scenes here but for those of you that are interested I'm happy to talk about what I know on those fronts fifth integrating public housing and voucher applications so right now you often apply to both things separately I'm guessing Winnie will tell you more on on those fronts um but I think there's a lot of really interesting things to think about on the waitlist design giving people more information and certainty like you can imagine you apply for something and three years later boom you just figure out geez I I got this voucher it's kind of a shock and then all of a sudden you only have three four months to figure out what you're going to do with this newfound luck I think that relates lastly to this last point which I think is by far the most important one which is thinking about Market designs to increase what people call lease up so I mentioned that when people get those vouchers they have about four months to use them across the United States so just actually let me set the stage here how much of those vouchers worth on average people stick around about seven eight years and I said it's about a hundred thousand dollars in present discounted value in kind what's the average incomes of these people it's less than twenty thousand dollars or so so this is like a five-fold increase this is like five times your annual income that you get all you have to do is find a landlord in a place that you can lease up in in four months okay fully one-third of people in the United States that get these vouchers do not lease up they are eligible they have the voucher in hand they do not lease up all right so just think about the it's rare you can kind of put a number on the size of the market failure here the size of the search friction but it's enormous right and I think that thinking about General ways of how do we do Market design in contexts where choice is hard search is hard I think is a really crucial area for for future work so okay I'll stop there but thanks
