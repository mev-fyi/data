good morning everyone I'm Juan Holly from USC Marshall it's a great pleasure to present my paper and this joint work with the winching and the event so this paper studies how intermediaries balances interact with the trader yield curve and our motivation is that the treasury territory Securities seem to become inconvenient after the global financial crisis if you look at the Swap treasury spot swaps are interest rate derivatives that exchange floating to fixed rates that involve very little risk and they serve as Benchmark interest rates and we know that before the global financial crisis swap trade response are positive indicating that treasury yields are low so they are more valuable they are convenient after the global financial crisis is the squad becomes negative indicating treasury yields are higher so they are less valuable and the inconvenient and meanwhile we saw this all this much violation the gaps opened up after a crisis including CID base so in this paper we explain why the swap trade response switch sign after the crisis and the connector with the balance sheet cost proxied by CIP deviations and also intermediary treasury positions now the Highlight is that there is a regime shift before the global financial crisis dealers not a short or Naf sorts Treasures but afterwards that are networking so too loud so maybe without this good enough oh I see yeah yeah is it okay yeah thank you um okay so to switch the sign that's the we call the regime shift and in different regimes intermediaries balancing cost enter the treasury pricing in opposite directions and there we go to equivalent model which show that you know depending on the regime these policies could have opposite effects on a treasury yield curve okay now let me show you some basic facts so it has to know in the literature that the swaps treasury spread tend to sign around the global financial crisis as you can see from this green line and furthermore the CIP deviations become significant non-zero after the crisis in this orange line now what is new here we bring forward the data on intermediate net treasury positions in this red line you can see that its switch sign exactly at a similar period as a swap treasury spread now this kind of makes sense before the crisis dealers a nav sword on treasures and long swaps while the swap treasury spread is positive indicating that these dealers are talking a positive spread now after the crisis the Swiss side while the swap trade is spread also to his child again you know they are pocketing a positive spread uh and furthermore we observe that the CIP bases strongly co-move with the swap traffic spread after the crisis indicating that balancing costs likely play a major role afterwards now what exactly we do in this paper we view the intermediaries as arbitraging between treasures and swaps subject to a balance sheet constraint and we're going to use the whole term structure of swap raise and the CIP deviations to construct the dealer law and dealer short curves so if the treasury yields are close to the long curve the model says they should launch if it is close to the source curved models that they should sort and indeed in the data if you compare the treasury yield with its model predictions the treasury yield shifted from short curve to Long curve exactly consistent with what we observed in the data now our exercise contrasts with the two alternative views one is that the dealers are just like a yield seeking Masters like Pension funds and mutual funds so they load more treasuries when the yield curve is steeper but in the data that's exactly the opposite okay and the second is we contrast with this video of dealers being a classic OTC intermediary where they take a net neutral position or take a net long position in your short construct nevertheless in the last figure as you saw they take a systematically connective position before the global financial crisis okay so once we understand the dealer Behavior we build that into a simple two-player model to understand what are the factors that could drive the regime shift and what are the policy implications so I'm going to skip over the literature but at a high level we contribute to literature by combining an analysis of the swap trading spread of the CIP basis the treasury yield and the intermediate asset price okay so now let's take time to think about the treasury trade and the connection with the intermediaries balance it frequency so here we illustrate two traits one is a treasury bond long position in the other is the CIP trade okay in principle any no Arbitrage violations could work to measure the intermediaries balance sheet cost but we choose the CIP deviation because it has a rich term structure which is important for pricing treasury securities so when the dealers launchers they buy a treasury bond they financed in the secure financing rate and meanwhile they can also trade the CIP so they finance in the unsecured dollar and then lending the synthetic dollars through either forward or swaps and usually this is the right direction for most currency pairs if they expand their trade repulation in order to maintain balance sheet neutrality they have to shrink other trades so one example is shrinking this CIP trades in other words the foregone profit on the CIP trade is a matter of the Shadow cost expanding the treasury trade so this is just a graphical illustration of like like Randy multiplier approach so what's through the treasury yield be in this case well it has to be high enough to account for both the financing cost and also the balance sheet cost proceed by the foregone CIP profit on the other side if the dealers are doing a short treasure trade what they do they borrow a Trader security sell it in market and get cash and opposed to cash with the security lender and our interest on the cash okay which is typically lower and when they expand a short treasury trade again they have the incur losses uh on the foregone CIB trade in order to maintain balance in neutrality now again in this case what should the treasury you would be well uh you know for the dealers to sort Traders the treasury price has to be high which means the yield has to be low enough and to accommodate not only the lower rate on the cash but also the balance sheets cost incurs so at a high level when dealers Long the balancing cost possibly enters the treasury yield curve well when the other sort is negative interest that's the key intuition for the whole paper all right now let's formalize that intuition in a simple uh model so let's consider a single dealer's decision that chooses between trading a single in Period zero coupon Trader Bond versus the CIP Arbitrage uh and here we introduce this risk neutral measure q that reflects the Dealer's pricing now in classic asset pricing one SDF prices all assets but remember here what the special is we consider balance sheet cost which enters differently depending on whether deal is long or short so we use this to price only the zero balance sheet or balance sheet neutral strategies which we constructed in the previous slide and then we Define the expected Next Period bond price as PQ now let's set up the intermediaries problem so they're optimizing their profit subject to a balancing construct under the trading here we consider the one is the CIP trade which is multiplication of the syntax lending spread which is CIP basis multiplying the quantity of the trade and then they also engage in treasury trade when they take a long position what is the profit well they can sell the treasury Next Period which is PQ divided by the purchase price and that's a grocery term and you have to subtract that from a Security Financing rate uh and if they sort then next period they can earn the principal plus cash on the cash collateral uh but they have to buy that treasury which is the cost so that's the second part right uh of course it's subject to the balance sheet constraint which is important um and this resembles a supplementary leverage ratio and in reality you know multiple model the expectation of this binding also plays a role and furthermore I want to highlight that this model captures a risk adjustment and the risk-based regulation implicity in the Q measure and risk adjustment all right now we can actually solve this model by pencil paper if I gave you five minutes probably you can solve it but let me just directly jump to the result so you can see that the travel price is equal to the next period expected price divided by some discount rate now to understand the intuition let's consider a very simple case uh one period treasury bond which matures Next Period now let's do log linearization so we have this linear equation so the in the law regime the treasury yield is basically the financing rate plus a balancing cost adjustment and this is just the CIP basis okay um uh you can impress this in terms of a swap trading spread which is the green line we observed initially in the graph now it's going to be a minus the balance sheet cost plus a funding benefit so let me explain the intuition so when the intermediaries are long Traders and if their balancing costs go up they would require the treasury yield to go up which means the swap Traders start to go down so that's why there's a negative sign okay and also the funding benefit will drive down treasury yield which means drive up the swap spread now whether this is possible negative is a battle between the two terms before the global financial crisis after the global financial crisis we know that dealers take a long treasury position and their balancing cost is quite significant also varies a lot over time and that dominates that the second term it's why we observe a negative swap Trade Express and also that drives a close connection between the CIT basis and the swap spread now in a short regime we can have a similar expression we do the simple case and you can see that the treasury yield now is has a similar expression now let me directly jump to the swap treasury spread so now the swap Trail Express has a positive term on balance sheet cost which is exactly opposite from the lower region okay and then again there's would be a term reflecting the difference in the return on cash collateral and the unsecured financing rate so you can see that both these terms are positive so why this currency cost constantly enters when the dealers are short Traders if the balance sheet cost is bigger they would require the treasury security yield to be lower to justify them to take the position which means the swap trade spread to be bigger okay that's why the balance should cause positive interest so the highlighting Point here is that you know they enter in a different direction and this resembles pre-crisis regime where both these terms possibly contribute to the swap trading spread and make that positive and pre-crisis we know that balancing cost item is small but this item is big and also fluctuates a lot and carries a risk premium that explains the pre-crisis regime uh now in order to take seriously the risk premium Dynamics and also to get consistency across multiple term structures we build an affine Dynamic term structure model we basically have the same equation but iterate over multiple Horizons um and we then fit this term structure model to the term structure of a swap curves and the CID curves and from this we can construct this model implied dealer law and dealer sort curves and then compare with the actual treasure yield and give predictions about positions and then compare with the data so you know this is a probably not surprising that you know these fi models can do a good job pricing the cross-section of the interest rates so the swap curve fit is very good and you can also see that cross-section of the CIP basis the model does a great job pricing them and there's quite some variation across maturities indicating you know there's a rich Dynamics in the expectation and also risk premium in the balance sheet cost Factor and then we can compare the actual Transit yield with model generated dealer net long curve and dealer short curve I know this is kind of small so let's zoom into a bigger one so let's see the 10-year maturity okay so uh according to the model if the treasury yield is close to the nav sort curve they should do a definitely go short and you can see that before the crisis that's exactly the case so the treasury yield is very close to this red line which is a net short curve after the global financial crisis you can see that the treasury yield jumps to the net longer and model says they should definitely Lock And if you still remember in the first graph that's exactly consistent with the actual dealers and that's treasury pollution and we can actually do a stronger version of this exercise by defining a so-called relative treasury yield index so this index measures uh how close the strategy yield is to the long curve versus the short curve so if the actual treasure yield is right in the middle there is a zero if it's close to the lawn and it's more positive okay again this relative yield index is constructed from model predictions where we do not feed any Trader information so think about this other sample prediction and then we also put this together with the Dealer's position so if you add extra assumptions on the model it's relatively yield index would predict the Dealer's positions and you can see that that's kind of consistent and particularly the switching point of the sign from negative to positive all right uh I think so far I convince you that is a group description of a dealer behavior and now we are going to embed that into an equilibrium model because we're trying to understand what factors could drive the regime shift and the potential policy implications uh so in this model we have the same intermediary Behavior as I already set up but we're going to endogenize the treasury yield and also the synthetic lending rate okay so the dealers are having the same problem with the balance sheet constraint we introduced two types of investors one is the real money investors like Pension funds and the mutual funds so they're like the yield seeking behavior and you can see that their demand is an increasing function of the treasury bond holding return minus the TBO return so they're comparing the holding the bond return versus the bill return if it's higher they would load more on the treasury bond okay so they're like the yield C King in the master and furthermore we also introduce this foreign investors who has their foreign position think about this a Japanese life insurance companies who have Japanese Yen liability but they want the invest in dollar so they swap their in liability into a dollar obtaining effectively a synthetic financing rate and remember this is a coming from the dealer so it's going to incorporate the balance sheet cost and that's their demand function again they are also kind of yield seeking but their Benchmark financing rate is synthetic dollar rate for each unit of bond demand therefore for the also demand synthetic dollar and then we clear the both the markets so for the treasury market the government supplies nominal bonds and the multiplying the price as a market value of the total Supply that should be equal to the total demand which is the dealer demand this is a q Bond plus some other investors which are yield seeking and you can see that by setting this treasury market clearing in this way we are actually imposing a pretty strong assumption that is when the yield curve when the term premium is deeper there's other investors are demanding more treasury security which means dealers have to behave the opposite way meaning that your their position has to be negatively cool it with the yield term with the term premium okay and the word so then we also clear the syntax lending Market where the uh sorry The synthetical Lending Supply from the dealer to the equal to the demand but now let's first look at this uh actual dealer's position and the term premium that's exactly consistent with our models set up that is dealers reduce their position when the term premium is steeper contrary to the yield seeking Behavior like pension fund and I want to highlight that is it it's very different from the mechanism of German 2020 where the dealer estimation increases when the term premium is higher all right uh then we solve the model so for the sake of time I'm just to summarize the key results so we get a unique equilibrium feature different regimes so we have you know long regime short regime also there's a less important intermediate region where dealers take zero position and what drives the regime well there are two factors one is the bond Supply and the other is the term premium so before the global financial crisis the total amount of Treasury Supply is not as large and the dealers take a certain position effectively creating more Supply to cater the demand afterwards there was a significant expansion of a treasury Supply and the dealers had to take the other side and to subsume the actual Supply and take a long position and furthermore we have a secular decline in this term premium which you know drive down the other investor demand for Treasures again that drives more position for the dealers and the drive up they're trying to beholding um and uh our model says lies a very important event about the treasury market fragility that happened in March 2020. we all know that typically in time of Crisis treasury yields should go down because flight to liquidity but in March 2020 the long-term trendy yield actually spiked which was very unusual and so far the standard view from the literature is that it's coming from a large selling pressure from you know mutual funds and foreign investors as documented by you know Coronado in its own paper so I think this paper will provide a compliment reveal that does not rely on the direction of the client socks so just think about any crisis as a sock to the intermediaries balance sheet okay so the balance sheet costs suddenly spiked if the intermediaries are taking a short position just like a pre-crisis regime on trailers that when the spike when the balance sheet costs Spike they would they are demanding a treasure deal to go down to justify them still in the market and to be marginal and that drive down the treasury yield well after a global financial crisis we are taking a long position so if their balance sheet cost spiked they are requiring a treasury yield to go up to justify them to be still in the market now that provides a complementary view on the event that happened in the in a pandemic uh and finally so we can study the impact of different policies on the treasury yield curve and the synthetic lending rates well the caveat is here we are fixing the small price so everything is relative uh now I want to highlight that you know depending on which regime we are in the impact of policies on Treasury yield curve and existing that lending rates could be exactly opposite as you can see from the directions of these arrows now here we study uh quantitative tightening and term forward guidance supplementary Library exemptions and so on and so forth so the highlighting point is that Regulators have to pay attention to this regime shift in order to understand the policy impacts on the yield curve and the broader economy and with this I'm concluding uh thank you so much and looking forward to your account
