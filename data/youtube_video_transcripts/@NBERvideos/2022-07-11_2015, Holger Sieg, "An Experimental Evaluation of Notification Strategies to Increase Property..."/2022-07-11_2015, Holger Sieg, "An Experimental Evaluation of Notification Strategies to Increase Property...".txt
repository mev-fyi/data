let me use the opportunity to talk a little bit about tax compliance and an experiment that i ran with some of my co-authors in philadelphia trying to help the city of philadelphia to improve property tax collection so as you know tax compliance has become a pretty substantial policy issue not just in the u.s and municipalities in the us but of course also in europe particularly not only are we germans world champions in soccer as all of you know but we're also world champions apparently in tax compliance and our friends in greece are not doing so well on the soccer field right now but they are doing even worse in terms of tax compliance should they be concerned about this well obviously yes if the government is denied the resources then they cannot provide basic services and we all know we all believe that there are important services the government should provide on top of that if there's a significant amount of non-compliance the people who actually do pay taxes so those 27 percent in greece who are currently paying taxes they will have to pay much rather tax rates with all the problems associated with that but on top of that also obviously non-compliance on a large scale completely undermines any kind of fairness that may have existed in the theoretical tax code and as a consequence can really undermine the functioning of government and undermine the credibility of democracy so each taxpayer basically has to ask himself or herself two questions right so the first question is how much do i owe and from the perspective now of the municipality or the government who is trying to run the tax code or was trying to enforce the tax code there are a few options and those make i think the use of certain types of taxes more desirable and so since this paper is about the property tax it's pretty hard to hide property you cannot really ship it off to some tax haven abroad on top of that assessment of property values is pretty straightforward these days given the kind of technology that we have available same is true of course for certain types of income taxes value-added taxes and to some degree i think that explains why we're using it it kind of like minimizes the opportunity for taxpayers for under reporting uh their uh uh their their tax base right so the second question then a taxpayer should ask themselves is you know what happens if i don't pay the taxes well as you know you all have paid taxes if you don't pay taxes what happens is that there is a usually a complicated system of fines and penalties that start to accrue and hopefully you know gary becker tells us that as we are piling up the fines and penalties we make non-compliance less desirable and people will start paying their taxes and in the worst case scenario we will go after them and we will either go after them at the sale of their property through a lien or we will if they don't sell their property we have the option to foreclose on them through sheriff's sales and things like that now obviously the problem of that is there are credibility issues here there's a question whether there's political willingness actually to go through enforcing the fines and penalties it could be extremely costly for the local politicians to do that and it could be extremely costly for the local politicians to change the equilibrium right once you're in a bad equilibrium in which people don't pay taxes you need to get reelected might not be in your interest to change the equilibrium in the short run on top of that there is actually rather mixed empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of these fines so what can we do are there alternatives to basically the stick right can we uh can we design maybe a softer system of incentives here that would provide a sufficient amount of incentives for late or maybe even delinquent taxpayers to at least contemplate paying some of their taxes so um what is there so the more recent literature on tax compliance as far as i understand it then has kind of like focused on alternative motivations that may explain why some of you or all of you i hope pay your taxes now some of it has to do with uh the realization that without tax without taxation there's no civilization and there is no provision of public services so this is basically still speaking kind of like strictly economic logic here kind of like suggesting that you should pay your taxes but there should be motivations non-economic motivations that may also suggest that it's a good idea to pay taxes and usually the way we think about these is some kind of like appeals to civic duty right we believe that actually a lot of behavior that is seems to be economically irrational i think can be uh easily explained within a slightly broader economic framework in which you're actually endogenizing things like morals or rules and things like that and then it can be you can sustain often in these slightly more general models cooperative equilibria in which people actually do the right thing and fulfill their civic duty so um well what can empirical researchers do here to add to our understanding and i think that there is kind of like a new research evolving um which is trying to take some of these ideas that have come up in the theory a little bit more seriously and trying to see whether actually these kind of motivations and reinforcing these kind of motivations can actually account for maybe increasing tax collection in in especially in communities municipalities that have poor track records for collecting their property taxes so that's uh that's how this all started actually um if i can digress this is actually the best thing that has ever come out of me sitting on a university committee as you know these dreadful experiences but i met this guy john mcdonald at this strategic planning committee and we started to talk about research and this is how this whole started because he had been contacted by the city of philadelphia he had some good contacts in the department of revenue and they had actually contacted he's a criminologist okay so they were bypassing the economies see okay they went straight to the criminologists and they had contacted him asking what can what can they do what can the the criminologists can do to help them redesign the letters that they send out to tardy or delinquent taxpayers and then he came to me the economist and then we went to bob and other people and we started to bounce around some ideas and that's how this experiment came about so there was a lot of interest within the city of philadelphia to improve a property tax collection and so what kind of kind of nudge strategies right here that's the way you should think about it or notification strategies what can we do here in order to help them and historically speaking i should say that the property tax collection in philadelphia is bad right around ninety percent of assessed property taxes are only paid well below average in the us you can look at table one of the paper for you know find your favorite city and then see how you're doing okay so um because there was a lot of interest on this on the city side they uh promised to let us run some experiments here and to evaluate different strategies i come come back to that in a second so so as you can see uh this is the standard letter you would get in philadelphia if you are tardy you can see a good lawyer okay cooked up this letter okay it has everything essential from the legal perspective and it has nothing on it that might be economically interesting or relevant right it basically tells you how much you owe penalties fines and so on and so forth and then it gives you the contact information where to send the check right okay what could we improve well i mean hopefully we were we were hoping initially uh what am i supposed to do here no okay no okay all right no so hope we were of course hoping that we could directly change this letter and needless to say the lawyers told us no and so what we did instead we designed some stuffers so basically a second page and if you look to the back of the paper you can see exactly the four papers so the three of three treatments one control you can see exactly the letters that we use so we were basically adding a second letter to your standard reminder and we changed the message okay that we were trying to communicate and we made it such that if you opened the letter actually you would first read our letter all right and then you would read your tax bill so what are the three letters that we designed the first one was pretty much a straight up a threat letter where we said don't make the mistake of thinking we're not going to come after you we will the second letter was basically where we said listen here's all the great things we do for the community please pay your taxes and the third letter was basically reminding people that nine out of 10 people in philadelphia were actually paying their property taxes so why not them okay that was the strategy then we had a control letter okay because we were adding these stuffers and we didn't want to confound just the stuffing the adding another letter with the treatment of receiving a message and so the control letter the force letter is just like you know saying something that you should know anyway please pay your taxes so um the experimental design i don't know how much i should go into detail here i don't know how much you guys care about this i just we ran into basically two minor problems first of all because it was the first time we were running an experiment with the city of philadelphia and they had some constraints uh that uh we ended up we didn't wanna spend waste all our time arguing with them and so we couldn't do straight randomization but fortunately what the city does they have already basically what i would call a pseudo random assignment of properties to billing cycles and that's almost as a matter of fact they claimed they randomly did it you know way back when when they had a guy who could produce random numbers for them we checked it and it looks pretty random to me but obviously it's not ideal okay the other thing i should say on the side okay we use so the stuffing occurred in the city of philadelphia and it's amazing what can go wrong even with simple tasks is starting an envelope and they managed to totally screw it up on six of the 15 days of the experiment so if you look at some of our tables carefully you will see some odd asymmetries in the sample composition and that's exactly because the guys who are running the mail room i don't know what the hell they were doing okay i really i really don't know so well the good news is we were still left with roughly 4 900 people in our sample the bad news is they were not equally assigned to the treatment and control groups also there's one thing that i should know we were because it took us such a long time to negotiate at some point we weren't even sure whether they still wanted to go ahead that when came because we wanted to do it before the new billing cycle starts in january and so we were still talking to these guys in october and they were still kind of like you know shuffling their feet and so eventually then we we managed to convince them at the beginning of november we got to go ahead and then at that stage unfortunately two-thirds of the tardy ladders had already assigned to collection agencies so the sample that we have is not technically a random sample of the underlying population of tardy properties because two-thirds of them because these collection agencies they don't randomly pick they obviously pick the ones that give them the highest potential returns and so we're left with the one-third that the city tries to enforce and so but nevertheless it's still a perfectly interesting and legitimate exercise to do even on that third of the sample all right so did we make money for the city okay and i was really concerned about that because you know i mean i have tried lots of things and failed miserably many occasions so but at least here it seems to me if you crank through the numbers just the raw numbers and that's the beauty of running an experiment it's not that complicated turns out if you look at the last column here i know these tables are awfully small and if i had known this i would have anyway if you look at the last column there you see that the threat our best guess is generated around ten thousand dollars over and what the uh per day i should say per day that's not the best measure i will show you a better better measure in a second okay you add that all up we generated 250 000 for the city okay that's good okay a better measure is you know because there were this unequal number of treatments in each treatment and in the control group is actually to look at the average payment per letter okay that is i think the correct outcome measure and that's in table five of the paper and so for the if i ignore the difference between the three treatments i get 174 bucks for the three treatments together in the full sample i got a hundred and twelve dollars for the control group so we kind of like raised 62 dollars right that's the difference in means by sending these guys these three different treatments and if you decompose it down by individual treatment then you find that we raised 90 on average in the full sample for the service treatment 21 for the civic duty treatment and 30 dollars for the threat treatment so and it turns out no matter how we break the sample so we have three different samples we have the full sample then we eliminate commercial properties we eliminate properties with multiple owners we always have positive treatment effects so that's very reassuring we did not lose money for the city no matter what no matter how you cut and slice the data all right the city is better off as a consequence of this experiment is it statistically significant well yeah well that's uh unfortunately a tougher cookie right because remember 65 85 of these people on average do not respond so there are 85 zeros in the sample if you look at the amount sent in right and so that means the variance even in large samples is very large but the good news is that in our favorite sample which i think at least my favorite sample i can't talk to bob in my courses but my favorite sample is to say a sample of sole owners because that gets around the problem of having multiple property owners of multiple properties in that sample we actually do have a significant treatment for the moral treatment and even the other two treatments if you look at the t statistics or you look at the ratio between the treatment and the the estimated the standard error it actually doesn't look so bad okay so all right now the literature also looks at other outcomes between besides the the mean treatment effect right because as i argued before there are some values just of increasing participation in the process right you can say even if somebody only pays a few bucks doesn't pay the full bill at least that person shows that he still has some faith in the government right whereas if he totally or she totally drops out then you know that's that's worse right so that's why we look at but that's why we look at two different outcomes so we look at the outcome whether you send anything in so that's what we call ever paid and then we look at this outcome that is similar to the total payment but does not have this variance problem associated with it so we just look at an outcome which is a dummy which is whether you paid in full or not right and it kind of like deals with the fact that different people own different amounts right so that's why people in this literature look at these two discrete outcomes then you can't say anymore how much money you generated but you can you can find out by how much you increase participation if you go back to table four of the paper i show you exactly the different participation rates based on these outcomes and then you can judge for yourself so what do we find we find actually that the appeal to civic duty here had overall the most significant effect on uh both participations or whether you send anything in and full okay the drawback of the this is that uh the the civic duty primarily worked on the size uh on the sub-sample of taxpayers that owed very little okay so we had huge effects in the lowest quintile or quartile of the distribution if you rank people by how much say oh that's where the civic duty kicks in so that's nice and kind of like we get these people who don't owe much they get this letter they say hey you know it's really the right thing to pay these guys look at it i owe 20 bucks 50 bucks 150 they actually are more likely to send it in you send it to some notorious tax evaders who owes tens of thousands of dollars right that guy is not going to change his behavior that's exactly what we find the thing that is maybe more surprising is the fact that the uh remember what we found is the provision that the service appeal was actually the one that raised the most money and so when we kind of like break it down by types we find that it is most effective when we look at the people who owe the most um and so to some degree that is a little bit astonishing i think and we need to do maybe think of this through a little bit more but that is something we also find right so the service appeal seems to operate at least in this experiment and in this sample on seems to be more effective on people who who do owe a lot of money so let me wrap up so i think that there is some value i mean actually there is definitely value in exploring different uh nuts or notification strategies and i do believe we have at least provided some evidence that these tragedies have the potential to improve tax collection not just in philadelphia but hopefully i mean i don't know how much we can extrapolate from philly but you know they should work in other scenarios for other cities as well now one thing that comes out of our estimates is that you know not everybody responds the same to these nudges right some people uh seem to respond stronger to civic duty others respond more to service appeal and i'm sure there are people out there you can threaten okay we haven't found them but i'm sure they exist and to some degree our next experiment that we're contemplating right now we'll try to target these guys a little bit more carefully so but i think one thing that you can take away from this research is that you know a targeted there could be potentially large benefits from targeting if you can figure out right you know how people respond to different uh messages then i think there could be some potentially large benefits from targeting and um and so obviously we need to do a lot more research to to exactly figure out how to do that right but i think that's that's that's kind of like a nice result that we get from this kind of work so obviously i think you all are hopefully paying your property taxes and you may know people who don't and so if you have any suggestions on how we can improve our strategies uh hopefully we will be able to do more experiments here in philadelphia i think we did convince the people in the department of revenue that there is some value of doing this and so if you have any please let us know thank you
