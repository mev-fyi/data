i'm mirey jacobson and i'm delighted to be here to discuss my nbr working paper financial incentives and other nudges do not increase coven 19 vaccinations amongst the vaccine hesitant this is joint work with tom chang who like myself is at usc manisha shah at ucla and doctors rajiv pramanik and samir bisha at contra costa health services before i begin i do just want to acknowledge the generous funding we received for this work from japan north america state and local innovation initiatives and the nbr's nia funded royal center um this work really wouldn't have been possible without this support of course the usual disclaimers apply that the funders are not responsible for the work and our findings and conclusions do not necessarily represent their views um so in this work we wanted to understand whether we could increase covid19 vaccination rates amongst the vaccine hesitant and by that we mean people who after kind of months of eligibility and despite ample supply of vaccine had not yet been vaccinated there's been actually a lot of work trying to understand this group but almost all of it has been focused on vaccination intentions meaning people stated likelihood of vaccination and we were already partnering with an integrated health system in northern california to test ways to increase covet 19 testing and we're able to pivot to try to understand whether financial incentives um and other behavioral dungeons could increase vaccinations our implementing partner in this work is contra costa health services which is essentially the department of health in contra costa county california you can see here on the map contra costa is this area in green and it is um to the east of san francisco um and north of berkeley and oakland and just in terms of population it's a little bigger than the state of rhode island um contra costa health services is responsible for public health testing and vaccinations and importantly also runs the medicaid managed care plan in the county where medicaid is public health insurance for people from low-income households the county actually did a really great job at getting people vaccinated and at the time of our study about 77 of the county had been partially vaccinated um rates were lower in the medicaid plan and there were there were and continues to be general concerned both uh nationally and locally about reaching this kind of remaining group of quote-unquote vaccine hesitant so what did we do between may and july of this year we invited unvaccinated adult members of the county medicaid managed care plan who self-identified as white black or latino to take part in a survey about coping 19. within the survey participants were randomized to different public health messages financial incentives or a link to an easy vaccination scheduling system and all of these treatments were crossed such that some people got a public health message a financial incentive and the link while others got one or two of the treatments and some got none um just to provide a bit more detail the financial incentives were 10 or 50 gift cards um they were offered if respondents randomized to those treatments got one shot within two weeks of the survey and they were told of the incentive at the end of the survey and reminded of it a day or two later when they received a small gift card for successfully completing the survey in terms of public health messaging uh we had three different messages uh survey respondents could be could be randomized too um the first was one from the california department of public health and was focused on getting back to normal we think of this as kind of our treatment as usual message the second and third messages were ones we created with physicians at our partner contra costa health services first we recorded messages focused on the general safety and efficacy of the vaccines and second we recorded messages focused on the potential negative health consequences of remaining unvaccinated and we were interested in the impact of having a gender and or race concordant messenger so all the messages were recorded by both male and female physicians who were white black or latino some respondents uh also were provided at the end of the survey with an easy vaccine scheduling link which i show here and the nice thing about this link is that the appointment availability can be seen right away without any kind of special login or kind of click process so it really was much easier than at least the link available through the state of california and here is our main finding the solid diamonds here show our point estimates and the dashed lines the 95 confidence intervals and as you can see none of our interventions meaningfully changed our primary outcome which was vaccination rates within 30 days of the survey not only are the point estimates close to zero but for most of the interventions we can rule out pretty small increases in vaccination rates um so for any financial incentive which is combining the 10 or 50 incentives the upper 95 confidence interval rules out an increase on the order of one percentage point we also looked at the link between stated vaccination intentions which much of the research has looked at um in actual vaccinations and how both of these were affected by the interventions um and as i said this is important because that's kind of where the prior work um was mostly focused just out of expediency so our intention questions were asked after participants viewed the public health messages if they saw any and before they learned about financial incentives or saw the easy scheduling link so this is really all about the messages in blue here you see estimated percentage point changes for vaccinations and in red for intentions to get vaccinated and what we found here somewhat surprising in particular even though the public health messages had no impact on actual vaccinations it did change what people said they would do the provider psas particularly the one focused on negative health consequences really increased people's stated likelihood of getting vaccinated why they ultimately did not get vaccinated is unclear but may have to do with barriers between intentions and actions or that the effect of messaging on intentions is just short-lived and while we found financial incentives didn't work on the whole for some groups the data suggests the incentives unfortunately backfired so specifically for respondents who indicated in the survey that they supported trump in the 2020 presidential election the 50 incentive decreased their 30-day vaccination rate by nearly 5 percentage points for respondents ages 40 and over which is kind of on the older end of our sample um both the 10 and 50 dollar incentive reduced vaccination rates um by about five percentage points and again here we can only speculate on why this happened but one guess is that the incentive was interpreted as a signal that there was something wrong with the vaccine finally we did look at the impact of the public health messaging from a race or gender concordant messenger and we were unable to detect any impact of race concordance uh for gender we found a somewhat surprising effect again so for some messages particularly the one focused on negative health consequences uh a gender discipline messenger actually reduced vaccination rates this was particularly true for the respondents who were who were young under age 40 in our sample for men and for latinx respondents so just to kind of conclude we unfortunately found that none of our interventions small financial incentives um public health messages or an easy appointment scheduling link increased actual vaccinations um and financial incentives actually seem to backfire for some groups um while more work should be done in other settings our takeaway that small financial incentives and other nudges are unlikely to meaningfully increase vaccination rates amongst the vaccine hesitant in the u.s thank you
