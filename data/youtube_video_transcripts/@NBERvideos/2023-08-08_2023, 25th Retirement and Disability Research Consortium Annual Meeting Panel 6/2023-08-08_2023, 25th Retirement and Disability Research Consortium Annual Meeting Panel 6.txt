this is a panel on informing trust fund projections the moderator will be John Sable house so John is visiting fellow at the urban Brookings tax policy Center he has a PhD from University of Maryland I think of him as being an expert on wealth data consumer expenditure data excellent all-around Economist uh John I appreciate your serving as moderator thank you John I I really really appreciate uh you're inviting me to um moderate this session there are uh we're gonna see three great papers uh and they get to one of the uh things I worked on 20 years ago I think before I knew John or maybe right as I met John which is about using mostly micro simulation but other types of micro based techniques to think about macro questions and and the real key the the thing that ties these three papers together is there are things that are happening to groups of people that are also affecting uh macro outcomes and and Social Security budgetary outcomes so we're informing trust fund projections but we're doing so in a very important way so our three papers uh the first we will hear from honka hewn Johnson uh who is a research scientist at University of Southern California using the fam and Femme models to study covid-19 and again showing us sort of the you know the uh two sides of covet 19. it's a obviously a terrible set of outcomes but it does have implications for Social Security Finances uh after that and I will just segue straight from one to the other uh we will hear from Karen Smith who's a senior fellow at the urban Institute uh using the dynasim model so another uh great uh micro simulation model used for studying lawn problems talking about the implications of differences uh black white differentials in terms of earnings capacity and other demographic characteristics that affect how Social Security impacts them but also in turn you know sticking with the theme impacts the Social Security System more generally and finally we have a a last minute pitch hitter uh from the team at Opportunity insights uh and as we saw cat uh we'll be talking about the work that they've been doing on narrowing uh or the narrowing of racial wealth gaps and and what the implications are uh again for Social Security so with that I have my trusty timer set I assume everybody's going to stay on time and we're going to wrap up here on a Friday uh in goodstead we will have plenty of time for questions so I'll go ahead and get the timer started and hand things over to honko thank you John let me share my screen can you see my slides yes we can see them okay great so uh thank you for your introduction I'm hanker and Johnson I'm at the USC Shaffer Center for Health policy and economics as are my co-workers drives like davala and Brian Tysinger and Julian reef is at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Brian was actually scheduled to do this presentation but he unfortunately he's out sick so I'm stepping in for him I want to thank the rdrc for funding this project and I want to provide this disclaimer that the findings that we're showing are ours and not representing the views of any of the agencies so the project that we're dealing with today is um is excess mortality and the effects of that during the pandemic on Social Security Outlets I'm not able to afford my slides there we go so this is a chart that many of you have probably kept track of during the pandemic and maybe a little bit too much but it shows really beautifully the excess mortality in the U.S from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 to uh to current day and we're seeing excess deaths observed until January of 2023 of this year and so far we've been going on the average over the seasonal of on the seasonal variation and so hopefully we'll stay that way this year but we'll see if we're out of the woods just yet and um the the question that we had is who are these people and what does this access mortality mean for Social Security outlays because we don't know what the kind of factual situation is of the people who died we don't know if they were healthy if they were retired or not if they had disabilities even if they would have died a month after their after death after covid after dying from covid because we don't observe them otherwise so that's the question that we had and what the effects are on the Social Security outlive now the standard approach is basically to take a life table by age gender and perhaps race ethnicity and look at the average lifespan of a person at a specific age however we believe that we can do better than that by using a micro simulation and I'll go into the details on my next slide on the methodology but uh we are taking into account chronic conditions as well as nursing home status of simulants and thereby we can possibly make a better estimate of how long these people would have lived and other characteristics that are important for social security benefits as well as as contributions so a quick recap of the highlights of the paper was that although most of the mortality was of course during the older ages for for people of older ages but most of the life years lost the majority more than 50 percent was for those under 65 years and of course it's because these people die younger and they have more life years left and um of course there was a lot of uh talk in the beginning of the pandemic that only the sickest of the sick were dying and uh we show with our numbers that about 38 of the decidents would have had an average or above average life expectancy showing that it's not indeed the sickest of the sick but it's also not average because we're um it's not 50 of Precedence So currently the CDC estimates that there are about 1.8 million excess deaths up to January of this year and we estimate that that results in 24 million life years lost and that's about 13 years per person so that's pretty substantial the micro simulation that we're using is the future adult model and the future elderly model these are for different age groups they are first order Markov models and taking in data survey data from the panel study of income Dynamics and the health and retirement study as well as other survey data to calibrate and validate from uh these mcbs and IHS and Maps as well as census data we take these panel server data we estimate transition models to determine what the probability is of people basically changing their status every two-year in their health characteristics or their personal characteristics such as do they do they get diabetes do they become unemployed or what are they receiving benefits do they get children have children get married Etc and we simulate this at the individual level so we're really able to both look at the risk factors for covert mortality as well as the outcomes that we're interested in we're representing 223 million adults in the US over 25 years and older and those are the people who entered those panel studies which is the the requirement is that you form a household and the income the I'm sorry the outcomes that we're interested in uh are included in our simulation we're predicting mortality Quality of Life Health behaviors disease incidence functional limitations uh disability survivors benefits um old age benefits and earnings taxes nursing home entry Etc everything that's going to be important for this project and uh we have a lot of collaborators if you're interested in collaborating please reach out we're always interested in new research projects and working together with people around the world so how do we account for the covert deaths in the micro simulation so we begin with the stock population of in the U.S that is 25 years and older and we simulate that cohort until death then during those pandemic waves we calculate a risk of coveted mortality as well as regular mortality and assign deaths to specific people or basically in behind the scenes we're actually assigned to parts of people based on their weights and re-weight all the outcomes in that way the excess deaths are coming from the CDC data by race ethnicity sex and age and we assign these based on risk factors and then we compare the outcomes of one simulation to the counterfactual covert free simulation the outcomes that we're interested in is related to old age Survivor disability insurance spending related to survivors benefits retirement benefits and um disability benefits for both the dissidents and their family members and so we have these characteristics for everyone we know if they're married when they're getting children also in the future and whether they are working receiving benefits Etc other earnings other details and uh we then determine changes in these outcomes as a total as a total sum for the whole population and compare that to the kind of factual in general we're expecting increased spending on survivors benefits of course for children and their Spa in The Descent spouses however in some cases of course you'll see a slight decrease because someone who's dying at 30 without children but then has children at 35 and dies five years later of course in that case the counter factual there would be survivors benefits being being provided um and then uh we look at the the decidance benefits as well and their earnings and the taxes that they're not paying in anymore because of covet so uh another part that we're interested is in the racial disparities and I'm going to have only two results slides because we're still processing some of the data but I wanted to show some of the racial disparities that we have uh observed this is also in our first paper that we published uh we're showing basically that a larger part of the covet pandemic burden in terms of life here is lost as well as quality of Justice life first loss we're placed on the Black and Hispanic population we see about one and a half to two and a half times higher burden and compared to White across basically all ages and then we were curious what does this do to to the children of these decidance because these children will lose a parent they will be without parents for a specific number of years and if we quantify that for uh for children of of in families where a parent has died we can see that also for this measure we see Stark disparity where a black and Or Hispanic child will have twice as many one one half to two and a half times as many years uh without a parent until age 18 compared to white children and so now I will get into some of the dollar amounts that we are estimating and this I want to preface this with saying that we have calculated a lot of the measures in terms of years but have not been able to finalize the dollar amount so we're using average amounts for these estimates I just wanted to provide a general idea of what the um how large the different components are and I'm also not listing all the components that we're working on but in general we are seeing approximately two and a 2.2 million years of benefits that are to be paid out to surviving children of decidance resulting in about 28 billion dollars over their lifetime up until 18 in most cases we are estimating about 5.5 million years of missed payroll taxes or self-employment taxes of decidance amounting to approximately 35 billion dollars then on the other side where benefits that do not have to be paid out because a person has died is about 660 000 years in disability benefits and this amounts to approximately 12 billion dollars but the biggest chunk is really in unpaid retirement benefits of decadence we are estimating approximately 450 billion dollars and so this is really showing that um a lot of older people have have died and are do not need to be paid their retirement benefits anymore and this is it's it's it's a little bit cruel but this will result in in considerable savings and this is similar to for example smoking or or binge drinking where that is actually beneficial for these kinds of programs now we are as I mentioned we are still doing some ongoing analyzes I have not listed all the beneficiary categories that are that are present and the rules are complex as many of you know and we're working on all these different roles and family size is taking to that account that factor unlike the case where both parents died Etc then as I mentioned those numbers that I mentioned are average amounts we want to assign specific benefit amounts based on the characteristics of decidance to get a better idea of their um if they are different than that than the effort average they'll be interesting to find out in itself and then we have information on the taxes that they paid in our micro simulation and we'll use that to determine get a better idea of the missed payroll taxes and then we will dive deeper into racial ethnic disparities in receiving survivorship benefits and with that I will hand it back to you John and if anyone has any questions afterwards feel free to reach out to me thank you that was great I uh in pretty close to time uh let's go ahead and turn it over to Karen and I will restart the clock now I can hear it okay excellent okay so this is Joint work with my co-author Richard Johnson and we also had some advice from our racial Equity analytics lab and Mickey Wade at AARP no the normal display disclosure this work was funded by the Social Security Administration through the drdc and their results their opinions are those of the authors so black people face many systematic disadvantaged advantages that limit their social security benefits compared with white people black people have lower educational attainments they're less likely to ever marry and have fewer years they have worse Health higher disability rates a lower life expectancy and they work fewer years that give them lower annual earnings I'm sorry my my screen is acting up badly let me just try this again so our research question is how much do these systematic racial uh disadvantages uh affect their lifetime and annual benefits it's at age 70. so we show how eliminating many of the systematic disadvantages that black workers face could narrow the racial gaps improve retirement incomes improve oh my goodness I'm sorry I don't understand what's happening if one of the technical people wants to jump in please do I don't have it it's just I'm not hitting my cursor to advance and it's advancing all on its own okay so I've got a fight with my screen so we show how Limited in the racial disadvantages could uh narrow the racial benefit gaps the Improvement retirement incomes and improve Social Security Finances data and methods so we use urban institutes Dynamic stimulation of income model the model starts with the national representative sample of the US population in 2006 it makes annual projections of demographic and economic outcomes out to 2100 this allows us to do 75-year Actuarial projections the model includes behavioral equations are estimated estimated using the best available data these equations include racial differences either by projecting racial dummies or um different equations for blacks and non-blacks we project Baseline and Alternate simulations the Baseline simulation contain all the racial differences including included in the model's Behavior equations the alternate simulations remove black disadvantages and select the behavioral equations we then compare the Baseline and Alternate simulations and calculate the change in like annual Social Security benefits to age 70 that's when most people have claimed their benefit we look at lifetime Social Security benefits and bike attacks and we look at 75-year finances and our alternate stimulations we're systematically going to remove black disadvantages we do this in health disability and death marriage education labor force participation hourly wages at all five disadvantages combined we're going to focus on people born between 1996 and 2005. this is when these cohorts are they're age 1 to 10 in 2006 and we can measure their benefits at age 70 in that happens between 2066 and 2075. the model projects for all these cohorts their benefits through death we're going to show the numbers in 2021 inflation-adjusted dollars so what are our results so this chart shows black and black and white male and female differentials I want to focus your attention on the gold bars these are showing the differences between blacks and whites the key thing to take away is that the differences in most categories is negative that is blacks are worse off than than whites the one exception is for female black female labor force participation where black women actually work lower black women's work at higher rates than white women but the overall number of work years is about the same but this these cumulative disadvantages mean that black men have about 55 percent less uh lifetime uh lifetime earnings and 18 life lower lifetime earnings for black women so just equate you with my my bar charts here the blue bars show results for white adults the gold bar show results for black adults in the Baseline and the black bar showed the results of blacks in the simulation that includes all the five removing the five racial disadvantages so what is the takeaway so this is showing better median benefits of Social Security benefits at age 70. so eliminating our racial differences eliminates racial gaps in media and Social Security benefits by about 23 percent the male that a racial Gap is much bigger than the female racial Gap black women's lifetime earnings are more like white women's lifetime earnings so limited in the black disadvantages has a smaller impact on black women's benefits than on black men's benefits but eliminating the the disadvantages increases black women's benefits by about one percent but 54 for black men this is a similar chart but now looking at life media lifetime benefits overall eliminating black racial disadvantages boosts retiree lifetime benefits by about 23 percent the lifetime the the differences are much bigger for black men than for black women five percent increase for black women and 47 for black men so what disadvantage Matters Most the most important factor so the the bar charts are showing the change in lifetime benefits those are in blue and the change of benefits at age 70 that's gold the uh wage differential has the biggest impact on reducing the racial disadvantage the interesting story about participation is that the uh benefits at age 70 actually decline in the stimulation that's because as we increase participation those many of those no workers delay claiming also black workers work at low white women work lower rates than black women so when we like make black women work like white women it reduces employment but eliminating the health and marriage disadvantages have bigger effects on Lifetime benefits than on benefits at age 70. so what is the impact on Social Security Finances so this chart looks at uh cost and income rates over the 75-year time period and eliminated in The Black disadvantages extends the ability to pay full and scheduled benefits by three years you can see that as the shift out in this black bar out three years from 2035 to 2038 uh the additional revenue from higher payroll taxes would reduce the required benefit reduction when trust funds are depleted you can see that by the higher level in the payable benefits in the black bar relative to the Baseline which is the dotted bars and the trust fund benefits from revenue gains that Inc that happens sooner than the higher the higher Revenue gains that happen higher than the higher the cost expenditures in the future so eliminating the racial disadvantages reduces the unfunded liabilities by 1.7 trillion dollars over 75 years uh this happens because we get a 3.6 increase in the present value of taxable payroll uh it's a 3.9 percent increase in the present value of non-interest income this is higher than taxable payroll because the higher benefits also yield higher taxes on benefits but it's only in a 1.6 increase in the present value of cost so the uh taxes are rising faster than the cost or more than the cost that saves the trust fund money so eliminating the black disadvantages reduces the 75-year actual deficit by 0.27 percent of taxable payroll this is actually a relatively small adjustment but that's partly because blacks are only 12 percent of the US population limiting the impact of the reforms on the trust fund finances the actual deficit remains High and the changes do not close the long-term financing Gap so summary and conclusions will structural racism reduces Social Security benefits for black beneficiaries decreasing mean benefits for white but relative to White beneficiaries by 26 percent eliminating the systematic disadvantages and health disability marriage education employment and wages could increase lifetime benefits of black beneficiaries by 23 percent significantly reducing the racial benefit Gap the wage disadvantage has the biggest impact on Lifetime benefits and gains from eliminating the racial disadvantage are bigger for black men than they are for black women and the present value of payroll taxes is greater than the present value of benefit of additional benefits in improving Social Security Finances so eliminate the systematic disadvantages increases benefits for black beneficiaries it improves Social Security Finances it extends the solvency date by three years and most importantly it reduces the size of the benefit reduction or tax crease needed to maintain and maintain maintain solvency and that improves benefits for everyone thank you thank you Karen uh in your usual efficient way you have bought us back some time very much uh John Sable house for doing this and to the panel too uh we had a couple of last minute uh substitutions and they did a great job I appreciate it
