so there is a current policy debate about whether or not banks are safer now than before the crisis for example janet yellen last year at the jackson hall conference said yes because regulation has imposed banks to progressively decrease the book leverage banks should be better able to absorb a negative shock and so they should be safer now than before the crisis at the same time natasha sarin and larry summers have suggested that if you look at market signals of credit risks such as market leverage it has gone up since the financial crisis so banks are not safer than before the crisis so we will see during this talk that market and book measure give opposite signals because they are talking to addressing different concept of bank safety but the tension between book and market measurement of bank safety can be crystallized in the market to book ratio of equity the reason why market and book measure of safety have gone in opposite direction is because this ratio has changed over time so as it should be clear on this picture the market to book ratio of equity was around 1 from 1970 to 1984 then rose to 2 from 1996 to 2007 and fell back to one after the financial crisis so what does the market-to-book ratio of equity signals about bank safety what is driving the market-to-book ratio of equity well the literature has pushed to interpret a high market to book ratio of equity as reflecting a high franchise value of the bank the bank could have economy capital that is not directly reflected on the balance sheet they could have a source of monopolistic power or some intangible capital that gives us gives them this franchise value now natasha sarin and larry summers have pushed for the argument that regulation has damaged this franchise value and is responsible for the drop in the market to market to book ratio of equity now we would like to to argue in this paper that the market to book ratio of equity could be high because the liabilities of the bank are backed by government guarantees equity holder and the bank do not have to compensate debt holder for the risk they are taking they're reaping of the benefits of taking risks during normal times and it is the government that that intervenes and pay back depositors during a financial crisis now if the drop in the market to book ratio of equity from two to one that we observed during the financial crisis is reflecting a decline in the franchise value of equity then the continuation value of the bank declined banks are closer to bankruptcy now and they are less safe now than before the crisis in the sense that market equity and debt holder is still at risk now if the decline in the market to book ratio of equity is reflecting a decline in the value of government guarantees if by imposing regulation on banks by imposing to reduce their leverage at the book leverage we reduce the taxpayers levy liability to bailout banks during a financial crisis then in that sense banks a safer now than before the crisis so in this paper we're going to provide a theoretical and empirical model to try to decompose the changes in this market-to-book ratio of equity m-e-b-e whether it can be accounted by changes in the franchise value of equity fe or the value of government guarantee gov so how do we proceed well first we're going to use bankers estimates of fair value of loans and deposit that they compute and report themselves to construct the franchise value of equity then we're going to use a golden growth dividend model and use accounting data on profitability and leverage of bank to try to see how much of the market to book ratio of equity can be accounted either by changes in the franchise value or changes in the government in the value of government guarantees let me turn now to our model so we consider a model set in discrete time where at every period a random state is drawn according to a risk neutral probability we assume a constant risk-free rate so we abstract for interest rate risk on the balance sheet of the bank the bank we is going to have loans on its asset and government guaranteed deposit d and book equity be on its liabilities now all the components of the balance sheet of the bank are going to grow at the same rate g of s now what is the franchise value of equity then well we can attach a fair value to the loan operation of the bank bankers receive interest rates on these loans net of servicing cost some loans are going to mature and some loans are going to default so the fair value of equity is then the net the expected present value of all of this cash flow we can do a parallel calculation for the deposit arm of the bank bankers pay interest rate to depositors servicing cost and some customers are going to withdraw money so again the fair value of a one dollar deposit is then simply the expected present value of all this cash flow now to estimate both of this fair value of loans and deposits we're going to use directly banker's estimate of those numbers now the franchise value of equity is then simply the difference between the fair value of loans and deposits and the book value of loans in deposit so intuitively you could have a high franchise value because you are able to lend at higher interest rates and market rates and you're able to borrow funds at market rates at rates lower than market rates so what is the market value of equity well we show in the paper that we can write the dividends that we're going to use in our golden growth dividend model as the excess return that you receive on your risky loan that you purchase at price vl plus interest that you would receive on loan and deposit if you were taking no risk so intuitively by increasing the quantity of risk that the bank is taking you can increase the excess return that you receive on your loans but the market value of equity is then the expected present value of all of this cash flow taking into account the option to default now if at any state the cash flows of the bank plus the continuation value of the bank is negative equity holders are going to decide to default and during a bankruptcy equity hall they're not going to pay back depositors because of limited liabilities so the government is going to seize the bank and as we have seen in the case of b stern and g p morgan is going to inject cash in the bank to assist the sale of the bank so the value of this government guarantees of this cash injection is then simply the pre the expected present value of all this future cash injection importantly in our framework money and emilia holds if you recognize that the government has a negative stake in the bank so equity holders benefit from these government guarantees because they're ripping off profit during normal times and is the government that comes to pay back depositors during a financial crisis without government guarantees the market value of equity will simply be equal to the sum of the book value of equity and the franchise value of equity so how do we price so yeah so so then our framework is providing the decomposition of changes in the market to book ratio of equity into changes in the fair value of equity and government guarantees so to price the value the this option value to default and the corresponding side of the service option which are which are these government guarantees we need to calibrate the risk the the risk that banks are taking on their asset portfolios to do so we're going to look at excess return on portfolio of diversified corporate bonds let's not forget that you know portfolio of government bonds do not only contains loan to fund but also all the asset-backed securities now on this table you can show you can see the realized annual excess return that you would receive on this different portfolio of different rating classes during the financial crisis and the normal times as you can see most of the time you earned a small premium and then every now and then you got hammered by a crisis which turns out to be optimal for equity holder to benefit from those government guarantees now using this number provides a very useful benchmark for imputing the total losses of this portfolio during the financial crisis now as you can see the more risk you're taking the more you're going to lose during the financial crisis and the more is your excess premium during normal times so a banks that would have assets equi that have risk equivalent to triple b corporate bonds with 10 percent of equity would become insolvent during the crisis now we assume two states normal times in crisis and to calibrate the risk neutral probability of a crisis we use the fact that by arbitrage under the risk neutral probability the expected real the expected excess return have to be equal to zero so we have one formula three variable we use the the losses during the financial crisis to set the excess return during crisis times then if we set the risk neutral probability of normal times 2.95 then we we have that the formula is giving us the implied excess return during normal times and as we can see by choosing a risk natural probability of a crisis of five percent we get implied excess return during normal times that is sufficiently close to what we observed in the data so before going to the full accounting exercise i want to demonstrate that the value of government guarantees not only can account for the high level of market to book ratio of equity before the financial crisis but can also account for the change from two to one that we observed after the financial crisis for this exercise i will use a stylized bank that issue liabilities backed by the government and then as has it with greatest risk similar to portfolio of corporate bonds we assume a reasonable risk-free interest rate and a growth rate that we observed on the balance sheet of the banks before the financial crisis so here is the formula for the market to book ratio of equity of such a bank if this ratio is lower than one it means that the bank is not taking enough risk to benefit from government guarantees and then is not going to go to decide to default during a financial crisis now if you look if you use the losses on this different portfolio to calibrate the loss during the financial crisis you use um the calibration of the risk neutral probability of the cr of a crisis of five percent then you will you can compute the implied market to book ratio of equity here and you're going to have a certain implied return on equity given a certain level of book leverage now what we find remarkable what we find surprising is that a bank that would have asset that have creditors similar to triple b corporate bond already generates a market-to-book ratio of equity of two then if you if you are janet yellen and you pass regulation to decrease the book leverage of the bank you completely wiped out the value of this government guarantees so all you have to believe here to be able to account for the high market to book ratio of equity before the financial crisis and the second jump from two to one that we observed is that the asset of the bank have created risk similar to portfolio of corporate bonds triple b so this result actually reconciled the view of yelen with the view of summer sarin and summers if your concept of safety is the protection of the taxpayer because by reducing the book leverage from 90 to 85 percent we wiped out this value of this contingent liabilities then banks are safer now because the taxpayer liabilities is smaller now than before the crisis now if your concept of safety is the protection of debt inequity holders of the bank then banks are not safer because they are still enjoying a small value of this government guarantees they would still go bankrupt during a financial crisis and in that sense the bank the bank is not safer as they are still at risk so let's move now to the full accounting procedure in the first step we're going to measure the fair value to construct the franchise value of the bank and to do so we're going to use banker's estimate of the fair value of loans and deposit then we're going to use our golden growth dividend model use all the accounting data that we have on accounting profitability and leverage and use our formula to see how much of the market-to-book ratio of equity can be accounted for franchise value or government guarantees so bankers have to report in the footnotes of the annual report the fair value of the loans we collect these numbers for 19 large banks on their annual reports we aggregate the numbers what we find is that before the crisis the fair value of loans is about 2.5 of the book value of loans before the crisis and almost disappeared after the financial crisis similarly for deposit we have two sources one is the portfolio model developed by the office of thrift supervision and the second one is coming from whole bank transactions so basically when one bank acquires another bank account and have to justify why they overpaid for this deposit so the this reported number that they called car deposit intangible showed that the fair value of deposit before the financial crisis was about 2.5 percent and also substantially declined after the financial crisis so there is evidence that indeed the franchise value of the bank significantly dropped after the financial crisis now when we do a full accounting exercise we find that the fair value of equity can account for 48 of the book value of equity similarly when we use all the accounting data on bank profitability and leverage and interest rates that we observe during our period we find that more than half of the market to book ratio of equity is accounted for the value of government guarantees both of these components significantly dropped after the financial crisis so again we reconcile the view of yelen with sarin and summers if your concept of safety is the protection of taxpayer then banks are safe for now because it will significantly reduce the contingent liability of bailing out banks during the financial crisis if your concept of bank safety is the protection of equity and debt holders then the banks are still as risky as before because they still enjoy some value from government guarantees and would still go bankrupt in a financial crisis now let's go back to our original picture if you look at the market book ratio of equity we successfully explained the high level before the financial crisis and the subsequent drop after the financial crisis but what happened in the mid 80s that we observe the rise from one to two well what is remarkable about bank is how much profitable they became in the mid 80s to make that concrete we can develop a benchmark return on equity which would be the return that you would receive if you were taking no risk so intuitively if you have no franchise value this return should just be equal to the risk-free interest rate now if you have franchise value here is simply the modified formula for the risk-free return on equity so we use this memory to decompose the observed accounting profit during or period to decompose the accounting return on equity into one fraction that can be high because there is high interest rate or you have some franchise value and one portion that comes from the fact that you're loading on aggregate credit risk and what we find is that in the mid 80s banks significantly increase the fraction of the accounting returns that comes from taking risk now to conclude our work is suggesting that moves to lighten the regulatory burden on banks should we met with caution we have seen that the valuation of government guarantees is highly sensitive to the quantity of risk that the banks are taking so if regulators allow even a moderate increase in risk risk-taking by banks we should observe a significant jump both in the market valuation of banks and in their accounting profitability the temptation will then be to interpret this increase in market valuation and accounting profit as a restoration of the franchise value that was damaged by regulation instead we would like to argue that it would be better interpreted as a restoration to the times where the taxpayers had the large contingent liability to bailout banks during the financial crisis thank you
