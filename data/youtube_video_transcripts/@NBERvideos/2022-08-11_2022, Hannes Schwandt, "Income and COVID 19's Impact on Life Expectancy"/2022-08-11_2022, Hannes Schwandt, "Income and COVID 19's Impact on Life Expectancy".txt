hi everybody so i would like to talk today about a new paper that was just published in gemma on the changes in the relationship between income and life expectancy before and during the covet 19 pandemic in california 2015 2021 this is joint work with janet curry at princeton till van barter and jonathan kowalski at ucl and derek chapman and stephen wolf at virginia commonwealth so um there has been a lot of interest in the mortality income relationship also called the gradient in particular i think in economics in recent years for example um chatty cutler and co-authors they have a 2016 jamaa paper where they show that life expectancy between the poorest and the richest percentiles are like gets up to like 12 years or 12 and a half years and in the paper with janet curry in 2016 we show that um life expectancy or mortality inequality increased for all the ages but actually like at younger ages there has been some different changes so overall there's been a lot of interest but um it's not clear how the pandemic impacted those gradients and it is understood with a lot of indications that the economically disadvantaged people are more strongly impacted but how exactly the income mortality gradient has changed remains unclear so what we want to do in this paper is ask exactly how the covet 19 pandemic has impacted the existing income and race ethnicity disparities life expectancy and we are using detailed contemporaneous mortality data that is available for california that includes uh not only the settings demographic characteristics but also importantly the census tract and so what we first do is that we simply provide um a life expectancy estimates for 2021 this paper is uh to our knowledge the first to to show how life expectancy actually has developed um in the second year of the pandemic and we show this overall as well as by race and ethnicity and then in the core part of the paper we look at gradients and we follow a method that we've already used in the 2016 paper which is that we calculate um life expectancy by income percentiles defined across like um spatial areas in this case we use census tracts and which are like way smaller than um than counties so for california we have around like 4 000 um census tracts and uh with around like you know median uh population by census check is something like two thousand two thousand five hundred people and so what we do is simply that we rank census tracts by the median income and then divide those groups and i divide them into into percentiles based on the income and we use population estimates from the american community survey to provide a denominator there why is it useful to do this method it's first um you can look at uh all ages right because you you you you can include like children infants um it doesn't depend on people having income then you conclude you know the whole population because you know you can include every death and every person and the last thing is that you know measurement errors and life expectancy or mortality that you typically encounter those small and small area estimates and they get cancelled out once you divide those into percentiles i'm great so let's let's first look at overall life expectancy uh um from 2015 up to 2021 so including the the the two years of the pandemic so um after the pandemics under 2019 we see here for overall california the thick black line life expectancy it was around like um 80 81 and a half 82 years and it was quite stable also over the whole us this period actually life expectancy slightly declined or stagnated pretty much and why not hispanic population we see is actually below the average here the blue thinner line and that is because and there is of course this large hispanic population in california and even though spanning population typically has like lower income on average than the white non-spending population they have actually quite good health and and high life expectancy so they're you know um around like three years higher life expectancy then there's also a sizable asian non-hispanic population and they have even higher life expectancy so above 85 years we see here and then um the black and hispanic population has uh you know a much lower life expectancy yeah more than five years in all life expectancy this is like the situation that we faced before the pandemic now overall life expectancy goes down first year by f by 2.2 years it's a little bit about a stronger decline than than us-wide but you know similar range and then that's the first estimate for life expectancy for 2021 here we see that actually declines even further so you know a year where where vaccines become um available uh life is declines by three years compared to 2019. that's overall now if we look at like individual groups the white non-hispanic actually a group has a less strong decline um than the overall population in california and that is just by 1.9 years in 2021 and that's the case because the other subgroups have much stronger reductions so the most dramatic reductions here is among the hispanic population we see a staggering decline of almost six years of life expectancy and that is really that was quite shocking to us to see that we also see strong reductions for the black non-hispanic population and interestingly also for the asian underspending population a population that is you know we see enter the the the pandemic with the really uh you know strong life expectancy advantage and just one thing to point out here what we see is that the hispanic population the life expectancy falls below the white non-hispanic population for the first time in in a long time so this is really astonishing development here okay so let's next look at life expectancy gradients um and so the relationship between um between census tract uh income and and and and mortality or life expectancy and so first the way we show like some the super statistics uh by median income percentile so here in the first row a column we have the percentile going from the first like the poorest to 100 the richest and we see that it's actually a quite large range of income so the median income is just twenty one thousand dollars in the first percentile and over two hundred thirty thousand dollars in the richest percentile so it really reflects quite well in wide range now uh how do gradients look like in 2015 so here on the x-axis we have the census tract uh percentile going from the poorest to the richest and life expectancy on the y-axis and we see that um the the bottom percentile has you know just above 76 years of life expectancy while the top has you know a above 86 almost 87 years life expectancy that's a huge huge difference so 10.3 years of difference and it's actually um um almost comparable to the difference that uh rashetti and co-authors find in their paper that is based on individual level income so if you rank everyone in the u.s by the individual level income you get to a difference of around like you know 12 and a half years of life expectancy and so 10.3 years years is is getting quite closer meaning with these the census tract um um is quite a powerful way to um to to to get to life expectancy gradients for the population that's 2015 things don't really change over time overall and they also the gradients are also really stable for 16 17 18 and 19 a little bit of an increase so now we enter the before the pandemic we have like now a difference of 11.5 years between the richest and the poorest and presenters but now look what happens when we look at uh 2020 and we see this really dramatic decline in life expectancy in the poorest um and census tract bins and almost no decline in the in the richest areas so that uh it translates into quite dramatic steepening uh of the life expectancy gradient so while we had in 2019 11.5 years difference we end up with a 14.7 big almost 15 years uh life expectancy difference in in in 2020 and and that only gets more dramatic when we look at 2021 so and here we end up with a 15.5 here difference in life expectancy and we see that the bottom and percentile you know decline from 75.9 almost you know let's say 76 to 71 and a half yeah yes so and that's a really dramatic decline while for the top percentile there's just about one year of life expectancy reduction um happening and you can also we can estimate linear gradients here shown on the right they're just like coming from just like you know a linear or less regression and we see that beforehand it was around like 0.075 um per percentile and that increases um by by pretty much a third uh or more than a third um in the in in in the pandemic years so now let's look at the changes by ry race ethnicity and the gradient so again as we had seen before um the overall life expectancy declines were much stronger in um in the hispanic um the the black of the asian population and the question here is this is just driven by those populations living in and you know predominantly in the poorer areas and this is just an income effect or is it something that is on top of income so what we show now in the in this figure again on the on the x-axis we have the income percentile going from the poorest to the richest and the y-axis here sorry that the label isn't shown and it's the change in the life expectancy um and in the life expectancy of these different subgroups and we see that the hispanic population had like a much stronger decline um than the non-hispanic white population even conditional income so this is not just an income effect but those um stronger life expectancy clients have been even conditional on income and the um asian and the black population lies somewhat in between and that pattern just gets even stronger in 2019 and 2021 so let me wrap up what what we find is that all we show is that the pandemic has sharply increased existing disparities by income and race ethnicity and life expectancy for california so there was hardly any life expectancy lost in the richest areas while there were four year declines in the poorest areas and um the the hispanic black and asian populations experienced greater loss in life expectancy even conditional non-income and also stronger steepening of the of the of the gradient so overall what our result suggests is that the pandemic policies help to mitigate life expectancy losses among economically advantaged populations but none among the disadvantaged and it's really important to rather understand why this is the case to you know hopefully um improve the um you know pandemic responses for the future thank you very much
