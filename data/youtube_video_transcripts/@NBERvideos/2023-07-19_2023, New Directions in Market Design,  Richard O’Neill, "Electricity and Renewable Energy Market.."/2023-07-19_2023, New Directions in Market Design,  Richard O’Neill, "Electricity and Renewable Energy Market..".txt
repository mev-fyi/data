well first of all a little background um from 1935 to sometime in the 80s both the Natural Gas and Electric Systems in the United States were essentially what they called Cradle to grave regulation uh they and gas they regulated Wellhead prices they regulated transmission Estates then took over regulated distribution and retail prices same thing was true in uh in electric power they regulated the wholesale sales they regulated transmission States took over and did retail regulation uh in in the 1980s uh we started to re-examine um the issue of whether or not that was the best model and what had happened over time is that you could make a very strong argument that the commodity markets could be made competitive or even possibly more competitive but were basically tied up in a bunch of inertia with long-term contracts and things like that uh but uh as the uh the century ended uh we both we had we were very successful in in unbundling a commodity from transmission deregulating the commodity to a certain extent um making the transmission system Open Access and essentially creating competition in both the natural gas uh and uh Electric Power Systems uh the one not that we haven't cracked yet is retail pricing and you've heard both Martin and Mark talk about that uh and it's it's if you look at it it's like going over a wall once you go from the transmission system to the distribution system in the U.S uh the transmission and the wholesale sales are the sales that the Wellhead are very competitive and Open Access in the distribution system is still using the techniques it had a century ago to price electricity um uh the gas and electricity markets were essentially untouched due to technological innovation because they continue to make the processes more efficient and the prices continue to come down so there wasn't a lot of people screaming and yelling um but eventually uh due to some over optimistic of demand forecasts and electricity the standard uh way to forecast demand was to attach it to somebody's forecast of the GDP um and the forecast went wrong and they ended up with a lot of extra capacity and the utilities were actually amenable or more amenable than they were before the Open Access um re-examined it the philosophy for both gas and and electric was uh to focus on the places where they were Market power and to get rid of the regulation to a certain extent where there wasn't Market power for example the secondary markets for transmission um the the sale of the commodity under certain rules were all things that we could probably better regulate uh through competition now uh there was a legal argument that said that you know uh prices had to be just and reasonable the debate on that what a just in reasonable price is goes back to the Greek philosophers through the Roman Church uh up through still at State commissions today um as a matter of fact in the Roman Church there was an interesting debate between whether or not markets could set just in reasonable prices or whether or not you needed what we call cost of service here to set just in reasonable prices well apparently in the U.S they had forgotten about the market setting just in reasonable prices and focused on the fact that you had to use cost of service um and when we pointed that out to the courts the courts bought into it that in fact you could let uh competitions just in reasonable prices um well the first uh set of uh uh essentially deregulation when in natural gas it went fairly well uh it's still working fairly well um and then in 1996 we required the electric transmission system to open access and uh some of the power pools that exist in existence at the time thought that was a step backwards and so to accommodate them we created what we call the independent system system operator bias or my not the bias the option uh and they were quite happy with that now to get yourself into the debate um you need essentially three languages and probably a fourth where p and uh in economics usually means price in Power Systems it's a standard for for react uh real power Q is quantity and economics and it's reactive power in electricity and so on and they use the same they use different phrases for the essentially the same thing now uh the design criteria for isos sort of followed um a standard mix of uh of economic uh uh properties and also some additional properties and the one uh I uh Frank uh Wallach asked me to mail this thing to him last night I think I sent him the presentation he said make sure you make them understand that you have to have physically feasible dispatch uh and and so uh that's one of the the uh design criteria that we used in in these markets and that the markets had to match up with the physics of the system um now the other thing is is these markets are non-convex uh and so when you invoke convexity and try to force fit these models into convexity uh you lose uh market efficiency um as as Martin pointed out one of the interesting things is that if you basically walk try to make these markets convex you lose all these complementarities uh complementarities don't exist in convex markets and complementaries can be very important the problem with complementaries Martin's examples is you can't get by with a single price you have to have multiple prices and and it's it's efficient price discrimination um it's this is the iconic uh view of of the uh a feasible set of the AC power flow conditions uh this is a graph from uh Ian hiskins uh it it appears in in most all presentations of this sort um and it's it's only three dimensions and you can see that projection into three dimensions is awfully nasty and probably isn't even close to convection and then when you think about this we go from three dimensions to pjm the system is keeping the lights on in here today where it has 15 000 nodes three thousand generators 20 000 transmission lines and a lot of variables and constraints when you go to the optimization so it's a big problem and uh and nobody really pretends that we get it all uh correct now the other problem here is the is the fact that the fossil fuel side of the business and possibly some of the consumption side of the business has startup costs uh then a Max production levels minimum run times uh yada yada and so when you draw the uh the the simple two-dimensional diagram um which uses supply and demand uh step functions uh my feeling is what you really have to look at is the fact that each generator has declining average cost and that the market clears C3 and C A I3 it clears on the average cost curve not on the uh not on the marginal cost curve and that's where these side payments come in um which are not very transparent um now as as we go move to a more renewable system which probably won't be fully renewable in my lifetime um you know we we sort of get rid of this this part of the business but we probably don't get rid of it on the demand side um in 1997 uh pjm I was the first uh uh ISO to dip its foot into the market um it uh it used lagrangian relaxation which is we've talked about that before as this clearing algorithm didn't do very well um but uh we started to come up on the learning curve the learning curve for example uh we started out assuming convex cities that didn't work very well went to two-part pricing with Mayco payments that settled the market down quite a bit didn't really solve a problem in my opinion um we had a big debate about whether or not there would be congestion or not in the market uh the the no congestion uh folks won and so we went to zonal markets in pjm in less than a year they uh they had figured out how to game that market it collapsed and they wanted uh they went to two-part uh it's not the two-part they went to nodal pricing the reason why in my contention is that they looked at historical data and the way the utilities ran their systems historically was very Loosely they didn't they didn't congest the system they kept it uncongested yet when you put it into the market you push it right up against the congestion and and and you get congestion um there was uh no demand side if you looked at the early models they all have cost minimization with a single point for the demand when you have a single point in this optimization model for demand the implication is the demand is willing to pay an infinite amount of money to satisfy itself that doesn't make a whole lot of sense because you dispatch a lot of very expensive generators uh just to get that all the demand satisfied even today less than three percent of the demand in the market is is in the market um that that's pathetic um and uh and instead of having the demand side in the market to classically set what we would call scarcity prices we put price capsule in the market very arbitrary um and and they disappear as soon as the politics moves against them in February of 2021 in aircot um they had an elaborate way of calculating uh the cost of of reserves to keep the system going they made that a part of the pricing mechanism it was uh nine thousand dollars I believe uh that created a huge problem and the Texas Railroad Commission changed the value of demand to I think six thousand dollars a megawatt hour overnight um without even making a calculation um so uh it would be nice to have a demand side in this market so that the demand side could set the scarcity price and we wouldn't have a bunch of arguments about how you calculate it um today uh we have uh a bunch of markets that that the isos operate one of them is the day Head Market it's a financial hedge against the real-time Market it's a dispatch a physical dispatch uh we run it for about 36 to 48 hours for in the Horizon effects um we only priced 24 hours the first 24. um is it's a multi-product with energy and reserves it's also spatial and temporal with both time and and space differentiated prices um and uh and as I said before it's a hedge into the real-time Market the real-time Market runs every five minutes it's a physical balancing Market uh uh it prices only the next period uh it has limited uh commitment options and decommitment options because it's not it does not have a long time Horizon but almost every fossil generator has a uh has a minimum run time uh and demand still in that market is forecasted as a vertical demand curve uh they we also have a transmission rights Market uh which I won't go into it has a problem with Revenue adequacy we have a capacity Market which has a very weak pedigree because it was created because the energy market prices were too low uh now it's very hard to sell a methodology that makes the price higher um but in fact what we end up with is capacity markets which now have have gotten to be about 20 of the total uh uh energy market price um here's another iconic uh picture I've added the Western imbalance Market uh which basically uh is is going to essentially extend the Cal ISO and the haves to a certain extent uh over a fairly wide uh group section of the the Western Market uh the Western people don't particularly like being regulated by people in Washington D.C and so they're pretending that they're not being regulated right now um isos now account for over 70 percent of the U.S market uh every day about over a hundred million dollars changes hands um at least on paper uh and uh with uh increased reliability it would probably uh be saving at least 10 billion dollars a year um in in uh in its operation um as Morton uh mentioned and right now this is one of the problems I'm working on is there are computational issues I mean the market design is limited by by computations I mean these are very big markets very big optimization problems uh and uh we're not we're nowhere near actually solving the the real physics problem but we try I mean the objective is to get close um in in uh it and and as I said before we use originally used lagrangian relaxation to solve this problem but um people hadn't noticed the fact that mixed integer program had taken some great leaps in the late 90s and early 2000s and still is and we had a conference um in 99 showing how mixed integer programs should programming should replace lagrangian relaxation um five years later pjm actually implemented it saved about 500 million dollars a year which then uh gave us the the hammer to beat on the rest of the isos to to use uh mixed integer programming and in 2017 all of the isos had to develop that uh and then one another RP a Shameless uh plug uh model uh uh computational model got five to 35 times speed UPS uh on difficult problems um the model actually today still solves into a gap which is about twenty four thousand dollars so we are not really sure and the Gap basically we may have the optimal solution but we don't know it and and consequently um The Gap says that we could be losing about twenty four thousand dollars by moving uh by not having the optimal solution oops it's the wrong way uh so after 20 years of of these isos is sort of like what I was saying this morning we probably need some maintenance or repainting or a couple uh maybe even extension onto the the the market uh we're only about halfway there and the market is changing under our feet uh we're getting more Renewables uh we have lots of devices I mean in in 78 uh French weapons sort of laid out how to do all this stuff uh now we have all the technology it's just it's there it's almost ready uh to be used and it you know we have interval meters and all that so we have all the the the hardware if you will for the for for making the market more efficient but we haven't been able to move the market design into a position where it will uh become more efficient um you know the market has always been stochastic except that the engineers figured a way to sort of disappear the stochasticity in the market and pretend it was deterministic but it had you know the there's always been a probability that the generator will fail and they they modify capacity to to essentially represent that and and so there's a lot of subtle ways of dealing with stochastics but the wind and solar stochastics are completely different than the failures uh mode of the of the other generators and so weather forecasting is going to become really important um not only just for day-to-day operations but but for extreme weather uh arguably in in aircot in 2021 if we they would if they had a better forward look uh at at the market they would have been able to to to do a little bit better in terms of I don't think they could have solved the problem but they could have probably did a little bit better than the catastrophe um we expect to see greater price volatility um uh by the way I would argue that the bidding process gotcha the bidding process in in the day ahead market for wind and solar is not just a bid zero price it's it's the bid a probabilistic supply curve which includes the fact that if you don't realize the later steps on your supply curve you're going to have to buy back your position in the real-time Market which could be very expensive so that the supply curve is not going to look like a flat zero across it's it's going to have an upward slope um at cease skipping over some things uh probably the most important thing is to get demand into the market I mean there's just no and by by getting into the market I don't mean time will use prices or all kinds of gimmicks that happen at the state level and been happening for the last 100 years get into the market and bid I've been trying to to talk to get data centers and tell them you know why don't you bid your flexible load into the market they all have excuses I don't know why including uh Google and Microsoft and who are all represented here today so you know take the message um and let's see well since I don't up well yeah as I said before the prices in the energy Market are too low and yeah interestingly enough although the value is represented as infinite the the demand when it's a fixed Point can never set the price um and so you with what you really want is for the demand side to be in the market and set the market price occasionally including the reserve price and a whole bunch of other things and also you want to reflect the fact that when you're having extreme weather events the prices are important to get people off the system and to get generators on the system and not the Amber Alert that they used in California the last time they had a a problem I guess people from Stanford here uh I don't know whether you got the Amber Alert or not but it actually worked I mean it's a sort of an LMR everything because you don't get any Financial rewards other than not having to pay the price which is a price that's been set a couple of years ago probably uh uh so it doesn't have anything to do with the current circumstances um we're working on the computational problems as I said before and in essence uh there's lots of room um for improving the system especially um in modern ex and extreme weather scenarios we don't really know how to deal with them yet but certainly we can do better there's no doubt about that uh and uh and I think there's lots of room for improvement and billions of dollars at stake thank you
