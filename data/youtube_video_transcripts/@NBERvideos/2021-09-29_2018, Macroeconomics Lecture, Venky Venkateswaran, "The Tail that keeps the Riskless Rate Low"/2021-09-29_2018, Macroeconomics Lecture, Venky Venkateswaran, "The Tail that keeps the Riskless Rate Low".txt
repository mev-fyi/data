motivation for this paper is thinking about government bond deals in the aftermath of the great recession so several people have documented they've fallen considerably since uh 2008-2009 and perhaps more interestingly they have remained persistently low and uh the explanation of the story we're going to kind of pursue in this paper is that the great recession was an unusual event in the context of the us economy and observing an unusual event changes agents beliefs about tale events about similar events recurring in the future and this change in their beliefs is going to have persistent effects on the return they require from safe and liquid assets so we're going to argue that this story lines up quite well with the data it's quantitatively quite powerful it's consistent with evidence from equity and other markets and i'm going to try and show you the ingredients that are necessary to make this story kind of stick okay so that's kind of the plan for the next 15 minutes or 17 minutes so here are the key ingredients of the paper so the central premise the basic idea that we're going to start with is that agents don't know the true distribution of aggregate shocks but are going to estimate that distribution in real time as they see new data so that's going to be the standard or that's perhaps the new piece in that's the central new piece uh in our analysis the approach we take to beliefs is going to be slightly unusual but nothing terribly non-standard we're going to uh assume that agents learn about these this distribution in a non-parametric fashion that's going to give a meaningful dimension to this notion of tail risk the likelihood of extreme adverse events distinct from uncertainty which is kind of more a second moment type of object so that's part one of our um of our belief estimation uh strategy the second is we're going to try and use observable macro data uh aggregate and data to discipline uh our statement our conclusions about agents beliefs and i'll be much more specific about that and we'll talk more about that in some second right so that's kind of the the key ingredient and in that setting what i'm what i'm going to try and show you is that a tail event an event like the great recession which is unusual is going to induce large changes in agents beliefs especially in the likelihood they attach to tail events to negative events in the left tail um already [Laughter] so um perhaps more importantly apart from the fact that it changes beliefs by a lot these changes are going to be extremely long-lived long-lasting even when the underlying shocks are transitory so their their effects on economic outcomes are going to outlast the transitory effects of the shock and that's where the persistence is going to come from right so that's going to be a key part of our analysis uh today right so that's kind of the mechanism that's what's new perhaps from our perspective uh in our analysis so we're going to embed that in a fairly standard economic environment to kind of quantify the effects of this mechanism for interest rates which is the focus in this paper and one key op you know we're going to add a bunch of things that are necessary perhaps for quantitative relevance and one of the key ingredients is going to be liquidity constraints so these the safe asset the riskless asset in our economy is also going to provide liquidity services and the change in tail risk will interact with that liquidity provision uh in an interesting way so we're going to come back to that uh when i get to the mechanism so the upshot of all that is that the observing an event like the great recession is going to lead to a large and persistent drop in riskless rates so in our under our calibration that's about 1.45 percent um and i'm going to show you that the model's implications for things like options prices are actually consistent with the data in a particular way so i i'll talk more about that when i get to the results so that's the plan of action for the next uh for this for the rest of the talk okay so let me kind of spend a little bit of time on the belief formation the new piece here and i'll and i'll go through quickly the the economic environment because i want to get to the results right so think about agents trying to estimate an unknown distribution g of an iid shock process so they know the shock is iid they just don't know the distribution it's drawn from they have a finite history of shock realizations and they're trying to fit this distribution so as i said at the beginning our goal is a relatively flexible specification that's more tractable but it also can capture changes in tail risk and not just parametric changes in in second moments and the approach we're going to take is we're going to do a very standard non-parametric estimation uh the gaussian kernel density and here is the form of the gaussian kernel density um the parameter kappa the the bandwidth of the of the kernel uh and it basically just uh rather than kind of dwell on this formula let me show you an example about how this works most of you in this room should be very familiar so this shouldn't come as a surprise but it's useful to kind of just highlight exactly how this is going to work so on the left is the kernel density estimated on this finite sample and you know so the blue bars are the actual observed frequency distribution the histogram the kernel essentially just draws a nice smooth line through that and kappa is basically controlling how smooth that line has to be right so after you see a tail event and the tail event here is going to be those you know a really bad realization some about 0.85 and a really bad one around 0.93 as you can see they are well outside the the realm of the the realizations before such an event so how does the kernel deal with that the kernel basically kind of you know it takes a little bit of the mass away from here and shifts it there and draws a smooth pdf uh all the way through right so that's going to be the updated belief it's a little bit more pessimistic and in a particular way it's going to have more mass in the left tail and that's where all the action uh and that's what's going to deliver all the action uh in the model so this is about how beliefs change uh but as i said at the beginning what we are perhaps more interested in is why how persistent are these belief changes um so let me try and highlight that you know again using the same example so you know so this is g hat t estimated after the tail event uh has been realized so you know we're let's say we kind of take this economy forward for another you know 30 years and let's see what happens to beliefs in this in this setting right so now we have to take a stand on where we are going to draw time parts for this economy from if you kind of simulate this economy by drawing from g hat t the updated estimate of the agent's distribution in other words we're putting ourselves in the shoes of the agents and asking what is the our best guess for where sharks are going to come from then this setting has a kind of martingale property so the martingale property here holds approximately so the idea that beliefs uh on average uh out in the future are going to be the same as beliefs today right so that's where that's that already kind of tells you a fair a very strong result about persistence that these belief changes are going to stick around for a long time at least on average right so that's one ex that's one point i want to make the second you could also say let's let's try and simulate beliefs under an alternative world where the where the crisis the one the tail event that we observed was actually a freak event we're never going to see anything like this again it just we just happened to see one so eventually we're going to kind of you know forget about it we're going to essentially that's going to the effect of that on beliefs is eventually going to uh disappear however you know when you do this in this kind of non-parametric fashion that the pace at which these these beliefs get whittled down is actually very very slow so you know even after 30 years that bump that you saw on the previous graph is still very noticeable even though agents have never seen another crisis uh in that in that interval so eventually this bump will disappear but the pace is going to be very very slow so both of these things kind of underscore the idea that these belief changes belief changes about things that happen that the unusual stuff that happens all the way out left are extremely persistent right so that's going to be a key part of what we're going to find later okay so now let me kind of quickly walk you through what the ingredients of the economic model are nothing here should be you know particularly surprising i'm happy to get into more details if the discussions have comments on that so it's going to be a production economy this is the production function with capital and labor the only shock in the model is going to be what we're going to call a shock to aggregate capital quality so it's something which scales up the effective capital available for production in this economy right and that's the shock fee the shock is known to be iid but the distribution is what's unknown and that's what agents are going to learn about so this is the only shock in this model and i'll tell you how we're going to use data to construct a time series for the shock uh in in a second okay there's going to be a representative household which is going to give us a stochastic discount factor with standard preferences um and then the liquidity piece so these firms apart from this production activity they're also going to have another profitable investment opportunity an intra-period investment opportunity which is going to require liquidity so this is the simplest way to kind of build in a need a motive for liquidity in this economy so what they can invest in this project x is constrained by how much liquidity they have that liquidity is a function of gov the supply of government bonds which is what b here is and uh a fraction ada of the effective capital uh that uh that the economy has so since this is effective capital you can kind of see how uh the distribution of the shock process affects uh what agents think uh their liquidity needs would be or how how agents value the liquidity provided by this so as is usually standard you're going to get a pretty simple expression for the risk-free rate which is going to depend on the stochastic discount factor but it's also going to encode a liquidity premium which depends on how binding or how tight this constraint is so that's going to be we're going to quantify how much tail risk changes this liquidity premium in our results okay so that's uh that's essentially the these are all fairly standard ingredients uh in at least in modern macro uh to that we are going to append our new piece this idea that this belief distribution g is going to be estimated by agents in real time so at each point in time we're going to feed in macro data and that's going to spit out an observable belief uh sorry that's going to spit out an estimated belief uh g hat underscore t right in order to do that i need to first figure out how to construct a series for the shock fee um and that's what i'm going to turn to next okay um the idea there is uh the interpretation of the shock um or the mapping of the shock to the data is that effective capital maps to the market value of capital in in the u.s economy non-residential capital in the us economy and so to construct the series we're basically going to use the flow of funds which reports um the market value of non-residential assets used by non-financial corporations in the u.s and so the looking at that data through the lens of the model is a very transparent way to extract a time series for this fee so essentially fee is going to capture fluctuations in the market value of real estate and commercial real estate and other assets uh in the in the in the economy right so that's what that's what's going to give us the fee and through that kernel estimation process that's going to give us the the estimated belief process uh g hat t and i'll show you that in a second the rest of the calibration is pretty standard nothing particularly controversial risk aversion is kind of low we're going to have some we're going to calibrate the liquidity parameter so that it delivers a risk-free rate of 2 before the crisis right so that's how uh that part of the economy is going to be pinned down and then i'll show you what happens once you see this right so on the left panel here is the time series of that measured fee shock measured exactly as i discussed on the previous slide right so it's kind of you know somewhat stable here it bounces around a little bit and then you get these really bad negative realizations so about you know 93 or something percent here and point in about 83 in 2009 these are the two negative realizations and they're going to induce exactly the type of change in the belief distribution that i showed you in that simple example in fact that simple example made use of exactly the same uh uh the same idea the same series right so that's where that that that's our notion of increased tail risk uh and what i'm going to show you now is what this tail risk does to interest rates uh and liquidity premium in this economy right so that's our this is these are our estimated beliefs the blue line is the pre-crisis belief and the red line red dash line is the post crisis estimate okay so here's the thought experiment and i'll show you a bunch of results we're going to start the economy off at the steady state associated with the with with g hat 2007 so stochastic steady state so a long run average estimated using data through 2007 and then we're going to feed in uh the actual shocks estimate g hat 2009 and then simulate time parts for this economy drawing from this new updated distribution g hat 2009 and i'll show you what the average response of this economy uh or the average change in interest rates uh averaging over all these draws and then later today i'll just at the end i'll show you what happens if you simulate time parts conditioning on something like 2008 2009 never recurring again so we're just going to condition on paths where there are no more crises in the future i'll show you how or what changes affect okay so that's our basic uh main exercise so here's what happens to interest rates um in the economy right so the blue line uh is our baseline model that's the that's our that's kind of the model with learning for comparison the green dashed line is the same model uh with the learning mechanism turned off you know it's kind of the standard rational expectations assumption where we assume that agents know the distribution of shocks hitting the economy from the very beginning right so nothing they see the bad shock but their beliefs don't change because they know what the true distribution is right so the difference between these two things is essentially the contribution of learning uh to the story right so uh what happens uh when when the negative shock hit you know there's much less capital much less liquidity you know all of this leads to a big drop in the interest rate a fairly substantial one um and then but the economy slowly recovers back uh the the green line basically goes back to the steady state you know by the end of this time period it's well you know it's almost uh it's practically back to where it was at the beginning the speed of this the the reason it's a slow adjustment is because capital takes time to accumulate or replenish the the blue line shows a somewhat similar pattern because you can see it's kind of going to a new lower steady state so the new pes the pessimism induced by the learning mechanism takes the economy to a lower to a new steady state with lower amounts of capital lower amounts of output and importantly significantly lower interest rates right so that's kind of the main punch line here just for comparison the red dashed or the red circles are data using one year rail rates just to kind of give a sense for how much the change was uh over the same time period um so this idea so this thing here this economy is converging to a long run steady state and um i'll let me kind of quickly show you what the the the end results are there because i have five minutes left so like as i mentioned the lot the the model predicts that in the long run interest rates riskless interest rates are going to be 1.45 percent lower and here we collected a bunch of estimates for how much longer on interest rates or interest rates both short and long run have changed and you know this is kind of in the right ballpark uh in terms of how much the changes are uh we'll talk more about this hopefully after the discussion if there are any questions second we kind of to quantify how much of it comes from liquidity uh this is what this is an exercise where we kind of just isolate the component that's coming from liquidity and under our calibration almost all of this change comes from the liquidity premium perhaps not all together surprising we started out with a very very modest amount of risk aversion uh and so liquidity does you know a disproportionate amount of the of the heavy lifting here and the intuition of the mechanism is what i highlighted earlier you know once you are more slightly more pessimistic about capital uh about returns to capital you accumulate less capital and more importantly capital now is a worse supplier of liquidity because right when uh the adverse shock hits that's when you really need liquidity and that's when capital actually under delivers on liquidity so that the combination of those effects make the liquidity premium on bonds go through the roof and that's essentially what's explaining much of the drop in the in the rate of return on on risk response all right so that's one uh a quick comment on on equity prices and i'll conclude um so this here we do we kind of interpret equity as a levered value a levered claim on the value of the firm and price various equity related objects the only point i want to make here this is not exactly this is not intended to be a model of equity prices i don't want to push this too hard i just want to explain that in fact the model actually predicts that equity prices don't really fall off a cliff even though tail risk has gone up a lot so in a sense the fact that equity prices have run up the model cannot really match the huge run-up in equity prices but the fact it's not like it's predicting a precipitous fall either what is true is if you actually use this notion of equity to price options and construct measures of tail risk from traded options on on on the s p 500 the model's predictions are actually quite line up quite nicely with the data so the third moment or the probability of a return realization 30 below the mean are almost the change in those objects is almost exactly what you saw uh what you see in the data over this time period right my last slide um so that's what so this is the sense in which i want to kind of underscore that the this hypothesis of increased tail risk is broadly consistent with evidence from equity markets and particularly those on from on options so in my last slide um as i told you one of the the experiment the the analysis i showed you so far we were drawing future shocks from the updated belief distribution um here we're going to do the same thing but drawing from the pre-crisis distribution so the perspective here is that the 2008-2009 event where a freak you know occurrence we are never going to see something like this again so eventually this is going to wash itself out of agents beliefs but how fast does that happen and so the panel on the right the panel on the left is exactly what i showed you earlier the panel on the right is this with the new uh with a new distribution so as you can see there in what by the end of this period it was about 150 basis points here the drop in interest rates relative to the pre-crisis level is about 100 basis points so if i kept extending this this is going to go to zero but this at least kind of gives us a sense that this this reversion back to normal can take a very very long time right so that's the sense in which you know there is something about this mechanism that's a very powerful uh mechanism for persistence a powerful propagation mechanism so that's with that i'm going to conclude and turn it over to the discussions so the basic premise is you know i want to underscore is this idea we're going to start from this idea that no one none of us in the room agents in the real world nobody knows the true distribution but are constantly in the game of figuring out what it is and in some sense that's what uh that idea modeled in a way that is that treats tail events somewhat differently from normal events uh is up it gives us a new perspective on what persistence in uh after events like the great recession can come from
