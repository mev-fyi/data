hello my name is jessamine schaller i am at claremont mckenna college and i'm presenting joint work with benjamin hanson at the university of oregon and joseph sebia at san diego state university our paper is entitled schools job flexibility and married women's labor supply evidence from the coven 19 pandemic so recently there's been a lot of attention paid both in the media and among researchers to the disproportionate impacts that the coven 19 pandemic has had on labor market outcomes of women and of parents and there's been speculation about the role of school closures in generating these disproportionate impacts however the direct role of schools has been difficult to study for one thing because when schools closed they closed all at once and at a time when the pandemic was expanding and everything else was changing including economic activity and also because if we wanted to turn to school reopenings it's been hard to construct a consistent comparable database of school reopenings that actually tells us how many children are attending in person so our contribution is to use mobile phone foot traffic data from safe graph to create a continuous proxy for in-person school attendance essentially comparing weekday visits to k-12 school locations during the pandemic to pre-pandemic levels this measure that we construct is available for nearly all u.s counties across the entire span of the pandemic so we study through october of 2021 and our measure is more nuanced than categorical administrative data so within broad categories like hybrid learning and in-person learning we can actually observe uh the the level of foot traffic relative to pre-pandemic levels to get some idea of what share of kids are actually going to school we link our measure of reopening to employment work hours and remote work for women with school-age children and a handful of comparison groups in the current population survey so why do we focus our study on married women historically married women's labor supply has been an important subject in labor economics married women saw a dramatic increase in their labor force participation over the 20th century and in fact trends for this group have driven long-run trends in women's labor first participation overall married women are typically treated a little bit differently in theoretical models of labor supply so they're thought of as being more responsive to changes in wages and demands at home and their labor supply decisions are typically interpreted within a family framework empirically we know that women still take a primary role in household labor and parenting tasks even when they are primary earners or when they're in dual earner households and there's strong evidence that mothers still face a push and pull trade-off between family and career and that access to child care and job flexibility are important factors with cobit 19 we have a bit of a unique research opportunity so with school shutdowns millions of american children suddenly needed supervision and were at risk of learning loss and mental health problems then when schools reopened they reopened sooner in some places than others so what we have is a set of large and sudden shocks to demand on parental time at home and we have staggering of our treatment of school reopenings so that we can actually identify the effects of school reopening separately from the effects of other aspects of the pandemic now previous research has studied effects of increased availability of pre-k and kindergarten programs on maternal labor supply but in the modern era we really haven't seen such a large shock to the availability of schooling and child care for mothers of older children the kovit 19 pandemic also as we all know brought increased job flexibility in the form of remote work and a new cps question that allows us to directly study remote work so to give you some idea of the geographic variation in school reopening that we'll be exploiting here i have two figures so on the left hand side i'm showing you the changes in weekday school foot traffic for the minimum median and maximum states in terms of fall 2020 reopening so you can see that there's very large variation across these three states with south dakota reopening almost fully in the fall of 2020 and remaining open throughout that school year uh florida being somewhere in the middle and california down at the bottom hardly reopening until spring of 2021 and even remaining in fall of 2021 well below pre-pandemic levels in terms of school attendance now turning to the map on the right we can see more detailed variation in school reopenings so we can see regional patterns in particular that the middle and southeast of the country were far more reopened in the fall of 2020 compared with the west coast the southwest and the northeastern parts of the country but we can also see that within regions and even within some states there's substantial geographic variation in the extent of school reopening that we will exploit in our study for our labor market data we use micro level or individual level data from the current population survey we construct measures of employment hours and remote work inside and outside the k-12 education sector and this is important because we need to be able to remove the mechanical effects of schools reopening on employment within that sector from the estimates that will present as our main results due to data availability we'll link our labor market data to our school reopening proxy at the area level so county if it's available and then metro area if that's available and then also unincorporated areas within each state we focus our study on married women with children ages 6 to 17 and also consider three comparison groups so two of these comparison groups are groups that are also directly affected by school closures and reopenings so unmarried women with school-aged children and men with custodial school-age children but these two groups are known generally to have lower labor supply elasticity and so are likely to be less responsive in terms of their labor supply to these shocks we also consider married women without children as a comparison group so looking quickly at just what the raw data looked like in terms of labor force recovery there's not strong evidence that married women with kids between ages of 6 to 17 had particularly slow recovery other than the usual summer withdrawal from the labor force that married women with children are generally seen with but during the 2020 to 2021 school year their level of employment recovery was actually comparable to other groups um in this figure if we look at the map you can see definitely some geographic variation in the degree of employment recovery by fall of 2020 but you don't see that this map necessarily mirrors or matches the the map that we saw previously in order to get a deeper picture of the role of school reopenings we estimate difference in differences models which essentially are determining whether places that reopened more fully also saw larger within area increases in maternal labor supply than other areas within the same region that might have reopened less fully or at a later date we'll control for individual demographic characteristics we control for division specific time effects so essentially accounting for any shared shocks that might affect localities within the same division all at the same time uh and importantly we also control for area foot traffic to restaurants and bars and this is something that's important to our study because it allows us to control for more general economic reopening and maybe sentiment about about covin and finally we control for cumulative covenanting death rates at the local level before moving to our main results i'll show you evidence that our reopening proxy is actually correlated with other potential proxies for school reopening so we can look at employment and work hours as well as remote work shares within the k-12 education sector in the cps data and across the board we find positive and significant effects on education and work hours and strong large reductions in remote work in the k-12 sector this is really reassuring to us because it tells us that within our model that our proxy for school reopenings is indeed picking up school reopenings we also link our measure to a measure of predicted attendance based on the kovid 19 data hub data which is an extraordinary data collection effort that compiles administrative data on school reopenings but categorizes those into the broad categories of remote hybrid and reopen and so we use that data to construct an alternative proxy and it turns out that our proxy is pretty well correlated with that alternative measure okay so our main results are here and i'd like you to focus on the columns labeled other these are the effects on employment work hours and remote work in industries and occupations so sectors other than k-12 education and what we find is positive and significant effects on the employment and work hours of married women with school-aged children so we scale our coefficients so that they represent the effect of basically a full reopening of schools from being fully closed and so our coefficients suggest that full reopening of schools is associated with about a three percentage point increase a 3.3 percentage point increase in married women's labor force sorry employment status employment rate and also an increase in reported work hours of about three quarters of an hour per week and we also see reductions of about 3.2 percentage points in reported share working remotely when we turn to these comparison groups so unmarried women with school-age children men with children ages 6-17 and women without children we strikingly see zero effects at all of school reopenings unemployment status so we don't see statistically significant changes in employment work hours or remote work for these comparison groups looking at heterogeneity in our estimated effects by educational attainment we find that the employment effects of school reopenings are similar for women with a college degree and women without a college degree but we find that the reductions in remote work that went along with school reopenings are really concentrated among college-educated women turning to separate estimates by child age perhaps surprisingly we find that the employment effects of school reopenings are largely concentrated among mothers of older children between the ages of 12 to 17 and that the remote work effects of school reopenings are concentrated among mothers of young children so to summarize our key findings in this study we find that increases in in-person k-12 school attendance during the pandemic were indeed associated with increases in employment work and work hours and reductions in remote work among married women with school-aged children really strikingly outside of employment in the k-12 sector we do not find any effects of school reopenings on labor supply of single mothers of custodial fathers or of women without children the reductions in remote work that we find are the largest for college-educated mothers and mothers of young children and these are groups that are most likely to work in flexible jobs so it could be that the reason for these um larger reductions in remote work among these groups is because they were working in more flexible jobs to begin with but this might be an area for future study this does suggest that remote work may have mitigated employment losses for those groups the employment effects by contrast are concentrated among mothers of older children and are similar across education groups and mothers of older children may in fact work in less flexible jobs or it may be that their children face more severe mental health or human capital consequences of remote schooling so this is another area for potential future work to understand these differences by child age so that's all that i have for you today thank you for watching
