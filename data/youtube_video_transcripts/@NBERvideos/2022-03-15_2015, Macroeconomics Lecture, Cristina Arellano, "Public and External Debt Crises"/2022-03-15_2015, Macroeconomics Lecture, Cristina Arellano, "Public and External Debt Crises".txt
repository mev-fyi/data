in this paper we discuss debt crisis we are going to review the experiences of three different unions europe the united states and canada you know we all know about this ongoing phenomenal debt crisis in europe what's less known is that many of the u.s states have experienced a debt crisis comparable to some of the countries in europe during these debt crisis the spreads on public borrowing rose dramatically there were differences in the crisis in europe and in the u.s states for example the underlying levels of debt at which these crisis occur were very high in europe and are very low in u.s states in europe there were also spillovers to private borrowers whereas in the u.s they were not we're going to argue in this paper that the european countries faced an external debt crisis the u.s uh states faced a public debt crisis i also had canada on the title canada has been a pretty much a poster child the canadian provinces have not experienced any debt crisis so what we're going to do in this paper is we're going to argue that the different experiences from these three unions results from the interplay of two forces one is differences in the risk of government interference with private debt contracts and we define these as i said as the ability of the government to interfere with private external debt repayment the second force is differences in fiscal flexibility which is defined as the ability to vary revenue and spending appropriately and we're going to demonstrate that these two forces can lead to the different experiences observed in these unions we're going to have these three applications from a single unified theory i will show you that when a government can interfere with private debt contracts but has fiscal flexibility then in that environment public debt crisis and private external debt crisis will occur together and we see these as the appropriate case for the european countries when the government cannot interfere with private debt repayment and is has limitations on the flexibility of their fiscal instruments then in that environment only public debt crisis will occur and that is the relevant case for the u.s states last when the government cannot interfere with private debt repayment and is fiscally flexible that in that environment know that crisis will occur let me now show you some data so this is the very popular data on uh spreads on government debt in europe for the case of italy and spain the spreads on government debt rose and reached levels of about 500 basis points this is the similar plot for spreads for the states of california illinois new york and michigan and you see that in 2009 the spreads for some of these states rose significantly reaching levels comparable to those observed in italy and spain just across the border for the canadian provinces ontario quebec british columbia the spreads that they were facing on the government dead were pretty stable now the underlying levels of debt of these three unions are different for example the levels of debt for the canadian provinces here in green were pretty large actually comparable to some of the european uh countries the plot the shaded uh regions of the plot include unfunded liabilities so the uh canadian provinces with substantial levels of debt did not have that crisis the debt crisis in the in european countries happened with levels of debt to gdp of around over 100 percent and the u.s states in contrast had this debt crisis with very low levels of debt on average net debt to state gdp is around five percent in uh europe as i argue this public debt crisis had spillovers to the private sector what i am showing in this plot is cumulative net capital inflows from 2001 uh to 2012 and you see that these net capital inflows reach to uh levels of about five uh 50 of gdp what you can also see from this plot is the decomposition of total net uh capital inflows between uh the the the private inflows and inflows coming from uh official sources and you see that in the debt crisis there was a sudden stop a reversal on these private inflows where uh the the and the total inflows didn't really drop that much mainly due to ecb transfers and other transfers other official programs a second way to see these spillovers to the private sector in europe is to look at the co-movement of spreads for uh corporations non-financial corporations in this graph uh this is the uh the red line and the uh spreads on sovereigns in this graph that's the green line and you can see that also for the case of spain but this holds also for other countries in europe there's a stronghold movement of corporate spreads and sovereign spreads we in the u.s we did not really see these spillovers to the private sector in fact as an anecdote uh in july 2009 when the california government was issuing this debt at very high spread in fact they issued some ious to finance some short-term financing la county was able to borrow a really low rate so having looked at this evidence what we're going to do now is i'm going to show you a model that is going to integrate the experiences from these three unions tomorrow is a simple model it has a small open economy model with two periods and deterministic output output in period one is less than output in period two which creates the bar a borrowing motif households have preferences over private consumption and public expenditures in the model private agents uh households and domestic intermediaries have commitment to repay their debts while the government lacks commitment to repay its domestic or is external debt we're going to consider environments as i've been mentioning where the government there's differences in the risk of government interference meaning when there is risk of interference the government can induce a default on private external debt and also environments with varying flex of fiscal flexibility when the government is fiscally flexible is going to be able to set taxes freely defaulting on domestic external uh debt or interfering with the payment of private debt is going to induce a resource cost so in this model we have different level different debts for example we have the b the public domestic debt the dg which is the public external debt and the dp which is a private external debt there's going to be resource costs from default or interfering one for each one denoted by delta the government is benevolent and the price of that is going to compensate exante so in this in this case in period one is going to compensate creditors for default and interference so an important parameter in our model that is going to determine this degree of interference is this delta p how do we think about it we think about this this parameter as reflecting the institutional arrangements in these different regions in the us and in canada the constitutions provide strong creditor protection for for private creditors for example in the u.s the contract clause limits states from issuing paper money changing the legal tender and imposing moratoria on repayments we view this institutional environment as one where there's large interference cost a large delta fee there are some treaties for europe too for example this treaty on the functioning of the european union that limits the euro to be the legal tender but of course there's the risk of euro exit which we are actually all witnessing right now with greece and also this treaty allows for capital controls and suspension of property rights in case of emergency as they actually did in the case of cyprus we see this institutional environment as one where there's a small interference cost okay so let's go back to the model so in this this is very simple model if the unconstrained optimal in this model will require that private consumption is equal to public expenditure which equals to one-fourth of the aggregate you know income of course in our model the the government lacks commitment to repay debt and there are going to be some debt constraints arising from that lack of commitment that can be binding we're going to define a binding external constraint as the case where the marginal utility of product consumption is larger than the marginality in period one than that of period two and a binding public constraint if the marginal utility of public expenditures in period one is larger than that in period two let's consider the case of interference and fiscal flexibility and we see this as the appropriate case for the european countries just to give you a flavor of what the problem looks like here is uh sort of the problem in period two for the government the government is going to choose taxes style two and default and interference with these indicator functions that uh equal to one if if there's repayment to maximize the utility of the representative household the first result that we have is that there will not be a domestic default here the reason is because the government might default on domestic debt to raise revenue but that is going to lower private consumption okay but in addition it's gonna have this uh this extra resource cost so it's best for the government to with flexible taxes to simply raise taxes uh because that's going to have the same distributional effects among private and public agents and you know it can save on the resource cost now in terms of a default external default and interference it might occur in this model and uh the rules for default and interference is going to be natural that the government is going to choose to default or interfere if the level of debt that it has to pay is greater than the cost so these rules for defaulting and interfering are going to imply that they're in period one that's going to limit the amount of resources that they that the government can borrow okay um in addition the government is going to choose taxes and is going to choose taxes to uh to set private consumption equal to public consumption okay so in this environment because of the possibility of binding that constraints there there might be a binding data strain but the external and the public constraint is always going to bind together so this environment if there's a crisis here or these are there's a binding constraint it's going to occur for both for the public and for the external constraint now let's move to the other case okay let's consider now the case of uh no interference suppose that this interference cost is very large and fiscal flexibility in this case when the cost of interference is very large there's basically no debt constraints on private borrowing okay and households uh or prior consumption is going to be equalized across time consumption in period two is going to be equal to consumption period one now with fiscal flexibility the government again can use taxes freely and what the government actually can do is borrow from the private households such that it equalizes private expenditure over time and eq that and and make that equal to private uh consumption okay and so in this case the government you know is always lacks commitment so you know in my face this uh constrains on external borrowing but the public that constraint is irrelevant so in the case of no interference and fiscal flexibility we get that you know no not constraints are going to bind this is what we think about for the case of canada last let's consider the case of the u.s states so here is the this here is the case where the government does not interfere with private contracts but has fiscal inflexibility okay so as in the previous case the um the private consumption is going to be um there's no constraints on private borrowing and so consumption is equalized over time private consumption but now with fiscal inflexibility in particular suppose that the tax in period two is fixed and it's low then the private uh consumption is going to be greater than public consumption and so there might be a reason for the government here to default on both external and domestic debt because this would be the only way to raise revenue the rules for defaulting on these two types of that are similar to the previous case so you know default is is going to happen when the debt is greater than the cost but now you know it's going to be weighted by the the particular agent that pays or suffers the cost these uh these rules on domestic and external uh default are going to imply that the government faces this uh potentially can face these binding debt constraints and so in this environment we get that only the public constraint is going to bind these are our main theoretical results the paper contains a few other theoretical results and also other parts of the paper for example the paper documents the um the sovereign credit ceiling okay and how that has been uh the credit agencies have brought it back for the european countries and these rating agencies have used or used the risk of government interference as a main factor for limiting the rating of private corporations in european countries we also review how for the u.s states these credit agencies actually give them lower ratings specifically because of their lack of fiscal flexibility and contrast them with the flexibility in canadian provinces finally we have historical accounts on the constraints and interference for example we document that before the constitution and the contract clause was established there were many cases where states actually interfere with private repayments of debt okay and but why and after the contract clause was ratified with the us constitution you know this uh contra clause was used to um protect creditors protect creditors through various court rulings so let me conclude so in conclusion we've provided an integrated analysis of default risk on external and public debt we think that our work has some lessons for addressing the debt crisis in the eurozone for example we think that institutions that mitigate the risk of government interference might prove useful in terms of limiting a debt crisis to stay stay in the public sector and integrated banking might actually be a good way to do it second we also think that the restrictions on fiscal flexibility that have been talked about for europe one consideration is that that is actually going to reduce the test sustainability of many uh you know might reduce the sustainability of many of the european countries you
