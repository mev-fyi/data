i'm jonathan parker this is joint work with olivia kim and antoinette schwar my colleagues at mit this paper is about the owners of small businesses and the extent to which during the early stages of the covet 19 pandemic and the declaration of the national emergency they were able to maintain their standard of living or consumption spending despite potentially significantly large declines in revenues and so we basically have two questions that we're after here by what channels were the revenues of small businesses uh hammered or hit and reduced following the declaration of the national emergency on average most of the change could be due to local infection rates covet 19 levels locally it could be due to state or local responses non-pharmaceutical interventions like shelter and place orders or it could be due just to the national economic situation and the changing economic uncertainty the second question is given these revenue declines how did those feed into the standard of living of the owners of small businesses we don't know a lot about how exposed small business owners are to the volatile revenues that typically accompany small businesses and this is certainly an extreme case of volatility and so we want to see how hard has it been on small business owners at least in the early stages of the pandemic so we have three main findings the first of all we find that revenues and expenses and the consumption of the owners of these small businesses all fell by about 40 percent at the declaration of the national emergency in mid-march and remained reasonably low over about two to three months the early stages of the pandemic the drop in this performance the decline in revenues was vast majority of that was due to just the national emergency the declaration of the national emergency the concern over the pandemic the rise in economic uncertainty and general declines in economic activity not related to local infection rates or shelter-in-place orders those only contributed a modest amount to the declines in revenue for small businesses and then finally at least in the early stages of the pandemic despite significant revenue declines these revenue declines did not feed through into much differences in the standard of living or the consumption spending of the owners of these small businesses and that is basically revealed in this graph here the top blue line here shows the revenues in percent change relative to actually a year before but you can see that in the before march 15 the revenues are largely unchanged and for the least effective industry five industries at the four digit level they're also unchanged after the declaration of the pandemic if not slightly higher the most affected industries however experiencing more than 80 decline in revenues and yet the consumption of the small business owners of the unaffected and the affected industries the same five industries up here in the same indus five industries down here the owners had very similar declines in consumption and so that's the heart of our result which is that the actual small business owners didn't seem to have a lot of impact did not reduce consumption a lot when their small business declined revenues declined a lot at least on average why three possible reasons um and we think all three are at play first of all a lot of small business owners are used to weathering volatility and entered the pandemic situation with some liquidity and funds to draw down and use and there we are indeed we indeed see smaller consumption impact on small businesses where the owners entered the pandemic period with more liquidity ex-ante secondly there was a massive increase in fiscal support from both paycheck protection program economic impact payments some of these business owners would have been eligible for some of the ui extensions and expansions so median liquidity across industries actually rises following the declaration of the pandemic in the accounts meaning account balances grow so the massive fiscal support also helped insulate small business owners from the collapse of their small businesses and indeed the paycheck protection program was targeted that way finally all households were reducing their spending you couldn't go to entertainment or plays and lots of restaurants shut down and a lot of sort of consumption declined which means that even if your revenues or profits decline to some extent you don't need as much to consumption nobody's doing it it's a bad time and so um some revenue decline could happen without feeding into consumption just because you need slightly less income where where you'd like to of course have the full income but the the ability to spend it in certain circumstances in in this period was low the data we're using come from the jpmorgan chase institute which makes uh made this anonymized data set available to us and we helped to um to build it to um create account balances of business owners and link them to the account balances of the small businesses that they run the in the small business account space the jp morgan chase institute uses chase bank data gathers it together in the institute in an anonymized form and tries to use it to well to themselves and to allow sometimes outside researchers to create um studies that we think inform the public uh the public interest and and provide data like this so this is one of our one of these studies and we'd like to thank them a lot and of course the views of this paper reflect our own analysis and not that or the views of the of the bank or the institute the first fact is that averages revenues and expenses fell a lot relative to a year ago on average across all small businesses and this is about 40 percent with some rebounds so zero here is march 15th when the national emergency is declared um and so uh the week six is the end of march end of april um so there's some rebound increase into may um but you can see that it's a grim picture on average for small businesses following the declaration of the national emergency break down the proximate causes of that we'll look at the increase in infections per thousand in the county and the increase in shelter in place or other non-pharmaceutical interventions at the state level and then also include time effects and then what we can do is compare the regression run without time effects where the average increase in infections and shelter in place is measured by these two variables and their effect and with time effects where really the increase on average from zero to some positive number is measured only from the differences across counties that is it really is due only to the local impact of what's going on locally not the average change of all of the shelter in place and infections nationally and this this picture shows the red line shows what happens um if we don't include the time effects and we subtract the effect of shelter in place and infections and you get the red line which says that really a lot of this is due to shelter in place and infections but the national response as well as just the local response if we just subtract the impact of what's going on locally we get the blue line instead of the black line i.e the very small response to local shelter in place or or infection rates the vast majority of the average decline is due to what's going on at the national level even for small businesses turning to consumption we have a 40 average decline in consumption very much like the 40 average decline in revenues and we're going to measure the way small businesses revenues pass through into their owner's consumption by comparing two businesses in the same county in the same week so we know that business owners in general and indeed everyone in that county is probably reducing their consumption a bunch and so we're going to compare the difference in that reduction knowing that everybody's doing it to start with so and then we're going to look at a business which has a big effect of shelter in place and infections locally when we look at the national relationship and a business that has very little effect of those things when we look again across the whole country and so businesses that are hit hard are going to see bigger declines in in revenues when local infection rates and local shelter-in-place non-pharmaceutical interventions are imposed and other businesses are not and we're going to see whether those are going to cause differences in business revenues how much do those feed through into differences in owner consumption and the answer is very little sort of we've got here one point five percent per dollar two percent per dollar in terms of profits three point six percent per dollar so cents per dollar so so the fee the direct impact in the early stages of the pandemic of revenue losses minimal that's again this picture i started with the consumption of the most affected and least affected businesses very similar the consumption of the most the revenues of the least affected businesses and the revenues are the most affected businesses dramatically different and so our more structural analysis or a more cleanly identified analysis gives the same answer as that broad picture why well massive fiscal responses constraints to lower levels of spending and self-insurance so here's just the account balances part of that picture median change in business and household checking accounts rises between march and april and between april and may so that says that actually people are to some extent small business owners are actually accumulating wealth and small businesses are actually accumulating liquid wealth during this period that suggests a massive fiscal rebalance runs if we break that down by the most and least affected industries um the low most affected small businesses in the most affected industries see a significant decline initially in the um their account balances and then they're recovering by the end of by the end of may or by may sorry um that is the month of may um the the owner's accounts in the most affected industries um also drop initially and then recover and of course in the least affected industries um the account balances are just rising steadily and so that actually we know in general from similar data and from the jpmorgan chase analyses that have been done since with more recent data that a lot of these account balances have remained high on average or even on median through the summer and into at least the early part of the fall before starting to decline so large negative shocks to small business revenues and to owner consumption the large fraction of the job in revenues is driven by the national situation only modest effects of local infections and shelter in place or other non-pharmaceutical inventions interventions and modest pass-through of shocks to business income into the consumption of their owners possibly do in part due to pre-existing liquidity and it also substantially appears due to the massive fiscal response in the economic impact payments in the paycheck protection program of the cares act we hope to get back and look at what happens throughout the rest of the year in this relationship because this is just covering the early stages of the pandemic which while very bad seem to have been mitigated by preparation and fiscal responses thank you very much
