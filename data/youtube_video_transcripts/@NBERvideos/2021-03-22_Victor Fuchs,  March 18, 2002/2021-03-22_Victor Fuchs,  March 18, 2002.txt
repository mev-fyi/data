uh the fuchs a beautiful home in palo alto on the campus of stanford it is march 18 2002 i'm here with victor fuchs and victor is going to tell us about his times at the national bureau so why don't you take it from there and we'll go in whatever chronological or non-chronological direction you would like all right my my first time at the bureau i was there as a visitor at the invitation of saw fabricant i believe it was in the spring of 1958 i had a one semester leave of absence from columbia university to work on a social science council monograph my monograph dealt with the location of industry and was eventually published by yale university press i looked at changes in the location of manufacturing in the united states between 1929 and 1954 approximately and saul i guess knew of me or might have been an introduction between george stigler who was one of my professors at columbia and saul and saul said you know we have some extra offices if you'd like to come down and work there and it sounded good to me for the intellectual stimulation and contacts and so on and that's how i came to the bureau as a visitor and didn't return to the bureau until 1962 as a staff person uh when saul hired me to uh direct a project on the service industries right can you say a bit um about the fact that you were a graduate student at columbia you began in 1950 is that right that's nice that's right 1950 1950 uh and you continued in at columbia until it was in 1955 no 1958 that that last year when i was on leave writing was my last year at columbia i started teaching there immediately after completing okay so so it was 1958 is when you left your uh position as graduate student and you began your position as a system professor no no i uh i was a graduate student from 1950 on right i started teaching in 1953. okay i received my degree in 1955 and i left in 1958. okay and when you left in 58 you went to the ford foundation no i went to new york university uh for one year and then went to the ford foundation okay so you went to ford and 59 right okay now now i've got it all pretty much and when you were at uh columbia so so you were at columbia uh and you got your phd in in a very short period of time it was pretty fast well considering that i was teaching full-time considering or i should say that that you you became a an assistant professor very quickly well until i got the degree i wasn't called an assistant instructor an instructor okay uh so uh from from the time you were uh an instructor until when you got your phd you were you were teaching um economic theory no no i was teaching undergraduates in the school of general studies okay this was a special program mostly most of the courses were in the afternoon and in the evening most of the students were older uh than the typical undergraduate and that that's where i'm trying i was trying to figure out when you wrote warner and fuchs uh that was and that was that during that period of time yes okay yeah in fact i was going to mention well i like the case method of instruction even for principles right right and and um did how much interaction did you have with arthur when you were a graduate student i took one course with him right and that was our main interaction the second interaction was interesting because it didn't occur uh you uh as a graduate student when you take your oral exams in your courses you're allowed to choose the professor you want who do you want to do you know question you on economic history who do you want theory and so forth and i chose arthur as one of my professors who would question me and when i came to the orals unfortunately arthur had forgotten about it and at the last moment after we had all assembled uh j.m clark john maurice clark came in and said that arthur had called him and said that he was terribly sorry but he had forgotten about the exam and would he please come in and question me on economic theory and i had never taken a course with professor clark and i had never even exchanged three words with him in the time that i've been a graduate student but he was a perfect gentleman and he began the questioning by saying what would i like to talk about yes so it was no problem um and so so you had very little interaction with arthur when you were uh at columbia except for that one except for that except for that one course and that one course was of course on theory theory on anti theory yes we read hicks for example value and capital yes and things like that and uh but with stigler uh stigler taught you the basic price theory chrysler right right and that must have been an absolute joy joy yes why well i suppose when when that it was funny i used to go to any course that george would teach at chicago i would go to and just sit back and listen um uh because it was it was humorous it was filled with uh tidbits of interesting economics uh at what stage in your career uh when i was a graduate student like my uh second third year or remember this is the first course right yes and uh and it was 1950 51 and i don't know whether he wasn't i think george is marvelous i he you know i learned more economics from him than practically anybody but i think you have to have a certain amount of sophistication a certain amount of understanding in order to appreciate what he's saying as an introductory cost economic theory it was deficient in some respects it wasn't very complete uh george was very selective wisely i think in what he chose but there were lots of things that most people would get an introductory course that i knew nothing about i i think his teaching and his humor were perhaps too subtle at times right right and uh the other thing i remember very distinctly is that he would often come about 10 minutes late to class and then he would make up for it by leaving about 10 minutes early [Laughter] but but as compared to the alternatives were were to take course with the heart or with vickery i still think i made the right choice right um okay now we get back to um yeah that's not the bureau well it is it is the hero in the sense that that one of the interesting aspects about people at the bureau in the 50s and 60s is that so many of them had been columbia graduate students and that there was an obvious pipeline from colombia and it was often arthur but sometimes it wasn't arthur that was part of the pipeline right and in this case um it wasn't exactly george because george was on the committee that was supervising the this series of monographs uh census monographs sponsored by the social science research council so it was george who was the pipeline george was the connection between the bureau and colombia and that monogram now george comes to and says uh victor uh you want to work on uh location of industry uh what was your first uh sense of what you wanted to do what had you been thinking about working on very good question i'm not you want me to make it up now or you want me i'm not sure i was thinking about anything right i was just sort of you know had had a wife with three kids and just getting along and making my way in the world and i knew i wanted to do research but i didn't have that clear a line of in a way i was straddling industrial organization and labor uh i tell you where my thinking was as a young assistant professor at columbia one of the senior professors took me to lunch and said to me what did i plan to specialize in and i said to him i wasn't sure that i was going to specialize in anything it seemed to me that specializing in economics was already too much specialization he never spoke to me again the entire time that i would have said columbia right but the uh you know location of industry seemed uh fine good enough it was i liked working with numbers and this obviously afforded an opportunity to dig into a large dataset when once again in colombia did you take industrial organization with george no i didn't take industrialization as a student my interests were primarily in the direction of soviet economics comparative economic systems international trade economic development subjects of that kind i did not take labor wallman was the professor there and i didn't take industrial organization although later on i sat in on uh george's course in industrial organization and got a lot out of it but i never took it as a graduate right so okay so uh location of industry and clearly as someone who uh had an interest in and trade for example in development uh location of industry some of the same theories would apply no you just i i was more interested in development so on from the point of view of comparative economic systems right the soviet system other types of systems but but economic but the theory of trade and location of industry you didn't see the connection a little bit remember i i mostly didn't operate at a very deep theoretical right so at this point and we'll get we'll get to gary becker's influence on you uh a bit later right but another uh interesting point from other interviews is how many people say of the bureau i had a family and even even milton and the bureau said uh would you like to work and i thought well extra income for what i'm doing well that's great and here's yet another example of where the bureau steps in and uh helps people and pays them for what perhaps they wanted to do or in this case uh entices you in a slightly different uh slightly different direction okay so this is the route that you came to the bureau so uh in this this early year that you worked on this where where did you labor on this project were you physically at the bureau in 50 which project location of industry uh for a period of of the semester that i was uh on leave from columbia i was physically at the bureau i went in there almost every day had an office not always the same office one of the memories i have of the bureau in those days is that there was a very tyrannical office manager i think her name was o'neill but i'm not sure and one of the joys of coming in on a monday morning would be to see your effects in the hall being moved from one office to another because somebody else was going to occupy the office that had been previously assigned to you and i was probably the lowest person on the totem pole being just an unpaid visitor and so uh but i always had an office but i never knew which one it would be right and did you have any memory of of people who were there in that year and people you interacted with yes yes well i remember i i think i remember you know memory can be funny thing we're talking a long time ago uh zv grillicus uh he was there as a postdoctoral fellow i believe and the memory i have of him is his pouring through farm machinery catalogs and i said to myself here is a brilliant econometrician who thinks it's important and worthwhile to dig in and get out the actual details the specifications and the prices of machinery and so on so that is a a memory that i have from that early visit yeah right do you did you talk to anyone i mean here you were working on this this you know uh fairly large project uh where were you to begin uh what were you to do if you had a problem um what were the best sources you were using um census data you were using census manufacturing data oh yeah and uh every month i would go down to the uh census bureau in suitland maryland and i would spend at least half a week down there and i was a sworn agent of the census so i had access to material that would have been barred for disclosure reasons and so i was able to use all that material and i was able to have a great many of my calculations done within the bureau so that the data didn't move out within the census bureau and so on right that was i had more interaction with the uh colleagues at the census bureau than i did at the national bureau and and those were the more recent data for but for the data for the late 20s 30s 40s you could use the published stuff that was in the columbia stuff wasn't good enough because a lot of the uh stuff the uh geographical detail was not published because of disclosure reasons it was course for certain real information about particular in industries in particular locations yeah that's right so i had had access to the right unpublished material no i've i've used that material uh but not for the reasons that you were using it and and of course something like automobiles there are lots of uh asterisks straight across that's right yeah no but i had the whole stuff now who who um did someone say to you this is uh this is how you do it who how did you figure out uh i'm i can go to suitland maryland and get this um did this come to you i think i think the the committee uh provided a little guidance the committee which would communicate the social science research council committee that george was a member of they provided a little guidance and the people at the census bureau provided a lot of guidance into the data and as far as what to do with the data that i sort of made up as i went along right but but exactly where it was i i always imagine you know uh as a historian you have to think very hard about how to ferret out this information and how to figure it out but what to do with it after i had it well that was that was your that was your problem that was the hardest part right right that was the hard part um okay so now let's we're now back on track in 1958 and that's that's where we ended so so in 1958 uh you uh a brief visit to the 59 and then from 58 from 59 you were at nyu for the year uh as something right 59 uh 58.59 i guess yes i was associate professor at nyu right school commerce which had been my undergraduate school right right which you went to at night while working during the day for your father who was that was after the war right before the war i was a uh a day student right so 46 to 50 you you attended nyu in the evening right just till 47. i got my 36 okay i got a lot of credit for work done in the uh during the war during the war yeah right when you learned a tremendous amount and and bowdoin yale electrical engineering right so uh and then in 1959 you go to the ford foundation you work just for one year right no no i was full time for two years i'm sorry 59 to 62. and then i was half time for one year okay yeah uh and now uh and what did you do at ed ford you you worked in the field of what development and they had a program called economic development and administration but each program officer was to some extent free to develop his own ideas uh or her own ideas as as they wanted i became interested in a lot of problems having to do with human resources and so on that was when i first got interested in the health field i initiated a project on health education and welfare right i think it was one of more successful projects it cost twenty five thousand dollars uh it was internally administered uh it had uh i signed up six people to work on the project uh tw schultz uh kenneth arrow carl cason bob dorfman herb clarkman and peg gordon it's quite a group dorfman and kayson didn't come through but four out of six is not bad schultz produced that little volume called the economic value of education which has been a fantastic success translated into many languages arrow produced the seminal article on health economics published in the american economic review in 1968 not 1963. it's the most frequently cited single-authored article that arrow has ever written and then there were quite credible books by herb klarman on the economics of health and pet gordon on the economics of welfare so it was a big problem it was a good project and it also appears that it formed many of your ideas that later blossomed in hell it was educational uh because all well related to that was an assignment that i got from uh uh the president of the ford foundation uh healed henry heald uh i think that was his first name anyway he asked me to look into what if anything uh the ford foundation should do about health in the health field because until that point they had not done anything in health and i spent uh quite a bit of time looking into that i hired some marvelous consultants walsh mcdermott from cornell med school leona baumgartner who had been a commissioner of health in new york city uh rufus rohram who was one of one of the founders of the blue cross uh movement in the united states so i learned a lot from from those people right colin macleod from the rockefeller university and in the end i concluded that the the foundation should stay out of the field of financing biomedical research and medical schools and things like that but that it should provide support for work in health economics and healthcare administration and that type of things and we did make one grant that would be of interest to you with your chicago background and that is a grant to george bugbee and odin anderson who were pioneers in developing data on drugs on the consumption of drugs and so on and for many years they were supported by the drug industry and then the drug industry took away their support and they came to me and they said they had an opportunity to go to the university of chicago to the school of business but they didn't have any money right so i gave them a grant to get started there in chicago just one small thing which is why did you leave a tenured position at nyu to go to ford i didn't find the students uh at all uh challenging or interesting and i didn't find the intellectual environment uh contributing to my uh development and intellectual growth uh marion chamberlain who was a friend of mine from colombia and neil chamberlain were had deep forward connections and they came to me and they said you know this is an opportunity to learn and do things and so on and i thought they were right and they were right right i learned a great deal there i met all the most of the top economists in the country came through the office one way or another and so i did learn a lot there so it was a few a fruitful four years at ford two and a half two and a half i keep on getting dates wrong i when i read uh i did i when i when i tried to put together a veda of words from uh the pieces that you sent me yes but i i couldn't get the exact dates so okay but but now we have them we have them through my many errors on this tape you see i told you that when we make these tapes we make mistakes but i've made about 20 so far and uh okay so um so some of it was half time at ford what were you doing the other half time i was at the national bureau so after two years at ford right uh the national bureau came to me and said we would like you to come and join our staff and direct this project in the service industries i thought that began in 62 but so it began yes okay that's right it began in 62 because 59 60 61 62 that's why i counted four years at ford two and a half but it was only two and a half because it must have been the very end of 59 right and then you began the beginning of 62. i get it yeah okay now we got it absolutely straight victor well okay i i i i did well at ford uh one of my other uh projects which i'm kind of proud of it really led to uh much of the work that we associate with the poverty institute at wisconsin it started with jerry summers and bringing him down to west virginia and getting him to start to work on the unemployed in west virginia you remember that in the early 60s there was a lot of concern about structural unemployment or maybe you don't well you would remember us in the stargate not personally and uh that was an interesting project and uh gave support to the university of wisconsin i think it led to the creation of the journal of human resources and so on so that was uh that was a good thing and enjoyed that uh the at the end of the two years i had to make a decision the foundation wanted me to stay on and become a more or less permanent staff person and make my career at the foundation the bureau was offering me an opportunity to do research i liked both kinds of work and so i decided to try and i convinced each of them that let's try it on a halftime basis i spent half time at the bureau in halftime at the foundation and at the end of one year uh the foundation decided that this really didn't work for them and so then i made my choice to go full time so who was the contact at the bureau who was the assault advocate and you had first met saul when at the end when i was the police you were there as a visitor okay and saul came to you and he said what did he say exactly uh looking for somebody to direct this project on the service industries and would i do it and did you look at him and say services no not at all this has been an interest of mine this is something i had worked on when i was at the ford foundation yeah but but didn't you say saul services is is so many things it's you and me and the janitor and and the youth no no i i think i had a a clearer view of it than they did at the time because i i thought about a lot when i was at the front so what was the clear view that this whole american economy was being transformed from an industrial to a post-industrial society and it was being led by the shift in employment just as as the industrial revolution had been led by a shift in employment from agriculture to industry uh i'm going to anytime you want to get up you just get up good do you want it i can see this pace claudia we're not going to do it in an hour are we no well well what we've done i'll i'll turn it off right now okay we're in 1958 you're working on the service sector and no i'm in 1966. i'm starting a project on the search working on the service sector right and motivated by work on by the interest in the post-industrial society and take it in whatever direction you want to well that was a very very fruitful time i was full-time at the national bureau until 1968 and as i've said in my essay i considered it to be a long and late postdoctoral experience i was 38 years old when i came to the bureau and i felt that i really had not by a long shot completed my education and my training and so forth the graduate work at columbia was was okay but it was deficient in many respects uh the work at the fort foundation was very interesting and i learned a lot but it wasn't uh the kind of learning that you associate with being a a good research scholar and the bureau afforded that opportunity because there were very good people around and i mentioned of course particularly gary becker and he he along with george stigler were the two main influences on me from the point of view of intellectual development theory economics and so on and i also give gary credit for certain characteristics which i think are valuable if you're going to be a scholar and that is the willingness to take chances to be persistent uh not to be deterred by some people who are just harping at you and so on and those are things that i observed about gary which made an impression on me and in addition the the content of of uh his ideas and his theories of course also many ways gary is extremely succinct in his ideas he's succinct he's extremely successful um so and he's become a much better writer over the years much better yeah right i i think so too um so so from 60 to uh to 68 to 68 you're physically working physically there going in practically every day right and uh and who else or do you want to say jacob jacob mincer had been a fellow graduate student at columbia of all the graduate students i knew there he was the most impressive the brightest the most in command of of economics and also statistical technique and econometrics and so on and i continue to see a lot of jacob at at the bureau um can you say anything about uh life at the bureau uh uh people like gary and and jacob uh had jobs up in columbia yeah it was it was it was somewhat monastic uh people worked in their own little uh studies and a small group would gather together for lunch every day in the conference room uh this consisted of going down to the street and going to the grocery store and buying sandwiches and then coming up into the uh conference room and talking about the affairs of the day and so on i remember uh early on well almost from the beginning be being opposed to the vietnam war personally and uh most of the people there had not formed a strong opinion one way or the other or were actually maybe a little in favor of it and over time that changed i think i eventually persuaded not i but the vents persuaded arthur burns that the war was a bad idea and he tried to persuade nixon uh but uh not not very successfully when you would have lunch would would saul be there yeah yeah would jeff morgan would be there yeah would author be there sometimes yeah and and um what were the interactions with author and the group was there a sense that this was just a group of of peers and oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah right and there was an interesting type of interaction with arthur which would occur uh late in the day if you were prepared to devote a good deal of the early evening to it you would go down either you would take the initiative or author would ask you to come in for a chat and it would begin late in the afternoon and he didn't seem to be in any great hurry to go on anywhere else and so you'd sit there and he was a very very smart man right and he had a terrific range of uh contacts and understanding and appreciation of how the economy worked and how the world worked and so on uh i went when the decision was made to escalate the vietnam war he he knew about it i think long before the council of economic advisers knew about it because you know johnson did not keep them posted on what his defense spending plans were but the contracts were being let to uh defense contractors all over the country and uh and arthur knew that right and so he didn't need to have johnson tell him what was going to happen to the defense budget do you have a sense that everyone got along that uh uh author um author was a brilliant individual and and people um had enormous respect for the mind yes and followed him yes in many ways um but there are uh many statements about the fact that arthur could be very um to put it bluntly cruel to people did you ever yeah he was tough very tough-minded right and uh cruel in the sense of uh of speaking his mind without without a thought about uh the fragility of the yes yes that's right that's right that was not yes but on the other hand he he had a side to him which uh uh was exposed to me once which uh surprised me a little bit so i'll mention it uh he and his wife helen invited beverly and me to their home for dinner they lived in an apartment in manhattan and i was very pleased and very flattered to be invited there we were the only guests and at the end of the dinner helen asked if we would like coffee or tea and i said that i don't take either coffee or tea she said what do you drink i said i drink milk and turned out that she didn't have any milk in the house arthur immediately jumped up and he asked helen for a quarter because i don't think he carried right money around and he ran down to the basement of the apartment house where there was a vending machine that had milk in it and he got milk and brought it back up and that that really stuck with me yes obviously a different side of arthur than once saw at the bureau um i saw him i met him much later and and found him to be the most congenial bright individual it's a story i won't get into but i i uh um it was victor said that uh uh when i asked him about about arthur he's he said well he said i didn't see much of him he seemed very nice but one day he made ruth mack cry and that stuck with victor that if anyone could make ruth mack cry that was very bad did you have anything to do with ruth did you see her i i saw her a little bit but not a great deal uh our interests in terms of subject matter and so forth overlapped a little bit overlapping i had one chapter in my dissertation on uh fluctuations uh cyclical fluctuations in the fur industry right she had done some work on hiding leather and so forth so we had that in common uh you know ruth was a uh a uh fellow at the bureau in 1930 the same year that arthur was a fellow so they go back and forth she goes back a long way right i'll tell you one arthur's story yes which is relevant to my work at the bureau and that is about 1965 i had not completed the service industry project yet but i was thinking about where i would be going next in my research and i more or less decided that i wanted to pursue certain questions having to do with health economics and i came to arthur and told him about my plans and he tried to discourage me he tried to persuade me to think about some subjects like business cycles or economic growth something that would contribute more to my professional advancement and he didn't see a great deal of future for me as a growing as an economist to spend a lot of time on something like health economics which was sort of just a buy you know and uh i respected his opinion but i must have been somewhat tough-minded myself because i i persisted in that thought for a while and by chance i met uh a man named quick newton who was president of the commonwealth foundation in new york and i told him some of my ideas and he says well why don't you write me a letter and i sat down and i wrote him about a five-page letter telling him some of my ideas about health economics as a field and asking for some money and here my my memory is not perfect and you could check the files and see when the letter went out and so what but one day i walked into my office and it didn't seem very long afterwards and there was a check on my desk made out to victor fuchs for a very substantial amount of money again i don't remember exactly how much money it was but it was a big check and when i showed uh arthur the check he withdrew all his objections to my going do we work in health economics uh he is a realist you know and if someone is willing to fund it the person wanted to do it do it uh dick easterlin and and others have said uh something that's similar which is that um dick felt that there was um and and remember dick's talking about an earlier period because he's talking around 55-56 that there was little or no interest in the bureau in what he called labor population that nexus that's right and of course what dick was working on uh fit in because it was in the long swings tradition sure uh but this sort of fits in and but uh you come in when uh things are changing how could the bureau not be interested in labor if gary's there if jacob's there can uh do you have anything to say about um about that uh issue that here here is a collision of business cycles and this this new group and you're of course um moving from one to the other well i never did business cycles no you know but but you were uh you were i should say the non-labor into the labor the the business cycle the industrial organization that's correct i think that it's very clear that arthur's commitment was to business cycle research and the economic development of the american economy i don't think he was terribly interested in the world economy but the american economy and that meant that if there were free funds available within the bureau that was the area that got priority on the other hand if people were successful in raising funds on their own there was no one standing in their way and saying you can't work on this and you have to work on that so that's that's the way you have to understand it is a as a question partly of where does the money go and who brings the money in see there were a lot of researchers who never brought a lot of money in on their own those researchers who were capable of raising money on their own didn't find any impediments put in their way to work on what they wanted to work on right so that's that's the way reconciled but but then people like gary come into the bureau using bureau money but then he comes up with uh some great ideas and brings money i assume into the bureau later but his first projects were bureau funded um and not in in and they were uh human capital the the the project the conference on uh investment in human capital in 1962 right you'd say would be the beginning of that type of thing but that was part of the conference program criw right and uh also uh gary came with very very strong recommendations from george stigler and milton friedman which i don't think uh arthur anybody else were prepared to ignore or discount right and after that once we really got rolling in this whole area of uh what later was called the center for economic analysis of social institutions and human behavior human behavior and social institutions now then then uh there was a big fundraising responsibility there and that was mostly my uh responsibility right yeah um do you have any i'm gonna um i mean to raise money for people like gary and jacob is is partly a burden but it's partly a privilege right um i can skip to some down to uh just a few questions but but i don't want to leave this uh this very important uh part of your life and part of your work on services and i was wondering if there was any part of of this uh i know that you want to be succinct if there was any part of this important project that you want to say something about in terms of the uh uh what what it left in the bureau what it uh what it meant to you what where you see it fitting into the bureau what uh welfare the influences of the bureau on it and back and forth uh i can speak more clearly about what it meant to me one was it left me with an interest in doing work in health economics which i plan to spend about three years on and whenever i think about my relationship to health economics i think of al pacino in godfather three you know that every time i think i've escaped it they keep pulling me back in this is a field that you don't easily escape from and uh my intention was not to become a health economist and spend the rest of my life doing research on health economics but i have spent a good deal of the rest of my life on that the other thing out of the service industries was a very strong interest in the role of women and the problems of women in a modern society and that did lead to work like women's quest for economic equality a strong interest in what was happening to the family as this new type of economy uh was emerging so it it def it definitely uh provided a backdrop for a lot of uh subsequent work that right those several years in the service industries terms of of the bureau i don't know whether it had much impact on subsequent work there except as it uh evolved through the work that of the center that i was talking about working on the family we had basically we had programs eventually in the economics of the family economics of labor and income distribution program in law and economics which was headed by bill landis and dick posner a program in health economics and work in the economics of education now all of that you might say came out of gary's intellectual and theoretical influence and my moving from service industries into uh those kinds of areas right um and they and that has stayed very they have stayed very strong programs in the bureau and expanded up in cambridge and so forth very much in fact there are people in cambridge who think that health economics started there right and they don't know no yeah they don't know but but that's why we're doing this so that we can tell them um do you feel that in the years that you were physically at the bureau from 62 to 68 that you influenced any of the young people walking through the bureau i think maybe if i if i were to pick out a few people of the younger people uh i would mention first of all people like mike grossman who took over for me for the health economics program and who also took my position as professor at cuny when i left there i would mention bob michael who was my deputy throughout this period that we're talking about now and then who went to the university of chicago and a very very successful research administrator heading up newark heading up the school for public policy i didn't use to dispense a lot of advice but i remember one little piece of advice i gave to bob when he was a deputy to me and clearly headed for a career first of all i pointed out that there were very few people who were good at administering research so that if you were good at it you know you had the whole world open to you and as a method of operation i suggested to him uh to be honest uh i said it will so amaze people that you will make a fantastic and he he looked at me open eyes what do you mean i said you'll find out i think you're absolutely right just be honest and and you will be you'll stand out in the crowd and uh so there was bob and there was michael there was bob willis uh there was lee lillard who unfortunately died uh recently recently uh there were uh warren sanderson who was one of the younger people in our group right whether i whether i had any influence on uh bill landis or not it's hard to say you'd have to you'd have to ask bill that uh that the piece that that i i didn't get to read which is some economic aspects of mortality in america yes that was never published i never i never submitted that publish i did that for my own education i i understood that there was a lot of interesting data out there on mortality and i knew that there were a lot of other kinds of data that i knew about like education and income and so forth and the epidemiologists who worked in this field uh never either thought of or never had the temerity to try to put these numbers together and that's what i did i i said well you know here all these numbers out here on mortality and education income let's try to put them together and see what kind of story they add up to and i presented this work a few times to epidemiologists and so forth and they were horrified they were horrified they thought that being a good researcher meant refining uh the data making the data better and more accurate better and more accurate and the idea of drawing some obvious inferences uh from relationships between different pieces of data would just never was not something that right they did and so i circulated that to a few people and it had an enormous impact in fact it's an interesting lesson that if you really want to get attention don't publish because i actually had people show up at my uh door of my house in roslyn knocking on the door asking for a copy of this uh underground classic yes underground classic and but it did it did stimulate subsequent work in fact it uh it led to uh three research assistants uh richard auster uh deborah saracek and irving levison uh did a paper called an exploratory study of production function the production of health this was interesting too because i was going abroad for the summer and they said did they have my permission they had this idea to do a two-stage model and so forth that i they have my permission to work on this during the summer and i said by all means and and three years later they finished the paper and they published it in the journal of human resources and to this day and the identification of the of the impact of income and education on health morbidity mortality is still an issue that we tried to crack that identification issue my own thinking on it you know has changed enormously yes yeah i i i used to think that the correlation between uh education and health was another example of the formation of human capital and the production function approach that education makes you a more efficient producer of health several years ago i did some research on smoking and education so forth which led me to think that that's probably not the main way to think about it not to throw it out entirely right uh but that the correlation between education and health is really much more a third variable problem right which draws there i think in that in that case i think you're absolutely right in some other cases uh it may be that that you can the question is whether you can have a treatment effect whether you can increase education and increase health and for some things uh the free in less developed countries where uh parents uh don't know how to rehydrate their oh yes yes i'm talking strictly u.s uh modern times oh no and as a matter of fact if you talk about the uh low-income countries it's not education in general but education of women and specifics that can make a tremendous difference on the health of the population let me get back uh to the bureau and and i really just have one other question two other questions we're going to run out of time soon so i'm going to put in a another in in five minutes we're going to run out of time i'll put in another tape and we can do just the last 10 or 15 minutes and okay and and um and then we will have uh uh somewhat completed this i'm sure that someone will come back and look at this tape and say why don't you ask vic this question i'm going to go after and ask him this question um and so the question is is is very bureau specific it has to do with with author and the transition and it may be that you'll say um i really didn't know much about it but maybe you did and so when services was published in 68 burns uh was no longer president he uh um uh john meyer was president 1968 was the year when martial that's right that's right and author um uh uh and some people say fortuitously became uh head of the federal reserve board i became chairman of the fed others say that that there was dissension and so there's sort of push-pull issues concerning author uh at the bureau uh and the transition to um uh to john can you say anything about the transition and it's complicated and your view of it may be different from someone else's view to the best of my recollection arthur's interests had moved in somewhat other directions than simply running the national bureau you have to understand about arthur that until the age of 40 he was in his own words a recluse he stayed in his office the way anna schwartz would stay in her office and he would do his work he was not out front and after the age of 40 he began to develop a very different style a very different personality he became very good at relating to all manners of people business people politicians he was a very very successful uh chair of the council of economic advisers he really restored that so so i think that and remember he when he spent four years in washington he came back and he said to me and i'm sure he said it to other people too that four years in washington completely withdrawn from academic life completely withdrawn from research and so forth essentially finishes you off as a as a serious researcher and uh so he saw his life moving in other directions and i don't think arthur's the only one i think most people who would spend four years in washington would not return to a life in academia larry summers is uh i mean he returned to academia but not as a uh as a researcher and a professor of economics right it's a whole different issue yeah and the and the reasons for that could be uh because you on the production side you lose the ability and the skill to be at the top of your game in that after you're out of it for four years or it could be on the preference side i think it's for with larry summers i think it's on the preference yes because he was very he's still very young coming back but it's on the preference side you you see that you really want to do other things right okay yeah i i agree with you that larry could get back into the game yeah okay so so arthur didn't really want to do that uh he would have been happy uh if let's say jeff moore had assumed the mantle and had run the bureau the way arthur had in previous times but that was not to be there was not it wasn't so much that there was a lack of support for jeff within the bureau as outside the bureau particularly foundations and things like that were not did not see i think jeff in the same way that they saw arthur and so i think that's what led to the bringing in of uh someone from the outside let's stop here and we'll pick it up back with uh victor fuchs and so so anyway i think arthur did not particularly want to continue to run the bureau so that was not an issue and john meyer was recommended to him i believe by gottfried havilla and obviously made a big impression as he does on almost everyone he needs because he's so smart and so forceful and so dynamic and he was brought in uh he he was particularly uh good i think at getting money from government uh that's when when he started to raise money that's where he mostly went uh arthur had been very good at raising money from business uh people when when the bureau was running short of cash i've actually seen this been in the office arthur would pick up the phone and call the head of a major u.s corporation and speak to him in very personal friendly terms and tell him what his situation was and that he needed some money and would he send some and get some of his friends to send some and they did and they did support the bureau now i personally always found private foundations the easiest place to work with to get money least demanding in terms of what you have to submit and so forth but that may be partly because i spent a couple of years at the ford foundation so i know how foundations work and i never felt that they were doing me a favor by supporting me i felt that if i had a good piece of work that i was doing them a favor by helping them to to spend their money in a reasonably constructive way so that's that's just the different ways of approaching things but john was i think very uh good influence on the bureau for the first five years he was there for 10 years altogether and in the beginning he brought a lot of fresh air into it brought in computers and that type of thing and and a different type of research style more econometrics and things like that and and so it was good the the particular projects that he chose to back in a large way were not very successful and i think that was part of the problem he put a lot of chips on three or four different projects none of which really hit a home run or even a triple or even a double and some of which led to very large uh deficits and the second five years were more difficult for john partly because of the deficits and partly for for other reasons that i don't know that things just got out of hand under his leadership and so after 10 years there was the transition to uh marty and and marty came in to a difficult set of problems also uh but has been enormously successful in uh marty reinvented the bureau yes absolutely changed not only the product but the whole almost the whole configuration of what the industry was all about right right and then the bureau almost lost its history and that's what we're regaining right now i see yeah when was the bureau west founded this was one of john's ideas that there should be many bureaus at one time he had five bureau offices right and one of them was the idea to have a west coast presence and he talked to some people at stanford who were very enthusiastic about the idea stanford found an anonymous donor who was willing to put up the money to build a building and i don't know if you've seen the bureau of building that building was built for uh 250 000 and there was money left over to for some of the furniture as well and uh so john uh wanted initially to get hal larry to come out and head up the west coast office what year are we talking now we're talking about 19 the early 1970s so you're this is this no i'm not here in the early early 1970s i'm at cuny and mount sinai school of medicine and part-time at the bureau but 72-73 i come here but that's that's purely coincidental i come here on sabbatical uh leave or some kind of leave to the center for advanced study of the behavioral sciences with no intention of moving to the west coast in fact by that time john had been after me uh uh to to agree to head up the west coast office and i had said no and when i when we came out here for the year uh people said oh you're going to like california you're going to want to stay there and i said the probability of our staying is 0.1 i'm a realist i don't i don't think it's zero but it's it's 0.1 and every month that we were here it went up by 0.1 so so by january we were sitting out there on the patio in our shirt sleeves having come back from a walk on the hills and we're looking at each other beverly and i and we're saying why are we fighting this and so i agreed to come but with a year's grace i wanted to go back for a year finish things up personally research wise bureau wise and so forth and then we came in 1774 74 right and i also did not want to take responsibility uh for all the fields uh that the bureau would be working in so uh a co-directorship was worked out with sherman maisel who was a berkeley professor who was interested in finance interested in macro economics and subjects of that kind right yeah and uh but you but you then became bureau west yes and you were half of the uh half of the directorship yes that's right that's right and in many respects it didn't uh realize the hopes that john had for it one of the hopes was that we could tap into new sources of funding out here that weren't being tapped into through the east coast operation and either because maisel and i were not very successful or for other reasons uh that didn't materialize uh there was also the expectation that economists all up and down the west coast would flock here to do their work the way people from colombia and nyu and penn would come to new york but that didn't happen either and maisel i think gave up the ghost about 1977 or so and in 1978 i decided i'd had enough of directing i've been doing it for 10 years and so i said i went out as vice president and director and the projects that john began that as you said just didn't pan out they were very costly he said that there were five projects some of which didn't pan out uh in in new york or he he had moved part of the bureau to new haven yes um can you uh do you recall any one of them that that was um uh uh the the the an expensive project that was was just poor judgment or or just didn't pan out yeah there were a few were there was a project that ann krieger had on uh you know 10 volumes 10 countries so forth that was a very very expensive project a lot of money huge amount of how larry's time he had to work practically full time on those manuscripts and so on and they published them at great cost and that was not a i don't think a very successful project uh there was a project involving uh richard and nancy ruggles uh that went on and on and i don't know whether there was any product that came out of that eventually uh john was very enthusiastic about work on urban problems and i don't think that uh was very successful curious because one would have thought that there was a lot of us government money in uh in urban issues and transport in housing and poverty at that time an enormous amount there probably was government funding but so i don't know that it was a shortage of money i think the field had fallen on hard times it was actually a field that i had worked in uh a bit earlier i had a a fling there for about two or three years where i uh worked on regional problems stemming out of my work on location of industry and i think that field really ran into a dead end theoretically and uh it it just didn't it didn't revive until more recently now of course there's a lot of interest in and a lot of good work being done on urban problems well it isn't as if the urban problems weren't there then as well but people didn't have a good idea about how to how to work on them right so that was not that was not a successful project either then john had an idea that the bureau would become the place the the location of a huge computer it would be something like slack in physics and and that economists all over the country would think about problems that they wanted to work out and then they would send them or come to the bureau and have this huge computer grind out the answers for them he was thinking of a model like the physics like the huge physics laboratories of course technology went in an entirely different direction and so that didn't uh uh materialize one small point we just have a a small amount of time left that uh in services you acknowledge help from ibm and i was talking to dick about this as well and and uh well that's very simple the ibm was free free computers right and they were on 59th street that's right but but did you did you do it did you walk up to 59th street and and and submit the jobs did someone else submit them no i i did it yeah i don't know that i personally walk up there i i usually like to give my research assistants as much opportunity as possible to do things it was a woman named charlotte boshin yes she was very good very helpful was she the person who took the computer jobs up there i don't know whether she physically did but she was a very valuable person and we should mention some of the other people at the bureau who were very valuable there was a man named h irving foreman well and and a fantastic person uh i'm a great fan of irving's and i talked to dick about irving as well because dick dick has his undergraduate degree in engineering and but dick was a terrible draftsman and of course irving was the perfect draftsman for an economist so you might want to say some words about irving irving's artistry and his mathematical brilliance no well no no that's not what i want to emphasize irving had been a research assistant yes and he had drawn uh the graphs i think for uh simon kuznets and he was so good at it that it was decided that he would draw them for other people as well and the thing that i most valued in irving was his meticulous approach to things his insistence on accuracy and clarity so i used to send my research assistants to irving with a figure that they thought they wanted to have drawn and he would bombard them with questions and nitpicking about this and that and i did this because i wanted them to see what it meant to pay a lot of strict attention to exactly what you were doing in this figure and why you were doing it that way and so on so that's the thing that i most valued not his skill his skill was there and it's there for everybody to see but the idea that this should be clear and it should be accurate is what i what i do his brilliance in setting up a figure so that you could make comparisons very clear so that he rather than as as many people do you put a a figure on each page then you have to flip back and forth he would do it so that all and and i have monetary history which has i don't know how many 50 60 figures but within each figure there are maybe six figures yes yes but it's done so that you can make the comparison that's right and and that was the brilliance that's what i what i meant by artistry is that type of thing okay okay not not the not the business cycle shading and the not shading well that was good that was very imaginative yes this was good that was good too and i don't discount that but i wanted to throw in uh this other side and i like the way you put it and and i i wish i could speak with irving foreman because i have been a fan of this for a long time when i open up a bureau book i immediately look at the figures it can be very annoying and frustrating at the time because you think you're finished and you think you know what you want to do and you're just at the beginning when you start with irving now uh charlotte beauchamp was very valuable at the bureau because she was an interface between sort of just the straight research and computers and punch cards and and that kind of thing now whether she played any role in my getting some free computer time from ibm or not i don't remember i don't remember how that came about but you said were there other people sophie sakowitz sophie sakowitz had among other things a responsibility for looking at every table of every bureau of publication yes and checking it for internal consistency you know you can pick out a lot of possible errors in tables without ever having made the calculations yourself by just looking at the different numbers within a single table or comparing the numbers in one table with the numbers in another table and that was her responsibility she did that she did that very well i think that was an enormously useful uh thing to do because people do make mistakes all along the line that's right in calculations and so that was another kind of thing and the other thing i would mention is the esprit among the research assistants and the ability to train the new ones as they came in it was one of the greatest sources of personal satisfaction to me would to be to hire a new newly minted bachelor's degree person very often they were women very often they came from the women's college at the university of pennsylvania which had a separate existence at that time and they produced some very good people and they would come in and they would be nervous and they would be unexpected you know inexperienced and pulling on their hair and wondering about how they're going to do this and that and the other thing a year later watch them operate with the with the new with the new one that's coming in self-assured knowledgeable training the new one showing them exactly how to do this and that the other thing and that just went on year after year after year did any of them go on to graduate work and economics oh yes oh yes quite a few of them i'm not sure but maybe june might have been a research assistant there uh arlene leibowitz uh a research assistant there right uh yes there were quite a few and uh and some some didn't but they still did very good work when they were research assistants right yes right uh dick said uh when we were talking about the ibm on 59th street and of course he used it uh somewhat before uh you did he said that he would he would give the job to charlotte who was younger at the time she would take the job up there and um and then about four months later he he'd come to his office and be a big pile of output and he'd look at it and he'd say what's that and and by then he had already you know what he wanted to do he sort of did back the envelope calculations he did it by hand and he had no idea what this stuff was so it wasn't this useful he needed much better turnaround so i i think that we've we've completed just about everything there's there's always more and um i know that you want to do your exercises and well one other person do you uh chris nagorski do you remember yes wonderful person very valuable bob lipsy can give you chapter and verse about well christian's still there yes she is i saw her last time i visited but she is she is the the longest running continuous employee at the bureau other than i think uh ana or or bob um i don't know whether it's continuous but yeah i think he goes back to 47. he goes back to the problem right right bob used to hire uh or at least interview uh and test uh all the candidates for ra jobs he had a little paper and pencil test so chris began as an r.a oh yeah i said then i didn't know yeah uh well thank you very much and i know it was chris mortensen in case people i say get confused about the name right yeah [Music] is a great place and i hope that it continues to flourish right i recognize that it has to change i don't think that we touched and i understand why because i had no personal contact with him with wesley mitchell who was after all the guiding star for the bureau for 25 years and it would be a shame if you don't if you don't pick up some stuff about uh well i think for for uh for mitchell it was it may have to be the written record his record and other people other than uh milton uh but my sense is that uh that milton will speak more about arthur than about uh than about mitchell well uh george stigler has a few pages in some of his uh autobiographical material about what does it take to create an environment with a productive environment and some of that deals with the national bureau some of it deals with the university of chicago so you can get some stuff out of that and i think you can get some stuff out of that volume that i showed you this morning right and there's the columbia has this um oral history project right and uh i think that uh there are tapes because that goes way back uh at least into the uh into the 80s so there were people who knew mitchell uh who were interviewed if you want to interview someone who knew mitchell very well and who had a lot of opportunities to observe the bureau but from the outside right i would highly recommend that you go see eli ginsburg um absolutely yeah eli is someone who is on on my list and and and i want to talk to him anyhow because he kindly sent me his book on college women and it's something that uh that i've been working on on and off for some time well i think that one of the nicest things you said about your time of the bureau was that it was a late and extended post-doctoral experience because that means that you were able to sit back and think and at the same time you were able to learn that's why i think the word post-doctoral experience that's my interpretation of it and you have models around and you're working yourself after all i was you know in charge of a big project but i was still uh learning a lot and there were a lot of people there right who you could learn from okay well uh thank you very including the research assistants and i think the nice thing about our lives uh i think you would agree vic is that uh we are always having a postdoctoral experience [Laughter] right i'm going to turn this off now hello turn okay
