thanks good morning everyone thanks for coming out so early thanks very much the organizers for putting me on the program for this i'm honored to be uh speaking in this uh in this venue uh okay so my topic today is upgrading by firms uh in developing countries i realized i inadvertently kept you in suspense by not putting the title in the program but that's the that's the topic um but by upgrading what i mean is innovative behavior in a broader than usual sense okay so innovation often when people talk about innovation in the field of innovation economics is usually about new to the world stuff okay so the uh and they rely heavily on for empirical measures on uh patents and r d spending that's obviously uh less relevant in less developed countries typically firms in less developed countries although you do sometimes see patents and you see r d in the data for the most part they're aiming to catch up to the world frontier not not not push it forward and so the those measures of r d and patenting that we see are less are arguably less and less informative in this context i like the word upgrading very much it encompasses both this new the world innovation and catch-up innovation okay now but it's gonna that's gonna have implications for how we measure it we don't have we don't have quite the obvious measures that we'd have if we're just talking about new to the world stuff now you'd think that adopting a technology that already exists would be much easier than inventing a new one uh gershon kron back in 1962 famously referred to this as the or one of the advantages of backwardness uh it's somewhat non-pc terminology but it was a useful uh concept i think but for many firms and i think i'll just assert that i think the probably wide agreement here those advantages have remained elusive there are some firms that have caught up quickly but there are many that seem to struggle with the catch-up process and so my question uh for today and for the sort of research that i and a bunch of other people have been working on is is what's what's getting in the way what's the what's the problem um anytime you identify a barrier you're implicitly you know sort of making a causal statement you're implicitly also identifying a driver of upgrading just if only by mitigating that barrier and so i can i can restate this in a positive way and say what are the drivers of upgrading at the firm level this to me seems like a first order question for development it's hard for me to imagine sustained increases in living standards in the absence of such firm level upgrading i think it's also fair to say that this was not a focus of the development economics community for many years it's it was there at the at the at the start of the field of development but then for many years it was uh it was not a core topic outside of agriculture i should actually qualify that agriculture that it was but not too much in in in manufacturing or non-agriculture uh one uh illustration that was sailing to me was that i was in grad school and brianna barton who's an advisor of mine and christopher put out this readings in empirical development economics that had no you know there's nothing in there with firm level data um and there was there was a sort of apologetic paragraph saying you know we realize that this seems to be happening if you know uh eventually we we hope to uh you know the next next round of this will include some papers with uh with firm level data but it took a while it took a while for that to happen i think it's an interesting question we don't talk a lot about intellectual history often but i think it's an interesting question about why is that why is it that there wasn't this focus on firms some possible answers i think um and even as you know as micro empirical work and development took off uh why wasn't there uh so one reason is that firm level data you know is hard to come by it was hard to come by certainly it was only in the early 90s i guess that sort of micro data on firms and panel data firms started becoming available it's still much more costly to access firm level data than it is to access many other types of data sets i think another important uh reason is just there was such a strong reaction against uh import substituting industrialization interventionist development policy uh which was then codified in the washington consensus policies that sort of broke the link between policymakers who are out there and have continued actually to do industrial policy right and and researchers industrial policy became such sort of bad word in academic circles that there wasn't a lot of work and so there wasn't much the sort of connective tissue between researchers and policy makers and implementers of that research uh was was broken and so that there's no natural there hasn't been a natural policy audience for this kind of work i think that's changing but it's it's uh it's been been somewhat slow and i think a third reason which you know we don't often talk about i think it's important is that there's a perception that it's it's quite challenging to do work that's credible by modern applied micro standards uh on on firms uh it's very costly to run experiments um outcomes are hard to measure well that's i'm going to talk a fair amount about that uh you know firms don't have a lot of fixed characteristics what x's would you control for it increase precision of your estimates it's not clear okay and partly as a consequence i say a lot of this firm level work was not considered part of development it was done by certainly was starting out is mainly people you know trade or in macro or or in io and not so much in development so some messages i'm going to try and communicate uh today uh one is i think some of that skepticism around point three about hard to do credible work is actually justified so i'll talk about some of the outcomes that you know tfp is the standard outcome that most people still use to measure out upgrading it has lots of problems i think those problems are unappreciated outside of the tfp literature so i'm going to talk about some of them um but the i guess my bigger message is that a lot of progress has been made it's now quite active area there's lots of work going on that i think is quite credible and should be you know it's credible by modern applied micro standards people are using uh direct measures of upgrading rather than what i call residual based measures like tfp which i'll come back to um there are more increasing numbers of experiments and quasi experiments we shouldn't forget about quasi-experiments and i think there are some robust lessons emerging from this from this literature there are also some lessons that appear to be emerging that are not quite so robust and i'll try and highlight those if i uh time time time permitting and i guess uh also part of um my message here is that i think this is quite fertile ground for development researchers right there's there's cost to leaving this work to people in trade in macro and io so my best friends are trademark really i'm i'm i'm often considered trade macro and i o among other other fields why do i think this is fertile ground for development researchers uh the questions are very important the data frontier is expanding rapidly there's increasing support from policy makers and firms and funders for running running experiments um and i think that you know the development community's traditional focus on paying shoe leather costs to get the right data and on understanding the context are actually crucial okay and that's especially when we move away from sort of residual based measures like productivity to actual direct measures of upgrading we really have to understand what's going on in these industries and so i think actually this this crowd the new helm crowd is the crowd that really where i'd like to encourage people in this crowd to to uh to work on these topics um so i have a new review coming on the journal of economic literature i'm going to rely heavily on that in this talk it you know anytime you do a review like this you have to focus things pretty pretty pretty drastically so i'm going to focus on non-micro non-agricultural firms and then within firm upgrading not allocation resources across firms misallocation is obviously a hugely important topic there's lots of work i'm going to leave it i'm going to leave it aside i can't i can't do everything okay so road map so i'm going to talk fair a fair amount about sort of what do i mean by upgrading more precisely i'm going to give a conceptual framer to kind of fix ideas and give us a notation and then talk about some of those measurement issues i discussed um and then i'm going to talk about evidence on drivers of upgrading motivated by the framework sorry motherboard right firmware i'll classify them in three categories output side input side and drivers and know-how and then some closing thoughts okay so uh so here's a framework um it's it's going to be frustrating to you because there's no fossil viable predictions it's very general but i i think it's it's useful to have a notation and there are some conceptual points that i think come come out of it okay and i want to start by going down to a quite micro level think about a production function at the firm i product j technique k year t level okay so now all firm is only going to choose one technique at a time but it has a choice among a menu of techniques okay and then the so that's just to say output is going to depend on a vector of inputs which might be specific to the k the technique the technique you're using will determine which inputs you need and then this lambda thing you think this is capability okay or sutton calls it capability um and a key point about that is it has to be in some sense be homegrown that's that's given bob gibbons's term uh woodard saying pratt and andrea have a recent paper arguing this that you can't just go out and buy capability on the market if you could then arguably it should go in the m okay so the capability is something that has to be developed internally in your firm i'm just going to think of different quality outputs and inputs as having different js or different being different elements of that of that m vector uh i'm going to you know uh use this fee as as uh product quality it's a single dimensional it's very drastic simplification to say that the you know it's a single dimension we'll we'll describe all heterogeneity and quality but bear with me i think that you know a lot of the key ideas in literature can be can be uh can be expressed with that okay and then think of big j and big k as the sets of products and techniques that the firm knows about to which the firm knows this f function okay and then i'm going to do this capital lambda as the set of all those land you know product technique specific capability terms and j and k together i'm going to call that know-how all right just to save time uh there are more more more basically notation but there's we can think about different destination markets there's a bunch of fixed costs that could you know be be incurred at various different levels um you can firms can invest in their know-how so in their capabilities and they're knowing about products knowing about techniques that's costly those are costly investments and then i'm just going to model this as in a very general way firm's face inverse sort of an inverse output demand curve right but this characterizing relationship between let's see if my uh yeah okay so between output in in a market you know product j and market b uh relate that to the price in that market depends that's going to how much with demand is going to depend on the quality and then some exogenous exogenous external to the firm uh shifters you can think about an inverse input supply curve also right so that you that's going to relate the prices of inputs uh to this to this vector to this vector of inputs okay and so then the firm's problem is to maximize the present discounted value of profits um so there's a lot of procedure but here you're summing up over over over future periods that's a discount factor this is something over the set of markets that the firm decides to enter this is the products that it decides to to produce uh that's revenues that's variable cost you got a bunch of fixed costs and then also these investments okay and so the firms you know has to choose the destinations the products they have to use a uh choose a technique for each a product they decide to uh to produce they've got inputs and then these these investments okay all right so as i said that was um you know we're not i'm going to stop there i'm not going to try and derive any predictions but i think it's useful certainly useful for defining terms and for the four main ways that i think upgrading has been defined in the literature okay so one would be learning i think of learning as gains of know-how so that would be gains of of of lambdas so it could be all lambdas or could be some subset of lambdas uh also knowledge of products and knowledge of techniques um quality upgrading would be an increase in the average quality this average quality fee bar and that's just an output weight output uh weighted average of the of all the of all the fees product innovation would be producing a product which hasn't been produced by the firm before okay uh technology adoption would be using a technique that hasn't been used by the by the by the firm before now one would be sort of tempted to say technology adoption would be adoption of a new or better technique but i'm going to argue that we don't know we don't really have a good ranking of of techniques right so i'm just going to say technology often just be any any new any new technology okay so what's one point i think that comes out already is that these dimensions are related they often go together firms that are upgrading a one dimension often upgrade on other dimensions but they don't have to right you could have quality upgrading without product innovation just by shifting say the weights between pre-existing qualities you could have technology adoption without learning it could be that you knew about this product already you just happen not to not not to choose it okay and you can go through all four that have that have that have that characteristic okay so uh maybe a bigger point that comes out of this is that ldc firms face different conditions than firms in risk countries okay they're typically going to going to face different product demand curves so for example they're often facing poorer consumers than firms are in rich countries uh they're for consumers who are less willing to pay for quality that's obviously going to affect quality choices they're going to affect they're going to face different input supply curves and prices so that's going to uh for instance high quality inputs or high skill workers are often relatively expensive in poor countries and that may affect also the choice of what you know inputs use and what outputs to to produce and they're going to have different levels of know-how which is costly to acquire okay so you know related to that upgrading may or may not be optimal for firms okay there's a nice quote here this is from a review by fostering roadstrike on uh microeconomics and technology adoption largely focused on agricultural technology adoption but basically you can't look out and say okay firms that are using sorry farms that are using fertilizer are more profitable than farms that are not using fertilizer to say everybody should use fertilizer right depends on the on the conditions that they face so it's not going to be the same technology it's not going to be good for everybody now know how you know having more know-how is better than having less know-how that's clear that's enough to be good for firms but if know-how is costly to acquire then it's not obvious that firms you know that firms should be investing that know how depends on the cost and the and the benefits okay so that's one point second point um so there's a lot of discussion now and i think rightly so about management especially management firms developing countries now the in the context of this framework i think we can understand what people mean when they say management in three different ways one is management would be sort of know-how which might including entrepreneurial ability okay sort of the the inherent quality of your of the of the entrepreneur okay so you can think of entrepreneurial sort of a a lambda that applies for all different product product techniques because that's one uh definition of management another would be the skill of the employed managers so not not just the entrepreneur but the people that the firm is that the firm is employing and that's a purchased input and then in a third way you can think of management practices but now i want to think of and i think there's some fuzziness on this in the literature i want to think of management practices are okay that's part of the technique that firms are choosing based on their know-how and based on the conditions that they're facing okay so when i say that i'm in good company in in thinking of it that way so john van renen and this is the working paper version of the india uh consulting experiment saying you should think of these practices like any other technique okay but that's it's not it's not always thought about that um in literature okay and then there's a immediately a question arises related to this is whether these practices can be ranked um so the uh there's a long history of this debate in the in the management literature one view is thought of typically labeled the vertical view which is the view that i think you know these guys who are leading john and nick and others leading uh contributors to this literature would say some practices are better than others and the claim is if you think in the context of the framework the claim is that's true across contexts right so that the that profit of uh of using a technique k is higher than the product of using technique k prime for all output demand input supply uh and you know levels of know-how and knowledge about about products okay so that would be that's the vertical claim the other sort of count you know countering claim would be you know the horizontal or contingency view which also has a long long history basically saying you know which is best uh depends on the context so i have the luxury of just written the review paper you can go back and find the sites to woodward and also to you know to others who are um uh who are who are and the same and pratt also relates to this um so but basically it depends very context specific what's the right what's the right practice um so it's ultimately an empirical question right or some practice is good right better across across all contexts it hasn't been resolved i don't think we know i think that we need more evidence on that i will say though and this is probably somewhat uh controversial but i will say that so normally if we look out at not not management techniques we look at normal technologies okay and you look at and you see firms are using different technologies you don't immediately assume one's making a mistake and one's doing it correctly right what you what you say is i wonder what are the conditions that the firm is facing that's leading to to use these different technologies okay and so i think that point uh it can be uh can can sometimes be lost we should keep it in mind okay so so that's um i'm going to come back to this to the select to this you know the framework and the and the note notation as we go so now but if we think about uh those four definitions of upgrading now let's think about how people have tried to capture this empirically okay so there are there are patterns in rd expenditures and as i said you know it's that's typically you know related to new to the world stuff not um not new to the firm um and also the uh and they're unlikely to capture ketchup also this is a paper daniel and daniel i'm sorry didn't he's in the ed al i said so someone who's also up in the at al uh but the nice paper showing that you know r and d expand are manipulable in china they incentivize r d expenditures and the people re-labeled you know a lot of other expenditures as as r d so so arguably the patents and rnds are not that not that useful the the main thing i'd say the you know predominant uh measure that people use what is tfp so there has conceptual advantages uh trying to estimate tfp that's aiming at at directly estimating this lambda or you know typically you make some assumptions that the lambdas are the same across across products but you're trying to get at that lambda so that's a plus uh so conceptually it's a plus the minus is that the methods require quite strong assumptions um and have various biases and i'm going to i'm going to take some time to talk about those um then i think that what's to me is the more encouraging uh movement is to use direct measures of of some of the other dimensions of of of upgrading quality upgrading product innovation technology adoption which would be including management practices so there are a couple of minuses there um one is as i said that it's not necessarily optimal to see upgrading on those on those dimensions right so you can't really say if someone's not doing that you can't say that they're somehow i'm not doing not doing well another minus is that you know you typically you can only observe them in particular sectors where you've done the work to collect this this information um but the big plus is that you don't require the same strong theoretical assumptions okay so i think that um uh you know that we're sort of a company will come later also but i think a good way forward is try and start building up slowly from particular sectors where we observe these things rather than sort of asserting that you know across sectors i have a measure that's that's that's useful okay um so the framework has a lot of inside the firm stuff right but i would have thought like equilibrium conditions firm competition etc might also drive these decisions are you just holding that outside uh so i will talk about um competition uh i'm sort of burying them into these outputs output demand where where do they go output demand input supply curves so so basically everything's going to be in there right so oh sorry the question was the question was what about you know general equilibrium stuff and outside the firm stuff and competition etc this is are you just focused on on firms and and and obviously those things are very important it's just that in the framework i'm just i'm just um you know bearing them in these output demand input supply curves right and and those capital gammas which like all the external the firm stuff that might be that might be might be shifting so i don't want to ignore them it was just a sort of a shorthand way of bearing this okay uh okay where was i yeah okay and then there are there is a literature basically using kind of residual based measures to try and for quality i'm going to talk less about that i'm more excited about the direct direct measures okay so tfp let me try and do this quickly i'm conscious of time but i'll try and communicate sort of the basic the basic issues uh the first couple of these are quite familiar the third one may be less less familiar okay so a standard thing to do in the in the tp ledger was to write down the cub doug's production function your capital labor's material you got the coefficients you have a x anti-shock that the firm observes before it chooses inputs and then an exposed shock which comes out comes afterwards uh the problem is that firms may you know may look they wake up see that they're more productive you you know decide to use more use more inputs and that will induce a bias you know a variable's bias there um okay which people have tried to deal with the dominant strategy is what's called proxy variable strategy which is essentially to say okay if there's a monotonic relationship between let's see if i can do this between say capital and that omega that x anti-shock and investment okay then you can invert that investment demand equation okay and then you can proxy this omega with like a flexible polynomial in capital and investment that would be the alipay strategy um there's a levinson patron would do that with materials instead of with investment the literature's kind of gone along the way there there are new versions acrobat case fraser basically doing something similar to levinson patron i won't go into the great details so the last literature so far the last sort of sorry last paper biggest last big paper in this literature is this gandhi navarro rivers which is basically the point that you can't be completely flexible both about how productivity evolves and about the production function they're not non-parametrically identified and so they suggest you need they guess using a first order condition for for for an additional leverage in identification okay but my key point about is the first point is that this monotonicity assumption is very strong and i think maybe not you know it's there's been this weird division of labor where there's the productivity literature and people just sort of uh you know assume whatever state of the art and productive literature that's what we're going to use and they don't you know question it but that what you need for this for these proxy verbal methods to work is that uh there's there's a single dimension of heterogeneity right so a scalar monotonic relationship is omega and an investment or or materials so uh credit constraints for instance which those of us in this room are used to thinking of as as endemic right would invalidate this strategy if you have heterogeneity and credit constraints across firms uh if you have heterogeneity and input market frictions across firms that would also invalidate that so the first one invalidate holly pagas the second would invalidate the levinson patron uh even just having firm fixed effects if you want to control for those typically you can't do that with these methods these methods can't handle a firm fixed effect and i think these um issues are particularly likely to be relevant in developing countries okay that those that sort of heterogeneous likely to be particularly relevant okay second uh issue um which has been highlighted by this is a nice review paper by yonder loker and penny goldberg it's rare to observe physical quantities okay it's typical to it's more typical to observe uh revenues so this is now in log so revenue that would be log physical output plus log output prices or you know expenditures log expenditures that would be log material i mean physical units of inputs and and input prices um so then suppose that the price for a given firm would be some if you think this is a sector level uh level price level and then an idiosyncratic part and then the input prices would be a sector level um uh price level and the idiosyncratic part uh you plug that back into the production function i had on on the last slide you move things around you get the standard regression that people run which is revenues firm level revenues deflated by a sector level price index on you know for firm level expenditures deflated by a sector level input price index but then what happens is that these iterative parts end up in the error okay and that can give give rise to output what's what the locr and goldberg call output and input price biases okay so for instance if you get a demand shock price for your goods are high you use more inputs that's going to give you that's going to break that then you're going to have a you know covariance won't be won't be zero there or if when uh you know input prices are high you use fewer inputs that's also going to lead to a bias okay so now what people what i think the for most recent turn here in this literature has been is to say okay given these output prices input price biases we should go to physical quantities which are becoming available there are a few data sets now where you see this okay so let's regress physical quantity of output on physical quantity of input okay so this is a famous uh paper this is foster halter wenger severson this is in in in the in in the in the ar in the in the u.s data it's it's now a lot of people are talking about this which generates tfpq you may hear that tfp quantity right based on based on based on quantities that works in single input single output industries that are homogeneous homeostasis and they're basically focusing on homogeneous good industries here in these in these papers um i've been doing work uh trying to make the point and this is building on work that by jim tyboot and then also uh david atkin and now mccondewall and and uh adam osman and others have made this point that when you have quality differences and i'm gonna add when you have variety differences then these quantity-based measures are going to be misleading also okay so tf tfeq are observing physical quantities is not going to solve the problem when um when you have when you have quality differences or variety differences so just to illustrate that i'm going to illustrate that a bunch of c has algebra i i hesitate to put the cs algebra it's going to be very familiar to people who are used to working with ces it's going to be not familiar to others but let me just try and give you the sort of the bottom line idea so we can think of so now i'm going to write this now not in logs but write this production function just as an aggregate output okay y tilde on an aggregate input so why is that partly that's motivated by the fact that typically in data sets even when we see quantities we don't see the mapping from a particular input to a particular output okay so so here our strategy people have dealt with this in different ways our strategies are going to aggregate to the firm level right from the from the firm product to the firm level right that way and we're going to it's convenient to have the ces aggregation i don't want to push too hard on the ces aggregation it's algebraically convenient for what i'm going to show but in fact the results in the in the in the paper don't really depend on on that on that aggregation okay so here's where flashing up a bunch of algebra i don't want to go in great detail but basically if you once once you have those cs assumptions um there's lots of existing ces results that one can use so basically to express the log change in real output and that y tilde can be expressed as a sum of three terms one is a quantity change that's called the satya varchar these two guys who originated this in the 70s so this is going to be an observable uh term okay it's like a weighted average of changes of product specific changes okay uh with these with these weights which are a mess which i won't go we'll go through you can rep you know peruse at your leisure afterwards um yeah a quality change and a variety change okay that's the convenience of the ces you can sum it as these three things so then i and then that's that's in changes i can i can take an initial normalization sum these things up and so i can say in levels the log real output is going to depend on an observable piece a quality piece and a variety piece okay exactly the same thing works for on the input side it's the exact same algebra and again i can just point where the the log input quantity index can be summed as an observable piece a quality piece and a variety piece okay and so when i put those together and i plug them back into the production function i had uh that a few slides ago okay then i get something like that looks like this where i can i can that's an observable uh quantity output that's an observable input that's output quantity output input quality output and then other stuff we can we have i've got a firm effect in year effect that's totally not not really crucial for what i'm about to say but then this error term is going to it contain not just the x anti-shock and the expose shock that i talked about before okay it's also going to have these quality and variety terms in it okay and those can generate what we call quality and variety biases okay so just as an example if if we go if we specialize where we have a single in output and a single input producer okay in that case these southern varchar aggregates are just going to be the you know observed physical quantities of the physical quantity of output and physical quantity of input okay but for instance if uh producing higher quality output requires more labor hours okay that's going to generate a correlation between the number of labor hours in l okay and the output and the output quality okay that's uh that's a minimum variable's bias and we'll get so we'll get a bias in the old coefficient there okay or same thing if you use like if when input quality there's a shock input quality improves you use more of that input that's also going to give you a bias okay um now a key point here is you could have a perfect proxy for omega right which is that's what the proxy variable strategy is all about finding a proxy for a you could have a perfect proxy for mega and still have these problems right that that would not solve these problems um and then i guess i'd say i think most sectors that we care about are not the homogeneous single input single output sectors for which the previous methods apply right when you think what are the you know and i'm going to all the papers i'm going to talk about now basically none of them i think are going to be characterized by homogeneous singularity firms are almost always multiple output multiple input and have quality differences okay this is especially and i think especially when you're talking about firms that are in developing countries that are entering world markets the quality change is going to be first order okay so and i'm going to i'm going to uh yeah so well okay i'll provide some evidence for that so we have a again i won't go into detail here this is our new paper we have a sort of a competing method we have a new method where we say let's use instruments for uh for the for the input choices using exchange rates minimum wages and we supplement that by what's called in the literature internal insurance would be lag levels or lag differences um the jury is still out on how much how much influence that proposal will have so i won't um i won't go into great detail about that but i do think i guess the point for this talk is that i think that standard tfp methods are on pretty pretty shaky ground um especially for different well in differentiated product sectors as i said the intuition will go through if you don't have ces our results are similar whether we have ces or not and it's not this quality variety advice is not just a theoretical curiosity so i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to talk about that um shortly so now happily uh a growing you know or think about what's the way forward i believe i think a number of papers are sort of showing us the way forward um several are going to mention below where you have we've paid the shoulder costs i've gotten these direct measures of of of upgrading and not just relying on on tfp i think that i would put this you know this literature on management practices which is generally a very you know a great thing that where that people are observing management practices much more carefully right so that's observing that you can think of a technique very carefully and the world bank has been um conducting a technology surveys going around with particular sectors asking about what actual machines the firms are using that's going to stimulate this is there's a it's a working paper and then there's now a book coming you know on the on the world bank website so that's i think going to stimulate a lot of work in the area so that's quite uh that's quite promising and so i think that you know my view is that the way forward is gonna is going to be fine settings that combine you know these where we have direct measures of upgrading and credibly exogenous variation in in factors that affect firms uh upgrading decisions okay but we do have to be careful as i you know back to my point about not the vertical view we're not sure you know what if technology is good we do have to be careful in interpreting these results when we're using these direct measures you know about uh you know is this we shouldn't automatically assume that if someone's not upgrading that they're that they're somehow making a mistake or they're not optimizing okay so all right uh i made it through the productivity thing all right so now let's go and let's go to the um actual uh you know evidence on on drivers of upgrading and i'll start on the on the on the output side um so i think a robust lesson that's emerging from this literature is that selling to richer consumers which could be directly by exporting or indirectly by selling into value chains that sell eventually to richer consumers is associated with with upgrading especially with quality upgrading but also other forms uh also other forms of upgrading so there were some early papers there were some tfp papers that kind of had mixed results i've worked a lot in this uh in this area mainly using you know prices and quantities rather than rather than rather than direct measures had a little bit of a you know iso 9000 or whatever but not not not very much but the recent work i think has done made a lot of progress on on the measures and on on on clean identification as well okay i'm going to talk about a paper this is probably familiar to many of you the edition rugs paper uh david uh and kind of adam osman um but it ties together a number of the themes i'm trying to talk about so i think it's worth spending some time on it um so they working with a an ngo they randomly allocated initial export orders to these egyptian rug producers typically pretty small okay typically not exporting and and uh they also tracked detailed quality indicators okay of the rugs that those guys were those guys were producing they kept track of i won't talk more about this but they i think a very nice asset they kept track of the conversation between the buyer um and the intermediary for the buyer and and the producers um and then they had brought people into into a laboratory and had them you know weave identical specification rugs okay so this is just uh you know one one table from that this is here we have the intended treat treatment untreated for guys who took up this this order these are a bunch of different uh quality metrics which they had uh you know measured by local local local experts essentially and so and i here i'm reaching the the boundaries of my knowledge about rugs but basically how you know the corners the waviness weight touch packiness warp thread tightness these are all indicators of the quality of the quality of rugs those went up okay so these guys started producing higher quality rugs their inputs also went up this would be like the quad inputs here is the quality of the threads the price of the threads went up went up as well okay so it seems clear that there's quality upgrading response to this uh in response to exporting um profits went up okay again that's maybe not surprising these guys are are are doing better they're they're direct products measured in various ways there's direct profit they can do revenues minus cost you know they constructed a forum they did hypothetical profits what if you know this happened anyway anyway you any way you slice it looks like profits went up not surprising this was a good thing for these firms tia um productivity went down uh okay so it probably could be either if you mention measure it as unadjusted output per hour okay or unadjusted tfp controlling for capital stock basically what's happening is these guys they get an order produce high quality rug they take more time doing that and they produce fewer square meters of rug okay so i think this is a you know it's hard to imagine a cleaner example of how of the of the problems with the tfp measures you know and why this it's just very clear this is a good thing for the firms they're more profitable higher quality in various various ways but the the tfp is going to be give you exactly the wrong answer on on on this okay uh and then so not only now in previous work i had modeled uh partly for convenience this quality upgrading is just a shift that didn't have learning involved basically it was just a shift between products that firms already know how to already knew how to how to produce okay so shifting weights of their of the output weights but but the point here which i think a very nice point about this paper is that no people are the producers seem to be learning something in the process of doing that okay and the way they figure that out is they say okay let's go and do identical specific or there's a couple ways but the one that i think is most convincing is they take the uh we're gonna you know so identical specific can rug specification rugs in the laboratory okay and they find that the guys who got the treatment right are producing higher quality rugs even though the specifications were were the same the drugs that they actually produced were higher quality at no and they took no longer right so the time was the same but they're producing higher quality stuff which it seems it looks like you know an increase in capability which i would call we would call learning um so that was the point i made uh before i was just talked about shifts of vancouver but here there's actually accumulation of of lambdas i think an interesting question uh you know that comes out of this paper is is that a is it just you know capabilities uh involved in producing the sorts of rugs that like rich european or rich american buyers want or is it somehow is that some of a generalized increase in knowledge i think we're not quite sure from this paper and so that would be an interesting thing for people to try to to try to try to investigate okay uh let me go another another paper they're sort of in the similar spirit um you know this is here uh the paper you're in the in the at all also so a paper on on peruvian fish mill uh fish meal sorry um mills okay where they have a neat strategy so the advantage here is they observe in the data they observe the qua there's a quality indicator in the data okay the quality of the fish meal that that these guys are are producing um and then they have a nice strategy where they're using quotas in the main uh competitors that are producing uh high quality fish meal okay which would be denmark iceland chile and when the quotas are binding then that's going to increase demand for uh for fish meal from uh from from peru okay and here they find a very interesting you know outcome is that these mills buy boats basically they vertically integrate with the fisher with a fisherman fisher people i guess i should mostly admit i'm guessing uh okay so that they uh they they they buy this so i mean the concept of the framework would be they're using a different technique okay that has different set of inputs and producing a higher producing higher quality higher quality meal fish meal the idea there which they have evidence of the nice thing about they actually see where the boats go which is extraordinary and the integrated boats stay closer to port and they deliver smaller loads of fish which are both associated with having fresher fish okay so the so the freshness of the fish is not observable at the point of transaction and so this is a way that they can sort of ensure that the supply of high quality of high quality fish meal okay so i think that sort of points to an interesting direction for this literature to go is and which um you know is very relevant to the where sort of in the wheelhouse of development economics which is you know there are there are contracting frictions right there's asymmetric information there's contracting frictions that may constrain the ability of firms to upgrade okay so in this case the the firms actually were able to you know vertically integrate integrated upgrade but there may be other firms that are not able to do that and hence would be constrained by the fact that they can't get the high quality can't get the high quality fish meal and so i think that's another very promising uh direction trying to go in is how you know the interactions between contracting frictions uh and these upgrading decisions may be driven by by by either output demand output i'd say like demand pull for for quality um i'm uh i'm happily i'm so isabella's here someplace right okay so i want to talk about this another great paper um by by alfaro ninja also in the era uh isabella and jose vasquez um so this is where they have so i think the firm to firm data which we're getting from vat systems from tax systems is a this is an important um a very important expansion of the data frontier i think it's going to stimulate a lot of work on on this firm stuff so they have such data from costa rica they can look at firms they're basically comparing firms that start start selling domestically to a multinational corporation against firms that don't start selling they might start selling to a domestic corporation or various control groups basically so you can imagine that that's a picture of the intel factory in costa rica um and uh they find that so guys when they start and so it's important to have the firm to firm because before we didn't know we we we couldn't ever see this who was selling to a domestic multinational corporation okay they find uh you know sales of these new suppliers to mnc's employment tfp in traditional measuring traditional ways um go up relative to non uh new mnc suppliers um and i think for me my favorite i haven't said this development my favorite results here are about what happens what the characteristics of the other buyers the non-m c buyers that these firms are selling to okay and so basically they end up selling after they start supplying to the to the mnc there their other buyers tend to be larger are more likely to export and import um have and have longer relationships with suppliers you can see this here this is this is like a comparing this is so the green notch would be guys who start um supplying to mncs the and then this would be domestic exporters which would be it's already pretty good you know pretty large firms and this is this is now um you know say this says how much sales to others you see there's a looks like there's capacity constraints in the short term when they start selling to intel their sales to other firms go down they just don't have the argument they don't have the capacity but then pretty quickly uh their their sales are their sales are higher um so uh it looks like i think it's convincing the authors argue and they have qualitative data to to support this it looks like these m c suppliers new m and c suppliers learned uh and got and got a reputational boost basically from selling to these mncs what seems so that seems sort of in line with this idea that who you sell to who you sell to matters and selling to sort of rich country buyers directly or indirectly um seems to matter this is commonly perceived to be a a key driver of upgrading um and it's including within firms so not just uh you know allocation across firms but within firms there's obviously some uh nice examples of that here's another there's a paper by das at all college christian is also on this paper where there was a like a public sector rail mill which had a monopoly on selling rails to the indian uh railroads uh and then the government considered allowing others to enter um in uh basically in 1999 2001 and it became uh sort of binding where the sailings rose in 2001 and you can see that the output of these rails relative to these structural shifts would be sort of non-rail items in the same factory and this was output per shift just you know shot up so at some point the threat of entry seems to have gotten this factory uh you know producing more quickly so clearly competition can matter um but so the theory is not obvious first of all why was this firm you know in the case this case was a you know monopoly selling to a public public sector but in typically it's not obvious why a firm would not be already optimizing right so why do you need competition in order to get firms to optimize um and then i think the evidence is is is less than definitive so um the uh holmes and schmitz have a nice review basically it's hard to tell empirically the effect of killing off poor performers from a within it within firm upgrading effect of competition okay so and uh so basically you've got to be very careful about that right so so you if you you look at competition you look like average productivity goes up that may just be because you're not seeing the guys the guys were killed off for that for whom that didn't happen uh wreckage also has a nice paper where this is the historical one but napoleon blockade was more mining in the north and the south and so firms in the north of france were able to rescale economies and and productivity rose more quickly and then a paper by rocco machiavello and i mean um i think is a very nice one which is in a in a second best world where there are contracting frictions then it's not obvious that competition is going to be is going to sort of increase increase efficiency so basically what they're finding is this is in rwanda with coffee coffee mills they have an engineering model uh given the ruggedness of the iran and geography sort of arguing about some uh they have a constructed intro for how many other mills are going to be nearby okay in places that have and then they show that that predicts you know how many other mills are nearby and so in mills that have other mills nearby they see fewer investments in relational contracts okay so this would be like that did the and they asked on the the suppliers and the and the mills themselves you know did you receive an input from the mill ahead of time did or did you know the the the mill did you give inputs to farmers did they have delayed payment which is some sort of trust on the other side these sort of indicators of trust look like they're weaker okay which is which is interesting and striking and they also find that you know quality falls with competition so that's just to say this is a note of caution i think that competition is one of those things i think people come out and say oh yeah competition isn't driving upgrading i'm you know i'm not i'm not i'm not too sure okay 15 minutes okay uh all right let me go so input side drivers so so far i've been talking about what i call demand pull drivers like selling you know who the buyers are matters for how much upgrading there is uh the question would be are there can there be input push does the supply of input somehow uh matter as well there's some existing work there maybe i'll won't say very it won't say very much about it but it's like in china when import tariff went down it looks like export prices went up which suggests that some firms are able to you know import higher quality inputs and they sell higher higher quality outputs um i want to tell you briefly about with one slide a new project where we're trying to support this as the end of the alphabet person we're trying to support this this uh this new norm i didn't didn't do it go so well for me this time but but uh i'm hopeful that i'll i'll uh eventually i'll get out there in the in the front um uh okay so that we did is with our we have we've been working with soccer ball producers in pakistan for a long time we randomized the vouchers for a high quality imported version of the main material which is called rex in this artificial leather and then we looked at you know how how people what what people did on other dimensions these are basically iv models where um now the voucher was the same dollar amount and so it was a bigger effect for for smaller firms than for than for larger firms so we're using like the interaction of the size and you know the treatment um that's that's the instrument for this whether you used eligible reckson and producing your ball but basically the the point here is that when for when the firms got this got these subsidies they improved on lots of dimensions not just the rex and dimension so they they use betorexin which is not surprising but they also use better latex as kind of the glue to glue the rex into the layers of cotton or polyester they have they used the number of la the number of layers of the cotton or polyester they and then not significantly but this is the type of bladder this is a better type of bladder and then we have whether the bladder is imported or not and so if you put those into an index you find that's um that's that's significant and then if you can do that just that's in terms of physical quality which we're which we're observing and you can also do it in terms of um costs okay so the like if if they got this voucher their bladder costs went up the lake this is the glue stuff cost went up uh you know costs went up on various other dimensions as well and so i i i'll have to refer you to the paper doesn't exist but it's coming out shortly um or it'll be posted shortly but essentially so overall costs actually went up right in response to getting this voucher overall cost went up uh even though we just we just tweaked that one price there wasn't any general effects it was just that one price you see and so you actually have uh you know password is negative right so it looks like uh you know the price goes down right so that's going to screw up a any any uh passenger regressions but i think if you have you know this upgrading idea in mind then it's clear what's happening right it's just that they're they're upgrading on various dimensions you can think of this as you know input quality complementarities having better high quality inputs on one side leads to higher quality inputs on the other side okay let me just i'm conscious of time let me just briefly say i was expecting somewhat surprisingly in writing this review i didn't find a lot of evidence that supply of capital matters for upgrade for upgrading outcomes right which those outcomes that listed learning or technology adoption or product innovation right uh so now there's some nice papers so this is martin not to roenenberg bound in my train neither of them is explicitly focused on this but they do have uh you know the research designs that allow them to say something about the effect of of of capital on outcomes they're both not looking at tfpq they don't find about much on tfpq ballot matter i do find something on you know adding adding adding products that's the that's that's this one okay and this is a paper by jinkai and anne harrison there was a vat reduction on capital goods in china that increased investment but not product innovations or productivity okay so it's uh that's somewhat surprising um to me uh so here the concerns about tfp estimation would apply to the you know when they're using tfpq um but uh we so i think that's an area where a lot of some new research would be would be uh would be welcome but but it looks at least so far it looks like we don't have a lot of evidence that that supply of capital per se matters for for innovation okay uh let me move on let's go through to now drivers of know-how so let's say so far i've talked about external conditions out up advantages and input supply conditions uh we i think we can imagine situations where uh you know output supply and inventment sorry output demand infrastructure seem to be favorable and firms still fail to upgrade our framework would say would point to lack of know-how right so that they don't have firms may not have the capabilities or they may just not know about the the products or the or the techniques so i'm going to talk about if i well time permitting i'm going to talk about you know four different areas where i think we're learning something about sort of barriers or drivers of upgrading um one was htsu so i i hopefully okay i've many of you have probably heard me talk about this paper and the soccer ball paper i don't want to say very much uh talk about it at length basically we came up with a new technology for these soccer ball guys it was a way of cutting pentagons that reduce the weights of of the wrecks in the main material using something that mathematicians knew we uh we gave it out uh very few firms adopted right and the argument was that the misalignment of incentives within firms can impede information flows and hence learning so basically the cutters the guys who are actually doing the cutting were paid peace rates they didn't have their their the new technology slowed them down which reduced their incomes and so they found ways to block it okay and it wasn't until then we gave them an incentive explicit incentive to adopt we said hey we'll give you a month's salary as a bonus if you can demonstrate this technology works they did that and the firms the firms adopted so i think it's an example of how sort of organization agency issues within organizations can impede the flow of information and sort of impede the accumulation of noah another paper maybe it's less this one's less well-known it's uh just just coming out it's jing kai and ching wong have a very nice paper on uh this is in chinese auto manufacture internal within a single manufacturer so basically they implemented a new policy where uh employees evaluations of their supervisors were taken to account heavily with twenty percent weight in the salary decisions for the supervisors okay so that they um the employees made it unsurprisingly session rewarded that the supervisors became nicer um and then uh so team level productivity increased essentially because there was less turnover the reduced turnover it didn't have a lot of effect on product you know individual productivity but it did have effect reduced risk turnover uh t-mobile productivity increased uh and then the the proof and that was in the pudding in the sense that the firm you started with this little pilot program rolled it out through all the all their factories um so now uh i think there's a different interpretation we could have in this paper but to me it suggests that this evaluation system led to an information flow from lower level workers to upper level management about what the middle level managers were doing right in a good way right and so then these guys are being abusive or these guys being annoying and so that this led to a mechanism where that um that stopped happening and people were happier and and more and more productive an interesting question is you know why didn't firms these are all within the firm stuff why don't firms figure this out on their own i think there are a couple of different uh possibilities one is that you know firms were just not aware of the new practice they didn't have the knowledge it wasn't in their you know this it wasn't in their set that capital k thing that they of tech techniques that they knew about um that's one possibility the the other possibility is that firms were aware but that there are re-contracting costs that outweighed the expected benefit so actually that's my preferred interpretation of the in our soccer ball case is that even if firms knew that this they you know they incentivized workers to share this information they might have got more information they said well if i do that then they're going to want you know they're going to want a bonus every time they do something else and it's going to be it's going to be a hassle and and so they didn't you know they didn't want to do it based on their sort of low perception that the technology was going to pay off i'm not sure if that this one may have been just that the firm was just not aware and so i think actually that's a good another good topic for research is you know what do firms if you see firms failing to adopt like ask them why not what is it what do they believe that costs and benefits are and try and try and try and try and bring that up okay uh all right so another big topic sort of uh you know bear when you think about barriers to upgrading would be you know or buried after it would be a lack of entrepreneurial ability um and then a lot of that's related to you know family control like why is it that there there seem to be some manager not particularly good who've inherited you know control of their firm from there from you know from a previous generation um so there's uh you know lots of work showing this is sort of cross-sectionally basically that managers do differ in their practices and those are associated with with productivity differences so this nice new paper this is orianna banjera and andrea pratt and raphael sudoon and somebody and this is och and anant was here yesterday um and others sort of showing that that correlation there's also i think strong evidence that it's a correlational evidence or event study evidence that when when you know uh control is passed to the next generation that uh those firms have have worse performance and then also this is um you know blue marine will point out that they have less less structured practice meaning lower the lows practices that score lower on on the world management survey um that that they run uh there's this um i think the evidence is strong here that this kind of succession does have negative effects and the strongest evidence is are these child composition iv so you can look at whether the the gender of the firstborn of the ceo or of whether the ceo has any sun and that predicts whether the control was passed within the within the firm and then that's so then family succession is associated with lower probability profitability worse performance and lower scoring lowering management scores so that's i think pretty clear i don't think we should conclude from that though that like family control is bad we should just never have family control because i think it's important to realize like what again in the spirit of figuring out what problem is being solved i think family control helps to solve many of these agency problems so so family control helps solve some of these you can you can sort of trust your family members you know it was a larger span of control arguably so back to ninety several firms that had more brothers were larger uh family they you know are offered lower lower power incentives and so i think what maybe the way i think i would interpret this is that you know family control solves some problems right that then outlive their usefulness right so they saw from when the ceos and you have the dynamic charismatic ceo right and then but then once that person dies and then then they outlive the usefulness in the same way actually so peace rates in the soccer ball example do a similar thing piece rates were a good thing obviously they are optimal before a new technology came to town it was just once the new technology came to town they got in the way right and so there's it's somewhat more subtle than just like families or bad uh interpretation okay uh uh what was it so how many people are going to have questions nobody okay dean's going to have a question a couple couple questions okay um let's see what can i say so i'll just say there's let me i'll uh sorry to the guy inside all and the next video so there's lots of evidence that for people that firms can learn from other firms they're very they have a very nice paper in china there's paper there's lots of there's good evidence that firms can learn from trainers and consultants there's a sort of accumulation of evidence there um uh there are some frontier issues i was going to talk about uh maybe i'll say that this might be something a good topic of conversation or something to to stimulate a few more questions which is so i've uh emphasized a lack of know-how as a barrier to upgrading here right that that affirms it looks like you know firms should be doing subtract adopting some technology or producing some product they're not doing it why is it it's arguing that it seems like they might not have the know-how it's also possible obviously that they have some other goal that the entrepreneurs have some other goal besides profit maximization or that they're making mistakes and so you know we definitely need more evidence about that so michael and gallatin and frank i guess have a have a chapter in behavioral development economics where they have a section on behavioral firms and basically say we don't know that much about the motivations of entrepreneurs we need to find out more about that i heartily you know support that i do have a word of caution which is i think especially sometimes in these management discussions that there's a tendency to say oh yeah people just make mistakes and if they just had mckinsey or whoever it was uh you know consulting them then then things would be better and um i i think that there's a tendency to sort of jump too quickly to that to that conclusion right so there was a the old schultz idea like we think of you know people as agricultural producers as poor but rational right we try to understand the problem they face i think we should you know update for ldc firms we can think of firms as lacking know-how and but populated by rational individuals and so firms may not make optimizing decisions but you know arguably many individuals i think the evidence so far is largely consistent with the idea that individuals are maximizing um you know on their own and so what looks like non-profit maximizing behavior that you know would often look like i think would often be explained by agency or contracting organizational issues and or the cost of acquiring know-how rather than just making mistakes or holding up holding other objectives okay okay summing up uh so i think we should i think it's a stronger way of saying this i think it's time to move on from tfp as the main metric for estimating upgrading i think we should go like pay the shoe leather costs go out and find these direct measures i think that's the way um that's the way forward um uh you know some drivers have said this before selling risk uh consumers uh available high quality inputs uh ability to resolve contracting frictions exposure to other trans firms and trainers and funds are all important a key challenge i think is how to promote uh learning in firms there were some notes of caution on competition on capital and behavioral firms but i do think i guess the big message is i do think it's possible to do credible work in this area and you also go out and start doing it i think these are important uh questions and and i hope i hope basically that that this work on firms won't just be you know like trade macro i o that has some application in developing countries but that they'll actually be uh they'll actually be seen as inherently an organic part of development economics okay i'll stop there and so we can take a look [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
