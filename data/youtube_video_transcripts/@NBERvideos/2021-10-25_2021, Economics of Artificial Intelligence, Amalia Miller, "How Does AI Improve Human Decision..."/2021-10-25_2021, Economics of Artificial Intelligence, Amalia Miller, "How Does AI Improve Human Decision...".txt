okay the prompt is a i will substantially change the skills needed in the workplace of the future and my reaction is yeah probably will um ai is already causing large changes but in the very specific narrow areas um but it does look like both the innovation in ai and the con and adoption of ai are both on track for continued growth so i think there will be a big impact and it will affect skills i want to use the time i have now to address uh not the question of if but the question of how ai might affect demand for different skills in different ways and first i want to just offer a bit of structure on how i think about the question and then talk about implications from the two papers so just a few kind of notes i had about thinking about skills the first is that skills are not the same as occupations they're not the same as jobs and they're not even the same as tasks their inputs into these things iai can therefore affect the mix of skills uh used to in work um even if employment is stable job titles are stable and tasks are stable the second thing is that people acquire skills using a combination of their innate ability and their human capital investments and that means among other things that skills are going to be unevenly distributed across the population if innate ability or costs or access to costs of or access to investment opportunities are also unevenly distributed in the population third point is that skills can vary along both vertical and horizontal dimensions skills can vary in degree or in kind we typically are often talk about skills in terms of high versus low skill basically as a proxy for education level but skills also can range in um in terms of their type of skill in terms of both a range of different general and specific skills and finally i think kind of comes from the previous point skills are not very well defined conceptually and they're not very well measured in traditional data sources which actually makes skills a hard thing to study why do should we do this anyway okay skills i think it's important to do but i want to say they're also a weird thing to study okay thinking about disembodied skills in a workplace is a strange thing to do it ignores a lot about work so much that's important and so much that's going to be affected by ai and particularly i mean the subjective experiences of human workers how they allocate their time interact with other people their degree of autonomy their pay their job security their status their intrinsic joy their personal growth and also the bad things like the board and the frustration the conflict the stress and the risk ai can affect all of that um and yet despite this omission and complexity focusing on skills is a very standard typical policy response um to ai and to labor demand shocks and disruptions in general and one reason is this focus on easing the transition path for workers whose skills have been devalued this idea is we have this very popular tool of trying to offer them retraining um in part that maybe will help them um long term and it's also a way to provide um targeted transfers so it's success can be questions uh beyond just this transition path i think skill demand mix in the economy also is going to matter for the long-term distributional impact of ai particularly among workers right there's other distributional impacts between workers and owners of capital but within workers um technological change is often biased in favor of skilled workers and that's going to generally increase wage inequality um but it's also true that horizontal shifts so shifts in the distribution of skill of demand for different skills can also have distributional effects in particular because ability preferences and opportunities are not distributed equally in the population another reason why policymakers care about skills used in the workplace is because of the large role that the public sector and government has in promoting skill development through the provision subsidies and regulation of schooling and that's at all levels of education human capital investments take time and so we need to project future demand in order to inform our current choices about the content of this training the funding levels and the types of training that the government should invest in okay so it's important but how what do we think is going to actually happen how will ai change demand for skills so i think there's sort of this two concepts right is that we think that ai is going to reduce demand for skills that can be substituted easily by ai which ai can do the same thing but in a cheaper way and that could either be tasks that resemble ai in form in the sense that they're routine in their prediction like tasks or in function in the sense that humans use a different way to accomplish it but the same thing could be accomplished um using ai um and we think that skills that might be um increasing their value are skills that are complementary to ai and so a common example of skills that um that we think are going that people talk about being in greater demand is computer skills or tech skills um and i think in the near term that's right clearly right um if there's more ai then demand for programmers of ai tech support of ai and then also people who feed ai data and who interpret ai outputs all of that is going to be more valuable and that can happen within jobs or tasks the same person now interacts with a computer and needs that other skill or it could be that you sort of hire out professionals it's a different job mix um i do think though for thinking about the future of ai and ai is that um innovation could actually reduce or remove um the need for specialized human programmers by making it easy for me to just talk to the computer um directly and actually devalue the skills that created it um in that case it's i think that the skills that would become more valuable with more ai are actually those that are used in tasks that have limited capacity for ai or no role for ai or where ai can't take over the whole thing because we need a human um in the loop okay so what do the current papers have to say about this kind of complementarity versus substitution question um it's kind of interesting so they share a common focus i think where they're both really focusing on settings where ai is superior to humans which i don't think is always true um but they kind of focus on opposite aspects of this of this interaction between ai and human skill i think deming's paper is mostly about substitution and um and the choi and co-author's paper is more about complementarity so in some sense um the ai the first paper um focuses on this concept of decision making and in particular decision making as a job requirement and documents for us the rising frequency and some possible implications of that so the first thing is what does this mean so in the broadest sense i think every human task requires some aspect of decision making and so we need um a definition of decision making to sort of think about this that is more specific um the approach the paper takes is to use a definition of decision making that is operational rather than conceptual and what i mean is that it's defined on data using a dictionary based approach um text analysis of job listings and so if they have these words then they're decision making jobs and if not they're not and that does make it a little hard to interpret sort of what is that what is the defining characteristics because of course listings are advertisements used to attract applicants they're not objective accounting of jobs um but we can kind of get a sense from the paper about what sorts of jobs are being picked up in that it's correlated with management and with non-routine and cognitive tasks although not perfectly correlated with any of these categories so the paper kind of gives us this idea about decision making and shows that it's been increasing and then gives a model of human decision making that on the one hand looks a lot like your typical economic model of decision making it's sort of rational choice with an objective function with uncertainty and on the other hand also boils down to a simple prediction problem and so in some sense uh the deck is stacked here uh because decision making is defined in such a way that the ai is going to beat the humans right um in the model humans get better at making predictions as they accumulate experience and they're passively exposed to more data but they'll never be as good as that task as the ai is um and so if decisions boil down to routine prediction problems or clear objections and lots of clean unbiased data yeah ai wins and human decision makers should be substituted out and in some sense the paper does highlight this competition between man versus machine on the one hand um you know the machine learning can doesn't have the same constraints of humans on the other hand if the data is messy machines can't handle that and suggests um a possible complementarity where maybe humans can support machines running at times a little bit faster i just want to say i think that that idea of complementarity could be could be expanded right so part of it is that these decision-making jobs also have a lot of non-prediction parts to it okay and those um so not just feeding the computer better data but also management jobs are also about working with people communicating inspiring mentoring leading and i don't know that robots are good at that maybe if they're managing other robots but i think if you've got humans you want a human manager um also the keywords involve things like diagnosing judging setting priorities and goals ai cannot set goals and it seems poorly suited to setting goals um for people and so maybe a human would be necessary for admission or vision okay the second paper um takes an approach of ai as an enhancer of humans looks at this setting again where computers are better the ai has beat the humans um what's interesting here is that the complementarity is not from production um but it's actually from being a learning tool and human capital development um and they find um as a human capital theory would predict that we see bigger gains for um for humans i just wanted to end by saying what are the implications here it's unclear once ai is better than humans why are humans doing this at all it seems like a sort of classic case for substitution um and so i think that also raises an interesting question about potential you know why are there still humans in human uh human need people still play go for fun and they even do it professionally it's also true for chess why are people playing go and why are people paying to watch other humans play go they don't seem to want to pay to watch robots compete so this suggests maybe we can think a little bit more about the kinds of tasks that could survive even after the machines are better than us at everything i don't know the answers but i'll just conclude by saying we expect ai diffusion i expect it to have differential impacts on different skills um but i don't think it's going to align simply in a vertical dimension or just techy versus softy skills and i think that even in very stark settings where ai has a clear advantage both of these papers suggest modes of complementarity and human machine cooperation
