um it's great to be here because i remember so clearly my own first behavioral summer camp which is i think like the second one ever done because it was at the very beginning of the revolution and um and i come back with my first year i come back and i tell my advisors i want to do something crazy i would like to apply behavioral economics to development and they said what are you going to say to people who say that's not first disorder compared to infrastructure or schools or any of the other things that all my comments work on and i said well i guess we'll see that's the point of their miracle work and you know i had some sense that this could matter because i had spent the year prior to graduate school living volunteering in a rural community in the ivy coast and seeing you know vaccines piled up and no one using them and technologies that people weren't adopting and all kinds of decisions that didn't make sense and policies that i had worked on at the world bank that were not being kind of taken up at all in the field um and then you know imagine the great feeling of coming to graduate school and reading like golden eggs and hyperbolic discounting thinking about the demand commitment but what i saw in the field and this is i really those of you i've talked to have really encouraged you as much qualitative work as possible because what was most helpful to me was not only being able to identify behavioral biases in the field and talking to people understanding how they make decisions but also feeling out what kinds of internal solutions and one of the women i met so everyone has trouble saving their spookies right that's like a chunky expense one of the women i've met had planted all of her crops at the same time officially except for her sweet potato frost which she planted to come due when the school fees were due and i told her why would you do that given that you know there's some you know efficiency to harvesting at the same time and she said no no no if i do then all that money will get sent i make sure that that only comes to harvest when this will be served then i met another woman who had a locked box in her house was keys she had given to the neighbor and she had to go and ask the neighbor every time so we took those examples and designed a commitment device in the philippines um to basically as you know david kind of teased us really nicely yesterday um as you know kind of demand for commitment is kind of a smoking gun for hyperbolic present biased um time consistent preferences not completely you know there's also a lot on other things that would um uh predict a commitment twice and take up a commitment advice but here's kind of what we wanted to do and i'm going to tell you a little bit about the design of it because as you can see that you know i'm going to just to give you the overview of what i'm doing today i kind of chose five the four areas where i thought um you know behavioral economics have had a very significant dialogue with development economics but also in the spirit of what we're doing today that the dialogue would go the other way as well but what we've learned in in in applying and testing some of these ideas would then hopefully feed back into theory and that's the dialogue that i hope you will all whatever you're doing be engaged in that's part of what's been fantastic about behavioral economics is that the marrying of theory um so on the the demand for commitment so we designed this product that had a withdrawal restriction so basically the client chose the goal that was an important distinction we had a debate you know this is a a poor community actually had a lot of pushback from development economists and microfinance at the time was focused entirely on finance what would you be doing taking liquidity away from poor people um and when you ask people they say they don't save enough because they don't have enough money but then if you ask a little further and especially if you use words like have you ever been tempted then all the stories come out okay so we designed this kind of together with people on the ground on allowing them to choose so not not dictating what they should stand for but allowing them to choose what they wanted to save for and then making the goal either an amount before which the bank would not let you take out the money or a date so a lot of people are saving for christmas or graduation and again you signed a contract with the bank to not let you withdraw money so basically it looks like the sweet potato harvester and then that was my strong restriction that's the kind of main strong commitment on that side um and then there was a deposit incentive so this was actually also based on what people were doing on the ground they had these financial boxes which were essentially locked boxes um and and so that kind of provided a deposit incentive it also provided a reminder to some degree um if if this had been more advanced we would have done automatic um automatic transfers and you'll see that actually a lot of yeah we had significant impacts on average but a lot of people didn't actually use the commitment advice and this is a theme you're going to see once commitment devices make their way through every aspect of development economics um and a lot of it is because there's nothing on the uh on the on the deposit side or on the kind of um incentive side okay the last thing that we did in designing this was that you know this is a ordinarily in a bank this is uh taking liquidity away and that loss of liquidity would in a market be compensated so the interest rate should be higher but again we're at the beginning of the revolution so this is like 2003 2001 maybe even when we started the experiment and so we knew that um even if so the regular interest rate for a regular savings account at this bank is four percent i know that's really high but it is that's what it was we knew that even if we said 4.05 economists would say that's why people put their money in there so we really had to make almost people paid to some degree for using the device to be able to see whether they really demanded it or not um so this is a distinct sample it was people who were actually already banked but weren't using their accounts very much and what we did was a randomized controlled trial where we randomized the clients into um this commitment savings product where we offer them the commitment savings product a regular savings product four percent and an encouragement to save because what we found was that you know the process of offering we wanted to randomize by individual the process of offering your door could in itself banks come with you you know could in itself happen so that was the placebo and then and prior to that separately we had a very separate team doing a survey and there we measured people's uh time preferences and again this was at the beginning of our understanding of measurement of of time and consistency and i think there's been a lot of progress since in terms of how we want to do this here we did it hypothetically but making people imagine the the the amounts of money and what they would do with it etc and then we were able to categorize people into you know fully patient today into mars is like ten dollars today versus fifteen tomorrow you you all know that the time preference experiments um fully patient fully impatient present bias tagging consistent which is who we're looking for and then this other category which is kind of in the other direction um and you know about 27 of people were in this present bias about 11 were in this other kind of off off diagonal um those are the people who took up the commitment device so that was kind of a good test that this is actually um part of what's going on here um there was a 28 take up alongside treatment and it's predicted by these present advice time consistent preferences you all remember the theory it's only if you're sophisticated right that this would actually demand commitment and if you have these kind of consistent preferences um it turns out that it's only women that have time in the system wise time consistent preferences that take up and then i have some follow-on papers that um recognizes the cultural role that women play in the household that requires them to internalize they're basically a savings commitment and so if they have the problem they have to be sophisticated about it and uh and then what we found was that there was a significant increase in savings over this time period um for people which were offered the kind of device that's an average again a lot of heterogeneity and since then there's been you know people have applied um the commitment device to uh smoking to under adoption of agricultural technology labeled yeah i think it would be useful to say what i remember in this picture you lost you addressed the issue that's to what you're just discussing about the difference between self-control and other control right and and given that you know women are in the position that you're describing the other control thing yeah [Music] yeah yeah so i i went on the market with two papers this was one of them and the other paper was called sponsor control in the same setting and um because these are these with both basically if you if you have a partner who is going to spend the money you bring home you have to keep it away from them so it's like the two shelves but inside of either inside of you or inside the household um and as i mentioned in the philippines there are very clear rules where actually even in the marriage ceremony husbands hand the money over to their wives and from from when they're small um boys are raised to kind of be out there and they're supposed to be playful and present by us and women are raised to be responsible and so um so in this case the reason we think that it is more of driven by you know hyperbolic preferences is simply because of this correlation this prediction from the preferences um but the fact that it is women who take it up suggest that there's um that's that dynamic in the household is creating an awareness of one's own challenges um [Music] i you know my reading of all of this now because there's there's now been i haven't kind of put on the the papers that deal with spousal control but there's been a lot of work in that area as well is that both of these things are present um and uh and it's useful actually as in including you know um doug's homework and and going over these other ways of thinking about our two cells are useful to think about both within ourselves and within the household is that where you were thinking about now yeah i just want to pause a little bit on the welfare option right here so as you mentioned um there is a big trade-off between kind of flexibility and constraining your future self um which means that commitment contracts are not necessarily optimal um for a lot of people um and then it's possible if you layer some kind of naivety on top of that you know you could figure out a situation where people with the lowest levels of the present focus parameter might actually be they force off by commitments because they kind of lock it it's like this government of my work a lot of people are confused and just kind of like take on commission contracts for other reasons that are orthogonal preferences um so um you know there's sometimes this impossible preference way of thinking about events you know people pick it up and they say more nice that maybe they're better off but it's not so obvious um at all given all of these considerations um so can you what's your view um what's going on do you think we increase the welfare of these individuals or you know is just something that we need additional metrics for yeah so just on the additional measures um we measured we did household surveys two years down the line and we looked at the total income and paid then all the payday loans here was a very important reason for this was they have five sixes which is you take out five today who owns six tomorrow and so uh really high interest rate payday loans anything else consumption we were looking at for every other measure of welfare um subjective well-being etc and um and we didn't find any crowd out in that sense um however other people have and uh i was just thinking about this this hypertension paper as well where you know they're generally i think what we found is that people are partially naive even when they're sophisticated or they could be you know stochastically sophisticated and depending on the design of the contract you could have a situation where people end up putting a lot of money thinking they're gonna do this and then they don't do it and then they end up foregoing that money so anything that's like a bomb that can be very i think welfare register um particularly because especially if you're working in these settings where people are not very educated they might be taking signals from your offering on this contract because maybe this is a good thing for me and you think i should do it and the bank will be more likely to offer me a loan or other things and so actually that's my you know big caution about losing anything including defaults right so even the default one we think oh that's you know people have a choice they could they can opt out but in a developing country setting the default is signaling something about what the government wants to do about other things and that may actually have its own effects so all to say that here um we were we were quite worried about all of these welfare questions largely because this was the big discourse was you know microfinance is all about micro credit this is why would you do this and you know the reason we did this was people on the field were asking for it and doing it to some degree so so were the people that we saw doing it that was enough or if we offered it in the market would other people also be made better off and here what we did is um we did two pilots the first pilot um we actually allowed it to be super soft so basically any for any reason you could take out the money so you set a goal you actually signed a contract but you could come to vancouver and when we um i i've been telling some of you that um actually david was the one who always told me to debrief every one of my subjects from the first pilot i do i still try to do that somewhat but there i did and we had focus groups and they all said could you please make this harder honest because i can come for any reason so can you and you said but we don't want to create a situation where you can't take out the money they're taking down a loan instead and they said no no we'll know because we have this other account so we know that it requires them to know so we did a little bit of when we when we offered it to them we said something about you know this is a situation where you know you're gonna put the money in and then you won't be able to take it out so you need to think carefully about that um but they themselves were the ones asking for more commitment um for hospital so the actual hardness of it was you either needed a hospital bill or something that said you moved out of the barangay or you write a letter to the bank manager there weren't any fees but obviously with lots of permanent movement devices there are fees and people lose money um and and that's where we need to be really careful um sorry but even with choice of restrictions to the extent that there other methods of is and so forth yeah that puts them closer to the category of feedback commencing devices as well because it's hard to come up with a tree choice right and it's true what is a commitment has to be costly somewhere yeah yeah so that's the whole point but that design and you know there's there's kind of some great papers to trying to really trade off the value of flexibility and liquidity versus commitment and you're totally right to point out that this is deeply related to how much people understand of their own needs um and i don't i don't know how else to answer it other than to say we measure everything we can possibly measure that we think is related to doctor and this and i think everyone should [Music] but they haven't they haven't and i also think that you know and you know it's really i mean there's like this kind of puzzle because what you know there was this this great thing like wow a little bit like like this is the time you're like wow low-cost way to help people say that this is great and like we should do this everywhere and of course often in developing countries or of course as you see people you know having this easter famine mentality so you think this is this is going to be the solution and in fact you know it hasn't scaled either in terms of policy or in terms of private sector in the way that you might expect if even if 30 of the population had these kinds of preferences um and i think part of that is because it is actually quite a tough thing the other part is that i don't think we've thought deeply enough about time preferences so that's where i'm going next but yeah and one more thing yeah i'm interested so you mentioned this really interesting fact from your debrief about how these people kind of knew they had some kind of self-control potentially or kind of inconsistency issue and that's why they were asking for it and that feels different from what we kind of see from some of the modern um lab experiments like ogden blitz and raven where the finding is almost complete unawareness of self-control problems or time inconsistency it's just kind of extrapolating very loosely from kind of that and when you just i think it's fair that kind of like when the stakes are higher and people have lots of experiences that kind of leads them to start learning yes a lot about their and we shouldn't extrapolate too much from kind of the pleasures of night but they better have a more artificial setting that's right and this is highly related to the whole dialogue between kind of when we think about decision making under poverty and under scarcity right so on the one hand a lot of the attention has been given to cognitive bandwidth constraints making worse decisions but what dmitry's pointing to is what i you know i think the wealth of evidence is pointing to which is that actually the higher stakes the more constrained environment makes it very clear to you when you have these biases and because it's it becomes much more like life or death i mean you gotta you gotta find out what to do and and what we were trying to do in offering this was to say who are the people in this environment who have faced this problem and found their solution and how do we make that more readily available to other people okay so this goes nicely into the the kind of second area which is that um when we think about time preference as economists we're used to thinking about these different factors that we've been talking about for the last few days and um and in fact in kind of the beginning of economics that's not what we thought about thinking provision for the future makes no inconsiderable demands on our intellectual strength this is not a preference so much as the capacity demands on our intellectual strength the present always gets its rights it forces itself upon us through our senses to cry for food when hungry occurs even to a baby but the future we must anticipate and picture so more recently in economics there has been you know a formalization of this and you know quebec has a very nice overview chapter in the in the handbook that doug um edited showing sort of that heroin attention can explain a lot of phenomena in particular he thinks about hyperbolic discounting and projection bias and then you know there's some wonderful paper the 2017 version has a model in which as if discounting is generated by imperfect forecasting that comes just because agents are experiencing signals that are noisy but accurate on average and you know the farther out you go the variance and the signals will be larger the farther out in the future the variance is larger so this is just signal uh that you're getting in their revisions they've been doing uh models with scenario simulations so it'll be great to see like the new version that's coming out here um but uh and then the reason for that is that this this this is a good way of thinking like okay we have to anticipate a picture of this thing that's fuzzy and in the future and that's why we discounted it right but then if you continue on this quote it tells you even more about what the process could be which is we must be able to form a mental picture of what would be the state that's kind of a projection bias problem of our wants needs feelings at any particular point of time and we must be able to form another set of anticipations as to the fate of those measures which we take at the moment with the move to the future so that's mental scenario simulation if i do this what will happen if i do this what will happen so you need that to be vivid and precise and to go through the all of the them in this process so it makes no inconsiderable demands on our intellectual strength to do this right and it doesn't seem like it's just sort of exogenously given to us interestingly there was a paper from 1997 of uh carrying background mulligan that thinks about this as a capacity and in particular says okay well if it's a capacity then there should be a rational incentive to invest in this capacity um to appreciate the future to reduce the degree of discount and they allow the fact that probably in rich families or in educated families there's a lot more talking about the future a lot more making details specific and precise and then they do it more naturally and that of course opens the door for really thinking about potential types of traps and deep implications for inequality that arise because because there is an under investment in this class and that i want to take even further beyond the rich and the poor to talk about then how trauma can affect the brain in making this kind of anticipation and picture to understand that you need to understand a little bit about how that mental picturing happens when we anticipate the future what's happening so neuroimaging studies of perspective range show that imagining future events you draw from your memory right that it basically recruits the same part of your brain when you're thinking about the future is when you think about the past and and then you have to recombine these elements so what does trauma do it it creates a sense in which the memories become overgeneral and so everything in the future that you have to think about either the trauma will shut down future thinking because it triggers negative uh affect from past negative memories and you get this overload essentially that um that uh therapists who work with ptsd have to deal with is of their memories and that leads to what um is called the literature or shortening sense of the future or um sort of we really think about things in this non-specific over general way so you could even think about the future but but it's really being driven by things that may not be relevant in your past and so you know this mental time travel that we're talking was talking about and we've been kind of starting to address in the economics literature requires the capacity to flexibly reconstruct details to simulate or kind of pre-experience future events mentally and that becomes much more difficult and so you get this murky vague non-specific thinking about the future that looks a whole lot like present wise discount so um what we've done is over the past five years we have been working in colombia which is a setting um with over 8 million people who have suffered displacement and conflict so they have very high trauma and i had the incredible honor of meeting emily holmes who's on this paper she's a professor of neuroscience and a professor of psychiatry and her work is on trauma and imagery i'll tell you a little bit more about about all of the science she's done on the role of imagery in decision making and particularly in helping people trauma and the thing is like in in colombia as in many countries there are all these reconstruction efforts with all kinds of credit and training to help people restart their lives and then actually sometimes there's also mental health um interventions but the the problem is these are a little bit in the way that we think of these things but they're not separate of course as we just learned um and so what we tried to do was design a curriculum that took a long time again within this sort of cogeneration process that we were doing on the ground with these imagery based learning techniques and this is with eric bryant alexa delfino emily leonard connie and ashley popel um and you know it's been a long time when most of these have gone from phd student to assistant professor um but uh the the key is to uh we took all the best things we knew about traditional business training by the way business training has the same quality as the discussion yesterday about financial training quite mixed uh uh effects to negative um but there are some things that work like them and um and so we took the best of what we know that works in business training and we added embedded basically this imagery based uh learning where you imagine future scenarios and in particular you imagine all the steps so you know you imagine what kind of entrepreneur you'd like to become and what it would be like on a day-to-day level to do that you then start thinking about the product and then you start doing the perspective taking of imagining the customer because by the way that's also similar and and then you start imagining yourself going and getting a loan and getting rejected by the loan officer and then what would you do you know these are the kinds of things that we invented into the teaching about how to calculate your profits and save and get credit and the three things that we think are really working um that imagery is doing and i'll tell you a little bit more about the science under each of them is mental scenario stimulation it enhances emotion as a motivation application and it helps with memory consolidation okay so this is you know the way to think about what imagery does so imagery you know we the way i'm going to talk and i'm just channeling emily here um we can think in either words or images at any moment we're thinking in either words or individuals you can switch between them the images are much older right from an evolutionary point of view we've thought about images a lot more in images and so they they're kind of faster and um when we think in an image it's essentially like perceiving something like with our eyes with our other senses and so for example a lot of the imagery exercises that we did with people require them to recruit all their senses because that is how you get from here to here there is a way in which you can make this that strong basically um and you know athletes have been doing this forever right so this this is the guy who climbed el capitan by mentally simulating every single step and every possible scenario in his head hundreds maybe thousands of times before we scaled it right and that's why it works it's because it's actually similar to the real experience um and that's you know again on the debriefing when i asked participants what did they in the pilot what did they like about it it's so practical it's like you know what i saw as they were sitting there closing their eyes like imagining something but for them it was like practical experience and it turns out that people had less experience in business are actually uh improve a lot more from this okay the second part so that was the mental scenario simulation aspect of imagery the second part is about emotion so compared to verbal thought mental imagery has a more powerful impact on emotion and specificity of thinking i actually want to take this opportunity to say something about financial training so i was involved a lot in it before this because of the savings product before actually and it's clear that financial decisions for a lot of people have emotion attached to them but most of our trainings kind of really shut that to the side and you could even see this here when when we started in the traditional training when i just was looking in the pilot when people would write down their profits and then they would just stop calculating i don't i don't know how to do this calculation as just because they were starting to see that they were making zero profits it was too painful avoidance so what imagery does is it kind of forces you in this setting to actually confront the emotions that arise in any scenario and then to see what you would do so we have both negative and positive scenarios and um and again we think of emotion as something that can get in the way of rational decision making but under the homes framework it's actually a very powerful driver that can be harnessed and then finally and so and this is this is the kind of um some of the evidence behind that that when you stimulate engaging planet activities it has a larger impact on um on your ability to carry out those activities um and on your self kind of reported motivation um so uh what we find is that imagery increases both the use and the quality of business interest so what we have there's measures that you can use to see how well people are using imagery give them scenarios and ask them about the vividness the precision um the emotion of their scenarios so it's self-reported but in our baseline it's highly correlated with business success with outcomes and that kind of thing so the question here was can you teach it is it malleable and um and there's a causal and so the first thing we need to see is yeah can we teach it and it looks like we can um but it's domain specific uh it doesn't cross over to other domains only on business symmetry and um and then downstream people in the imagery treatment do significantly better on economic outcomes and that is far more for people with trauma and for women and you know the the traditional which is really the verbal and analytic it turns out it actually browns out some of the imagery so those people actually do worse than the baseline on imagery because it kind of puts it says in this business in this scenario in this domain of business you should be thinking like this verbally analytically okay yeah this is so interesting 100 questions for you but um one thing that was continuing just your last slide the on the on the on the question why why are the ways that people have faced trauma that kind of chance of the future how much of this is about feeling that you have control over your own future and like when you've had a shock or like that i don't know a government pandemic you kind of are trained to to believe that you don't have control of your attraction therefore um so we measured agency and looks control for women it does actually go up um and we actually did pre and post code so we can see how people are responding to google shops so for women it does go up and i and i think more generally that's a mechanism even though we only find it for women today i actually think that it is broadly a mechanism because that when you do this mental scenario simulation you're the protagonist in the story and uh and so that feeling of being the protagonist in your own story i think can lead to uh overwhelm overcoming the helplessness that arises when you're facing someone's objective shots yeah you see a lot of what the training is like yeah so um we always had a psychologist and business trainer and they were they were both trained by by emily um and essentially um each so for example you do this the first thing is on um we want to we want you to think about the area of entrepreneurship that you want to go into and so the first thing you do is imagine being a fisherman and now you need to like you're waking up at 5am and it's extremely detailed so we give them like we take them through a kind of guided visualization and we feel that we send them smells and we do this and then we ask them to do it themselves um and then we do the same for each level so for for um the product design we imagine a customer coming in and imagine a customer not being happy with what you've done well will you do that you know and for the profits and savings we have imagine you don't say enough when you have a health shock what are you going to do but you take them through not in this verbal way you actually have and that's what i'm saying it's a little bit but um i mean you sit you breathe you close your eyes you're doing meditation essentially you're in this other kind of and then you start picturing these things so you're trying to get people away from the verbal analytic way and really get them to use images but images by which we mean all the five senses it's um 12 weeks i just didn't go through all the details but i'm happy to um and yeah it's it's uh uh 12 weeks and like probably three times a week it's not a very long training compared to others and that's my general experience with all of uh you know various trainings is that you've got to find the right book but once you do you don't actually need a lot of times we just have to yeah um so first uh did you uh get there any essence time conference no we didn't actually because for two reasons both because of the um challenges that have arisen in the literature on measuring right so we have some some sense that measuring in terms of labor is probably okay but it's not so easy the second is that um it's not clear that it should change actually so even though i've sort of motivated this by saying attention is the underpinning of time preference but i don't know if time preference the way we measure it is the right way to to think about it um and it is kind of a and that's in another domain you know so so i do think it's domain specific um annette john and katie orton have a paper where they um they help people visualize um use visualization for using water purification treatment and um and there they do find some effect on savings but so we do by the way i should say we find effects on savings and on credit um getting credit for your business in terms of the outcomes but we didn't measure the time preferences because of all of this other stuff and actually i talked to david about it yeah around him so he's distracted from eating yeah he's distracted from sleeping and then it's just like a disaster because there's just too much going on there um that suggests that you know these kinds of kind of mental imagery simulation exercises might also be taking away from other things where we can direct our attention you know we have a limited medical budget so when people are doing this they're not doing um something else potentially is that yeah let me um because you know we have these downstream effects on income right and then we're asking like what are the intermediate output that led to increasing income and something that is suggestive towards what you're saying is that the people in imagery are doing um much more marketing activities like going to customers going to competitors getting more credit having more savings but doing less record-keeping so i think you're right that there is some problem of this but the reason why i wouldn't do the analogy to your four-month-old is i think your four-month goal is a little bit more like the trauma victims who have just a bombardment of images where they haven't been it's difficult to actually discipline them to harness them to point them towards something that would actually be useful instead it's just a bombardment of stimulus and that's why i think you see trauma victims shutting down because in fact they have too many images of their head right but the broader point i think just to kind of conceptualize this a little more is with any kind of lover there's kind of a partially coordinated effect which is the domain that where we're deploying it and here you kind of have the financial good thing yeah that you're exploring with incredible detail but then we wonder what happens to all of the other domains where people are making decisions and so forth and kind of with any kind of a kind of bandwidth using intervention i think this is one of those there is always the question of what happens to the family left over yeah i would argue that the same could be said for the placebo so when we take people through traditional business training why would that also be the kids put a bunch of analytical ways in their head words they need to work on and and so it's helpful to have a single here but yeah absolutely we always want to know about the integral um but it's hard most of these field experiments are partial so i have a comment and a question comment just to follow up on thinking about welfare and it's just an observation that you know yesterday we talked about the non-profit problem uh the idea that you know if um the act of choosing is in your utility function that uh creates a fundamental problem of choice-based welfare analysis this is encouraging people basically to make that happen which makes it extremely large to evaluate um well i mean you know it's it's hard to even imagine doing doing the voice kind of design like this having people choose about whether or not they want some of those images because it's like are you supposed to use imagery to decide whether you're going to imagine yourself easily [Music] so i think some of the welfare issues are going to be very tough so that's the comment the question is um do you can you make one yeah sure um i think you know i think the number i don't exactly like like 80 million or something sent on business training around the world so this is happening anyway i think whatever welfare combination we have to compare to the become factual status no sure it's just that doing that requires an apparatus that while we're working on that problem don't really know an observation um the question is whether you can manage to say more about mechanisms and here's what i mean by this when i i'm thinking about you know the the guy climbing the face and there are two things going on one thing is he's trying to make a decision about where to put his hand okay that that could be one thing that's going on he goes through the imagery saying okay here i can see myself [Music] and seeing myself pulling myself up and what i'm doing is releasing anxiety you know getting comfortable with this course which is not about the choice itself it's about you know getting uh as i said it's more about getting comfortable with my choice of confidence in my choice it has emotion related to it right whereas the other one [Music] so is there any way to say whether this is about helping people stimulate different courses of action between them as opposed to simulating one course of action that they then unders so one thing is really about choice yeah yeah i mean because because the the answer to the question is that um the act of thinking about these alternatives which is like the mental practice that athletes do is on all the different scenarios it's not just but it's also when i do this i feel this right and so it has to come with that um in order for it to kind of consolidate into memory that's that's the kind of thinking on that from the mental practice of uh from athletes so that's important it's implementation and it feels like we have done that what i can tell you is there have been studies where where people have done visualization for the outcome like imagine yourself successful and actually it's demotivating for people putting less effort because they're like oh i already achieved it i don't need to do anything so this is really about the step-by-step thing but it's like when you're doing the stress you need to feel those so the only piece that i currently have to speak to that is that um we ask them about both negative and positive scenarios that they will raise those scenarios in the surveys afterwards and then ask them about the vividness of the precision and the vividness of emotion and both in positive and negative scenarios uh people have more emotion so they're thinking through negative scenarios and experiencing them more and the positive ones we thought it might be more about you know bringing down the negative bringing up the positive but when i talked to emily about the results she said no this makes a lot of sense because the point is they're supposed to in this situation be able to experience these emotions that would be attached again with this projection bias idea of overcoming projected lives to be able to actually know what would be the right thing to do in that situation yeah it seems like that differentiates this kind of treatment from like a regular communications intentions where you're going to be to vote you know like where you're going to be before what what are you going to take and what like which is the same idea exactly exactly and so there is that someone that could run the study to separate out the pure implementation of exercise with no emotion right to the visualization component which would separate out the scenario right absolutely can we get a time check just because we have two other areas i'm going to just very quickly go through i added this for you guys because of the question on the first day about what you do what do you do with people who have the wrong wrong beliefs um and you know certain beliefs are harder to change than others okay cultural beliefs superstitious beliefs beliefs that are really good um and they can hinder social learning so we have a paper that documents this in the in the aspect of maternal mortality um where it's a very common belief across all of sub-saharan africa that if a woman dies in childbirth it's because she was promiscuous during pregnancy this is how we uncovered this belief we were teaching them because we had this other project looking at different preferences where men want to love children then we wanted to teach men about internal mortality risk so in the pilot i stand up and say okay well you know as you know i wanted 27 women and they had died in childbirth over their lifetime and then all the men put up their hands and did the summer movement all the men put up their hands say oh that's because they were permissible just during pregnancy and i didn't understand what to say and then i asked you know our team and they said okay this is a cultural belief and i said oh well okay that's a myth let me show you the science that does not work at all um so we experimented with what is what is a way to address this and it is certainly not to say your beliefs are wrong let me show you the right stuff instead what we said is one in 110 women in south africa die in chomper over their lifetime and then they said oh look that those women are different from our women so if that is consistent that's data that's consistent with their mental model then we say one in 43 women in zimbabwe guiding childbirth over their lifetime so wait a second we think there's a big competitiveness between us and broadway those women we think are more promiscuous and yet they're dying at a lower rate what's going on and then we start with let's show you some of the um other things you can do to decrease maternal mortality and i'm not going to show you what we actually do you know pregnancy goes down sad and like satisfaction happiness in their marriage and their sex life goes up that's all but i just wanted to show you that about the beliefs and again i really encourage working with people on the ground on this last bit i want to share with you because this is something that you know for most of what we've seen behavioral economics has been great for development this is not an area it's still great um so you know there's a sort of large literature in behavioral economics on prowl and this literature i mean which many of you know is i'm not going to go into it um this literature has actually had a significant impact on policy discourse okay you may not think this but i was um sitting at in in the office of the archbishop of canada in england and he tells me but we know from all the behavioral economic literature that any financial incentive will crowd out for social motivation so you know how do we know this well i read michael sandel's book what money can buy and uh you know there's the israeli daycare study and and they they're fine and people did it less and and i said but that's a very specific mechanism right it was signaling to people that this is how much it costs when you come late we're talking about you know paying health workers more or paying teachers more but in fact it was something that um was is then been used to justify keeping salaries low for public service delivery and taking incentives out of anything that has to do with social activity and um and so but you know being on the ground you realize that money actually can signal many different things so even when you go back to this you have to really ask yourself from each of these studies what is the incentive signaling in terms of information and that will tell you whether it could crowd out or crowd in and what the mechanism would be and so this is a study where you know this is uh the only way that women have to protect themselves against hiv see more condoms in in southern africa where should you distribute them where people are in hair salons okay but the question is do you want to treat hairdressers and barbers like agents that you give a financial margin to and potentially crowd out their pro-social motivation for caring for their community or do you want to do something different and so we thought we would test this so we designed and implemented this field study and we randomized with um orientation kelsey jack this is the city of lusaka we coded gps coded it and um and we have four treatment groups i can tell you much more about the details later but if you're any of you are interested in doing incentive design experiments all the spillovers and designs those are really crucial but we went through all of those and then we did you know a 10 financial margin and a 90 financial margin because one of the magnesium papers is about payment or paid enough or not at all because a little could be insulted so that's why we have the 10 the 90 the pure volunteer and then this non-monetary reward that we created to basically be a parallel of financial incentives so every marginal effort you put in this is connecting you to the marginal community in fact totally symbolic um and uh and we measure using an adaptive dictator game they're based on altruism towards the hiv cause and then we'll track the science of female condoms which are sold at a substance price and what we find is that sorry if you don't see the whole thing this is just the breakdown by um by low donation high donation we find that the stars are twice as effective as any of the other margins and even the highest financial margin was not that effective because frankly there were a lot of ways that burgers and farmers could make an extra buck but turning that into something that connected them to the social impact they were having was just far more valuable to them by this way and then when we um do heterogeneous treatment effects by below median giving in the dictator being and it's above median given what you see is that the both the stars and the high financial incentives seem to crowd in so for the people that have the highest altruism they're actually more motivating them rather than crowding it up this isn't like the perfect test of prado what you ideally want to do is um you know give people some money and then take it away and then see what they do you know but it does help you to see for the people who started out super motivated just giving them some money change and make them demotivated and that doesn't seem to be the case okay and when again doing the qualitative work what people said is we felt valued and again that that money was signaling um value okay the best that's sort of on the intensive margin um i'm going to end with a couple studies that are on the extensive margin which is where a lot of the argument has been you know basically extracting from these lab and some field experiments into uh let's not pay for public service delivery this is a paper by double financing where they they changed the salary of mexican civil servants and found that they got higher quality candidates who were equally pro-social so that was important but you know you know what elizabeth was saying it depends on when you end the evaluation there was no performance evaluation here it was just who applied and who accepted and so um what we did is in in zambia this is with um oriented bandera and ed davenport who's a ph.d student with several of you know at mit and he was a pre-doctoral league um and this the goal was to train so you know like in many countries in the world there are not enough doctors um for 11 million people and 111 doctors i think in all of zambia so the idea is to upskill community health workers and help them serve the needs of the community most of the time community health workers are asked to volunteer and to do it for the speculative community when we talked to the ministry of health they were going to launch this new program of professionalizing the sector and their fear was that once these guys became civil servants that would change their their connection to the community and in particular that would draw in people who wanted you know the career success of being a civil servant and the money associated with it instead of for the right of serving their community so we said great let's test this out together and in the pilot we randomized across 48 districts in the country whether people saw a poster that emphasized the aspects of career so these are both the same job but just a different emphasis on the benefits that you get from the job so on the right hand side is career motives and you know accessing career opportunities becoming kindly skilled and on the left-hand side is the kind of status quo on a certain community and the benefits associated with it everything else remained the same um and then when they were when they applied and were chosen they came on for a year of training at that point they were all told you were part of an important cadre that of civil service you're going to have these career benefits and you're going to be part of this incredible service core so the way you want to think about this is that the selection channel we were able to open that shut down the treatments that channel in terms of the incentives on the job because everybody gets the same job um now the thing i want to mention is that this is not what we would call a light touch even though it looks like it's just a difference of posters but what we're really going to look at when we look at the difference in outcomes is the selection of people who came in and what we find over 18 months so a lot of what these guys do is household visits what you find is that those who were attracted by the career poster do 20 000 more hustle visits over this 18 30 more that's about uh the same kind of change you get when you move to a paper performance incentive scheme on the job but this is coming entirely through who you attract good job but then you would think well household visits maybe they visit like the easiest to reach households or maybe they don't work on the weekends or maybe they there's a whole bunch of other things that they can do or maybe they crowds out other activities that they're supposed to do turns out they do twice as many community mobilization meetings they see as many patients and then we do household surveys and what's interesting is that in the knowledge is actually the same across both treatments but the but the actual practices of um washing your hands and the effects on children's weight and height are much higher in the career treatment so we have this on the policy but i haven't talked a lot about this but given that you guys are all interested in sort of policy discourse as well we had to give results before we had the final results here and because the government wanted to scale up they've done this in the first pilot they want to have five thousand community health workers which poster should you use and um we didn't exactly know but we knew that we were getting really good candidates from the career poster so the first year in fact they just merged the posters together and then once we started getting these results they scaled up with the career poster and now this has become um for the world health organization the best practice for community home workers um what does this tell us the kind of lay intuition that monetary incentives can draw in the wrong kind of people isn't entirely wrong but it's not right either so let me show you how um you can think of two dimensions that you care about in public service delivery we care about people's hearts and how social they are and we care about their heads how competent they are at the job both are important when you have low rewards you attract people who are committed to the cause but also don't have a lot of outside options in terms of the um other things that they can do so it's load talent hyposociality as you add the rewards it's true that it happens that people who are you know not as committed to the cause start coming into your apartment but so do people who are very committed and have half-head and then you know as you increase the material rewards you kind of move up and the thing is what you want is to make sure that you have this person in your pool so what you care about is who shows up in your pool and yes it is true this person will show up in your pool and that's what everyone is scared of but you don't have to choose that person you choose this person and in fact you choose that person because in our case because of the outside options that were there also we're writing another paper about this kind of returns to talent across sectors um it turns out that the highest competent person is also the highest pro-social person because this is a pro-social job and you know just recruiting on the basis of that and drawing in people to come to the african pool that would not have otherwise come leads in this case to 25 lower malnutrition processes so taking this all together i've shown you a few domains in which there's been a kind of two-way dialogue between development and and like i said most of it has been about testing and applying behavioral insights into development and showing that it matters but increasingly we're seeing the dialogue go the other way the hope is to keep that dialogue going and one area that you know it's really close to my heart is is about this idea of exogenous or fixed preferences and you know we didn't get into this but the maternal mortality work really suggests that what initially looked like a very big difference in preferences between husbands and wives for a number of children is actually a difference in beliefs about maternal mortality risk which is much easier to change so really again kind of getting under what is really going on is it preferences or is it beliefs is really important is it preferences or is it tension what are the factors that affect attention um and then thinking about the processes through which if it literally is preferences health preferences become endogenous without functioning the the work that she has with um with others on the choice of preferences we saw some work on kind of the capacity to imagine the future and orianna and i have an agenda on trying to think of altruism unlike what i just showed you not as tight but really as a skill that you build that we call just a capital and but in order to test that we're we're now doing experiments in firms that where we need like 10 years of data and and lots of on the welfare point and all the domains in which they're active
