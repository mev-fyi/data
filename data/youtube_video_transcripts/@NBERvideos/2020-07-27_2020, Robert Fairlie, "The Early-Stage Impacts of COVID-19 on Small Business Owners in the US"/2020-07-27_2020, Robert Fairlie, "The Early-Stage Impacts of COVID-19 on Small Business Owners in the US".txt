rob fairley i'm a professor of economics at the university of california santa cruz and a research associate at the mbr i was really interested in trying to get a handle on what's happening with cobia 19 on small business owners and trying to get some a sense of what the early stage impacts were so i've started some research projects on this issue and just to give you a little bit of background on it if you look around you know the country and also other parts of the world stores factories many other businesses have closed either by policy mandate downward demand shifts health concerns or other factors and one of the things that we don't really know much about right now is what are the early effects of coven 19 through these channels on small businesses and entrepreneurs the problem is that it's hard to find data it's very hard to find timely data on small business owners on business ownership in general or entrepreneurs and so i wanted to look at a project where i answered three questions the first is how large are the early stage impacts of cobin 19 on small business owners the second is were there disproportionate effects on female minority and immigrant business owners and what contributed to the disproportionate effects if there are any so what i tried to do is try to figure out what's the most timely data that i can get on this that within a reasonable amount of time i could get some evidence that was useful and so i've done a lot of research with the current population survey and the current population survey has questions on business ownership in addition to you know what most labor economists work on with it is the unemployment rate and also labor force participation the cps is great they're large samples each monthly survey has about 130 000 people in it it has a very rapid release so the april 2020 micro data covers the week capturing april 15th and was released on may 13th so it's released less than a month after kind of the midpoint of the capture date it captures all business owners so that includes unincorporated business owners incorporated business owners non-employer and employers so all types are included which is very useful and then one of the key things is it includes active business owners so those individuals who are currently running their business and working in that business one thing we don't know is if those are temporary closures or permanent closures and that's something we're not going to know for a while in any case just to give a very rough and quick timeline on what's been happening so march 11th was a key date the world health organization declared covet 19 and pandemic march 16th san francisco bay area was the first to impose shelter in place restrictions that were very extensive march 19th the state of california followed the next day new york state followed and then very quickly a lot of other states followed and by early april most states had some kind of social distancing restrictions in place now if you look at a graph of business ownership over time so here i'm graphing from january 2000 to april 2020 over this period of time you can see business ownership is pretty stable there's certainly some kind of longer term patterns that are slow moving you know even when you look at the great recession over the entire great recession there was only a five percent drop in the number of active owned businesses it really just doesn't change that much and that's because of demand and supply factors kind of cancel each other out but what you see is this dramatic shift downward in april 2020. it's dramatic it's clear it is undoubtedly a break from trend now let's look at it closer so if we look at just any business owner who worked in the survey week we see a 22 drop in april i'm going to compare all the numbers to february the march data has some small effects from what was happening but clearly you know the timeline that i just showed you april was the first month where we saw you know a clear full month of social distancing restrictions so everything i'm going to do is mostly comparing february to april and then i'll show numbers for may and june which are also available now if i condition on working 15 or more hours which is roughly two days a week you see a 28 drop so an even larger drop and then if you condition on working 30 hours or more per week you see an even bigger effect of 31 if you just focus on hours so hours worked among active business owners what you see is almost a 30 drop unincorporated businesses showed a 34 drop from february to april and even incorporated businesses which we tend to think of as more successful more growth oriented uh they also showed a 20 drop in a two-month period again all of these numbers these drops are unprecedented even in the great recession we only saw five percent drop overall and that was over a one and a half year uh you know period of time instead of a two-month period of time now one of the things i was most interested in was how this differs by demographic group what we see when we look at business ownership and the success of businesses is extreme um inequality in terms of outcomes so we typically see that female business ownership rates are are much lower african-american latinx business ownership rates are lower immigrant businesses typically have higher business rates but often lower um you know success rates in terms of you know revenues profits survival rates so here i'm looking at female versus male female business owners did see a disproportionate drop in the number of active business owners the drop of 25 percent compared to 20 for men when we look at this by race major race and ethnic groups what we see is african americans were hit the hardest so 41 of active business owners who were black uh shut down essentially at least temporarily maybe permanently from february to to april so that's unprecedented it's extremely alarming and i'll come back and talk a bit about that number a little bit more later on latinx also experienced a disproportionate impact of 32 percent and asian business owners 26 so all of these were higher than the national average of 22 percent immigrant businesses also took a big hit in business activity over this period of time 36 percent of immigrant business owners were inactive relative to february and you can see comparing that to us born or native there was only an eight percent 18 drop which was still large but in terms of percentage points there was a disproportionate one now this also translates into unemployment because a lot of minority-owned businesses hire co-ethnics and so one of the things that i looked at in another project with ken couch and hunan shu is looked at unemployment rates and what we found is huge increases in unemployment for african americans in latinx over this two-month window also so those two are related you know obviously a lot of jobs that that blacks and latinx have are not in those businesses because they're such a small number but it does have implications and that's another factor that i wanted to talk about later on there were also some interesting patterns by industry some of the industries hit the hardest were personal and laundry services so i found a 79 drop in the number of active businesses over this period of time arts leisure hotels huge drop 35 percent decrease construction was also hit pretty hard 27 drop from february to april number of active business owners now how do these industries affect the racial uh female and immigrant patterns that i showed you before the ones i've highlighted in yellow here are the ones where industry does explain part of what's going on so female business owners their drop from february to april was partly because of the industries that they're concentrated in same for african americans same for latinx and same for asian-owned businesses not so much true though for immigrant businesses so even though they're concentrated in different industries it is turned out to pretty much be a wash from at least from february to april was there a rebound in may and june so as i mentioned earlier the may and june data from the cps are now available i looked at both of those in kind of a separate follow-up paper and what you see is there is a rebound there is a rebound in may and then a continued rebound in june so looking at that graph a little more carefully here this is just the number of active business owners conditioning on any work in the previous week so you see the 22 drop in april the drop from february to mar uh to may is 15 so there was a seven percentage point rebound based on february levels and then another seven percentage point rebound in june so if you look at june relative to february now we're talking about an eight percent drop over that period of time it's true for all demographic groups so you can see the rebound for female for male business owners you can see the rebound for african-american latinx asian one thing that's a little bit hidden here in this graph is that for african-american and latinx there's still both of these groups still have representation that's much lower the rebound was um you know large but still it put them at lower levels relative to february than non-minorities immigrants also saw a rebound over this period of time but again we see disproportion and impacts if you're going to measure the losses from june relative to february overall so what are some of the conclusions from this project that i worked on one thing that i found is there's a large drop in the number of business owners in april there were certainly disproportionate effects on female minority and immigrant businesses this is problematic because each of these groups had levels of business ownership that were lower prior to um to this period of time the loss of 41 percent of active black business owners is especially troubling right this is a group that has low levels of wealth low levels of business ownership to begin with and even if you condition on business ownership less successful businesses there was a partial rebound in may and june for all groups i also found that pretty consistently across industries um most industries also found a rebound one of the issues though that i think is really important here is that there's lost business income in each of these months so even if there is a rebound when you still see you know a 10 15 percentage point drop two months later that's a lot of lost income i'm also measuring this as active business ownership so that conditions on any work activity so if say your business is running because you're active in that business but your revenues could be down 80 percent right that's one thing you can't measure with the cps data is there's no information on income or revenues so something to keep in mind that all of these losses are going to be much bigger when we think of them as income and that's going to translate into longer run inequality as i mentioned before there's also job losses for co-ethnics so there's a fair amount of research showing for example that black owned businesses are more likely to hire african-american employees right those jobs are often in those communities they're local jobs and they're important jobs and you know that's going to have another impact you know this summer we're seeing that kobe cases are going up so we also have to be very careful about that and and i'm not trying to make any kind of judgment on whether or not these rebounds are a good thing or bad thing i'm just trying to be objective and show you know what's actually happening one of the things that is worrisome is the disproportionate impact on different groups especially among african-american businesses the policy response specifically to small businesses losses one of the biggest programs is the ppp loans that the government has spent over 600 billion dollars on obviously the stimulus checks have been important they're not targeted towards small business owners but they've also helped some small business owners stay afloat and then private firms and foundations have have kind of stepped up there have been a number of really interesting ones so for example magic johnson has put money towards black home businesses beyonce even has a new uh you know set of money that she's selling uh a song that she's you know putting the proceeds to to help black owned businesses foundations are stepping up their efforts uh paypal has a new program facebook has a new program out there google also has another commitment to help small businesses it seems to be that almost every new you know every day there's some new company that's coming in and trying to figure out a way to help so that those are all good signs uh there's also been a lot of interest in the senate i noticed that there were at least two or three different senate testimonies that have talked about the numbers that i've just presented that i created from the cps and the numbers have also been used for the by black movement so there's been a lot of interest in shopping at small businesses shopping local so california has a new sort of shop locals shop smart um initiative going on but they're also ones that are specifically targeted towards black owned businesses where there are lists that have been uh kind of you know pushed around on instagram for example showing which black businesses are in your local area and so that's also been a really interesting movement and all of these things have are somewhat unprecedented right there have been smaller movements in the past but there we've never seen anything like this in the past
