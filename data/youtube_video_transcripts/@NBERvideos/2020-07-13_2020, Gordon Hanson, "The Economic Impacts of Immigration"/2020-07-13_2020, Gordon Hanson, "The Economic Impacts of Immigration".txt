have we witnessed the high-water mark for immigration globally and so it's it's it's useful just to take stock and and figure out where exactly we are in the US you have about 15 percent of the population that is foreign-born Canada 22 percent Australia 29 percent you've got Gulf states United Arab Emirates at 88% and then throughout Europe were kind of in the low double digits so we've seen pretty significant increases in immigration over the last 20 years not quite as dramatic as the increase in trade as a share of GDP that Paul showed and we still only have three point three percent of the world's population living in a country other than the one in which they were born but we have witnessed the largest increase in global labor flows in more than a century in the last 20 years so in thinking about what KOed might do first thing I'd like to do is just kind of quickly run through what do we what do we know about what immigration actually does to the global economy and I want to highlight four things here first is that immigration moves labor from low to high productivity countries second within countries immigrants tend to be Footloose and help address spatial misallocation issues third the global mobility of labor allows us to more fully exploit agglomeration economies and fourth something we don't spend nearly enough time talking about is that immigration represents a form of insurance against very severe shocks related to famine pestilence and war the and so we know any model is going to give you quite substantial global welfare gains from from immigration the optimality of immigration of those flows depends very much on what tax systems look like and kovat certainly threatens these gains so just giving you some evidence on each of these mechanisms what do we know about this the impact of immigration on on labor productivity well for the typical country moving from home to say the US you increase income and therefore reflected productivity by somewhere between three and seven times so these that this is a very efficient way of addressing spatial misallocation issues globally a substantial share of those income gains are shared with with members at home if we look at high remitting countries what we see is a bunch of places where remittances are between 10 and 20 percent of GDP what the IMF and the World Bank are forecasting for this year is a reduction in global remittances around 20 percent so if you're a Honduras or an El Salvador this is going to be a very severe shock to your economy third in thinking about spatial misallocation inside countries what is immigration do here I'm citing work by Kadena and Kovac looking at the the excess mobility of immigrants to local labor demand shocks which helps deal with differences in unemployment rates across regions within countries then thinking not just about that what you static gains from immigration in terms of addressing long-run differences in in in labor productivity there's also a sense in which immigration plays a very important role in the global innovation process when we think about innovation a lot of that innovation happens the United States and a lot and immigration plays a central role in that and I want to highlight three features of that first on the worker side if we look at occupations that account for a disproportionate share of the patents produced in the last 20 years what you see is that immigrants are over 40 percent of the labor force when we look at those with advanced degrees and over 20 percent of the labor force when we look at those with just a BA when we then look at the movement of inventors so now narrowing our focus on the individuals who generate patents and where do they go they overwhelmingly go to the United States how do they get here many of them get here by virtue of the education system and what we've seen at the BA level but much more dramatically at the graduate level is substantial increases in the share of foreign students in what we do so at the FIR in in masters granting institutions the foreign-born now account for about 18 percent of students and for PhD granting programs it's 13 percent and for BA programs it's five percent finally something we don't talk enough about in when when considering immigration it plays an important role in allowing individuals to flee violence or other persecution or other very adverse shocks this slide just shows you in the top where homicide rates have peaked in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and in the bottom where did young people leave from who then sought asylum in the United States so as we then you know take stock and and think about well what is kovat gonna do here you know Paul makes a very good point in that that the the impact on the stocks might not be that substantial people are where they are and there's a relatively small number of people who will be forced to return home of that about 3.3 percent of the global population that are where they are relatively a small share would be fourths forced to go home but what I want to highlight is that the disruption in the flows even though that's a small share of the total can have a quite substantial impacts on important parts of the economy in particular when it comes to innovation so think about if you want to imagine it like this that the u.s. innovation ecosystem relies enormous ly on immigration first we we attract students to the United States and we've severely disrupted this not just by the rules that were put in place this week but the US has pulled consular staff out of consulates and embassies worldwide she can't get an interview together these second those graduates then go on to get opt or h-1b visas which you can view as something like a training ground as they as they try out for jobs with US companies the u.s. has essentially shut down the provision of these visas that at least for the time for the time being and then after that period of a tryout phase what do we have is that after being on an h-1b visa that your employer decides to sponsor you for a green card and we have new restrictions that are complicating the process here so what we have is at the current time is is the imposition of a quite severe covent tax on the movement of foreign students foreign workers and business travel and because that those flows are quite central to how these agglomerate 'add areas where innovation happens operate we have the the potential here to disrupt global patterns of industry agglomeration at least when it comes to where innovation happens and this is going to force firms to to think of two strategies one is just to regionalize innovation in the way that they might regionalize supply chains or simply agglomerate elsewhere the u.s. faces competition in terms of where university students might go the the UK Canada and Australia have taken a big bite out of global market shares and are now if the u.s. keeps its restrictions in place are primed to capture a larger share of that higher education a market that matters for innovation and where innovation happens because that's that's the training grounds the tech companies recruit from from those universities to fill out their labor force so I don't know where things are gonna go here and it's and it's way too early in the process to understand we do know that as of right now that Cove attacks on immigration is very large its prohibitive in a number of senses and so as we think about future flows and we think about the hiring process we can get real glommer ation in certain activities that could be quite substantial in terms of the share of the labour force we aren't talking about big numbers but if we're thinking about where productivity gains happen this could be quite important for the US globally you know it's hard to say that this would have a substantial impact on on US welfare but if you're a property owner in the Bay Area or if you're a US tech worker then impacts on your livelihoods could be affected quite substantially so there's a we're set up for a very interesting experiment here depending on how long this this this tax lasts and and how responsive firms are in terms of locating key parts the production chain to that tax
