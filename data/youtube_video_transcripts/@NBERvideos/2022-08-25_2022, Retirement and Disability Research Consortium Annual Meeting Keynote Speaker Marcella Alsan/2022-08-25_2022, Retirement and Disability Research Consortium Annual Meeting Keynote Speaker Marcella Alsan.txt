today we begin with a very special keynote address it's my honor to introduce to you dr marcela alshon professor of public policy at the harvard kennedy school she has the distinction of being both an infectious disease physician and a phd economist she has authored path-breaking research on trust in medical care for example showing how the public disclosure of the tuskegee syphilis experiments in 1972 generated medical mistrust that lowered utilization of medical services by black men in the region reducing their life expectancy almost a decade later her study of physician workforce diversity in oakland california demonstrated how black men were more likely to take up preventive care after meeting with a racially concordant doctor in 2021 she won the macarthur fellowship also known as a genius grant for these and for many other contributions to our understanding of the origins of health inequalities please join me in welcoming dr alshon thank you so much uh nicole for that generous uh introduction can people see my slides okay okay perfect um so it's really an honor to be here i had the opportunity to um view last year's keynote um by valerie wilson and two years ago by ann case both were tremendous uh presentations one on race and ethnic and financial well-being um and then anne talking about dust and despair in the future of capitalism they really set the landscape with important observations and descriptions about how inequality in the united states operates in retirement and in mortality rates so my modest goal is to build on that um i was really struck by something ann said which was uh if you're not at the table you're on the menu and that really dovetailed with some of the work that i've been doing with co-authors trying to flush out our understanding of representation what it means why it matters and today i also wanted to talk a little bit about how it affects the rules and by this i mean the institutional rules institutions like harvard like ssa that determines who gets what okay starting with representation so i'm going to toggle between a couple of different definitions of representation first and foremost i think representation is about accurate description um and it was a little bit of abusive terminology because in this when we're talking about representation in the census we're actually talking about accurate enumeration and this is important for lots of different reasons accurate enumeration is important because we use we all use these data when we're trying to forecast or do demographic simulations and try and understand what the country is going to look like and and years or decades from now for my line of work as an applied microeconomist i'm usually using these same data sorts in a retrospective manner trying to understand the impacts of different programs and policy et cetera they're also hugely important particularly the census for the allocation of resources to the tune of about 1.5 trillion dollars in federal spending um over a decade is attributable to the census enumeration it has a very strong link to representation that's why it is included in the constitution because it allocates congressional seats um and another important aspect though of particularly these surveys that we do that are related to the census is in the absence of having a national health system which we do not have in the united states it's very hard for researchers you can't really just you know tabulate go to this national registry and tabulate things very easily so we're critically reliant on surveys uh to take the pulse and understand where diseases are coming from what their level might be when it's time to count emergencies and uh and also to understand exposures and whatnot and so we're very reliant on things like maps and haines age the health and retirement um study and so on and so forth so much so that the cdc actually developed a survey called pulse to understand the cobin 19 pandemic sort of in the middle of the at the beginning of the pandemic i'm going to talk about representation in a second way representation as it relates to participation and here i mean do you see people that you can relate to in the process and what does that mean for how you view the outcome of that process representation in terms of participation kind of imbues the outcome of that process with a certain legitimacy now legitimacy is often a term we hear apply to sort of political outcomes and whether leaders attained their power authority in a legitimate way but in fact we think this term has much broader purchase and we're going to apply it in a few slides um to the study of the help of health now with respect to you know representation is accurate description or enumeration there's been a lot of being spilled on that here's just a snapshot of some of the recent um press uh articles on the subject talking about either the census or missing criminal justice statistics missing counts of hate crimes against asians and so on and so forth one article that really caught my attention was one from 2015 in the new york times authored by justin wolfers and colleagues where they said that there were 1.5 million missing uh black men now this was a fairly straightforward demographic exercise what they did was they looked across different age groups and calculated sex ratios across different racial and ethnic groups as well and what they found was among the working age population of individuals 25 to 54 for every 100 black women there were only 83 black men and this led them to conclude this with a couple of other bells and whistles led them to conclude that this 1.5 million missing black men number now they um talked about mechanisms being things like the very high disproportionate incarceration rate for black men as well as premature mortality and that's true they brought up you know hiv aids and violence associated deaths um but in addition the urban institute when reviewing that article brought up this other sort of well-known feature which is just that black men are under counted um often in in uh surveys and even in the census so i wanted to kind of turn to that next so this is actually looking across different decades from 1960 to 2010 this is um put together by the urban institute drawing on some work from census itself and uh what we can see is that black individuals uh are in the blue total is in yellow non-black is in uh this black line and overall the underground had been declining over time from 1960 to 2010 but it was still higher uh for black americans and that gap that relative gap has actually been fairly constant um so it's good news in the sense that the undercount seems to be up to the 2010 at least declining but also problematic news in the sense that if we're talking about certain fixed budgets or a fixed budget constraint and allocation of resources among groups unless we actually close that gap we might not expect to see staggering differences in the distribution of scarce resources now that kind of belies some important differences in terms of intersectionality looking across age groups or across gender so in the 2010 census this is still 2010 there was a slight overcount of white individuals by about 0.8 that black out vendor count was 2.1 percent but that was kind of hiding as pretty severe under count of uh black young children zero to four years old and even more severe among black men again kind of overlapping with the wolfers article of 25 um to 54 year old so how did things look in 2020 unfortunately things were quite a bit worse despite the census um its best attempts so the undercount for black americans was lower ranging from in this figure 0.4 to 4.4 percent and unfortunately it was quite a bit lower in states that had some of the highest uh black populations in it particularly in in the south now um it's not just racial and ethnic groups that tend to be under counted um this also we see a relative over count of the individuals that actually own their home or households that are uh owner have ownership status versus those that are renters so the over count was about 0.43 for owners um and then for renters there was an under count of 1.48 a little bit larger than in the 2010 census and then we already looked at this um for children so children are have well established that they're under counted particularly those young children those zero to four year olds um it's about 2.8 in the 2020 census um but of course again as i showed you before that under count tends to be lower for children that are black or hispanic or minority all right so this table kind of summarizes the 2010 and 20 uh 20 census side by side we can see that that over count for non-hispanic white americans kind of doubled from 0.83 to 1.6 black or african american the undercount increased to 3.3 percent on average american indian or alaskan native increased as well particularly for those that were on the reservation um that is generally having a problem there which worsened in this last census but the real sort of headline was hispanic or latino so that under count went from 1.5 increased by 3.5 percentage points to nearly 5 percent in this 2020 census so that um could be because of a lot of the brow beating if you recall around citizenship questions um that occurred and and really seemed to we're not exactly sure the causality there but we really do see a drop-off um in that in that uh in terms of uh that under counting rate so this is the acs now the acs is taking uh uh pla taking the place of the census short form and uh has been deployed uh ever since you know the 2000s or so these are the coverage rates you can see the formula down here but it's essentially asking of all the population that we believe to exist based on prior censuses and vital statistics what fraction is actually in the sample um that we're actually trying to enumerate and what we unfortunately what we tend to see here is the coverage rate particularly again for black americans and hispanic americans that's that red and the orange line have been going down um over time and i actually don't have a good explanation for that fact in particular we also see at the same time that response rates for the acs have been going down we didn't actually include the 2020 response rate because it was just so low it kind of skewed the entire um graphic here these these data points here they seem to be significant outliers were due to government shutdowns and the like um but at the same time that the response rate um are going down we can see that refusal rates are going up um so again it sort of begs the question about who's in the sample and typically the statistical way to deal with these things is to sort of upweight individuals but that's kind of presuming that people who aren't in the sample are similar to those that are in the sample for the acs now census representation again enumeration is particularly important because it affects the accuracy of pretty much all of our other survey data sets so they all inherit their sampling or their weighting from the census itself and these are just some well-known surveys that we all typically use listed here now researchers who are interested in equity are also more and more relying on some of these surveys and this is just one possibly pertinent example here after the ssh discontinued publication of race and ethnicity for you know various legitimate reasons researchers who are interested in how social securities relates to these disparities often have to then go back and link to these surveys to obtain these variables so you can see how errors in the census kind of can then be spilled over and carry on to these surveys and to all the other research that we kind of try and do now as i mentioned this has been something that i've been interested in for um quite some time um this is a project um that i undertook with um the state of minnesota along with a bunch of development economists uh their names uh kind of familiar names listed here who have expertise working with disadvantaged populations in low resource settings and trying to elicit their views so um the context of this survey was in the twin cities this was about maybe five or six months after the murder of george floyd um the state was actually trying to deploy some new testing centers for cobit 19 this was pre-vaccination and really needing to get the views to list the views of those who were most in need so what we ended up doing is working with food shelves or food pantries and in order to see how we could best improve the response rates we did a randomized trial we randomized the types of flyers that went out at the food shelf date level and so in one of these flyers you can see we're really emphasizing and making more salient the role of the state in collecting these data so the state of minnesota wants to know how covet 19 is affecting you and the second flyer we take a more generic tone and this top line here talks about academic researchers trying to understand how people are being affected by uh coca-19 and then we cross-randomize this with the financial monetary incentive in order to complete the survey a low-powered or high-powered we called it 10 or 20 respectively now here are the results overall the response rates were low so overall we only had about eight percent of a response rate but you can see here the researcher framing versus the government framing there was also differential take up across the two um statistically significant different with researcher framing um this is all under the low incentive regime researcher framing getting a little over 11 take-up rates where the government framing only got about five percent uh take-up rates now what happens when we um put in those uh bigger financial incentives they're just doubling it from ten to twenty dollars interestingly we don't see any movement whatsoever in the researcher point but we see this really big responsiveness for government frames so this is um basically five times going from five percent response rate to over 25 percent response rate and the difference between those two is obviously eyeballing it statistically significant so what's going on here so one theory that we had in mind is that maybe people are responding to the researcher frame out of sort of intrinsic motivation to help the researchers etc etc and are fairly inelastic to these incentives whereas um the government frame maybe it's viewed as more transactional giving the government data in this way and so we're able to get you know these higher responses what we're also interested in and why we don't quite have a working paper is because you know actually how you frame and whether you incentivize can also change the nature of the responses you get in really interesting ways and that's what we're exploring um in the current moment but a question that i have taken to adding to my to my experimental work is uh questions about whether people have ever filled out a census i often work with disadvantaged populations and i just find the answers to that question to be fascinating so here from our minnesota field survey we see that overall about 42 percent of our respondents i didn't tell you the sample size it's a little over uh around 500 600 individuals in both of these um and these surveys that i'm showing you here 42 say they've never filled out a census uh form and that is differential across black and white respondents so it's 15 among black respondents and 32 among white respondents and this is an estate by the way just to give you a better broader context which actually does fairly good um in terms of compared to the national average in terms of um responding to uh census forms without needing to have follow-ups and and callbacks etc in a completely different context and an experiment that i i did with sarah akmeier of bocconi where we were trying to improve the take up of flu vaccine shots among men who don't have a college education here we found similarly high rates of people saying that they've actually these men have never filled out um a census form about 34 again higher not quite as large a disparity but across black and white men um in general when you're working with an online platform you're also getting people that at least have access to wi-fi or a smartphone or something like that so that is selected in that way too this was a catch-all question where we just listed a bunch of those surveys that were on the slides you know cps tip etc and again we see about 40 percent say they've never filled out any one of these um surveys so now i just wanted to talk a little bit more again about my own um domain of health and as i mentioned before we don't have a database a national database of health information to query what we have instead are a couple different things one is of course a lot of commercialized data products what are these companies doing they're getting the data for various reasons maybe they're um getting them from health systems in order to ascertain quality metrics maybe they're purchasing themselves and they repackage these and then sell them to resurgence to other in indus interested entities now these data sets inherently have a lot of churn why because the system has a lot of churn employee sponsored insurers you know that you know yourself that your employer can change your plan and there's churn there there's a churn when you take a different job or move to a different state and so it's extremely difficult as someone who's you know as an infectious disease doctor we are very interested in exposure history so it's extremely difficult to put together you know the life cycle of an individual from from in utero to where they might be um when they're entering the workforce and to see all their exposures it also affects what i want to call the geography of research because who can actually purchase these data sets it's not just you know imminent universities sometimes it's imminent scholars within those universities that can actually afford access to these proprietary data sets we might not be getting all those questions asked and answered that we would want um if the data sets were more freely available what do we have well we have medicare and as a naive um undergraduate graduate student i used to think why do people become inherently more interesting when they're 65. so as a physician i think well it's pretty continuous health risk and all of that well clearly it's because that's what researchers have access to they have access to people they get to see people when they turn 65 plus particularly through fee for service medicare but of course as medicare advantage increases you know the fee for surface population is eroding over time and we have the same issue with medicare advantage um you know insurer plans entering and exiting and that same churn where people are always selecting every year what kind of plan that they want there's inertia but there's also entry and exit veterans affairs or tricare those are our other options i was a va physician for a while i love the va system the emr cprs is fantastic uh however it's predominantly male and it also picks up when you know when they enter the service and because we're not drafting anymore you know this is a selected sample of men who are entering military service a selected sample of men who might be continuing on in the va system um etc so national vital statistics those seem to definitely have you know everyone covered births and deaths and whatnot well you probably you might already know this fact but in fact how you um you know how you're recorded how your death is reported really depends on what county uh you're in so for example and this is a figure from the cdc and these green um in these green pla states these are states where they have elected foreigners these are lay officials um and they are the ones who are deciding the cause of death uh in these white you have a mix of foreigners and medical examiners and only in these dark grade you really have a centralized system where a medical examiner a trained medical professional is ascertaining the cause of death um that occurred for the individual and what we can see this is from the earlier days of the epidemic so excess mortality has since increased but this does seem to um you know correlate with how many excess deaths are actually attributed to covet 19 obviously if you're being elected and there's some partisanship involved in determining cause of death we might expect what you die of might differ and of course testing also differs across these locations as well okay well just a note on code 19 i mean i think uh i'm showing you death rates and i'm showing you rate ratios compared to the white population taken from the cdc recapitulated in kaiser and i'm showing you them across race and ethnicity why am i not showing you case data well because of only about two-thirds of case data actually has race and ethnicity why am i not showing you hospitalization rates well because you know as you can see in these notes maryland just temporarily halted transmission of cobia 19 associated hospitalizations which has thrown off their metrics for that so what we have and of course i just showed you that the coroner might determine the cause of death but this is really what we have at least um in terms of completeness uh when trying to assess the the effects of this massive pandemic across race and ethnicity now the unadjusted estimates show that there is a slight disadvantage and maybe uh for african americans relative to whites and a slight possibly advantage for hispanics relative to whites that of course is extremely augmented when we actually flip the sign if you will when once we age adjust why well because both hispanic and african-american populations skew younger for different demographic reasons unfortunately for african-americans it's mostly related to um it's thought to be related to premature mortality and you know i just want to make an analogy with medicine again because there's a recent article in annals of internal medicine which showed that in fact bmi adjusted age-adjusted rates of diabetes it's also known for hypertension tend to emerge earlier in uh in minority populations so this doctor is actually making a plea you know the simplicity of a single screening threshold for all americans is alluring but it's deeply inequitable in light of these facts that we know these disease patterns emerge earlier for various reasons in different groups okay so now let's talk about the second you know represent the idea of representation this notion of legitimacy here i'm going to turn to some recent work um i've been uh uh honored to do along with some co-authors on clinical trials so clinical trials are just the data that we use the evidence base that the fda uses to approve marketing of a new medication in the united states they have to prove safety and efficacy and what we see here and these are data made available by the fda since 2015 the snapshots data is that they are very underrepresented of black individuals so the median share black in these trials is about five percent compared to their population average and this is not even comparing to disease burden which would augment these disparities um and when we look at you know how what what does a successful trial do it leads to a new medication coming to the market here using mets data we can see that this also uh we also can recapitulate some of this disparity when we're looking at the prescription rate for new medications it's much higher for white americans than black americans and that disparity actually increases over the first five years that the drug is on the market so um we wanted to understand these disparities a little bit better we ran two experiments one among primary care physicians and another around patients and in the interest of time i'll just tell you the high level things that we did we randomized we showed physicians eight different drug profile anti-diabetic drug profiles and we randomized both the efficacy of the drugs and how effective it was in reducing your diabetes as well as the share black the representativeness of the sample on which the drug was tested holding everything else constant and we asked them about their prescribing intentions the primary outcome of interest for our patients we did a similar but simpler study we held efficacy completely constant and we just shared changed the representation of the trial so a low representative trial of black americans versus a black participants versus a higher um share of black here's what we found so here's efficacy on the x-axis so higher efficacy means the drug works better as reported in the trial and we broke our physicians into two groups physicians that treat mainly white patients our acronym is pwps given the segregation in the healthcare system and 60 of the population of america is white this is a a large majority of doctors um as well as pvps physicians that see at least some um black patients we can see this nice upward sloping line so the more efficacious the drug is the more the physicians were interested in prescribing it that is uh very reasonable when we look at physicians that treat black patients and show them a non-representative sample we actually see the same slope of a line so doctors are responding the same more efficacious more willingness to prescribe but a level shift down as if they're discounting that information on the non-representative evidence space but this is why i really like this paper because it actually allows us to close some gaps at least in the context of our survey experiment when we showed these same doctors a representative sample we got them prescribing at the same rate as the doctors um the the white doctors on average there was no difference at all um it was almost like it didn't come top of mind uh for the white doctors when they saw these two different samples but we can close gaps with a representative sample for our physicians that treat black patients well we also wanted to pose the same questions to patients doctors are supposed to be agents of the patients and health is a production between doctors and patients and what we see is kind of the exact same phenomenon here we're looking at posteriors on efficacy if you remember we told them the exact same efficacy across the board but this question of this sort of detail if you will of what was a share black in the trial really um widened this chasm between how much these patients thought the drug would work for them between black and white anti-hyper patients with hypertension and we can again close that gap and get them all thinking that that drug is going to be efficacious for them by simply making the um sample more representative so i'm happy to talk about that more in the q a um but i just wanted to say you know that's the context of a experiment what about real life what about real data so here what we're showing is the median percent black and these fda pivotal trials and then on the y-axis we're showing you that prescription rate gap and you know um we see this is different conditions we've called out cancer and hiv aids because you know just a lot of money federal dollars have been spent on those two conditions they also have very robust networks that keep these trials domestic as opposed to offshoring and i want to say that this line is positively sloped meaning of course that the more representative the trial is the lower the gap is between black and white americans in terms of prescription rates and um and and this this is actually robust this line the slope of the line to dropping hiv aids but that's not actually the point the point is that hiv aids is an outlier and it's an outlier for historical and important rule making reasons hiv aids has always had a very strong activist community and the way that the trials are done are such that there has to be a community advisory board sitting on the protocols as the protocols are developed these trials are recruiting more and more and safe much more than in safety net hospitals than in for the cancer network and importantly of course there's the ryan white care act that helps to actually pay for new drugs for individuals um that have no other source so that that just gives me that we actually call this inclusive infrastructure we're not just talking about buildings we're talking about a whole set of rules and protocols that allow hiv aids to close that gap and that brings me to just the final point i'll make here which is rules so rules are important rules like who sits on the protocol who designs it um and where and where the trial is recruiting from and you know if we look at social security and you all are the experts certainly not me but there is this history of rules that you know again excluded agricultural and domestic workers which had a negative impact certainly on black and southern americans this minimum age of 62 you know that is going to disadvantage people that have lower life expectancies i'm sure you all know that at least for their retirement benefits benefits time to earnings it was great to see how the progressive nature of that um uh replacement rate plays a part but it still is the case that the more you earn the more you get the work credit minimum you know what does that do to people that are uncompensated a work of course you know parenting is one of the toughest jobs there is maybe second only to watching your parents die and and fail and help themselves and so you know what are we doing about uh what are we how are we going to make rules that that compensate them 10-year minimum that's going to disqualify individuals who are less tethered to that institution either legally or because of this next point incarceration rates which are incredibly high it's it's a it's a commonplace situation for many communities for the men to to be arrested and incarcerated um at some point in their lives maybe multiple points in their lives um and and so you know i think these are rules that we're making and we want to just think about whether they're increasing um inequality and i think in the interest of time i won't say much more about ssdi except s or ssi i think you're all probably aware of the low end piece safari and cumberland dillinger articles that just raise this question of whether whether we're looking through these rules about who is disabled through a gendered lens given the history of those sorts of um given history of those programs so my final sort of definition of representation you know we've talked about representation as accurate description as enumeration as participation what about representation as leadership who is leading um because that also affects the rules and the rules that affects who gets represented um now i was trained both as an infectious disease clinician where basically we get consulted to do chart biopsies we're always very interested in the history of the patient and by an economic historian claudia golden who always encouraged me to ask these questions you know where did the data come from how are they collected who is missing um and then of course with the rules when were they created who were they serving and how do they impact inequality today and and you know at a minimum are we are we actively contributing recapitulating reproducing some of the inequality that the system already has so last i want to just say one thing which is i've been basically you know speaking poorly about our federalist system one benefit of the federalist system yeah obviously not in data but um but we can get all of these policy experiments here's a great one i'm sure you'll see it presented um if you haven't already showing that fade ham paid family leave can um reduce the disassociation of women from the labor force so that is one benefit of having um having this federalist system that we that we have inherited thank you so much thank you that was absolutely wonderful um so we have we have a few questions and um just just a little bit of time for for some q a um so i'll i'll start with um a question about solutions so um i think you know this this um i i just the the the research you've done is so compelling um about all the various representation um gaps um and i noticed that a lot of that you know another hallmark of your work is that you often touch on potential solutions for um for some of these problems that you identify um we saw that in the clinical trials study i'd love to hear more about that um but what can you tell us about you know where do we go to find solutions how do we know how to fix these problems when we see them yeah i think that's a great question and um and it can get really uh overwhelming and frustrating um but i do think that you know finding those like whether whether you're looking looking for the heterogeneity you know where is the state that's doing well what is the medical condition that's doing well and what are the hallmark features um and i think we all do this intuitively already but just really kind of um digging in and and making it active uh even case studies i mean literally the hiv aids example is a case study um but the fact is that they have instituted these policies you know decades before other conditions and that has led to massive differences in the representation and the prescribing rates and saved you know countless lives among uh black and hispanic and other disadvantaged americans um so i i think that is you know every question that says you know every question that we pose which is like why are things so bad and why why are things not working there's probably another way to pose that is like well where is it working better and um and trying to really unpack that and understand that using when we can you know the econometric tools but if not you know the qualitative social sciences um and and um and narratives as well and is it is it always going to be that we find solutions in the us that's another thing i think what's really interesting when we're thank you yes i mean that's and one of the so one of ann case's points when she was talking was just looking at the productivity of the united states you know with with gd the the per capita health spending on the x axis and life expectancy on the y axis and when you think about all of the health economists we're always writing about productivity in the unit within the united states we're missing like 90 of the possible productivity gains maybe more because and in truth we are the outlier we spend too much we have lower average life expectancy we have the large you know very large disparities um and so um you know and i think you know i think we're getting we're getting to the point where we're also seeing it starting to drag on our innovation for various reasons um but i think you know uh just in the context of clinical trials where does a you know where does pfizer want to test its vaccine it wants to go to a country where it can easily query on the database and and and actually really carefully follow people um so uh something to keep in mind yeah so you you um you mentioned um you know at the beginning of your talk you talked about the um under count problems in surveys and um many of us are are thinking about you know like technical solutions to those problems x post when doing research and i guess question for you is is there any kind of you know statistical solution um to to this fixing this problem in in data or or you know does that not even really exist i mean i can sort of yeah no take it both ways but that's another phenomenal question i'm very pessimistic on the x post waiting i mean i i really i'm not i'm not convinced that the people that are in are similar to the people outside and i think going back um to dr ki chikazee's opening comments or the work of the hiv activists you know you really have to build those community bridges particularly when you're not trying to enumerate everyone when you're doing a survey just by over sampling you're just going to overstamp you're still not going to get the full picture i think we you know i think that's helpful but i think actually trying to understand the community meet people where they are financial incentives i mean i'm an economist tend to work um and and trying to understand you know how that affects quality what questions can be asked and again i actually think speaking of looking across countries looking across disciplines development economists have worked a lot on these issues as well in terms of using social networks the community actually knows a lot about who should be targeted um and things like that so um yeah i think there are uh there's a lot to be done but i'm not convinced that just like a re-weight uh is the answer yeah and so and then last question you know we often um you know and those of us running studies where we have incentives for participation often will get pushback from institutional review boards about the magnitude of the incentives and and so i thought your your contrast of you know kind of the high powered and low power and sentence was very interesting and wondered if it changed you mentioned it might have changed the types of answers you got but did it change who participated yeah that's a i won't have to go back to that particular analysis i think if it's going to and i think winnie um and uh michael greenstone uh at university of chicago also have findings along these lines but if it's changing who participated that's not necessarily a bad thing right maybe in a good way and and actually you know the national again you know we as social as a social scientist had clinic trials randomized trials have just been coming on board in the last you know decade or or maybe two uh recently i was part of a nasa committee national academies of science engineering and medicine committee to look at clinical trials and how to improve representation there and there is a section on financial incentives it says the irb should really be looking at whether this is an ethical study for people to participate in and that is the standard and if it's and if it is not harmful to them or if the benefits out um outweigh them the risks etc etc that is the the margin that they should be assessing things on and there are so many reasons why um financial incentives including targeted financial incentives might actually improve the representation he'll pay for or or in kind transportation food you know given all the structural barriers we know that different communities face yeah well i wish we had more time i think um we could all talk to you all day and continue the conversation but i just like you know thank you so much for for that wonderful keynote lecture and um without without further ado we'll um we'll end and move on to the next panel
