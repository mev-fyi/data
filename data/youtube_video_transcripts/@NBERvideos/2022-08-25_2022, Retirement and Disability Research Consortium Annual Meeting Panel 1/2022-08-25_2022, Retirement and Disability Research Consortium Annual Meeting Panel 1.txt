thank you nicole emma feel free to start sharing your screen while i do brief introductions i am honored to moderate this first panel titled understanding disparities in retirement and disability the first paper titled work and retirement for older black and hispanic adults will be presented by emma aguila at university of southern california the second paper titles structural barriers to receipt of income support and health insurance among adults with disabilities by race and ethnicity will be presented by ellen mehra at harvard university the third paper titled all in the family mothers of children with disabilities and retirement will be presented by molly costanzo at institute for research on poverty and university of wisconsin madison all right emma take it away please good afternoon thank you for the opportunity to present at this meeting in this study we examine retirement determinants for non-hispanic black and hispanic older adults this is a joint paper with siwen lee from the national university of singapore okay so the motivation for this story is that a well older hispanic and non-hispanic black will double and the proportion of older adults will double by 2060. so in 2014 hispanic and non-hispanic black represented 17 of the population 65 years old and older but by 2060 they will represent 40 percent so older non-hispanic black and hispanics are one of the fastest growing population groups in the united states in the figure below we can observe the poverty rate for older adults 65 years old or older and we can see a the poverty rate for non-hispanic white non-hispanic black and hispanic you can observe in this figure that the poverty rate is more than double for non-hispanic black and hispanic older adults so this implies that the increasing proportion of older adults in poverty you know will will increase in the coming years and so it's particularly relevant to analyze the determinants of retirement for lower income population partly of um in terms of like how do we explain poverty in old age so partly it's explained by the increasing income inequality since the 1970s that has particularly affected a older non-hispanic black and hispanics there are also large differences in the by race in terms of the proportion of workers covered by private employer provided pensions so you can see that in this bullet point i have um the proportion of workers that has the lowest coverage is hispanic workers so 38.4 in are not are covered by private employer provided pensions and then there's a higher proportion for non-hispanic black and and an even higher for non-hispanic white workers now it's a worth um highlighting that social security has a very important role because it has a redistributional effect because social security benefits are more equally distributed than pre-retirement income so we focus in this study as i mentioned to anal on analyzing the determinants of retirement for hispanic and non-hispanic black older adults we use in terms of data and the health and retirement study from 1992 to 2018 a b survey and the hrs oversample non-hispanic black and hispanic we link hrs to social security data on lifetime earnings and we also link the hrs to the working trajectories file and that so that we can analyze salary gaps and unemployment spells by race we impute earnings um you know when we require that we don't have that information in the social security data and we do observe that these respondents are working and we also apply different life expectancies or survival probabilities by race and gender to compute the expected net present value of social security benefits we include in this story a respondents 50 to 80 years old i just would like to show you briefly some of the descriptive statistics of the sample in our story in the first column we have um non-hispanic white in the second column of hispanic black and in the third column hispanic and we have some of the variables used in the study you can see that the average years of education is lower for hispanic than for non-hispanic black and non-hispanic white real net wealth and you can observe the large differences among the three racial groups so we see here that a real net wealth for non-hispanic white is 3.5 times higher than for non-hispanic black and 2.9 times higher than for hispanics in terms of um contributions to private employer pensions you can see in this last row highlighted that there is a higher proportion of hispanics that report not having contributed to private employer pensions employer provided pensions so it's about 50 for hispanics and about the third poor non-hispanic black and for non-hispanic white in terms of um the results or like the estimates that we have in our study in this figure i'm showing you the earnings for the 50th percentile and so we have us dollars in the vertical axis and in the horizontal axis and the age of respondents the gray solid line is for non-hispanic whites the black dashed line is for non-hispanic blacks and the gray dashed line is for hispanics so you can observe that between age 60 and 70 for the most part median earnings are higher for non-hispanic white we observed here maybe that um they are closer in the the median earnings for non-hispanic black and not hispanic white we have a little bit less precision for ages 60 years old or older for non-hispanic black and hispanic because we have a smaller sample size so this this is consistent to what previous studies have found in the literature in this figure i showed the source the social security wealth that we computed for um the 50th percentile so for the median again the gray solid line is for non-hispanic whites and the a black dashed line is for non-hispanic plaques and the gray dash line for hispanics we have um usolars in the vertical axis and in the horizontal axis we have the age of the respondent and so you can see here that a social security wealth for non-hispanic whites is higher than for non-hispanic blacks and we observed that a social security wealth for hispanics is for the most part um higher than for non-hispanic whites and non-hispanic blacks we have a slight overestimation of social security wealth for hispanics that we're now revising um and this is because well as we introduce different life expectancies by race and gender so hispanics have higher life expectancy and also hispanics are more a more heterogeneous group that includes a larger proportion of foreign-born a population or immigrants that may have different so we include all of them together so they may have different trends in social security wealth and we also are pulling in this study in the results i'm showing so far we're putting 26 years of data so we include different cohorts that have different lifetime earnings so um we're now working on presenting the results for different cohorts and we're also incorporating um new methods on how to project future salary caps or unemployment spells by race and using the working trajectories files so when we introduce those um salary caps or unemployment spells we do we observe a reduction in the gap between the social security wealth of hispanics and all hispanic whites even flipping and having a obtaining a higher social security wealth for non-hispanic whites than for hispanics that it's consistent with previous literature but the takeaway of this figure is that social security wealth is um quite similar among the three racial groups and this can be explained by the redistributive components of the social security formula in this figure um i show the replacement rates for the 50th percentile so um again we have in the vertical axis we have the percent so from 0 to 100 and in the horizontal axis the age of the respondents the the gray solid line is pronounced hispanic whites the black dash line for non-hispanic plaques and the gray dash line for hispanics so you can see that for the most part the replacement rate is higher for non-hispanic blacks and hispanics and than for non-hispanic whites and this in this makes sense because they have no hispanic black and hispanic have lower earnings and higher social security wealth therefore their replacement rate is higher the definition of the replacement rate is the monthly social security income divided by the monthly salary income before retirement two minutes summer yes so um the finding so far is that medium earnings are higher for non-hispanic white and than non-hispanic black and hispanic and social security wealth is uh more similarly distributed among the population replacement rates are higher for non-hispanic black and non-hispanic white and a we have a larger proportion of hispanics that have not contributed to private anterior provided pensions so um and just briefly to mention uh almost um i have two slides more um when we run the regression analysis all the determinants of retirement non-hispanic black hispanic and non-hispanic white they all respond similarly to institutional drivers of retirement that is to social security private employer provided pensions and health insurance however it's worth noting that in our results non-hispanic black and hispanic are less responsive to some socio-demographic characteristics so non-hispanic black to gender marital status and number of household residents and hispanic are less responsive to gender education and marital status than non-hispanic ones so just to mention briefly the police implications of this study so far are that um social security benefits have been shown in previous studies they are a large proportion of the retirement income for non-hispanic black and hispanic example non-hispanic white so it's important to highlight that any changes in the social security u.s social security system will affect the labor force participation retirement decisions and overall well-being of non-hispanic black and hispanic and in general lower income population thank you thank you emma that was perfect next up we have alan mera okay so let me stop sharing thank you so much can everybody see these well all right um i just want to thank ssa for funding this i want to thank folks at nbr for organizing and my colleagues at harvard david cutler and marie mcgay who's a terrific phd student and also our collaborator from bowie state rand obidat who's also been terrific so our starting point is something that will be familiar to this group which is ssdi so this is looking at determinants of disability ssdi applications and awards peaked around 2010 and they've been coming down quite a bit since and in fact awards are down to levels we haven't seen in 20 years and we also know that there's a lot of structural things changing in the backgrounds in different parts that can affect the application process as well as the disability determination process um this wonderful work from dash pandey and lee looks in a lot of detail at field office closings which really there are quite a few of them in in this 2010 to 2014 period as you see on the left um and and that work suggests that not only did applications fall in areas affected by those closings but awards fell by more um suggesting that because of the office closures maybe the targeting going that we hope this program you know can achieve was was suffering because of those closed offices um and on the right i have a figure that we created based on favorable determination rates at the initial level so these are taking place at the disability determination service level and you see this is also falling over time so we have these structural changes i'm going to say more about that in a minute but we have these structural changes going on um related to things like office closures we have other things going on at the hearing level and above that is also there's been a you know an effort at policy consistency that has also reduced the uh allowance rates at the hearing level and above but we have little data on how these declining award rates may affect different groups and of course as you all heard i was super excited to see the new data so thank you dr kuchikaze but uh as you heard a lack of race and ethnicity data at ssa sort of hinders our ability to look at some of these things so this is what's motivating us and this is really ongoing work we're actually working to get into some restricted use um data sets that and we're not there yet but um but we think we can make a little progress uh in in what we have available at this point so we're gonna ask two things how have applications uh favorable determination rates and disability receipt changed over time and across areas because we were just wondering you know one way to sort of target your efforts to understand equity might be to understand are there particular places that are experiencing this more than others and then second using two publicly available surveys we're going to ask some questions about how population rates of applying for and receiving federal disability benefits have changed over time by race and ethnicity um and so let me start this first figure is really going to summarize this is just based on um public data overall and and we're looking at different parts in the disability the review of disability application so when you submit your application of course the first thing it goes through is this technical review and so just to make all of these things you know look the same where higher is you're more likely to be awarded benefits and lower is less likely we've presented this top line here with the with the hollow circles this is the rate of applications meeting tech technical renew review that is what percent of applications will go on after the technical review that says you know look are you eligible for the program do you have enough quarters or your income levels you know in um in the right ranges and you see a pretty remarkable first an abrupt but then a steady decline in the percent of applications meeting that technical review um and and then we've got sort of the allowance rate so this is the rate of the applications that proceed to get a medical decision what percent of them will actually uh receive an allowance so this is really summarizing a number of processes and we're also showing here the hearing level and above allowance rate which we know due to these well-known efforts to increase consistency um really declined quite a bit and particularly in these years you know it looks like starting around 2008 and then in the next several years and so when you kind of combine all those things together the award rate the percent of applications that make it through looks quite different on the eve of the pandemic than it did around the year 2000 used to have about a half of applications would get through eventually and we're getting closer to about 30 so that looks quite different and so what we wanted to do next was to say a little bit about this cross area differences and and we thought we'd start out with these initial determinations that are happening at the disability determination service and so this is a combination of initial and reconsiderations that happen at those offices because that's where a lot of the medical decisions occur and and so we looked across states and we just asked how is that variation changing over time and what you see is that things are becoming more consistent over time so there was more variation across states that's fallen quite a bit from about point the standard deviation in these favorable determination rates was as high as 0.08 and it's fallen to about five percent over time another way to look at that is to actually compare favorable determination rates in a state in 2010 which i'm showing you on this horizontal axis to favorable determination rates in 2016 which i'm showing you on the um vertical axis so this red line this is the 45 degree line if you're falling along this line you didn't really see much change in your likelihood of getting a favorable determination in that state and so what you notice and there's there's not much happening above the line there's not many places increasing the favorable determination rates but you see a number of states particularly some large states new york new jersey texas and then dc and hawaii as as outliers as is seeing a big decline in favorable determination rates over time and they have moderately high favorable determination rates to begin with and so in in this piece of it we see the share of decisions with favorable determinations falling the state variation is um falling quite a bit by about a third and we know that other administrative changes have lowered rates of favorable decisions at other levels so the rest of the talk is just showing a few things that we can learn from publicly available surveys where we can look at respondents identified race and ethnicity and link that and so the first figure i want to show you this is available from the public use medicare current beneficiary survey so these folks and it's limiting to people under the age of 65 and so by definition everyone responding to this survey is in um the medicare program and in that under age 65 virtually all those folks are on it due to ssdi receipt and and so it's it's a great source of trying to learn about this because that program is really a universe of ssdi recipients now here is a survey we don't have everyone and what we did here is we said let's take the weighted estimates of who's in the ncbs each year according to their self-identified race and ethnicity and let's divide that by the adult population 18 to 64 in each year and this gives us a population sort of rate estimate of what's happening by these different groups and two things really struck us right away in this figure you know as while you see that you know white non-hispanic rates are kind of steady around four-ish percent of that working age population you see a decline among black non-hispanic um adults and you see an even more marked decline among folks reporting hispanic ethnicity um so that that was quite striking and in the public use you don't have a lot of details so we wanted to go to a survey that gave more detail to understand what um some of the factors going into it so we went to the national health interview survey and just so you can kind of you know have the context in mind what do they ask they ask folks do you have a work limitation whether it's physical mental or emotional problem so do you have it right now and does it limit your ability to work they ask if you've ever applied for ssi or ssdi so that's helpful but it's ever so we don't really know when and then they ask if you're receiving income from social security and is that for disability if you say yes they ask if it's for disability but we're going to limit to everyone under the age of 65 so so if they're getting it they're getting it for two minutes l ability so so what do we find when we do that and and what i'm going to show you the pictures in the interest of time when we do that we find that um reported work limitations are actually quite steady over this period we show these and these are adjusting for age and sex so we have um taken out five year age groups separate and and we have those separately by sex so you see work limitations are pretty steady until late in the period and they're kind of going up for everyone non-hispanic blacks in particular non-hispanic asians non-hispanic whites so the so the reports of work limitations are not changing too much until the end of the period but applications are rising quite a bit relative to 1999 and particularly for non-hispanic black and non-hispanic white individuals they're up by about five percent and then how does that translate into ssdi receipt per capita we see that receipt is up by about one and a half to two percent for non-hispanic black and non-hispanic white folks who are again reporting higher rates of application although not necessarily higher rates of limitations relative to to other groups and then the final thing we did this is a bit messy but the answer the takeaway i would get is is it's relatively steady over time the percent of people who told us they applied who then got ssdi later is actually fairly steady across the groups and so you know where do we end up with all of those figures well we know that ssdi allowance rates are falling over time it all basically at every level it's harder for your application to get through um a smaller percent are getting through and and some of the administrative changes have brought more uniform determination um rates across states but we know less about how that's playing out for workers and i guess we you know we're really struck by despite steady reported work limitations the actual receipt of ssdi by hispanic workers you know judging from the mcbs seems to be falling over time but when we try to connect that back to if you submit an application are there differences across groups that doesn't seem to be going on so so it may have more to do with who's applying and how it links back to their particular circumstances so we think all of these are really rich areas um for for future work to try and understand how to better target the program and help folks get the the help they need thank you ellen so next up we have molly costanzo thanks so much um i am excited to be here today among so many old and new friends um and i want to acknowledge some my coworkers co-authors on this uh work with lisa klein vogel a wonderful colleague at institute research on poverty and two great phd students victoria kenoki and social work and hannah han in the department of economics thank you so much to social security for funding also everything i say here is my view and not those of not that of ssa or the university of wisconsin um and as you'll hear we talk to families so we also want to send a big thanks to to families for participating in our study um so in this panel focused on disparities uh in retirement and disability we are interested in understanding potential disparities in retirement for one specific population that we don't know much about in terms of the retirement context and that is mothers of children with disabilities so um we might be concerned about retirement equity for these families because we know that they face greater constraints in work and savings during their prime labor market years which is going to influence the resources available to them uh as they enter retirement and then also into their retirement years right they have this unique um set of constraints uh and probably greater financial needs for resources and steeper caregiving responsibilities um than we might expect other families to have right so um there's sort of this the sense that these families might have some unique constraints when they're in thinking about retirement at the same time there's a variety of social security benefits that have the potential to provide economic security for these families so retirement benefits for mothers disability benefits for children ssi payments and family benefits um such as the disabled adult child benefit so in this study we're really interested in understanding uh what what we see so there so we're going to look broadly in differences in what i'll think of as objective retirement measures of planning savings and timing for mothers of children with disabilities compared to mothers of typically developing children and then we really want to dig into the nuance of how mothers are thinking about retirement and then finally given the potential for sfsa benefits what is the role of ssa benefits in families planning how are they thinking about those so this area is pretty there's not we don't know a lot there's not a lot in literature so we're using uh this is a fancy word and then these lots of words to describe our method which is an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach all that means is that we're going to go to available data sources some available national survey data to kind of get the lay of the land of broad brush strokes about what we can find about this area then we're going to use that information to um talk to to do some qualitative collection and analysis and we're going to put these things together really to get a more nuanced understanding of mother's experiences both in terms of breadth and depth so what are we doing for our quantitative piece we are using uh publicly available national survey data from the national longitudinal survey of youth in 1979 where we're linking mothers um in the nlsy 79 to their children in the child and young adult samples so this is like one of the few publicly available data sets that allows us to understand children and then mother's outcomes as well we have outcomes on mothers through 2018 so the mothers are sort of just on the cusp of retirement um at that at that time um so and we have uh sort of broad measures of of retirement behavior um our analysis is nothing fancy we're basically doing a little bit of work to make mothers of children with disabilities more comparable on different measures to mothers of uh typically developing children and then we're doing some descriptive work we're going to use that analysis uh to inform our qualitative work and for that we interviewed 12 mothers um they were all 45 years or older this was a requirement for our sample um had at least one child with a disability who they were providing a minimum of 10 hours of care for per month we conducted semi-structured interviews meaning we had an interview guide and we asked them all the same questions the interviews lasted for about 60 minutes and we then coded what they said in terms of themes so what do we find in our first our first bullet right was there there was about sort of looking at broad differences in patterns of retirement outcomes and for that we're going to really rely on our quantitative data um here i'm showing you just a graph we want to sort of understand employment trajectories since that's going to inform the the context of retirement and as with previous literature we find that mothers of children with disabilities are um working in lower proportions um even across sort of different trajectories of of their child's life especially for mothers who tell us that they have significant caregiving responsibilities despite these differences in employment we don't find any differences or at least statistically significant differences in these objective measures of retirement behavior so no differences in savings withdrawal planned retirement age the age they think they'll receive ssa benefits whether they'll be working at age 65 um we do find that um mothers of children with significant caregiving responsibilities those that have been working are less likely to say in the 2018 wave of the survey that they are retired um than the rest of the sample so maybe continuing to work longer if they um have been working so what can we take from that does that mean that um there are differences in retirement behaviors for mothers of children with disabilities um or does this really kind of reflect what we're measuring and that maybe we're not measuring it that well right um so for that we go to interviews with our mothers and we hear from others that in fact um they feel that parenting child with disability has really sort of influenced um their retirement behaviors and and and choices and i'll put those in quotes um so we heard from mothers that caregiving responsibility is really limited how much they were able to work the types of jobs that they had many chose flexibility over payer advancement right so that's going to influence sort of what that means as they enter retirement mothers some others told us that they were going to be working longer than they might otherwise have to save for retirement others had to leave the labor market early to for caregiving responsibilities um as one mother told us at one point he had over 20 different doctors juggling appointments juggling surgery complications routine tests all the time there was just would be no way i can't work there's just too much to be taken care of right so we do hear from mothers right that they feel that this is an important piece of their retirement uh outcomes even if we are not seeing that in our data um our quantitative data so this really also bleeds into our second question which is how are mothers thinking about retirement and we heard from others that our retirement plans really changed since having a child with a disability um and that was particularly due to what the financial needs of their children and uncertainty around those financial needs i'll say um in terms of like the retirement decision you know like other households they uh things that sort of played a role where their spouses retirement um household financial circumstances and then maybe more unlike other households i'll say um caregiving and what that was going to look like in future years and their child's living situation um and um again there's all we heard a lot of uncertainty about that and so that sort of played into how they were thinking about retirement um so one mother told us i think i need to be earning up until age 72 to make sure that i have enough set aside for my daughter i don't consider my needs to be primary i consider her to be primary i've always thought everything i'm putting to the pot is 50 mine 50 hers right so really this idea that for mothers of children with disabilities right retirement thinking about how to set up their children for financial success is perhaps top of mind we do have one measure in the nlsy of how people define retirement and the one thing i want to highlight here is that mothers with significant caregiving responsibilities are say in higher proportions that they're more likely to have to continue to work out of necessity into retirement um so what does that mean for ssa benefits i uh that's sort of our the third question um that we have set up and i don't have a slide about this but the 2018 nlsy contains measures of whether people say that they're receiving retirement benefits and we see that in our sample mothers of children with disabilities and particularly those with caregiving responsibilities are say that they're receiving retirement benefits and higher proportions than other mothers and this is likely early retirement benefits given the age of the sample our qualitative data interviews with mothers provide us some more context here however um mothers in our sample said that they figured ssa benefits into their retirement planning but they did not expect to rely on them um and i think mothers sort of grouped all ssa benefits together so their own and their children's right like they sort of talked about this as one thing two minutes molly thank you many most plan to draw on employer or investment based retirement sources um so one mother told us and this was pretty similar to what we heard ssa benefits are part of the picture but they are not the picture we're not relying on those benefits but one thing that i want to highlight here is that the mothers that we talked to were a really advantaged sample in a lot of ways so racially homogenous non-hispanic white mothers uh with a median household income around 125 000 right so that's that's and living in a resource rich community so that really is going to play a role into you know sort of how ssa benefits might impact them and and their resources that are available so that really also tells us that it's important to understand the economic well-being of more diverse samples that we heard from this very advantage sample that they felt that they had significant financial concerns about retirement you know that sort of suggests that understanding the experiences of families with significant uh other barriers uh is is going to be really important to understand um finally um what does this mean for policy so you know i think this underscored for us sort of the general their general supports for caregiving for all families and that those can be very important for for families of children with disabilities um as well as well as sort of taking into consideration the specific unique needs and constraints for this population so and this is sort of throughout the child's life right and so maybe this looks like um adapting current broad policies and supports to make sure that it's meeting the needs of these families you know different different formulas or eligibility or or whatever that might be um and finally in terms of ssa policy and benefits uh you know we heard from mothers right that they in our interviews that they weren't really planning on relying on these benefits and maybe they weren't totally sure what they were so that combined with our survey data which suggests that mothers might be combining both early retirement benefits and employment suggests that doing some targeted outreach to families to help them understand what ssa benefits they're eligible for and sort of any constraints in terms those earning limits might be important thank you
