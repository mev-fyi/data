good morning and welcome uh i'm jim paterba and on behalf of the nber i'd like to welcome you all to this meeting on the labor market after the great recession uh it has been an extraordinary four years since the turning point that marked the beginning of this recovery if you turn back the clock and think about the discussion that many of us were engaged in four years ago there were questions about whether we were in a sharp v with a very steep decline during the recession that would be followed by a very rapid period of recovery and it is now clear for four years after the fact that v was the wrong letter l was closer to the mark particularly with respect to the labor market and that we've experienced a period of truly historic uh developments within the within the u.s labor market that of course was the motivation for a research project on recent developments in u.s labor markets the statistics that motivate this project and thinking about these questions of course are known to all of you uh employment at the low point of the of the downturn was about six percent lower uh than before we started into the recession in late 2007. uh even today uh four years on we've had unemployment rate of 7.6 percent the employment to population ratio in the u.s has fallen strikingly by nearly four percentage points uh since the period five years ago uh long-term unemployment uh is at historic highs uh the numbers that i saw uh suggest that the there are about 4.4 million workers today who've been unemployed for more than six months uh that represents about 37 percent of the unemployed one looks back historically uh there were never periods we got above about 25 or 26 so so things have been different in the u.s labor market in the last four years and it's consequently an exciting time to be studying these developments and trying to understand what the implications are for thinking about policy if one casts back the clock further and compares the recovery that we are currently in with those in past years one of the great challenges in contrasting labor market developments and output developments is that we seem to have much slower labor market recovery than we did in say the 1970s or 1980s and what used to be a pattern that looked much closer to a v seems to have changed into something which looks much closer to an l and this recovery is not all that much different in terms of job growth from what one saw for example in 2001 so the set of questions that one tries to understand i think with regard to labor markets and the the current recovery are why is it different this time in what dimensions is it different this time and have we entered a new period in terms of business cycle developments that suggest a different dynamic plays out as one moves through the the recession and into the recovery period uh if you think about the major issues that have emerged as labor economists macro economists public policy makers have have struggled with these with these issues in the last few years sectoral shifts the extent to which the rapid run up in unemployment could be attributed to a shift in the patterns of demand across sectors in the u.s economy versus traditional sort of you know keynesian style demand-based unemployment the degree to which changes in the social safety net explain the long periods of unemployment we were seeing and to which to the extent to which supply side aspects of the labor market were playing a role as opposed to demand side from the firms looking for looking for workers the differential developments in the private sector the public sector substantial declines of course in public sector employment in the last few years in a period when the private sector has at least recently begun to hire at a more substantial rate so all different pieces that fit together to understanding where we are with that as a backdrop uh i was very grateful when david card of princeton of berkeley and alex moss of princeton uh agreed to david occasionally of princeton currently at berkeley uh when uh when david and alex agreed to take the lead in organizing a major research project uh that was going to look at the developments in the labor market uh since the since the onset of the of the great recession uh several weeks ago in cambridge we organized a research meeting at which there were 13 different research papers 47 economists gathered to talk about their findings and with the support of the alfred p sloan foundation which has graciously underwritten this project we not only were able to support the the research projects on on these various topics but to come here to washington to try to better communicate and talk about some of these findings so that we could enable the the public policy community to learn better uh about what we are doing i was particularly grateful to to our three moderators this morning uh david david wessel catherine rampell and greg ip all of whom are amongst the leading authors in the journalist cadre on thinking about labor markets in the macro economy and all of whom will help to to lead our discussions as we proceed this morning uh what we've done is to pull together a group of researchers and uh folks with public policy expertise to address the core issues that uh that that the broader economics and public policy community has been tackling with regard to labor markets over the course of the last uh the last four years and this morning's conversation's all on the record uh i would just remind everybody of that as we start we also have a video which we'll eventually post on the on the nber website uh but this is an opportunity for us to share the findings in an open dialogue setting uh to bring others who were not part of the research project but could also share their views on what's been developing in the labor market and to talk about the various issues that are on the table as we go forward the unresolved questions that we need to understand the lessons of the last four years and of course what the implications are as we think about public policy uh the nber by charter which was it was it was founded actually around a set of issues in labor economics two of the nber's founders uh had met they were a senior corporate vice president at att and a marxist labor economist trained at columbia in the 1910s they met on governor's commissions in new york talking about things like should there be a minimum wage and should there be a maximum hours constraint they had different views about the answers to those questions but both realized there was no data to speak to those issues and that led to the foundation of the nber and the creation of a data generation organization uh they wrote into the charter that there wouldn't be any policy recommendations in nver publications but that doesn't mean that we can't discuss issues that are highly relevant for policy and of course that's what we'll be doing uh this morning the the day is the morning is broken basically into three different panels uh the first we'll talk about productivity and sectoral shifts questions that of course emerged right after the downturn as the as the question where did this very high and very steep increase in unemployment come from uh were discussed the second focus is on the changing role of the social safety net and then the last talks about the social cost of unemployment and the issues that we've uh that we've been experiencing uh the first moderator was david wessel and the panelists in the first uh in the first session are my uh my mit colleague and now the chief economist of the imf olivier blanchard uh john haldewanger of the university of maryland one of the people who is well known to all of you as a an expert on the on the dynamics of gross flows in the u.s labor market uh eddie lazier uh leading expert on what goes on inside firms thinking about personnel markets and of course the former chairman of the council of economic advisors and justin wolfers from the university of michigan who while we don't think is here yet we have launched the panel in the hope that we will see him before the end so just in time we hope so so with that i'm going to turn things over to david we'll take it away thank you all for joining us you can see what my role here is um so uh uh john and eddie have are going to make presentations and then olivier is going to respond and then perturber is going to do is justin wolfer's invitation if justin doesn't show up uh so john do you want to sir thank you okay so my remarks today are are based upon uh this this work we've done for this project and it's uh collaborative work with uh lucia foster and cheryl graham who are both here um and so so the so what we went to look at was the nature of reallocation dynamics in the great recession in particular but we want to do as jim was talking about put it in perspective for from earlier periods so we know many of us have been studying uh these reallocation dynamics for some time and we know the us is characterized by a high pace of of job creation and destruction uh and indeed uh this first figure shows uh two series one from the census bureau that's on the left uh one from the bls equal time here on the right uh both series have advantages and disadvantages the census series goes back to the early 1980s uh its annual uh the bls series is quarterly and and somewhat more timely so the so the first thing uh hopefully you see and again well known is the us is it does actually have a very high pace of job creation and destruction so so if you look at the annual rates they're in the 15 to 18 percent kind of rate uh in terms of creation and destruction the quarterly rates are in the seven to eight eight percent uh uh range another thing that many of us have have worked on is that this this very high pace of creative destruction the us economy uh is is productivity enhancing and that'll that'll be a theme um uh as we go as we go through uh the results now our focus here is what what happens to these reallocation dynamics um over the business cycle uh historically by historically i mean in terms of what we know from uh uh the data uh before the great recession uh a number of us have found that what what happens in recessions is that is there's a there's an increased intensity of reallocation that occurs during recessions and it occurs in a particular kind of way so let me describe that what we've what we've seen in in past recessions and you can see this in this figure is that in recessions we see a sharp rise in job destruction and and a relatively um a smaller decline in in in job creation so uh a simple concept job reallocation we've got justin here come on justin join us up here um uh we've got uh job reallocation rising uh uh as a result of that because job relocation is just the sum of of creation um and destruction and and to the extent that this reallocation have already hinted that we think we know and i'll give you some evidence of this that this reallocation is productivity enhancing uh what this says is that recessions are a time in which this uh productivity-enhancing relocation accelerates some right because if indeed the destruction is is uh is um uh shutting down and contraction of lower productivity businesses then indeed we've accelerated that process and to the extent that creation didn't fall uh completely symmetrically that means at least some of that uh resulted in moving resources away from less productive uh to more productive businesses so that's what we thought we knew um before the great recession so even in this figure i know it's pretty small and and so on hopefully you're going to see it i'm going to make it easier for you in just a second um things look different in the in in the great recession what happened in the great recession job creation took a really big hit a much bigger hit uh than than in any of the recessions that we've seen uh uh before job destruction rose job destruction patterns actually look kind of similar to to previous um uh recessions so if you if i just showed you the job destruction figure you'd actually think that the the the great recession was kind of like the 1982-1983 recession so so sharp rise in job destruction uh so lots of lots of layoffs lots of job structure but but this came back came down pretty quickly indeed job destruction is below uh pre-recession levels you can see that clearly in the in the bed uh so what's what what hasn't happened well job creation uh took a really big hit and has not recovered so so to help us with this a little bit uh in terms of sort of the differences between uh the reallocation dynamics here i'm just showing us a simple calculation we made which is what fraction of the net declines that occur in recessions is accounted for by uh job creation before the great recession what we saw is this number is well below 0.5 so what that again is just repeating what i said earlier it says that in in in-net contractions what we see is destruction is the primary margin not so much creation but in the in the great recession that that changed dramatically so indeed what you sort of see is actually well over 50 is accounted for by the by the decline in creation now now to push a a little bit harder on this is what kind of businesses uh took took an especially large hit in terms of the decline in job creation in in the great recession it was young businesses and so uh what we sort of see again kind of a kind of a mean uh first set of points in our paper is we see a change in the nature of reallocation in in the great recession it was especially uh a large decline in job creation and especially large decline in the job creation for young businesses right so now we want to go turn uh to productivity so do we see something different in the nature of the connection between productivity and reallocation uh in the great recession and the answer is yes we do so uh so so here i've got a very simple chart and let me walk you through each of the each of the bars so the bar on the far left is you call i'll call it normal times that is it's a time in which there's we're not expanding or contracting and we're just characterizing in the cross section the relationship between productivity and reallocation and what do i mean by that well what we see here that you can see here that the it's it's the growth rate differential between businesses that are one standard deviation above mean productivity within an industry and one standard deviation below and you can see that that's a pretty substantial differential it's about 10 so that says year in year out what's going on in the us economy is we're moving resources away from less productive to more productive businesses that's evidenced in terms of this difference in uh in in the growth rates across high productivity and loaded productivity businesses in in prior recessions what we found is that this productivity enhancing relocation uh actually became even more productivity enhancing the more severe the contraction the way you can see that in in the next two blue bars is indeed as we're using by the way state level data here to achieve identification um what one sees is uh that the reallocation that the difference between uh a high productivity and low productivity businesses actually increases the sharper the contraction but when we turn to the great recession that flips on its head uh instead of uh the the the the difference uh increasing as the contraction becomes more sharp it actually decreases now now to be fair i don't i don't want anybody to to go away thinking oh that the recession was actually a time in which we were actually moving resources away from high productivity to low productivity businesses that gap that gap on the far right is still quite positive all right but it's but it is the case instead of the the reallocation becoming more productivity enhancing it becomes less productivity enhancing this is tied to theories uh that that the many economists have talked about which is that is it recessions may be a time of a form of cleansing in the economy and when you hear that term cleansing this is not a statement that recessions are a good thing okay i certainly don't want to be on record for that but the conditional on a recession occurring maybe it accelerates the kind of reallocation dynamics that hit that is productivity enhancing in the united suggests that in the st that was true but that's not true uh in in the great recession last slide and then i'll try to bring this home in terms of what what do i think this all all means and how to put it pretty much perspective for the kind of things that jim was talking about we find that that these effects that i'm talking about are dominated by young firms that indeed there's an especially large differential in the growth rates between high productivity and low productivity young firms those effects those marginal effects are especially impacted uh by the great recession so so let me let me try to summarize what i think this evidence plus some closely related evidence suggests that was different about uh about the great recession so in the united states we benefit substantially by having a a highly dynamic highly flexible economy uh and what we found in the past uh is that is while recessions are tough obviously um those reallocation dynamics actually becomes uh somewhat more intense and and and we get we get a a productivity uh uh gain out of that in in the great recession we didn't see that we saw a lower intensity of reallocation we actually saw it instead of becoming more cleansing it became less cleansing now one what i talked about is much about sort of the what of what happened so what so why why is this happened well i think the biggest hint in our work is is the effects on young firms we have found that that indeed young firms got hit especially hard in the great recession and it was especially on the young firm to mention that we saw this this less uh less intense reallocation but but also we saw this less cleansing uh relocation let me talk a little bit more last remark about about young firms so one of the things i didn't talk about in the first slide actually i intended to um is i talked about the the overall pace of reallocation and i talked about the cyclical dynamics um many of us have noticed there's a declining trend in the pace of reallocation so the u.s is becoming less dynamic over time do we fully understand that at this point no but we do know one of the key contributing factors is there's a lower there there's a there's a declining trend in in the business startup rate in the united states and there's a much lower share of young firms in the united states than there used to be to the extent that this these reallocation dynamics and and indeed uh young businesses are part of the ways that the u.s experiments reinvents itself and actually adjusts this means the u.s has become i'll say less dynamic less entrepreneurial i'll say even before the great recession so and so in some sense we were not as well prepared to be able to to deal with adjustment um in terms of these dynamics going into the great recession compared to for example the 1982-1983 recession so so in combination what we what we see is that that that young businesses were already were already you could say in trouble in terms of uh a lower pace of of entry and a smaller share and therefore lower dynamics even going into the great recession and they got hit especially hard so back again to the kind of hard questions that jim's talked about you know do we do we understand why things were so different no in some sense again i've given you more about what than why but but we think part of the answer is uh is to look at young firms why why they've had such a hard time i'll say even before the great recession and and certainly during it i'll stop there thank you i think the subtitle of this presentation is uh great u.s is becoming more like europe is that the idea yes um eddie [Music] yeah i need to get to the front page see my name good okay all right well i'd like to cover three topics in uh five six minutes um so that's a lot to do uh the the first one is based on the nber conference that jim mentioned earlier uh sponsored by uh both alex and david and thank you guys for uh including our paper in this uh the the paper that we wrote for that uh that conference uh was called making do with less and by the way it was uh co-authored by chris stanton and catherine shaw and the basic idea there is that we know that during this recession if we look at productivity this recession is unlike recessions of say the 50s or 60s where productivity tended to fall and this has been a trend that's been going on over time and we don't have much to say about that but the question is why has productivity continued to rise and in some cases actually increase if you look at 2009-2010 you see that aggregate productivity has increased we have data from a particular firm where we can actually look at what's happening at the firm in fact at the worker level so we can actually study whether workers are increasing their output or effort during the recession so this is a microeconomic approach to examining what actually happens to productivity during a recession and there are two possible explanations for why productivity might rise one is a composition effect that the changing nature of the workforce perhaps in the direction of more skilled workers uh might increase productivity and the other is that for a given worker uh productivity goes up for a variety of reasons and what we do is we test between those two the bottom line is that it is the second uh it's the second explanation not the first it's virtually all uh productivity per worker related almost none of it is a composition effect uh and the reason that we offer is that it's essentially based on the threat of unemployment and the threat of unemployment uh is a more compelling threat during a recession particularly a recession like this one so the way we test that is to look across different sites we have a number of different sites in our our plant unfortunately i can't tell you the name of the firm it's a service based firm you can think of this as stuff like um uh grading call centers insurance claims these kinds of people tech people gate agents all of those would fit in where you can actually track the output by computer essentially what we know is the start and end time of a particular transaction so we know precisely how long a job took and we so we have a very good measure of productivity there what happened was different sites in this particular firm experience different rates of unemployment so by going across the different sites we can figure out whether being in a high unemployment area affects your productivity by more than being in a low unemployment area and that's basically it that's the whole story so here's the bottom line bottom line is this uh the firm in question experienced about a five percent increase in productivity uh during this particular recession uh what we found is that the impact of a five percentage point change in the unemployment rate which is kind of typical uh if you look at the trough to uh peak to trough uh where you're saying you had four point four percent back in the 2007 period went to 10 at the peak uh so five percentage point increases somewhere in the right range uh you get about three and a half percentage point increase in productivity explained just by this effort effect and again this is very specific it's a particular kind of worker uh you know we're not talking about the the most highly skilled workers in the economy but again we think it is um uh it is suggestive of what's uh actually going on in the economy as as a whole so there does to be does seem to be this tendency to get workers to make do get for the firm is able to make their workers uh do with less when a particular worker leaves others seem to be picking up the slack and that that uh i think of that as a standard kind of labor supply issue because uh if the wages remain the same but the alternative use of time goes down you're going to increase your effort it's kind of first order uh basic labor supply microeconomic stuff all right next point uh jim spletzer my co-author on a paper that we gave at the jackson hole fed conference last summer is here and that paper made the point that jim introduced the conference with talking about whether these were structural issues or frictional issues uh as a cyclical problem we concluded in that paper that in fact most of what's going on in this this recession is not structural it's actually it's actually cyclical and the easiest way to see that is simply to look at this uh unemployment rate chart which shows you what happened during the recession now uh we've broken this down by industry so if you look at the total experience unemployment rate of course you see that that went up and went up significantly but there were certain industries that accounted for most of the rise and they were construction manufacturing retail trade and to some extent the financial sector what is interesting about the recession is that what went up also came down so although we have not reverted to pre-recession unemployment rates uh more than 50 percent of the increase in unemployment during the recession was accounted for by construction manufacturing and retail trade and what is also true is that more than 50 percent of the recovery in unemployment rates uh since the turnaround was accounted for by those same industries if it were a structural problem you wouldn't expect to see that you would expect to see the recovery for example you'd see construction workers losing their jobs but you wouldn't see construction workers coming back when the unemployment rate fell they would tend to stay out you'd see the health sector and other sectors come around so we actually look at this in a bit more detail we have an index of mismatch in fact there is a significant increase in mismatch during the recession mismatch being the vacancies don't fit the jobs but the bottom line is that while mismatch went up during the recession it is already back to 2005 levels so this does not seem to be a mismatch problem it basically looks like a um just a a problem in demand let me conclude with one last point and uh since we have the wall street journal represented here i'll give you a plug is since you gave me one this was a piece that was in the wall street journal last week jim also referred to this at the very beginning in his comments and i think this chart is really important because what it does is it shows the difference between this particular recession and all prior recessions in fact all prior cyclical movements uh when when i was a young labor economist and i think most of us as young labor economists learned that you really should be focusing on the employment rate not the unemployment rate because we care about the proportion of the uh workforce the labor force that's employed not the proportion that's unemployed uh historically that just hasn't mattered a whole lot because the unemployment rate as you can see was a perfect proxy for the employment rate they moved uh inversely and and even the turning points are aligned everything kind of moved perfectly that was true until uh this recession and if you look at this recession what you see is that the unemployment rate no longer is tracking the employment rate the employment rate is stuck at 58.5 percent it's actually 58.6 percent uh when i say it's stuck it's wiggled around a bit there but it's basically stayed there for about three years and so the unemployment rate decline is not a very good proxy for what's happening to employment and it really is employment that we should be focusing on in the long run you care about things like demographics and so forth but this is not long run stuff we're talking about high frequency very short short duration declines uh that haven't come back and that can't be explained by the demographic trends so i'm going to just stop with those three points uh i think that could that should lead us to a a general discussion on a number of different things david i assume you can take it from here um before we get i'm going to let olivier and justin speak but i'm confused about one thing here john is telling us that what made the great recession different is we didn't get this big burst of productivity and you're telling us what makes it different is we did so i know you're talking about the same thing from different perspectives so explain that i i listen yeah i was listening to john carefully i think what john is talking about when when he was talking about cleansing and and correct me if i'm wrong john but when he was talking about cleansing what he meant was cross-sectional cleansing so people moving from high productivity firms to low productivity firms what we are looking the other way right i'm sorry excuse me yeah or may maybe not but right sorry uh what we're talking about here is within a given firm do you figure out ways to make that particular firm more productive so you know i i don't want to use the word cleansing again we like we just prefer to call it making do with less but within any given firm it could also be true that even the low productivity firms even the bad firms are still figuring out ways to make their uh workers more productive and i think that's what we're seeing here we wouldn't argue that this is uh you know a good thing what we would argue is that this seems to be the way that firms are accommodating uh declines in demand right now the output decline the demand for output declines but the demand for labor seems to be declining by more because they can they can get the uh existing labor to produce more per worker go ahead john sorry so so i agree completely with eddie the kind of connection between productivity and reallocation that we're about um it it does have a productivity payoff uh each year but it but it's but it's something that accumulates over time so indeed uh what we kind of count on is uh this process working year in year out and and what we find is it's not so such a big kick in any particular year and so there's high frequency cyclical dynamics of the sort that eddie's talking about but we have found that when you look over a five-year or a 10-year horizon there's a large fraction of aggregate productivity growth that's actually accounted for by this reallocation and so the extent what i'm talking about is this this process has slowed down and became distorted in the great recession okay olivier good um i have a one-page handout which i've distributed but i want to know how how many of you have it there was supposed to be a few more distributed by don't see any additional supply how many people are far from one how many have excess supply pass them that way good i put a g-spot back we don't have one either but we don't have one up here well all right thank you sorry about that um yes what i'm going to do is focus on the on ed's presentation and on the first fact the fact that we just we just actually discussed which is that uh if i look at the great recession uh eddie pointed out that actually productivity output per worker actually went up in the recession and and that's a surprising fact but even if you look at the more conventional measures say output per worker so it depends what measure you use some of them went down one of them very short actually went up but in general what's true is that productivity declined much less in this recession than it does in usual times i think that's the general fact and again we now have seen how this can be reconciled with the relocation facts that that john uh john john gave so what ed did starting from that was to go micro which is this comparative advantage and look at one on name firm what i'm going to do is go macro and look at given that i met the imf i decided we'd look at the number of countries and see whether the fact is actually a more general fact whether the u.s is representative of something which happened in many countries or it is uh it is special so i'm going to make in that context i'm going to make four points the first one is trivial but maybe the most important point one can make which is that the reason why looking at about 20 countries the reason why unemployment has stayed high is that growth has been low so there is given growth there is not much looking across countries there is not much of an unemployment puzzle basically if growth is insufficient then unemployment is not going to decline very fast and i think that's a very important fact because then you get to the growth puzzle and i think there again there might be some growth puzzle but again less than some say we know that financial crises uh have very long output tales they basically growth is very low when the shock is a financial shock another way of saying the same thing is that oakland's law basically has done quite well in this great recession across a very large number of countries the relation between growth and the change in unemployment has remained very similar to what it was earlier in time and here i'm relying on work by some of my colleagues and by larry ball so this is where the the first figure comes in if you plot if you start by plotting across countries i'm not going to give you a list you have it there the change in unemployment and the accumulated change in growth for the period of the recession for each country so from peak to trough you just plot that you see absolutely nothing i mean you see that in germany for example growth went down but unemployment did not increase in spain unemployment exploded so you see nothing but this reflects the fact that the coefficient of oakland's law is extremely different across countries so basically when you estimate oakland's low across countries as we well know in japan for example there is a very small effect of growth and unemployment organ coefficient is 0.1 if you go to spain the coefficient is 0.8 so when you then use these coefficients which you estimate and you construct the implied behavior from oakland's local country by country then you get the picture at the top and the the line is conceptually a 45 degree line not not visually and what you see is that in general the position of the countries in the great recession are not very far from the 45 degree line right so this is plotting the actual change on unemployment on the predicted change in unemployment using oakland's law and you know you have about as many points above as points below but in general you clearly don't have a major puzzle okay so i think that that's that's the first point that's an important one the second is well you know the points are not on the line and maybe we can learn something from deviations from the line right whether unemployment has been higher than uh uh than predicted by by these regressions so this is the second figure so the second figure is obtained in the same way which is first from a regression of the change in employment on the change in output country by country allowing for country-specific coefficients getting the implied movement in employment and by implication the implied movement in productivity so the figure 2 basically gives you the unexpected movement in productivity given history and so the first thing you see is the thing you saw in the previous figure which is that there is no general pattern it's not the case that productivity has been higher than predicted in many countries you have points above and uh below below the line in general so there's no general pattern then the next step which is my third point is well that's an interesting set of points can we actually make sense of them so if you look you can see for example that the ad fact is there which is that the us is one of the countries where productivity has been unusually high given the level of output and given the way it has behaved in history uh there are two other countries which are in that camp you have ireland and you have estonia sorry we look at small countries as well at the front the and then on the countries on the other side you have a number of countries where in fact employment has declined very little given the decline output or productivity has fallen much more uh than you would be predicted uh by history and the countries here just to list then finland germany uh lithuania netherlands slovak republic slovenia okay so the question for me at this point is okay so can i explain uh it's not obvious that the explanation that ed gave for his firm is going to be able to explain why it happened in that firm in that country in the u.s and not elsewhere so you look for various possibilities the first thing which comes to mind is different labor market institutions but in principle they have been stable that's already taken care of in the open local efficient which is that if indeed it's very easy to find higher than the oak and low coefficient which has been used to get the prediction should capture that if it's hard so it's not going to it's labor market institutions are not going to do it obviously then if you look another another possibility is and that is one of it when you look at the countries which have done which have had unusually low productivity is special arrangements and this explains a number of these countries so for example finland germany slovak republic and slovenia all had explicit work sharing agreements in which they basically decided not to decrease employment as much but just to have worker steve work less so just the opposite of what ed was describing in his firm and in germany i think most of us have read about it and the result was clearly a decree in measure productivity when it comes to the countries above the line it's much harder the hypothesis which is tempting which i suspect is true but i could not verify is credit crunch which is that in normal times you're going to the whole labor because you think it's things are going to come back you want to keep the workers they have specific capital right and you keep them if there's a credit crunch it may be very very difficult to keep them and therefore you have to lay off more people this would explain and was actually given as an explanation at the time why for example in the u.s in 2009 many firms were forced to basically get rid of labor that they would have kept had they been able to borrow the funds needed to to pay them but i must say that i have not been successful i've used various measures of credit crunch uh to see whether i could explain any of the interogenic across countries the the us uh ireland and estonia all had aquatic crunch yes but many of us had as well so it is difficult and from an econometric point of view i got nowhere so this was my third point the fourth point are there policy implications uh yeah potentially i mean you see that there's a number of countries which basically avoided the large increase in unemployment for work sharing but this came with a decrease in productivity that's the converse side and then the the interesting question is to relate this to the work that john has done which is what are the short run and medium run effects of his work sharing arrangement has it basically led to a different pattern of relocation less reallocation along the way and does this have productivity cost not only now but down the line and i think that that's an open question thank you justin um i just want to make three very simple points uh about three important macro relationships thinking about um the labour market so the first is uh following on from where olivier just started the relationship between gdp growth and unemployment certainly in the us we've heard time and again that oaken's law is broken and i want to suggest that's actually more a question of gdp mismeasurement than it is actually any problem with oaken's law i want to then turn to the relationship to unemployment growth and unemployment how many jobs do we need to create in order to reduce unemployment and argue that maybe it's less than you think and then finally return to eddie's claim eddie suggested the employment population ratio had been exactly flat throughout the recovery and i suspect it's actually distorted more by compositional change than he let on so what i want to do is just begin by telling some history and this is history eddie will remember well because he was chairman of the ca at the time this is what we thought we knew about gdp in real time so these are real-time data i'm showing you here both the blue line which is the standard gdp measure and the red line which jeremy nelwork has convinced me is a better measure it's gross domestic income and um we start the story here in mid 2007 when house prices had already peaked we keep moving through 2007 and to that this is now the uh the quarter the recession begins you can imagine why eddie found it hard to see that a recession had begun looking at these gdp numbers this is also the point at which unemployment started to rise this is the first point at which we started hear complaints opens law is broken growth is going up unemployment is in fact also going up um let's move forward a little uh to uh this now is the the the monster quarter when um the economy just fell apart 2008 q4 the initial estimate of gdp was that it only declined by 3.8 percent uh we subsequently believe it declined by about nine percent um so throughout this entire period we have this puzzle that growth looked growth as the bea was telling us was actually not that bad and unemployment according to the bls was doing terrible what we've subsequently learned as we go forward is actually growth was dreadful through much of this period and if you look instead at the red line gdi in fact you could see that if you'd followed the income-based measure of gross domestic product you would have seen that we're in a recession much much earlier and the performance at the labor market through this period of rapidly rising unemployment was enormously less puzzling which is to say that through the great recession there are an enormous number of articles written suggesting oaken's law was broken but if you go back with today's data it looks like unemployment rose much as you would expect given that we had in fact a steep recession today we're seeing in fact the opposite debate it looks like um unemployment seems to be coming down and it's coming down despite what has looked like fairly moderate growth but again as we get each new vintage of data it turns out these deviations from oaken's law are just getting revised out of the data my favorite is of course if you look at the last quarter of 2012 there's a period in which we continued to reduce unemployment the initial print of gdp was minus 0.1 percent we're all puzzled again how could unemployment be falling when gdp was when gdp was falling if you look instead at gdi the income based measure in fact said that the last quarter of 2012 was a bumper time and gdi was growing at five and a half percent so again it looks like many of our oakland's law deviations just look like incredibly noisy early bea data so if we go and draw opens law now using the latest data and in in red i'm showing you the downturn and in green i'm showing you the recovery it looks like the past few years have been pretty much exactly what you would have expected if you're using not the real-time data but now our best estimates of what actually happened over the past few years and it looks even better if you use gdi rather than gdp again a point jeremy now workers made so um next question i wanted to ask is how many jobs do we need each month to reduce unemployment you know you hear these things like you know the latest jobs report comes out and you know if we create 160 000 jobs people say well that's not enough to keep up with rising the rising labor force i'm not so sure that's right anymore the past three years we've been creating jobs at 160 000 a month and clearly the unemployment rate's been falling so that immediately suggests that old rule of thumb is something that we need to revise and in fact there's an interesting piece of work by dan aronson at chicago fed suggesting we've got to revise it fairly substantially what he does is he looks at what's happened to the working age population and what's happened to the labor force participation rate and a couple of other technical factors and says what is in f what is the underlying trend in employment growth um this shows you sort of the the inputs into his process so the top left shows you the labor force participation rate and its trend and this he's simply projected based on demographics so this is based on age gender education and so on it's not based at all on sort of casey mulligan type you know um none of us that can be bothered working because we all hope to qualify for a mortgage plan that may or may not be announced in the future type labor supply arguments so this is purely the mechanical demographics churning through a fairly simple standard model and you can see that in fact it suggests the participation should have fallen by a couple of points or we can explain its fall by a couple points over the past decade and will continue to do so the other important factor here is what's happening to population growth which is falling from about one and a quarter to one percent and so once you take all these numbers and just turn them through the machinery you move from the old rule of thumb that we needed to create 150 000 jobs per month to aaronson's suggestion that right now if we create 80 000 jobs a month that would be enough to keep the unemployment rate stable and in fact the claim that through 2015 2016 that could fall as low as 35 000 a month so we start thinking about employment statistics it just suggests we can we need to be reading the data through rosia tinted glasses you've never heard an economist say that before and then the final thing i wanted to do was turn return to eddie's comment about the unemployment rate in the employment population ratio here's the data that we all find very troubling this is what's happening to the aggregate employment rate and eddie's dead right it's flatlined and it's flatlined flatlined at five and a half fifty eight and a half percent he then said and this is exactly the standard intuition which is of course there's demographic changes going on in the background more people coming in hitting ages where we typically don't work but demographic changes are all so slow when we're looking at business cycles we don't need to think about them just turns out that's not quite right because this time the demographic changes are so big and i i think that this picture overstates the case to say that the employing population has been picking up strongly would be overstated the other way i just want to say there's actually been some improvement so you do the simplest possible exercise and simply disaggregate this by age group when you do this for 16 to 24 year olds i'm going to show this so that the vertical axis has the same span on every graph 16 to 24 year olds the employment population rate has risen by about one and a half points 25 to 34 year olds the employment population has risen by about one and a half to two points 35 to 40 40 year olds it's risen by about one point 45 to 54 year olds now it's a lot flatter um and what's going on with uh this group is too large to actually take too seriously again and i would suggest employment populations rising so let me return what i want to say is the employment population rate is actually improving but it's only improving a bit it's probably improving about one and a half percentage points for each age group by contrast the unemployment rate's fallen two and a half so there is still a big puzzle there let me stop there um hey do you want to respond to any of the justin said before we uh no not really why don't we just have a discussion okay well let us what i propose i have a couple questions and then i'll stop asking questions and turn it to the audience and if the audience is quiet i'll ask more questions um it seemed to me that both john and eddie lead me to be profoundly depressed about the future productivity trend eddie tells us that all the productivity trend increase in firms came by scaring the hell out of low uh laggards in the workforce and presumably that's not a lasting effect and john tells us that all of the things that used to drive productivity after recessions didn't happen the way they usually do here so am i misreading this is this a profoundly pessimistic view about trend productivity i think can i say i think it's it's it's it's too early um too early to say um uh this is going to really cut short your journalism career [Music] but but but but i but i do think i mean i i think it's again i'll come back to one of the key themes i emphasize i do think uh the us again has has gotten a lot out of uh i'll say young firms and and and the job creation from from young firms so so let me just let me try to answer your question partly and talking a little bit more about that that evidence so so what else do we know uh about young firms so in any given year in the united states um uh there's a large pace of business entry and indeed um can i say back in the uh i'll say the good old days which weren't actually all that good but we're better than now we were getting uh roughly three million new jobs a year from from startups um alone uh and then out of that wave of entry um what we tend to see is i'll say is what's what ron jarman and hobby miranda and i talked about a very rich upper out dynamic that is uh actually most new firms fail uh actually even most new firms that survive don't grow but out of that group are a group of firms that grow very rapidly create lots of jobs okay and we've seen are are closely tied to exactly the productivity dynamics that i'm about indeed the things that are they're connecting reallocation and growth and so i'm not saying that we're not getting any of these kind of interesting reallocation and productivity dynamics from uh large mature firms we actually do we do we do see such firms but those young firms play a critical role in i'll say reinventing uh the united states so this comes back again to your to your question of pessimism i i actually think that there is concern that that we we aren't seeing those kind of dynamics uh occur in in the united states in in the same way we did before we were already seeing a decline before the great recession i would say that that that the 2004 to 2006 period were not was not nearly as robust a period of either job growth or productivity growth as for example the late 1990s and i think the kind of dynamics i'm talking about uh contributed to that and so to the extent that we were already on a downward trend and and then these this kind of dynamic got hammered in the great recession and has been slow to recover then then there is some reason for pessimism uh yeah i just let me comment on two things first on the productivity issue we know that uh productivity fundamentally has to occur through technical change so over the long term solo taught us that you know 50 years ago essentially we've got to figure out ways to get technical change high and as long as technical change is high we can continue to have productivity growth the issue is where does that come from and historically that's come from high investment in both human and physical capital that's uh uh helped facilitate the uh degree to which the economy has has changed i guess the question from from a policy point of view and from a you know prescription point of view or prognosis point of view is whether we are going to see those kinds of investments continue to be made in the future at the rate that they were say in the 80s and 90s and and i i to the extent that one is pessimistic i guess that would be the side on which i'm i'm somewhat more pessimistic i'm i'm concerned that we're not going to continue to see uh rates of investment of the sort that we've seen in the past so so that would be my my one caution i guess let me come back to um what olivier said because uh i agree with him completely in fact i mentioned the the work that jim spletzer and i did earlier uh in terms of trying to decide whether this was a cyclical or a structural phenomenon and and we um basically said almost exactly what olivier said which is you know we're just dead on oaken's law if you kind of look at this stuff this is really a low growth problem it's not a labor market problem uh and the question for the economy is really how to get the growth rate up not so much how to get the labor market moving again so uh i agree with that completely just uh one a quick comment on justin's you know i i don't disagree with that either in fact our numbers are are slightly different but the the number that i've had in mind is something like um we're on network creating something like 50 to 60 000 uh jobs per month uh you would have at a slightly higher rate than that but but somewhere in that neighborhood the problem with that is that if you figure uh we've got to make up for eight million jobs lost it's a long long time before we get back to that and so even if you use the revised numbers we're still basically saying the same thing qualitatively which is we still have a very long way to go before we have a normal labor market justin do you want to respond at all i want to agree with eddie absolutely somehow it can't be possible that everybody agrees with everybody and they say different things olivia wants to say something john so two things in response to ed oakland's law is actually i think neutral on the issue of whether the increase in unemployment is structural cyclical uh the relation between output growth and unemployment can hold whether u has remained your natural rate has remained the same or not i just say that relation is stable i think the on on productivity pessimism the question that david asked uh again with my imf hat you know we've looked at very many financial crises uh more than a hundred uh in in the recent past and and the characteristic is that many years after the crisis output is below the old trend so there's a permanent effect and when one looks it doesn't seem to come from an increase in the natural rate of unemployment it does not seem to come uh or only for a very small proportion from capital accumulation and so it comes from the solar residual and i think that's where it's easy to connect it with what john was saying which is that if we have a crisis in which there is less job creation than the productivity in the future will be lower maybe not forever but at least for a very long time and i think you may have identified one of the channels through which um a financial crisis even when the banking system goes back to health uh still has uh lasting effects on productivity john so so uh partly i i don't necessarily agree but i think i'm agreeing with olivier and uh on this point that that that uh i don't think oakland's law is important to look at i'm glad we've looked at it but i don't actually don't think it tells us that much as to whether there are structural changes uh i mean if if we'd gone off it yes that that would have been uh a signal uh and and i also think that structural changes again can can take many forms i think that all the work on mismatch i mean here's where i agree very much with eddie and jim's work amongst others that that indeed we we don't see evidence that there was substantial mismatch i would say across industries but but i'll come back i know i'm i'm you know i'm a broken record on this i think we have seen some structural changes in the economy remember the reallocation dynamics uh that i'm about is mostly within sector it's not between sector most of the reallocation is moving resources away from less productive to more productive businesses within sector and it and it's related to the kind of uh investment in and physical and human capital that he was talking about part of that is that process is a noisy process with lots of experimentation in terms of trying to figure out what kinds of new things work young firms play an important role in those dynamics so indeed i would sort of say um uh the structural change that we saw going into the recession is we were it is again that young firms were already on the way down so i would you know in terms of an elasticity that's changed so i would agree the elasticity between output and unemployment hasn't changed but the elasticity with respect to uh growth and job creation has changed let me uh turn to the audience i see some mics here so we should use them and when if you have a question uh yeah would you come to the mic and tell us who you are uh i'm alan cyanides question for uh freddie and your micro uh look uh and no real message no nothing on capital technological change in that particular increase in productivity that you talked about the micro level so i'm puzzled by that because we ought to be looking for that and if we look at the world the substitution of new kinds of capital for labor anecdotally is is very clear so did you look and this relates to this threat or fear getting workers to produce more that's a bit soft in terms of empirical evidence somewhat subjective i can believe it in a recession but the real question i'm asking is about the role of technological change particularly the new technology uh and the displacement of labor and the efficiency of that the worker in that firm of one whether you observed anything in that well i think your point is an important one uh for longer time periods in the short run we know pretty much with certainty that this firm did not change their capital structure so we actually first of all we we looked at the at this particular site so you know from a technical point of view we got site fixed effects in there and we also know what's happening with this firm over time through interviewing and so forth so there wasn't a change in the capital structure these guys are basically you know doing the same thing at their computer terminals that they were doing before over time i i would expect those kinds of changes to take place obviously if labor becomes more more expensive you tend to move more in the direction of capital and we'd expect to see that in this firm as well i don't think that's what's accounting for what was going on in this in this simple uh narrow case uh you know whether it would be more predictive of the economy as a as a whole is a is a different question but here we're we're really quite confident that this really is increases in in in effort and and again you know the way we think about it is this is you know this is completely rational at the individual worker level i mean there's nothing crazy about a worker you know stepping up productivity if you're worried about losing your job and and the alternatives just aren't very good out there so um you know it makes some sense and and particularly since it holds in the cross section that's what we found most compelling because uh you know this is not a time series result it's actually the case that when you go from one site to another the high unemployment sites are really the ones where you see the increase in productivity so that's what that's what made us think it was right yes i i wonder you're a bunch of smart people up there there is one structural change are you excluding or including yourself from that up there up there i'm not saying here i'm not standing standing here up there there is one structural change that seems pertinent to this discussion and that is the sharp fall-off and the share of output uh in the business sector that is being received by workers do you see any connection uh with anything you've said or or is this simply a measurement problem uh i mean i have a i have a thought on that but i'm certainly happy to let others speak so you want to you guys want to go first all right well let me just answer in the narrow context you know it again if i think about this particular firm and if i look at productivity i mean this is completely consistent with what you're saying because um we know that profits uh did not decline in the way that we might think they would during a recession uh and in part you know if you look at this you could say well this is this is substituting kind of kind of comes back to what allen is saying it's substituting the short run for the long run because at least in the short run you can see how you can get higher productivity by getting your workers to do more that may not be a good long run strategy but in the short run it will inflate profit so the wages flat right so more output more output more profits right but again as i say that's a short run kind of because you know over time if the uh demands on workers go up you would expect that you'd have to have wages rise commensurate with that so but not in a short run situation yeah right justin yeah um i had a thesis advisor in graduate school who wrote a paper called the medium run um in which uh olivier interpreted declines in the labour share as being a labor demand shock um you may want to speak to that um and let me add one advertisement which is in the next brookings panel on economic activity we're actually going to have a paper looking precisely at the declining labor share and hopefully we'll have answers do you remember this all i want to say that's a good question this is one of the least successful papers i wrote i think i mean i think relative statement yeah it's it's a fascinating question what determines the share of of labor income but i yeah i had a go at it and in the end i was not convinced nor do i understand what has happened in this crisis let me be humble yeah sure johnny why don't you down with so so uh i i want to talk a little bit about sort of both this question and eddie's evidence on what's going on with productivity and services and and i guess i'm wondering whether uh partly what we're seeing um is is a different form of a composition uh fact what do we know uh that's different than uh now relatively early 1980s is the service sector has exploded relative to the manufacturing sector and and uh uh productivity in the manufacturing sector actually kind of looked like it used to in terms of uh pro cyclical productivity so this is kind of a question for eddie is is it be interesting to ask the question is is this story for his firm and particularly connect to this is this just what we've always seen in the service sector and now because we're such a service sector dominated economy we're seeing this story and that may be connected to the to the to the question was just asked i just want to add one thing which is the decline in labor's share is strikingly international and it's not just the international it's not and it's also not just the advanced countries we're seeing in the emerging economies as well the ilo has some stuff where basically every country you look at it's got a sharply declining labor share over the last decade so this is um oh yes i'm sorry i'm chris ersig i'm visiting the imf as a research fellow but i'm only leave from the federal reserve board this is a comment that um he was directed towards uh justin wolfer's presentation which i thought was quite interesting i think there might be grounds for thinking that the decline in labor force participation that we've seen in the last few years has a much larger cyclical component than suggested for instance by the work of aronson and uh in particular um if you look at the participation rate of 35 to 40 you know four-year-old workers for instance that's fallen by a couple percentage points in the wake of the great recession something that was not predicted for instance by the bls looking at their longer term projections in 2007 they were projecting some increase in the participation rate of those workers instead of the very large decrease that we saw moreover if you look at state-level evidence relating unemployment to participation you see that states that had very large increases in their unemployment rates tended to have very large falls in participation which suggests a lot more of it was was cyclical in nature so if you believe that you know there might be much greater reason for for optimism going forward that participation will eventually recover that could be a strong catalyst for growth uh that's you know mainly a comment but i was wondering uh by way of question how much you know confidence would you put in the sort of projections that uh you know that you had there um the erinson-based projection which suggested a couple percentage point decline and it's a great question um i think what aronson's put out there is fascinating i'm not entirely convinced [Music] the flip side is you suggested that some large part of this could be cyclical that can be right that in that you know a greater downturn caused a lot of the decline in participation but that doesn't necessarily make us confident that during the upswing we'll we'll regain all of this um in fact in the united states to the extent that we've ever had hysteresis dynamics it's not been in our unemployment rate it's been our employment rate um so i think the fear here is that we've knocked a bunch of these guys out of the workforce and they're going to stay out all together okay uh i refuse to believe that there's not one woman in this audience who's willing to ask a question please thank you i'm chinhi and i'm at the university of houston i had a question for john in regards to the sort of the slowdown in the job creation have you ever looked at the changes in demographics and whether that had a that would sort of you know because you were sort of looking at the long run change it started in the early 2000s so we have had a shift in demographics uh just the lack of or the slowdown in the you know young entrepreneurs is that could that be a factor in what you're seeing we really haven't uh uh looked at that uh directly i think actually it's a it's a it's a very good question one of the can i say one of the complicating things about uh entrepreneurship is uh you know not all entrepreneurs are created uh equal uh there's uh enormous heterogeneity uh across entrepreneurs and actually the one of the most common forms of quote unquote entrepreneurship is 55 plus year olds uh becoming self-employed so to speak but but can we can i say we the evidence suggests that's not where this uh rich job creation dynamics is you know i'm in that age group so uh uh that's not where it's coming from so i so so i i agree with you completely there has been some work for example uh um jim sputter and henry hyatt have kind of looked to see whether whether in terms of just sort of the declining pace of work or churning whether uh worker age is playing a role and the answer is yes actually it does play some role but but your question is really about the entrepreneurs themselves and and to get at that uh we we need to work that much harder right because we we need to kind of take the kind of data sets that i'm talking about and linking it up uh to the characteristics of business owners uh that's work that can be done but and and we're interested in that but but but we're not there yet again if i think about uh the end of 2008 2009 uh it was absolutely impossible for any new entrepreneur to borrow from a bank right literally i mean they had two daughters trying to do that they didn't succeed so i'm just wondering how much of the law job creation can be explained this way do you have any way to use your data set to get at that so we we regard that as an incredibly important question a high priority question is to is to link in financial information to uh to our data at at least at the regional level um and actually even better uh at the micro level a hint that this that this is obviously uh related is that we we saw that the decline in job creation for young businesses and business startups especially clobbered in the states with the largest decline in housing prices and we see that even even once we control for local business cycle conditions and so that's suggesting i mean one but obviously that those were places in which you know it's not exactly clear what the channel was one channel potentially is the collateral channel but another one is just more generally those were the places where where the banks were uh were we're in great trouble um as well uh there's uh lots of interest in taking the kind of uh real data that uh that i was talking about so what what's census uh good at uh census is good at getting the real data on employment and productivity and the like uh they're not the place you could say unfortunately that has all the the balance sheet data and all the financial information uh there's lots of discussions going on with uh with folks at the census bureau with other agencies uh in this town who who have access to that balance sheet data but don't have any of the real data so i so i'd sort of say one of the high priorities in the i'd say in the immediate future uh is to try to get the real side data linked up with the financial data jim yeah i wanted to ask eddie you had a nice chart as you spoke to the question of sectoral mismatch versus demand side unemployment that showed many different sectors with you know unemployment rates rising and then declining and i wondered from the standpoint of many observing the economics profession talking about the labor market in the last few four years there was at one point you know enormous controversy about the extent to which this was a sectoral mismatch problem and what i was going to ask is is it the case that if we had stopped as justin did you know two years ago or three years ago and said here's what we're seeing was there much more scope for disagreement about the extent to which this was sectoral mismatch then than there is today so can we take away from this the conclusion that with what we've now learned four years into this recovery uh it's much clearer that it was not mismatched than people thought at one point along the way absolutely that's a really important point i i didn't bring the chart with me unfortunately but uh one of the things that jim and i did in that paper was we actually we have an index of mismatch that uh actually goes back almost 50 years that jacob minster was sort of the first guy to think about this stuff but many people have plotted this thing and if you do that and and if you look at that say two years ago what what you see first of all is that mismatch is highly uh cyclic so during a recession mismatch goes up and it did in the 2000 early 2000 recession and it did in this recession the more important point though i think is the one that you just mentioned jim which is that uh while the mismatch went up and went up significantly it declined just as rapidly as it went up so if we had stopped two years ago we would have seen a lot of mismatch out there and we'd have said oh my gosh you know this is yeah you know we're never going to recover now it looks like that's that's just not the case justin i actually just want to disagree i think the first symptom of mismatch um the first symptom of mismatch would be emerging shortages somewhere in the economy and if you look at the nfib small index small business index there's you can't find a small business over the past since the recession that has had trouble getting skilled labor i get called by journalists about this all the time and i say can you tell me a single example of a single firm anywhere going through extraordinary measures to find skilled labor and um there wasn't back then and there still isn't today let me i think that's wrong um and and so we're not agreeing on everything um what what what jim and i find is that uh there's an excess of labor in every industry it's just that the differential excess it which is the mismatch measure uh is has gone back down so it's still the case you know it's not the case that if you were to train construction workers to become nurses all of a sudden everything would be resolved because uh it's not that nurses are having such an easy time finding jobs either so even in the health sector which is the growing sector you don't have excess demand so i think that's consistent with what you're saying but but the point is the relative differences i think are not so pronounced now as one would have expected to katherine so it's related to all this uh catherine rampell with the new york times um so on the mismatch question if mismatch has gone down how do you explain the shift outward in the beverage curve yeah i mean i have my own theories but i'm just curious to hear yourself we also looked at that and uh we we can't we don't the answer is we don't know yet and again i'll just appeal to jim's point that it may be too early to tell we know that the beverage curve tends to have these loops so if you look at the pattern going out the the return uh during a recovery is always different it's at a higher level the vacancy to unemployment ratio is higher uh during the recovery than it is during the uh during the the recession itself and that seems to be true now and it seems to be more pronounced than in the past but what's also true is that the recession is more pronounced than it was in the past so we just don't know whether this is simply a more pronounced cyclical phenomenon or whether it does reflect something that's long run olivia yeah i had worked a bit on the beverage and varvi's loops and the amplitude of the loop uh varies for various reasons i think at this stage it's reasonable to think we're on a normal loop that there has been no shift in the underlying beverage curve as of today so i want to conclude the panel i enjoyed it i think i've learned that the one thing i draw from this is that whatever you do as a policy maker uh if you rely on the data you have available you'll make the wrong decision thank you very much for that [Laughter] all right we're going to try to do a line change up here without a break uh so we'll i'll ask the next set of speakers to come up while they're doing that let me just say that one of the wonderful things about doing an nber meeting like this here in dc is it does give us the opportunity for me and for the other researchers to have a chance to hear from all of you who are here in dc and in the policy world what what some of the topics are that might warrant further investigation and outreach so i would just ask you if you if you have inspirations or ideas uh topics that in the labor area or other areas that we should be trying to undertake research on that would ultimately help inform the kinds of questions and issues that you confront by all means at some point during the course of the proceedings try to find a chance to to let us know and we'll try to take something up on that so okay i'll let the next panel come on thank you
