we're going to switch gears i uh and move to uh from more of the causes of the uh great recession and some of its direct labor market consequences to a slightly different perspective um on the changing role of the safety net in particular we're delighted to have a really great panel catherine rampell is going from the new york times is going to be our moderator um hillary hawaiians is going to give a presentation based on the article that she and marianne bitler have prepared for um prepared for the research program and then we've got uh three respondents gordon berlin from mdrc the president of mdrc who i had the privilege of working with for about 15 years in the 1990s gary burtless from brookings one of the washington locals and and someone who's an expert in this area and finally cecilia rouse the dean of the porter wilson school at princeton university and my former colleague as well so um without further ado let me um sort of give you an overview of what we um alex and i when we were kind of putting together our thoughts on on the safety net we we wanted to um ask uh hillary and and marianne and others to kind of think about the traditional relationship between economic growth and and individual outcomes and just as there's a kind of a traditional open relationship between the labor market and economic growth there's a similar relationship between gmp growth or unemployment in poverty and so that's going to be one of the things that we'll focus on and some of the uh mediating factors in that relationship are the very important part of that is is the nature of the programs that we have to potentially put a buffer between labor income and actual final disposable income and these would be entitlement programs like unemployment insurance food stamps and tanf welfare in addition uh disability insurance program uh sort of the ultimate i wouldn't call it safety net but safety trap and uh so we're asking how has the safety net performed in the in this current recession uh has it uh moved in a different way than we thought and i think there's going to be some interesting and surprising i think findings on that uh we'll also um uh try and address a question uh or that i think is uh pretty important which is has the safety net itself been one of the causes of the prolongation of the great recession and i think hillary will probably have a little bit to say about that and that's probably something that has attracted quite a bit of informal attention i will say one other thing there is a another contribution to the volume which we're not going to talk about too much today jesse rostein did a very interesting study on the potential trade-off between unemployment insurance system and the disability insurance system and asked a really interesting question which is uh to what extent does the availability of unemployment insurance for people who've lost a job uh curtail or prevent them from moving onto disability insurance and so i think i can say that his his findings suggest that in fact the the role there is pretty small but that's another aspect of this work that it may may ultimately attract quite a bit of interest so without further ado let me turn the tables over to catherine so thanks everyone for coming hillary i believe is going to open with a presentation as far as i understand for the structure of this panel so if you want to go ahead and take it away i think i'll just go down there okay um [Music] thanks a lot it's great to be here and to be uh part of this uh panel today so as david said uh this is work with marion bitler and what we're looking at is sort of a two-fold approach to thinking about the safety net and in general we're relying on the historical experience as well as the great amount of variation across states in the severity and timing of cycles in order to try to parse out this question about the relationship between growth and the labor market and well-being for the more disadvantaged part of the population and the mediating factors of the social safety net we also looked at the private safety net but i'm going to focus here on the social safety net and so we do that by looking at a range of uh of the core safety net programs that are providing some income protection in cycles as well as addressing this question of to what extent there seems to be any relationship between the extent of that protection that's going on in the great recession and the lack of a strong expansion out of the recession so let me just show you um one picture to sort of motivate the the landscape here so what i've got here is uh is the core safety net programs that formed um what we focused our analysis on back to 1980 and for each one of those programs we've got just the aggregate amount of spending on real terms on a per capita basis and what you can see here and then the an annualized version of the the standard cycle definitions and the red lines are the disability programs the dashed one being ssdi the larger one the solid one being the income conditioned smaller one ssi the blue lines are tanf and food stamps the sort of core welfare type part of the of the safety net and then the black line the larger one is unemployment with the very large fluctuation that you can see in the cycle and then the one with the symbols is the earned income tax credit so part of the story here very much comes down to the fact that at the very low end of the distribution tanf is very small cash welfare is is all but sort of evaporated and in its place we know the earned income tax credit has really exploded and that's kind of interesting because the earned income tax credit while is you know very appealing in many ways because of its connection to the labor market and increasing incomes while incentivizing work is not very well designed to provide income protection and recessions because after all you need to be working to get the itc so part of the story that's been kind of interesting out of this project is in observing the great recession and what we see is that uh the the most disadvantaged households say less than 50 of poverty have experienced a much greater reaction to the recession than we would have expected historically and much of that seems to be because of the lack of assistance through tanf at the same time the eitc sort of takes its place to some extent although it's uh it's also reaching much higher into the income distribution but that's not necessarily providing a lot of cyclical protection as you wouldn't necessarily expect from a program which is tied to employment there's a little bit of a secondary story about married couples who experience a reduction in earnings and sort of earn their way into by a decline in income into the earned income tax credit but that's not a huge part of the story so that's the landscape for our analysis and so our main findings on the safety net uh to some extent surprised us a little bit so what's very clear is the point that i just made is that cash welfare through tanf is reaching many fewer families and its variation from year to year essentially bears no relationship to the cycle now it never had a very strong relationship to the cycle but that's gone it's there's a little bit here a little bit there but it doesn't seem to be responding to need the eitc does have some relationship to the cycle reaches very many families but is not providing a lot of counter cyclical protection it's providing a lot of anti-poverty protection in general but not in a way that's very cyclical which kind of makes sense secondly the two programs that have sort of received the most attention in terms of the safety net and are certainly reaching many households food stamps and unemployment insurance in general historically we know tend to be more cyclical obviously unemployment insurance but additionally food stamps say compared to cash welfare tends to be more cyclically responsive the reason being that there's a lower sort of tax rate on the program which means that there's more people who are the working poor not just the non-working poor that receive food stamps what we found is that the reaction to the cycle which we measured using the unemployment rate in the great resection we could not reject was any different for these two programs than from the historic so despite the fact that we see this great increase in food stamps and unemployment in the recession it was also a bigger recession that we'd seen and the results that we're finding again using variation across states and over time comparing the current period to earlier uh cycles we we can't reject that the reaction to the labor market is any different on behalf of the safety net so that was that was a result that surprised us a little bit um with respect to poverty um uh i again uh to repeat the the point that i made before in general there's a very you know for decades we've been studying the relationship between growth labor markets and poverty and for the most part the reaction in the current recession is not very different excuse me from prior recessions what stands out the most is that extreme poverty households with income below 50 percent of poverty is reacting much more strongly to the recession and from our analysis i would say the leading reason for that in terms of the safety net explanation is the decline of cash welfare which after all that's really where its greatest protection is at very very low incomes however once we move up the income distribution to a hundred percent of poverty 150 percent of poverty uh uh 200 percent of poverty uh there there's less of a change uh from the past and then finally the programs that are providing the most anti-poverty protection just overall in terms of now the changed safety net that we have are absolutely food stamps um and the and the earned income tax credit um not a cyclical statement but one that's just important about what these programs are doing so let me end with one picture to try to address this question about the relationship between the growth of the safety net and the lack of growth of employment coming out of the recession so we do a very simple exercise that is very speculative and and not very bottom line perhaps but what we do is we compare across states because after all there was a lot of variation across states and the extent to which food stamps unemployment insurance and so on expanded and so each dot on this graph is a state weighted by the size of the state and the x-axis is a measure of how much of this core entitlement spending uh per family was going on at the state level in 2009 as the sort of uh depth of the recession and then on the y-axis is the change in the unemployment rate again at the state level between 2009 and 2012. these are annual numbers so it's just annualized between 2009 2012. and what you would expect to see if in fact there was a strong exp relationship between the growth of the safety net and the lack of the expansion is that it would be a downward sloping relationship and there doesn't seem to be any relationship that you can really see here at all and you might say well we should really be looking at employment to population not employment getting back to the discussion uh in the first session um and if anything you see a relationship in the opposite direction as you would as as this theory would expound and that is that uh the law this is if anything showing a weak upward sloping line uh which suggests that in areas where there was larger safety net spending in 2009 there was a greater growth in the unemployment employment to population ratio so there doesn't seem to be much evidence consistent uh with that hypothesis at least in bringing the data that we have to it so that is it and uh thank you very much thanks very much hillary so i figured i would give everyone a couple minutes to respond if you have any immediate thoughts and then i have a lot of questions and i'm sure that there are audience questions so gary since you're you're next to me if you want to make any comments i think the uh the question about the social safety net in the great recession is what worked well and what didn't work well what worked well was unemployment insurance not only did it respond in its customary way but the congress boosted that ordinary effect by giving longer duration benefits than we've ever had in the history of the united states jacking up weekly benefits giving special tax concessions and supplementing what is usually just a strictly cash program with access to subsidized federal insurance for people who want to continue their health insurance under the role plan food stamp program worked very well the congress relaxed one of the requirements which permitted primage adults without children to keep getting food stamps they weren't limited as much and spending on that went up drastically replacing some of the lost income medicaid not mentioned here was used not as a tool to protect health insurance for people in the recession but mainly as a tool to channel huge amounts of money to state governments uh in terms of keeping publicly available health insurance for the energy available it did very well i think the doctor is not pronounced yet on whether it worked as a tool to encourage states to hold up their public spending or to uh postpone when they raise taxes to me it looks like states may have done pretty much what you would expect when they have a real severe slump in revenues the tax system worked well it was in the first two years of the obama administration tilted toward people with low income as soon as we moved to replacing those income tax changes with payroll tax changes then the benefits went uh basically in proportion to how how higher earnings are because the payroll tax cut gave much bigger tax cuts to people who had the highest earnings level what didn't work cash assistance for low-income people did not work as you just heard uh it's unclear to me whether that should be very counter-cyclical anyway because a lot of the people at the very bottom of the distribution actually don't have pro problems linked to the immediate business cycle they have longer term problems and what was added to the social safety net in this recession we did have a historical change in health insurance the affordable care act is sort of like introducing the social security program in the middle of the great depression so there's one legacy of the great depression that we still have even though probably we only got it because of the severity of that recession and the power political power that went to the party supporting that kind of an expansion of basic social protection and that the same isn't true for health insurance the only reason we got it is because democrats obtained historically large majorities and that is what gave us this change in the social safety net on the macro level what worked well all of the things that i just mentioned probably worked on the macro level to to some degree or other but what we didn't have was any program that gave employment to people who were adversely affected by the recession there is one exception through the canf program there was a public health program a public employment program but it's very limited compared with the scope and the severity of the recession and furthermore we did not have a major publicly supported private jobs expansion through direct purchases of goods and services in the market through direct uh investment in infrastructure or other things that the government buys from uh from private providers and that i think is the most signal failure of the social safety net it did not have as big a macro level influence as it could have if if we had offered job uh creation to supplement this income replacement strategy that we followed sure thanks so i want to just broaden the discussion a little bit and also just get on the table the idea of some alternatives to to the structure that we have currently and as i was thinking about the last panel in this one as we look for explanations underlying the slow recovery um and question the adequacy of the nation's safety net it seems to me it's important to keep in mind that we really have two problems underlying this one is a kind of the intermediate term problem of this really long drawn out recession and how the safety net responded to that but the other problem is a longer term problem to my mind and that's this very long-term secular decline in employment and earnings for those with limited education um and you know you know that concentrated primarily among men and fundamental to that problem which i think is part of what the you know we're all trying to understand and wrestle with is what i view is really gary's question in the last um session this fundamental breakdown between economic growth and productivity and and workers wages and earnings and if we can't really understand that and think about what systems and institutions need to be put in place uh regarding that problem it's going to be hard i think to get a handle on on some of these other shorter term issues so why does it matter because if you think about the safety net it was really built since the great society on sort of a three-legged stool one was income supports to help people get through tough times and the second was investments in human capital that would help people take advantage of the third leg of the stool and probably the most fundamental which was economic growth and why was it described in that way because there was a clear direct relationship between productivity growth and growth in workers earnings they moved really in lockstep and if that fundamental relationship is broken down it has seems to me at least profound implications for the safety net with regard to the individual programs you know i think food stamps did a really good job it's interesting to contemplate that the house would cut 21 billion out of the food stamp program they're uncomfortable with the fact that the roles have grown as much as they have and even the senate bill would would cut i think it's a couple billion out of it with regard to unemployment insurance it seems to me that there are two basic questions one is whether we're happy with coverage given this kind of state-defined program the recovery act included some money to do better on that and 38 states took the money and have made some improvements and we should be asking ourselves whether they did a sufficient job but the bigger question is how comfortable should we be with unemployment that extends beyond um i don't know 36 weeks or 52 weeks or even well beyond that at some point what appears to have been a cyclical problem for individuals becomes more of a structural problem and the idea that this scarring begins to take effect and you know should we really substitute at some point some kind of public jobs alternative at that point the welfare system is to me really straightforward um the 1996 welfare reform act was passed in the midst of the roaring 90s recovery the whole concept was that the safety net should be built around work so we expanded the eitc and we made the whole welfare system conditional and contingent upon work and you can forgive the framers of the act for being unable to foresee the great recession just as people who would have been in the midst of the great depression probably couldn't have foreseen the 1960s either but the fact is it really has uncovered i think the weakness and i guess i'm disagreeing a tiny bit with gary about the importance of the tanf welfare system with regard to you know a safety net it is the unemployment insurance system for people at the low end they often don't get get into ui there's a lot of movement and back and forth in those systems so in the aftermath of the great recession the wisdom of having designed a welfare system that was entirely contingent on work i mean they didn't even allow you to get education and training for any length of time and have that count against your work participation standard um all the incentives and structure and of course if the states didn't respond to those incentives well then the system was time limited just to be sure that everybody got got the message um and that brings me to my last point which is if you were going to redesign these systems what are the two or three things we ought to be thinking about so one key question is what role for public jobs programs or subsidized jobs i mean they've had a um i think a famous positive history starting with the ccc and the wpa in the 1930s continuing through the c2psc period you know they've had their ups and downs politically but it certainly was part of the toolbox a really important part and it wasn't really any significant part of our toolbox today and you know should it be what would it look like at mdrc we're running several experiments of transitional jobs programs they do get people working pretty quickly the long-term effects on employment don't really materialize but the experiments we've done so far are really aimed at structurally unemployed ex-offenders and long-term welfare recipients and interestingly and a bit of a puzzle for us is why those programs have produced positive effects in terms of reductions in recidivism even though the employment effects tend to decay over time and we have a next generation of those experiments underway that we hope will teach us more about some of those issues the second big question is if it doesn't make sense to continue to condition welfare on work alone but the idea of a quid pro quo and reciprocity reciprocal obligations is going to be at the heart of our social safety net do conditional cash transfer models like the progressive model in mexico make more sense we've been running a test as some of you know that it does reduce poverty quite dramatically the problem with our test is that it's built on the current safety net we couldn't really ethically test an alternative to it in the current structure but of course we hope to also have not just effects on poverty and hardship but longer-term effects on behavior that is the the benefit was conditioned on kids staying in school and doing well in school the whole family getting health checkups and dental checkups and parents participating education and training are working and those longer-term effects on behavior are much smaller than we'd hoped and we could talk about more of that about why that is later in some areas there wasn't room to make a difference it turned out poor people do all these things anyway but in a few areas we did get some positive effects and i could talk about those the last thing if you buy the first argument about we really need to think about the much bigger picture out there in terms of these long-term secular declines and their heavy impact on men and we need to create new kinds of structures and institutions that do what unions and the minimum wage seem to have done in terms of making growth be distributed more equally for the 21st century should we what other alternatives are there one that i think is interesting to think about is a singles earned income tax credit that doesn't have marriage penalties and that basically would be a vehicle to make work pay so that if hillary and i work next to each other and she has two kids and gets the eitc and i i'm a single male and don't she gets five thousand dollars and i get 500. um so it essentially says aren't shouldn't we be thinking about labor market policy not income support policies when we begin to think of that broader set of issues and that's essentially what a payroll tax holiday did but it wasn't targeted very well as gary said so i had one follow-up question on that before we get to cc's comments so if it is sort of inevitable that uh labor is capturing a smaller share of of income in the country uh that inequality is growing i mean as as justin mentioned that these kinds of these kinds of trends we have seen across the world and not just the united states what are the implications for what we should do about that if anything and in terms of the social safety net you mentioned the singles earned income tax credit but i'm wondering if you know education policy plays a role or if there are other policies that we should be thinking about people involved in that but i think it is really a big question it's not exactly clear we've done a lot of work trying to work on this whole question of upward mobility but the reality is if you look at the bls projections we're going to have a hell of a lot of low-wage work in our future and the question really is is that work going to pay the weather the way uh it would need to to be able to support a family i mean my favorite statistic is the typical low high school graduate could earn enough to support a family of three or four above the poverty line in 1973 and you're not even close today that just seems to be fundamentally a big problem because the low-wage work's not going to go away i'm sorry i don't have a good answer for you cece so um i agree with some of what's been said but not all about some of the disagreement we can leave for the discussion um i i i also completely agree with the the fundamental part of this paper which i think was um you know as a really important paper and i think this sort of echoes what david was saying about the data which we wish we'd had three or four years ago we were making decisions about expansions and in what is now the safety net um so i i sort of started back to first principles so i t i teach microeconomics at princeton and um i like to think of the safety net and so what i talk you know teach my students is um the safety net is our society's way of saying that we think that in that in our society we're a wealthy enough society that there should be a minimum level of well-being that individuals have and that households have and as a society we've decided that we should have some minimum level some people might call this a means test and obviously means tests go in for other reasons as well they're pragmatic they help with budgets um and they're complicated they have work disincentives but you know sort of embedded in that it says that we think that there's some minimum level of well-being um the safety net also is our way of thinking about insurance so you have you're employed you lose a job through no fault of your own um so unemployment insurance uh is part of that insurance policy to help you smooth your consumption to and also if you have this notion that there are good job matches and bad job matches it allows individuals enough time to find a job that is a good match which we think is productivity enhancing for us all um and so that's a good thing and then sort of buried beneath that as well is that our safety net then um in good times for those who have a minimum wealth of well-being that means they're also spending money and contributing to economic activity are able to do so but also during downturns it means that the safety net becomes an automatic stabilizer and i think that aspect of unemployment insurance in particular um you know sort of buried it became front and center as a part of the discussion of unemployment insurance but i think has um even heightened and i think this paper really reflects that and that may be part of the explanation for your last chart um for why and for why states that had stronger safety nets didn't do as poorly as because those individuals could continue to contribute uh continue contributing um but the the issue is i actually read the paper um not quite as rosalie as um hillary characterized it i i actually read it is that the safety net is has gotten a little leakier i don't know there are more holes in the safety net that um that the the programs that we did very well on maybe we could say that they did better than in previous recessions and when i say better here i'm not going for those standard errors and those tests where in the paper it's still tested um so but if you just look at the magnitudes of what they were finding for the very poorest it looks like it we did a pretty good job but as you move up um you know maybe we could say for those who are at the poverty line it did it did a little better but for those just above the poverty line which i don't think we want to call real victory um it really didn't seem to do very well but maybe i'm not reading the paper the way that you did and so i actually um you know say what you know so why did this happen i think that wasn't um necessarily and given the depth of the recession and how widespread it was um i did i thought that that was actually sobering news and i think part of it is what just what we've just been discussing is the fact that we've moved away from the kind of safety net which just says okay we think you should have a minimum level of well-being and we want to help you if you don't to it being more much more work based and when you then start to move for work base one you have those who are chronically unemployed or chronically poor and that they're not due to the cyclicality of the recession but it also means that for those who had tenuous relationships with the labor force to begin with many of them don't necessarily even qualify for um for unemployment insurance um uh hillary and gordon have talked about some of the people who don't necessarily qualify for the eitc um you have ssdi you know there have been historic relationships between between ssdi and that hasn't necessarily changed but it kind of steps up in importance when you don't have other forms of cash assistance and and the thing that makes me pretty nervous about some of these changes is that the expansions in the unemployment insurance part of it becomes almost automatic with the the state triggers for extended benefits although not all states have them unless the federal government steps in but then you have to have congress step in and actually authorize them these even longer extensions now congress has historically done that and and hopefully they will continue to do so but in this last one because the depths are so low and it need to go for so long there were moments when they were not extended in time and we had moments when people were without their unemployment insurance and so when congress has to step in and you know i don't know if i'm over you know i want to overreach here in washington but you know i don't have a lot of faith in what our our leaders are able to accomplish in these days but that makes me kind of nervous that our safety net is contingent um on um individuals being able to agree on on the way forward um so uh i want to talk just a little bit more about thinking about unemployment insurance in particular which is how i read the paper saying that the unemployment expansions were very important part of the safety net in this recession and um so as i think about that not only do you think about the fact that it doesn't have full coverage we have designed an unemployment insurance system which is designed to be temporary it's really meant to say it's insurance it's meant to get you to your next job as a result it was a really big deal when um the administration made an administrative change and said or and it was sort of temporary saying states you can allow people to go back to school while they're receiving ui and states had to opt to take this up and that's because it's not unemployment insurance is not meant to help you while you're going to school it's meant to transition you while you're finding another job um but going to school while you when the opportunity cost of going to school is pretty low because there aren't a lot of jobs available seems to make a lot of sense lost things took them up and we're trying to encourage the individual to make it easier for individuals to go back to school another area was you're not allowed to be self-employed and start your own business while you're receiving ui because again it's not meant to sort of help people do this other activity they're meant to be transitioned to a new job so if unemployment insurance is going to become uh more front and center as part of the safety net i think we need to wrestle with what do we how would we want to construct it and who should be eligible um the next part has to do with eligibility yes the recovery act expanded eligibility but one area that i think we need to be cognizant of is that independent contractors aren't covered by unemployment insurance and as firms start to move towards hiring more you know transitioning individuals from being regular employees to being independent contractors that's going to be another hole so again ui was never designed for this purpose and if we're going to move in this direction i think we have to move so cautiously um so last thing i just want to echo what gordon said about especially with these work-based programs forming the core of our safety net is what about the long-term unemployed um again this recession this is obviously a larger group than we've ever had historically but again you know even ui being 99 weeks makes many of us choke that wasn't true in every state and that's rolling back um and yet many people are still unemployed and have expired their benefits we don't have cash assistance they're still eligible for food stamps ssdi is still possibly available um wait that would you call it david the safety trap and uh but i think we you know if we're going to be starting to think about a safety net again some of these individuals need to be incorporated as well so my my big question is sort of a philosophical one sort of a practical one which is um you know over time we have seen this shift of the social safety net um focusing from the very poor to those who can't or won't work depending on your interpretation to those who are working to the near poor to the middle class um and this predates the great recession i think robert moffat had a big paper about this and people for russell sage i think um and is that what we want is that is that a good choice that we've made to the extent that it has been an explicit choice both in terms of automatic stabilizers during recessions as well as longer term growth potential if anyone wants to weigh in otherwise i'm happy to to pick on someone so i would just say it was the right choice in the 1990s and it's absolutely a bad choice in in the current period and the problem is we need to build in a system that works really well in good times and and also works well in in really bad times why is it a good thing to have done in the 90s because welfare is never going to be worth enough to help you really get out of poverty but if you can combine earning supplements with and food stamps with a low wage job you're going to be substantially better off and it was the right message to send to people to try to get to get them to mix benefits and and um and work in the roaring 90s when there were plenty of jobs it's absolutely you know the wrong place to be in a period like this because it leaves a lot of hardship uh with with very few options in my view gary thoughts well uh actually the uh the trend from the great depression until uh probably the mid 90s was much more toward the social safety net that is providing protection to everybody in society it's it was the growth of social security the growth of unemployment insurance benefits the growth of disability insurance benefits which after all does go to middle class and upper middle class people too if they become too disabled to work and the medicare program i mean these were the real engines driving uh spending on the social safety net and they remain the biggest elements of it i think gordon is talking about the parts of the social safety net that are aimed at people who we can expect to be in the lower ranks of the income distribution during much of their life that is a different problem in my opinion and particularly when we're talking about a great recession we are talking about people who got very badly hurt who were in the middle class when the calamity struck and the question is how well did the social safety net protect that broad group in the population that suffered a huge blow i repeat a lot of the people collecting tanf in 2007 were part of the group of people who permanently have low incomes and i think that their problems are different than the cyclical problems and we have an extremely severe recession i want to give one statistic which i didn't hear hillary give which is how much did private incomes fall in the great recession just on the aggregate level how much did private incomes fall they fell 10 at the worst point how much did net personal income fall at the worst point it fell about three percent so that says the social safety net did a heck of a lot in combination with the income tax and payroll tax system to buffer the broad middle class from the huge hit they otherwise would have taken if uh if their incomes were totally produced by our market economy i wanted to say a couple of things one is that you know cc's you know absolutely right that the the the data is consistent with the fact that i was sort of focusing on the most disadvantage but once you move up the income distribution you do see much more fluctuation in the risk at being between you know 150 and 200 of poverty in this recession than we would have expected and the safety net doesn't seem to have taken care of all of that and whether that is i think the leading explanation for that is the nature of how this recession and the composition of it is different apart from just what the unemployment rate overall would show but we don't really have the evidence in that paper to really say that that's true the second thing is i think we really do want to rethink or think uh about whether or not we need to have some if we decide as a society that we want to protect extreme poverty and i think that's very i mean i think that's very open to discussion about whether americans want to support people who are out of work um in the non-ui sense of the world i think that there's a a strong argument for making a tanf prime a second tanf that more mimics the ui system so there is a large you know cc mentioned that there's a large share of people who aren't going to be eligible for ui because of the lack of consistent work experience i hadn't thought about the independent contractor story and the question is could we come up with a a shadow ui that is what features would it have it would be short term exactly it would be short term it would be conditioned on looking for work although we know that doesn't work super well in ui but in principle be conditioned on looking for work but it'd be income condition like welfare as opposed to related to prior work condition like ui and whether or not there's a role for that not to get at the structure this is not a statement about the structural problem but i think the evidence we have is that extreme poverty is there is a dimension of it that is that is short-term and not persistent um and that that there could be some income supplementation um and insurance that takes place um for them for that part of the distribution the only thing i wanted to add is um one thing that hillary didn't point out about her paper that they looked at as well is the private social net the private safety net and there looked like there was some response response there i think there's clearly more that one could learn there and think about there but in this country it doesn't feel we don't i don't think we think of the family unit because we have so much mobility um as being quite as strong and so that it makes it puts even more pressure on the public safety nets but the private safety net did seem to people move back home uh tend to group in with others uh but i i didn't come away from that thinking well that fully compensated for for some of the holes in the public safety net right so we looked at issues like is there doubling up are our young adults more likely to be living at home and all of that occurred in very much the way we would expect but not very differently than from previous recessions which again perhaps the attention to uh for those of us with young adult children all uh you know everyone at home we might have thought that this time was different but it didn't appear to be very different compared to history but yet it's an important dimension of protection so it's kind of two ways of looking at those facts i think so i'm also curious about what kinds of safety net programs we should be considering now that might boost employment today and particularly those that would not require legislative authority although um [Laughter] given the given the political climate that cece mentioned earlier but uh on either level i mean gordon it seems like he might be the best person to to address this given some of the work that mrdc does but um i i don't know what i can do without money okay well so let's say that the two versions of the question are in an ideal world you know what's your what's your dream approach i think the interesting thing to think about is just what's happened to college enrollment during this period now we're all worried about the student debt response but um or load you know that's there but it seems clear that given the opportunity or given the requirement people made efforts to try to invest in their human capital and the question is whether that's going to pay off any more in the long run still i just i think it has something also to do with employers and um you know the one of the other things that existed in the prior period um that people have written about is this idea that we had social norms and it wasn't acceptable for ceo pay to get beyond a kind of accepted amount relative to the lowest person in their workforce um so it just feels to me like there's just a whole range of issues here i don't know gary do you have any any suggestions well one thing that gordon talked about earlier is the declining share of the total output of the business sector that is being received in the form of wages by workers wages and fringe benefits one other thing about the great depression is that in that period the national government also put its thumb on this negotiating scale to change the terms of bargaining between employers and workers and i i i think this is a nonpartisan statement of what a state of knowledge is in labor economics it is widely seen that unions are much much weaker in their ability to organize workers today compared with 1959 or even 1979 and that does reduce the bargaining power of workers uh reduces their ability to negotiate but if we're talking about increasing programs that increase employment not wages necessarily well uh gordon and i both also mentioned that in previous uh recessions uh the national government has taken much more active steps to directly boost uh employment by through government employment programs i think is what uh gordon emphasized but i would say in addition to that through through public infrastructure programs where the government is not directly hiring the people but it is making the funds available for state and local governments to improve their public capital stock and really if you look at the statistics on aggregate spending at all levels of government federal state and local on this kind of activity you see nothing there the everything that the national government attempted to do was offset by countervailing uh behavior on the part of state government so there's a lot of room for improvement there susie yeah i'm not sure i completely agree with that i mean i think there's some evidence that suggests that the state aid actually did cause did increase employment in terms of the you know the the money which for teachers and first responders especially in the first wave uh there's a very nice paper they think just got an award in the aej actually um that that suggests that um and so that's that's a place where i i mean i think that as we're thinking about the long-term unemployed i think we could think about is a public works a public employment program really likely to be effective i mean we've experimented with this in the past and they sort of evolve over time as people worry about the wind falls and is it really generating value added it sort of devolved into job training right that's where ceta started as an employment program but it doesn't mean we couldn't revisit it but i would i would take issue with the recovery act not actually basically doing that um the recovery act was all hands on deck they were trying to push out money through every channel in the federal and state governments and in the end that's what individual that's what agencies were doing was hiring i mean i i get that a third of it was the the tax cuts and the food stamps but there was a big increase in the spending and um that went to a lot of different agencies a lot of them had more money than they knew what to do with and couldn't spend it as quickly as we had wanted them to there were also some some sort not exactly public works programs but there were some states that used tanf funds to exactly and they were very they were very effective i mean is there any is there any thought about pushing to expand those kinds of programs there has been uh-huh it's hard without any congress the congress refuses ten days before it expired and it didn't do much good exactly um that's these transitional jobs experiments we're doing are really meant to we're actually have resurrected several of these programs we're evaluating them we thought if we could learn more about their effects both positive and negative it might help inform an effort to at least consider again whether we ought to have that kind of last resort kick in when unemployment reaches a certain level in a given state so i thought maybe i'll open it up for questions now um i have plenty more but if anybody wants to to raise their hand no one jim as a public finance economist uh i think maybe to hillary as a fellow public finance economist thinking about these questions right there there is in many of these programs a set of implicit implicitor explicit taxes that if we think about this from a supply side perspective uh it does create a wedge between the incentive to supply labor and the you know and what it would have been in the absence of these programs and probably the person in the academic community who has taken this argument you know most most forcefully forward would be casey mulligan who argues that the expansion of these programs uh did substantially magnify the the set of wedges that were out there for private supply of labor and of course those arguments run in this case into the into the teeth of the there was little limited demand and therefore you you know you couldn't find the chance to to find an employer that we talked about in the last panel but you know we're looking at a chart that's here on the on the screen that shows you know total spending on these programs at an aggregate level versus employment to population ratios uh done done across states but i mean i was hoping you'd say just a little bit more about you know where where we stand in our our thinking about the the role of these incentives and the extent to which there were behavioral responses if we took the wisdom we had on behavioral responses prior to the great recession and we looked at the kind of incentives that were you know resulted from the expansion of these programs what would we have predicted and are they consequential for the the magnitudes we might think about um so obviously at the core of any safety net program is a balance between protection and distortion and that's kind of hard to to move away from in basic fundamental design so if you create a program take food stamps as an example uh you're trying to provide some income protection uh but in the process you need to eventually phase it out uh you're giving everybody income protection across the income distribution you're giving a grant and so that that fact that you have to phase it out is is what creates the wedge that of course jim was was talking about so this is sort of a iron law if you will of of uh maybe with the eitc as a small deviation from that in some ways and so the question is how do you balance the the desire for protection versus um versus the concern about about distortion and my read of the evidence from um which i think the best evidence is a micro based evidence so mulligan makes a sort of uh macro you add up all these programs and and you you look at the the sum total of of the distortions and i think the points on this are are a couple one is there's not as much multiple program participation as you would think um along the arguments that that casey mulligan makes so for example you don't just add up the distortions of ui in food stamps there's a remarkably small amount of overlap between those two programs maybe about 20 percent of people on food stamps in a given month have ui income in the month before so there's not as much overlap and this matters a lot uh because these wedges as you add them up it's not linear the relationship between the amount of the wedge the amount of the distortion and the amount of the the reaction of labor supply so that's sort of point number one point number two is i think the best micro evidence and looking at uh ui uh where you'd think that that would be the scope for which there'd be the greatest amount of distortion given the dramatic expansions that we've seen we don't see much relationship um this is work by jesse rostein as well as work by uh rob valletta and hank farber doesn't seem to show much relationship between the expansions um of the safety net through ui and the sort of unemployment rate in the economy so i think our best micro evidence suggests that this was a time without much you know job growth and so despite the fact that these wedges were existing the reaction in terms of the moral hazard and reaction of labor supply was not very important for the aggregate uh unemployment or employment um statistics i think that's my take away actually i have a question related to that which is that in a lot of states i think it's most states there are different application processes for you know for medicaid for ui for tanf for everything else um and there and you know there are a lot of barriers to getting them which is probably part of the reason why you don't see as much overlap in program participation as you might expect and i know that there are some states that are making an effort to integrate those application processes like colorado i think is one right where it's like one application you go to one website and you give it all of your information and it says okay you qualify for these things um what's your thought on those kinds of programs then i mean on the one hand the money has been allocated so why not make it easier for people to get it but if if it does increase the likelihood that casey mulligan's fears um come true you know that that it will discourage work in some way i think the evidence the evidence that we have is that those things really do make a difference um and that there's dramatic there's huge variation across states and how much food stamps helped out um conditional on some kind of measure of eligibility and that's one example of online application one-stop shop and so on i'm all for a high take-up rate i mean we have these programs in place i see absolutely no reason why we don't want to create systems that create high take-up rates and i think everything that we know is that a lot of the marginal entrants that would come in from that are people that don't have strong ties to the system and tend to be more um short-term utilizers of the system so i don't think it's obvious from that that these newly um that you're gonna have more people who are on these programs for long i think that's my my best guess of the what would happen if we got to 100 take-up can i say something about jim sure uh hillary mentioned the unemployment insurance program is where you would really expect to see this uh problem that jim mentions especially important because there was such an incredible increase in the roles of people and an expansion in the generosity of the benefits especially especially at the margin of how long you can collect benefits and as and she referred to i think two very good pieces of research i i would say that the these liberalizations had an effect in boosting the unemployment rate without reducing employment and let me explain what i mean the the findings of these two studies are that at the margin of leaving the ranks of the unemployed yes the increased generosity tended to keep people from leaving unemployment but what state did they not go into they didn't go they didn't leave the workforce it's at that margin keeping people in the labor force because you have to be looking for work to collect an unemployment check the notion that it raised unemployment because it reduced employment which i think is the burden of casey mulligan's argument seems to be completely contradicted by the data in fact i suspect there was no reduction in employment as a result of these liberalizations because operating outside the margin at which casey mulligan analyzes the world we had a major form of stimulus going to people who had been unemployed for at least six months before they got the first dollar of the benefits these are not people even if they are receiving an unemployment check that are not going to spend that money they're going to spend the money pretty fast and most analyses suggest that this has a very good multiplier so in other words they spend the money relatively quickly and it's used to purchase things from someone else so my guess is we changed the identity of the people who end up in jobs some of the people ended up in jobs who were not covered by unemployment benefits they got the job that a generously insured unemployment insurance recipient might turn down but in a world where you have insufficient aggregate demand to employ everybody who's already looking for work the notion that you greatly reduce the number of employed people through the program in the midst of a recession this severe strikes me as bizarre in the extreme so listening to this discussion uh trying to reconcile this the second part of discussion uh with with something gordon uh raised and perhaps something that was related to the first panel which is one structural change that seems like might be important is the increased long-term unemployed um and uh this might even be related to catherine's question about about the beverage curve so i agreed with the earlier remarks that it could be just loops and so on but there are but there are some things that suggest uh structural uh changes associated with the beverage curve one thing we see that's that that's gone along with the shift in the beverage curve is it is that the relation the job filling rate didn't rise nearly as much as you would have expected that as the hires per vacancy didn't rise and this this suggested that firms are especially reluctant to uh to given a vacancy to hire workers and the question is why there's lots of reasons why one possibility is that uh you know uh is is the composition of the unemployed um or are they is is now that friction much larger because there's this all these long-term unemployed in there trying to figure out okay who who are these guys so that seems like an important structural change but potentially and then as i listen to this last part of the discussion i think i think i'm hearing you guys don't think the safety net had any role in in driving this is that is that what i'm hearing am i hearing this correctly then i do think this is a structural change and i'd be interested in your own thoughts about okay if that's not what's driving it what else is and i've even hinted that there are other kinds of structural changes going on that might might be related but again i wanted to confirm you guys are saying that the important point that gordon raised of the change in the long-term unemployment is not being driven by i'll call the safety net on large on all the different dimensions you've been talking about i think that's what we're saying okay i think there's very little evidence that that that that that is true but but where i got a little confused is i i think i think i don't speak for everybody here but i think we agree with the re-labeling of individuals who might otherwise have been called out of the labor force are now still looking so they're now called un unemployed so i wasn't sure if you were including that in your sweep yes you are so i'm not sure why i think of that as structural though you know i mean i don't i to me that's a labeling issue um but i was sort of looking for larry katz because i think he's got a paper that has that suggests that maybe some of this labeling has some implications for what we're observing with the beverage curve larry okay oh right he's a team he's a cbo or yeah he left my impression is that from from work that bill dickens and one of his dissertation students has done is that the relationship between shorter-term unemployment and job vacancies has really not changed we're right on the same curve it is the long-term unemployed that have moved us off which is i think what you're talk which are referring to and and i agree i don't think that that uh is inconsistent with uh what we're saying uh in that a lot of those extra long-term unemployed at least up through you know half a year or so ago are people who are collecting benefits that in previous recessions really would not have been available to them and a lot of them are choosing to remain in the labor force in order to get a source of income during their long jobless spell whereas in an earlier recession i think they would have withdrawn from the workforce they just wouldn't have been called unemployed uh the unemployment rate would be uh three or four tenths of a percentage point lower i think uh and so again it's just a labeling issue but larry we were just implicating you um but you know and but the other part of it and i think larry i think i got this from larry is um that when they're in the labor force they have an identity of being a worker and one of the things that we worry about for the long-term unemployed is that they kind of slip away and just get very disconnected from the labor market whereas even if it's nominal where they have to call the labor department and push one um they have they they maintain their identity of the worker which may ultimately reduce the amount of scarring and ultimately uh minimize the the structural you know and to the extent that we move into having a structural unemployment problem with this group sort of the disability question that if if that's where people are ending up then they don't they no longer consider themselves workers right quite the opposite they're not they're not pressing zero you know it does raise the question of whether this group that is sitting there with this really extraordinary long-term unemployment whether we ought to be trying to craft some strategies to work with them because it seems to me their only long-term option increasingly looks like it's going to be ssdi right which is very costly well what are that's what i was trying to ask before what are those strategies you know i think it's probably re-engaging them in public employment kinds of strategies maybe using the new structure we've been using where you subsidize them in the private sector in the hope that they can then stay on when as things recover might be one there's a lot of interest you know on kruger and others with some kind of incentivizing process that would let you can match take a lower wage job like in trade adjustment assistance and and um and we'll subsidize that for a short period of time if that's really the obstacle i mean those are all things we might experiment with to try to figure it out i mean gary remembers that i guess it was the downriver effort to go after the displaced workers who were facing some of these problems and you know we didn't learn that much from that effort i don't i don't think is this the paper that you did suggesting that if you subs that if the employer knows that you're subsidizing the worker then they're less likely to hire them that was a voucher right okay yeah okay that was a different research project i wanted to react to one thing that john said i'm not sure this is right but i want to see what people think about it you made a statement about as the composition of those that are looking for work is being weighed more towards the long-term unemployed is that affecting in any way why these vacancies aren't filled and there are two recent sort of provocative studies that are of the order of resume type audit studies that show that you know two identical individuals the employer is much less likely to call back someone for for whom there's a longer gap on their resume so that would be consistent with with the question that you posed however my you know reflection about that as i was putting this through my mind and thinking about your question is that yes the the population of those looking for work is being more comprised of the long-term unemployed but there are so many that aren't long-term unemployed in our shorter term that one would think that there would still be many eligible folks to fill those vacancies but i just throw that out there as a possibility because this is some new evidence that i think is pretty compelling showing a reaction to gaps of unemployment on the resume well when you think of periods of time when there's been a lot of scarring and people have experienced really long durations of unemployment 1940 does come to mind and those scars disappeared with remarkable rapidity by 1943 so i do think that these experiments that show that employers differentially will make job offers or at least accept the accept the applications and consider people who have short durations of unemployment where whereas they'll reject people with the same uh career records who have longer spells of unemployment uh mean that those folks are going to be at the back of the queue to be hiring and so the only way to give those people at the back of the queue a good chance of getting hired is to just drastically reduce the number of people at the short end you know they just have uh dramatic improvement in aggregate demand so that so that employers want in the 90s convicts were getting hired that's yes hi i'm stephanie schmidt i'm with the us department of labor so one of the main themes of the panel was about the unemployment insurance system and its important role in the social safety net i just wanted to make a couple of comments on that and one is that a lot of states have big shortfalls in their state unemployment insurance trust funds so i know that folks at the department of labor are really worried about the next recession and how states will handle the next recession and there are some states in particular that are dramatically decreasing the generosity of their unemployment insurance benefits both in terms of the duration and the level of the benefits for example states like georgia and south carolina are reducing the the longest amount of benefits you can receive from 26 to 20 weeks so they're responding to the shortfalls in their trust funds not by raising taxes on employers which is one potential solution but by reducing benefits on uh for beneficiaries of unemployment insurance so i know that folks at the labor department are really concerned about that part of the social safety net frame so in terms of jim paterba asked us to you know suggest future uh research agenda and that might be one is to look at the particular those states where the the duration and uh generosity level of unemployment insurance has declined or is declining right now and see the effect that has on on the well-being of individuals who aren't employed my understanding is that that's that the next crisis um raises lots of concerns for um public intervention of all kinds because of all you know the rick santelli rant and things like that and just a lot of public opposition to um expanding the social safety net or the expansions that have taken place including 99 weeks of ui and things like that but yes so chris ersig with just a brief follow up on the macro implications of the abridgement of unemployment benefits and uh the fact that many people are running out of the period uh in which they can draw benefits is it you know possible or plausible that this would result in a relatively fast decline in the measured unemployment rate over the next couple of years uh but basically a lot of it occurring through a continued fall in the participation rate so from a macro perspective would that make unemployment perhaps a less reliable signal going forward any comments well uh i make monthly commentaries on the unemployment rate and i have mentioned the fact that uh the the those 99-week uh that maximum extension has been scaled back in all of the states because no state now qualifies for 99 weeks and and so there has been a whittling back of that job production and i have mentioned that one of the reasons that probably uh the uh unemployment rate has gained in some months is connected to the fact that some people are changing how they're classified they're just not looking because they don't have the monetary reason to say they're looking when a census taker asks them what they're doing but does that mean that they were looking before i think so yeah i think uh you know look who knows how people answer the cps questions but if they're doing what they're supposed to be doing to collect the ui check they're supposed to be doing something that looks like job search from the point of view of the census taker i'm not saying there's a one-to-one correspondent between what they say to either the census taker or the uh the person who's uh dealing with their ui claim but uh how often they're asked about that how often in some states essentially zero currently because they're so overwhelmed i'm just saying that they're actually not asked that question or you once once every 10 months i think i've saw the forms when you call them in by phone and it does say there is something on that on the boiler plate about looking for work they may not they may not be forced to answer the question but uh there's going to be some correlation i think uh the the the previous speaker mentioned these cutbacks in the duration of regular unemployment insurance programs uh from the private view of statisticians that's exciting news because now there's going to be variation in the maximum in the regular duration of unemployment benefits there had been an incredible amount of uniformity across all of the states for decades in 26 to 28 or 30 weeks and now there's going to be much more variation uh i think florida the maximum duration would be 14 weeks if the unemployment rate is 5 or something and that's my recollection and there are other states that have equally dramatic cutbacks in in a benefit that has been available in the united states for four or five decades for six months so i the after effects of this great recession may be a diminution in the kind of social protection that unemployment insurance offers i just wanted to add that i think we ought to be very worried about that and not only the duration but also what also is going on in terms of reducing the generosity of the formula for how much income protection is being provided on a week-to-week basis so i think that's something we ought to be extremely worried about moving forward all right well i think we are at break yes quarter tail half hour break okay thanks so you come all the way down to washington for these things i was here for the week foreign
