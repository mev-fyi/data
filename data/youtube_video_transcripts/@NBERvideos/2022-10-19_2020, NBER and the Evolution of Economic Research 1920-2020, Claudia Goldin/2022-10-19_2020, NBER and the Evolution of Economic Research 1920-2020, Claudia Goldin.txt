the MBR has been my home for more than three decades and I mean my real home so the field of human capital was not invented by NBR researchers but it was nurtured and it was expanded at the NBR so human capital theory is the notion that investments in human beings today as a payoff in the future and the investment Can Be An Education and Training and health and job search migration and so on so the human capital construct is really deep in the bones of economics and finds mention of course in the classical economists Smith mentions it not by name Marshall mentions it not by name um Irving Fisher mentions it by name but neither the phrase nor the meaning we used very much for some time so when did the usage of human capital spread so we can find that out of course through the wonders of a Google engram using the English 2009 U.S English Corpus at giving the fraction of volumes mentioning economics that also mention human capital so this is a percent this means of those books that are on economics essentially what fraction of those actually mentioned the exact phrase human capital okay so hardly anyone used the phrase before 1960 but the phrase takes off and by 2010 16 of all books that are on economics essentially use the phrase human capital and that's truly amazing I checked phrases related to human capital and they're not important so this is a real change and note the increase in the late 60s and also again in the 1990s now usage of the term increased by more than six times from the first edition of Becker's human capital that's in 1964 to the Third Edition in 1993 and you can see Gary there with the Nobel that he won in 92 and also his hair combed now we use the term human capital today as if there were always part of our lingua Franca but as we've seen it wasn't and part of the reason is that even economists not that long ago and I can actually remember scoffed at the notion of human capital free people were not supposed to be equated with marketable assets to many that would imply Channel slavery in fact Gary Becker admitted that he hesitated in 64 to use the term human capital as the title of his book and he employed he said a long subtitle and boy is it long a theoretical and empirical analysis with special reference to education to guard against criticism human capital eventually became a staple of micro Theory but it was actually called into being by the macro part of the economist's brain the impetus was to understand the ever-expanding residual and growth accounting NBR researchers such as George Stigler in 1947 MOA brahmovitz in 1956 were among the first to notice that changes in physical input measures could not explain changes in aggregate output kuznets bemoaned and I quote the con that the concept of capital formation was too narrow it should be broadened to include what he called investment in human beings okay so what did NBR volumes concern from 1920 when they began to 2020 where we are today now to get at the subject matter I had my R.A who was sitting in the audience today uh go out and find all the Library of Congress codes for the more than 800 NVR volumes that have Library of Congress numbers okay and then we use those we had to do that because these do not have jel codes as of yet and then we use those to code subjects that are more likely to use the human capital Concepts such as Education Health aging children labor women and migration and you can see here the fraction of NVR published volumes these aren't the papers these are volumes that share these subjects and that it didn't change very much until the 1970s and then again in the 1990s okay there is an anomaly I've taken it out and that's because the 1920s there were only 16 books and many of them were on not surprisingly international migration and immigration okay so it may be understandable why the phrase human capital would not have been mentioned early on but it is really less clear why so few NBR studies before the 1960s even mentioned the word education that neglect seems very odd since that was not supposed to happen okay it will happen soon but that neglect seems very odd since educational advances in the US were already enormous both in absolute terms and relative to educational improvements in other countries is my book with Larry and articles that we've written have shown the U.S had become a leader in education of its people so how could NBR researchers have neglected such an important part of the US economy and the reason was probably that they were just less concerned with the human component than they were without what I will call stuff stuff is stuff ingots we porn there are some exceptions to be sure and the most important is Friedman and kuznitz's income from independent professional practice published in 1945. that study was begun as a means to enhance national income statistics by Simon but it morphed and it became the most controversial volume in the history of the nber kuznets was the initial author and he was preoccupied with his other studies at the NPR and therefore he hired a research associate who had a master's in economics from the University of Chicago and that person was Milton Friedman and this study became Milton Friedman's PhD dissertation at Columbia University which he received in 1940. note that the book was published in 45 those five years of the controversy the Friedman acoustness research was important in a huge number of ways most of most relevance here is that it grappled with issues Central to human capital Theory including investment under uncertainty the financing of strangers income contingent loans equalizing differentials non-competing groups and the reasons for variability in individual professional incomes and differences in earnings across professions that's a lot the volume had enormous impact on a Pioneer of human capital research and that is Jacob mincer in 1957 after mincer had written almost all of his dissertation on wage differentials of fellow Columbia students said to him have you read Friedman and kuznets foreign work was a revelation to me I Saw The Light he said human capital became an integrating principle in my work he then took back his dissertation rewrote it he said in a number of weeks he then showed it to his advisor who then gave it to Ted Schultz and Schultz invited mincer to go to Chicago and in 1957 mincer went from Colombia to the University of Chicago also in 1957 the Carnegie Corporation of New York awarded the NPR funds to create a program on education and Gary was invited to head it as Gary said the Carnegie Grant was why I took the job at Columbia and the NBR rather than the high higher paying one at the University of Chicago he said my book on human capital was an outgrowth of that project and mincer went from Colombia to Chicago in 57 and Gary went from Chicago to Columbia in the same year and that began a magical period of human capital at the NBR more generally in 1961 at University's NBR conference assembled a star-studded cast on human capital Becker on human capital mints are on on-the-job training shosted on migration Stigler on Modern search theory weispread on education Dennis and on edu on economic growth and augmented labor mushkin on health I think of this as the human capital Oscars and Emmys rolled together that became a 1962 JP volume in 1967 a health program was established under the direction of Vic Fuchs in 1970 Schultz wrote a volume on human capital for the nbr's 50th anniversary colloquia and Schultz then headed another NBR conference also a JP volume that expanded the human capital Paradigm to include marriage the family infertility with up-and-coming young people like James Hickman human capital began to change research at the NBR and altered it more than it did economics in general how can we determine that by categorizing books and papers by whether they've referenced human capital but NBR working papers didn't ask for jel codes until the 1990s and econ lip didn't use modern jel codes until 1991. so what I do is I look at the period after 90 and we can use jel codes from econ lit for books and articles as well as words in the titles and the abstracts so this isn't searching the bodies of the paper but just the abstracts the titles and there are only two jel codes that mention the word human capital so let me summarize this quickly here you can see the fraction of all economics books from 1991 that referenced the term human capital in the way I just said this is all books there are a lot of them this is Bureau books and you can see that Bureau volumes aren't much different but around 2000 they become very different similarly for articles okay this is all published economics articles that reference the phrase this is the fraction of them that reference the phrase human capital and the title The Abstract or in these two JL codes the same thing for NVR working papers once again by the 2010s NVR wording papers have far more human capital content than all published papers what does this tell us about the NBR has the NVR just added disproportionate strength in human capital or of all fields begun to use human capital more and the answer is actually the latter all programs publish working papers in human capital trade development EFG Dae Urban PF Innovation productivity core Finance of all using the the Notions the concept of human capital okay in some I noted earlier that the term human capital is very popular in economics books what about business Cycles here the comparison goes back to 1900 at the NBR and more generally in economics we are no longer business cyclists the end of the nbr's first century one can confidently say that we are all human capitalists now thank you [Applause]
