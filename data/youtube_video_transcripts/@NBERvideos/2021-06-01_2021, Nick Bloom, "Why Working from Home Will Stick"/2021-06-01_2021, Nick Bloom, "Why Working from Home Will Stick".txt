so i'm going to talk about why working from home will stick uh this is joint work with jose barrero bermitam and steve davis from chicago uh you know question is why are we interested in this well i've personally been working on working from home going back to a survey the first server ever did on it was in 2004 so it's been a long interest and you know not many people are very interested in working from home but as you can imagine that all changed pretty rapidly in march of 2020 so since march of 2020 over the last kind of almost a year and a half i have been collecting a huge amount of data which i'll talk through today but also talk to more than 100 plus organizations a lot of firms but hospitals uh judiciary uh you know palo alto my local city council or research lab all kinds of stuff so i'll go through in the next 10 minutes kind of what we know when working from home and why it will stick so firstly today what i'm going to talk about is uh basically evidence based on a survey of 5 000 americans we've been surveying per month going back to may of last year so initially two and a half thousand a month but in the last few months we've been doing 5 000. it's an online survey it takes about 10 minutes we pay people to do it it's pretty straightforward it's a bunch of questions you can see some examples here how often are you working from home demographics what do you see the future doing what's your firm told you we take that and we re-weight it to match the american population at age 20 to 64. so you can think of this in a sense as a as a survey of working age americans the u.s labor force so first fact is working from home not surprisingly has exploded so before the pandemic you know from the american time you survey a very uh high quality accurate survey run by the bls a module in 2017 and 2018 that about five percent of full work paid working days were from home so one in 20 working days in the us before the pandemic were home 19 out of 20 times people commuted to their business premises during the pandemic that has gone up tenfold so 50 percent of people or sorry 50 of working days from home that generally came about primarily from about half of people working 100 of days me probably most people listening to this i suspect we're full-time working from home since these are primarily cut at university graduates and then 50 of americans are either not working or um we're working on the business premises and then finally post pandemic we see this is going to drop to about 20 so pest pandemic about 20 of days are going to be worked uh from home and about 80 from the business premises you can think about this in a very simple way which is roughly half of americans can't work from home so they tend to be people in more front line uh service jobs manufacturing healthcare people who need to work with customers work with equipment have to go in the business premises they've been doing that for the last year uh if they've kept their jobs and they are going to continue working on the business premises every day into the future the other half of the u.s labor force typically college grads tend to typically have higher pay jobs the managers they're professionals they're more senior jobs they can typically work remotely during the pandemic they have been working remotely five days a week that's the 50 number that's been running it still is kind of now it's about to end post pandemic the average plan they've been told is they're going to be working from home two days a week coming to the office three days a week so this this has been called the hybrid mode you've probably heard all about well this is by far the most common plan you know thousands upon thousands of people were interviewing and telling us if they are graduates if they're in that typically that better paid half of the labor force that can work from home they're currently full-time post-pandemic they're they're gonna be working from home two days a week and you know if you've opened a single newspaper or gone online you've probably seen this you know citigroup announced hybrid microsoft announced hybrid deutsche bank announced hybrid google announced hybrid out i could just go on and on and on you know so from talking to firms uh i hear that something like seven to eighty percent of firms that have made plans post covered for their graduates are talking about hybrids so normally three days in the office two days at home so why is this why is working from home sticking this is really the core of this paper why do we go from five percent pre-pandemic to 20 post why didn't we go back to five percent so there are five key drivers of why working home is going to stick and i'll go through them now so driver number one is what i call forced experimentation you know working from home under the pandemic was for many people a horrible you know terrible experiment is something that you know almost no employer no employer spoken to wanted but it's turned out actually against expectations to work incredibly well so he asked this question relative to expectations how is working from home turned out we've shortened the answers but they're in terms of efficiency as you think of you know as a kind of layman's term for productivity uh you can see that the overwhelming majority of respondents to the survey so over 60 percent report it's more efficient than expected and a little over 10 percent reported less efficient than expected i've run similar surveys of firms and you get a similar story so you know against expectations i don't know about people listing have the same view but certainly for me i wouldn't say it's perfect you know i prefer being in the office at least you know three days a week and seeing my colleagues i miss my colleagues but you know it's a lot better than i thought it would have been at least working from home and so it's turned out it isn't as bad as people thought and as a result a lot of people are going to stick with this you know driver two for sticking is that there's been a massive investment in uh equipment and time think of it as intangible capital in terms of working from home so in our server i asked two questions first on how many hours you've invested in learning to work from home effectively so thinking you know me personally like how i figuring out all the little buttons and extras on zoom on teams on go to meetings and web you know all the different stuff that people are using uh getting my you know office set up behind me i don't know if you can see but there are pictures on the wall that didn't used to be there i you know but also spending money i bought a proper uh you know a microphone and a webcam because the laptop i'm using didn't i mean it was pretty awful uh i actually bought a desk that lowers and raises so i find it easier to stand up at times i bought a swivelly offer you know et cetera et cetera so it turns out that on average americans have spent about 1.2 of gdp in terms of expenditure and time getting themselves able to work from home that's obviously a lot of money that's on the household side we can also look at the firm side it turns out during the pandemic uh you know jan eberly actually talked explicitly about this at jackson hole during the pandemic there has been a big drop in investment by u.s firms but one sub-component of that has risen which is this private investment in information processing equipment and software so it's not just households that had a huge explosion uh to make working from where impossible but firms as well have only on the company side so this investment is sunk and it's going to mean we're better able to work from home post pandemic fact three there has been a massive reduction in negative stigma around working from home um collecting data on this is hard you know collecting engagement stigma and perceptions is never that easy but i you know i've honestly not met anyone that disagrees with this perception which is on our survey we ask how have changes in working from home perceptions changed among so changed amongst people you know and again you can see something like 60 percent have said they've improved about 30 percent have said they've stayed the same and about 10 said they've got worse so again the overwhelming majority of people claim you know you when i used to work on working around going back to 2004 people would talk about working from home shirking from home or let's say you know working remotely remotely working was seen as very negative uh you know the joke was the three great enemies of working from home at the bed the fridge and the television all of this was very negative now that stuff's kind of vaporized because everyone from ceos downwards are working from home and you know it's not seen as i mean it's just seen much more positively i'll give you a very non-quantitative way to show this as well which is this is a screenshot of a image search of the word working from home i took in march 2013 so i went to give a talk in microsoft and obviously it being microsoft to use bing so i took just a screenshot of bing and i took a photo and used it in my slides just to show how bad the stigma or i'm working from home once because if you look at this there are i think there are maybe 19 pictures here and they're terrible they're like naked people cartoons people juggling babies very negative uh images if you look at the similar search terms that get pulled up working from home funny working from comics working from underwear working from cut i mean it's just really really negative stigma you forward this to this is the same search uh on being in 2021 so what eight years later and it's dramatically better if you look at the similar search words working from home office okay funny is still there but desk opportunities making money et cetera so this is a much much more positive uh image so you know the negative stigma about working from home is dramatically reduced have not gone away so fourth factor is there appears to be pretty major residual fear of proximity to other people so you know it's hard to say why maybe who watch too many of those horrifying sneeze videos do you know ever want to get into a crowded subway or into an elevator i guess as i'd say you would say in britain a lift but we asked this question after a vaccine arrives um i you know how much would you return to precoded activities this question has been updated you know now once you've been vaccinated but it's the same sense of once you've all been vaccinated what would you feel comfortable going back to doing and you see that only 28 of people report at least to us they'd be completely comfortable uh going back to pre-covered activities 72 percent say they'd feel uncomfortable with at least the subway or crowded elevators you know interestingly enough i've done a lot of you know exec ed on this i gave uh um you know for marcus's uh seminar in princeton used this question polled and his zoom in exactly you get very similar things in you know polling executes polling academic economists as you get from the general public on this i've done this sub in the uk very similar numbers you may think that people a year or two from now forget about this it's quite possible so these you know people may be hyped up now they may kind of move on having said that if you look at the flight data after 9 11 it took three years for air flights to return to their 911 level of course 911 was at that point an upward trend so it took you know six years to get close to pre-trend so and 911 was uh in some ways less impactful on you know mass uh psyche as covenant and the pandemic has been so i suspect at least a substantial number of people are going to be nervous about density and it's going to make it hard for employers to pack people back into offices and indeed from talking to a lot of companies they are very concerned particularly companies that have property and high rises that they ever manage to get people back at the density levels they will pre-pandemic and working from home is one solution to that then finally redirected technical change there's a very long history in economics about how technology you know has changes in the rate and direction as a whole program in the productivity and innovation entrepreneurship programming on the rate and direction of technology here's a great example of this which is the pandemic has tilted technological innovation increasingly towards working from home so with uh steve jobs newly assessed cover we have a another paper that looks at the share of patent applications that mention remote working and you can see of course after the pandemic starts this thing starts going up maybe you know it starts in february but of course the lockdown happened in uh china at the end of the year before as you updated the data you can see this thing going up and up again it's not surprising i've talked to a large number of tech firms and they are throwing enormous amounts of money in fact talking to you know hardware firms talk to logitech to um intel etc they are throwing enormous amounts of money at technologies that are going to facilitate working problems of course the market is dramatically increased so going from 5 to 20 percent your market's gone up 4x investments exploded and therefore it makes more sense for firms to invest in it as a result working from home 10 20 years from now is going to be way better and way easier than it was 20 years ago so if i think back to when i first started working on this in 2004 there was no video conferencing on the internet skype was 2003 are still pretty rudimentary there was no file sharing there was no cloud dropbox the cloud were kind of late 2000s so that's a very different era already uh you know now we you know communicate by video conferences we share files we share presentations all the time you know 10 20 years from now i assume technology is going to improve further maybe fantastic virtual reality you know it's hard to say what it would be but working from home will become increasingly similar to our thinking presence work so what about the implications for society they're mostly good they're two good things and one thing i kind of worry about good news one is uh post pandemic hybrid is going to be beneficial to most employees so i mentioned that most firms particularly for graduates are planning to have people work from home on average two days a week coming to the office three days a week we asked people what they thought of that and you know the bottom answer is most people like that most you know pretty much everyone likes that better than you know five days a week in the office and they on average people say that's equivalent to something like a seven percent pay increase in fact that's very similar to a paper in mbr working program by alex mass and mandy pelay on previous research and working from home found people valued that at equivalent to about an eight percent pay increase so this perk that roughly half as in the graduate half of the workforce are going to get seen as very valuable equivalent you know a pension plan or a kind of mean health care plan if you think of seven percent of pay good news too um working from home probably at least hybrid so people you know just to be clear working from home two days a week in the office three days a week should probably increase productivity by about five percent roughly three of that five percent comes from safe commuting time the average american commutes about an hour a day in our survey they report they see about half of that time is wasted time the other half roughly you know you can imagine people listen to podcasts or read but certainly that's a fair amount of wasted time each week that you can say by working from home the other two percent comes from oh yeah this is evidence going back over you know work i've done before in previous mbr work actually on a randomized control trail out in china that it is quieter working from home turns out working from home once the kids have gone back to school uh on average is more efficient because it's quieter what about the bad news i think the one piece of bad news for me is it could raise equity concerns so what i've done here is i've plotted again from our from our mbr paper barrera and davis on the y-axis is the number of paid days post-covered and on the x-axis annual earnings and the black circles here are what employees want so what they tell us they're like you've noticed pretty much everyone wants to work from home on average for about two to two and a half days a week some people want more somewhat less but by income level it averages out pretty flat about two in terms of what they say their employers they're going to give them is very upward sloping so folks down here they're low paid they tend to be frontline jobs they tend to be you know face to face the tasks they do i mean this is very much related to dingle and neiman's work you have to go into the off you have to go into the factory or the shop to be there you can't really watch my own if you look at high-end folks you know high-pay grads managers professionals they tend to be able to work from home and so their employees have said you know you guys on average you are going to get to work from home two days a week so in a sense this is a perk but it does raise an equity issue because the very group that's had the worst pandemic those that had to come into the workplace throughout the last year because they have to be there you know lower paid workers a post pandemic also not going to get this nice perk the higher paid university graduates are and you know from talking to firms this comes up all the time as an equity issue and a managerial issue and i think it's also an important political issue so to conclude um working from home you know gone from five percent pre-pandemic pretty low in fact only 15 percent of people ever worked from home preen pandemics it's not only low it's rare so 60 percent 56 milliliters peter and kobe run in the majority of working days in the us were at home to something like 20 post pandemic to give you a sense by the way of how long it would have taken pre-pandemic working from home is roughly doubling every 12 years so the pandemic has generated about a quarter of a century's worth of growth of working from home in basically kind of two years um you know there are a number of mechanisms behind the shift i think you know as we say again it's partly stick i think it has huge positive implications for work from productivity but i do worry about the kind of equity implications of this with that i'll stop and say if you're interested in further details uh it's in the mbl working page thank you for listening
