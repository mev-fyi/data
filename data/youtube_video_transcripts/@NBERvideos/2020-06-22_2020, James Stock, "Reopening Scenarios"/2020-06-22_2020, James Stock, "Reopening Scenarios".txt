it might be useful to start with where things stand in the epidemic right now and how that poses challenges for managing the economy and managing the epidemic and the relationship between the two going forward so as of today or as of the data for today which is yesterday transferred today June 17th you can see that cases for covert cases and deaths have been declining very significantly for quite a while in New York New Jersey Connecticut Massachusetts the rest of the United States not so much so there's declining deaths but in fact cases detect confirmed cases have been going up part of that is because of testing but if you squint here and you look right at the tail this is concerns about the reopening that have occurred in May and then perhaps perhaps we're seeing just the beginning of some of the results of the widespread protests although it might be a little bit too early to tell but what this especially this chart on the right hand side raises is significant questions about what reopening policies should look like so that we are able to maintain deaths going down while getting people back to work and also what might be the appropriate policies in case we see a second wave so that's what this paper tries to do it's paper names of looking at informing reopening policy choices part of one of the questions that we wanted to answer is whether a nuanced sectoral approach can promote economic recovery while keeping control of the epidemic and the key epidemic parameter here is are the basic reproductive rate and keeping that below one a second question is a second question is how do these interact with non-economic NPI's and NPI is being non-pharmaceutical interventions what's the interaction between non-pharmaceutical interventions and economic reopening generally speaking in the popular press or if you listen to the news as we all do there's a almost a synonym between reopening and economic reopening and I think one of the messages coming out of this modeling is that that's actually not there's questions about how a tree opening and subsequent closing those according to some of these roadmaps they're being put out but I think importantly in terms of ongoing work and I'll give a in some some high advanced Muse they go beyond the working paper of this ongoing work later and at the end of the talk which is what are the policy options that we're facing for a second wave what are different choices and what are the interplay between these various features so we're going to analyze this using a 66 sector economic model combined with a five age epidemiological model and need cause on both of those sectoral economic model that's important because as we know the sexual effects of the shutdown have been very different there's a fair amount of lawyers working but not so many restaurant workers working so that's a there's a big sectoral variation a lot of that is related to personal proximity or risk exposure among the workers at work and among from between the customers and the workers the epidemiological model that we're going to make this with is an extension of a standard si and now standard something that we all understand in economics now in si our model this one's extended to have a quarantine component and most importantly it's extended to have five different ages and the age structure is actually quite important because it allows us to look at important important NPI's like what if you in fact as we did close elementary and secondary schools the oldest people 75 plus especially those in nursing homes are their most vulnerable so we want to be able to model those separately and then there's actually a lot of age variability among workers in different sectors so a lot of restaurant workers are younger a lot of workers in certain manufacturing areas are older that puts that means there's different risk profiles and getting some of those nuances right is something that was something we want to do the next piece that we have here is having time during specification of non-pharmaceutical interventions and I'll describe that let me describe that briefly right now so non-pharmaceutical interventions I'm going to interpret that broadly as a combination of mandatory shutdowns such as closing school of school is closed you can't go to school on the other hand there's a large amount of evidence an increasing amount of evidence that that part of the much of the shutdown was actually due to voluntary behavior in anticipation of either in anticipation of actual shutdown mandates or even more to the point just self-protection behavior you stopped going to restaurants and you stopped flying because you're worried about that there's quite good papers on that now including some upcoming bookings conference next week so we're going to have a model of a model of these time varying specific time during non-pharmaceutical interventions and then finally we're going to put this all together by having a governor who follows the CDC guidelines now I'm going to talk about this exclusively as a governor but but but you don't need to think about it just as a governor actually it's some song you can think about this as a representative agent solving some problem decision making problem and and open and guiding their own behavior in terms of going back to work or going back to doing other activities but I'm going to talk about it as a governor who is able to actually set mandates there's a very large literature on this using related models now which is a great sign of all of the excitement that's happening in this area the seriousness with which people are taking taking this and the fact that they're putting it all through the nver okay so the part of this is going to be the least familiar perhaps is the age based contact model HBase sei qrd model so I'm going to spend a minute on that the core element of the context of this of this model is having contact matrices the contact matrices represent different age groups so we have younger work younger people 20 and under younger younger working age older working age and then we have two older compartments one sixty five to seven 65 to 74 and then 175 plus and these these this allows the direct manipulation of the contacts and the interactions that individuals have as we do things like shut down work and shut down subtext shut down sectors and shut down non-economic activity as well so for example no longer being able to go to play bingo or whatever the non-economic activity is so the left side of this of this chart shows a normal contact matrix under normal circumstances this is what we estimate the full shutdown contact matrix to look like so there's a lot fewer contacts you still see contacts along the diagonal because you live at home this would be interaction say if your spouse if you're in a full lockdown situation here's interactions with with children two children this would be interactions between a parents and adults and children and so forth and then we can imagine doing various permutations which is say just having two young go back to work this structure allows us I'm not going to go through the math but this structure allows us to compute something that we refer to as a industry risk to GDP to risk index and that asks the question of what happens if you add a worker to a sector so a worker of age a to sector I what's the effect of that on the overall log level of GDP so what's the growth effect on GDP of adding work of a worker of age a to sector I and how does that compare to the marginal effect on our zero of any network or adding that worker means that that worker is going to have more contacts possibly having more risks so there's going to be some effect on the overall progress of the epidemic what the ratio of these is a ratio of the marginal with the marginal benefits to the marginal risks and we refer to that as the GDP to risk index so one of the things we can look at in this structure is the question of what are the what's the value of a nuanced reopening I will say that after all of this work it's a little disappointing because our conclusion is that yes a nuanced reopening can make a difference but it turns out not to be that much of a difference so it might add 1% - or we might add a fraction of a percent or half a percent to the level of GDP in terms of how quickly you can go for a certain number of deaths I think in our normal times adding half a percent to GDP by a simple policy would be a great thing in these circumstances that's a still a relatively small number compared to some of the other interventions that we Ruth can you here's an example of some simulations so what we look at on the left here is we have a consumer we model the governor as being fairly conservative in this case and the sense of wanting to have a slow reopening and putting a priority on deaths and making sure that those deaths are declining and as those deaths decline then the governor is going to be able to follow CDC guidelines one of the gating criteria is that cases or declining deaths are declining and hospital utilization is declining and so by doing that they're able to reopen different sectors the restaurants can reopen people will go back to work if if they feel safe and they'll feel safe if the deaths are declining so that's the mechanism underlying the simulation of the left all we've done on the right is we've had people stop doing non work intervention so non work we've stops if we slow down if we relaxed in addition in addition to relaxing the economic restrictions we relaxed non-work non work NP is then all of a sudden those non work NP is sort of I guess one way to think about is they suck all the oxygen out and and the contacts that you make in non work settings going to church going to play bingo going to visit with friends having birthday parties those can over those can result in in this plateau of what the conservative governor does in response to seeing this plateau is basically slam on the brakes so that the reopening not only ends up at a much worse place in the end of in the end of December but it occurs much more slowly so that we're looking at high levels of unemployment I should mention that in the east charge this has not been up to these charge this predates the the may employment report what we're looking at here is it is ours not not actually measures of numbers of people working let me wrap this up by giving some highlights looking at what what we might think about for for openings according to a reopening excuse me not reopening but dealing with a potential second way so I'm going to look at a scenario where there's a reopening occurring and it's following the CDC phase one to three guidelines on a timetable that's representative of the timetables that different states are using and what we're going to do at the same time as having those reopening since those guidelines are across the board and they allow you to have group gatherings that go from say 20 to 30 and so forth what we're going to do is we're going to say okay you're gonna have increased non-work contacts both gifts coming over to your home birthday parties also having social interactions at the Little League games and those sorts of things and you're going to be more relaxed about not wearing masks if you do that and then we're going to say well what's going to happen I'll just give what's going to happen if we do that but then perhaps if we see a second wave what happens if you in if you open up but you're much more aggressive on the economic side but you reinstate the non-economic NP is well here's our opening up scenario and what you see is coming this is based on new modeling and those so coming down to the deaths this is the data through this morning you can see the deaths declining and we're basically on track for us for the death declining the governor and the individuals then relaxed or social distancing measure and as they relax social distancing death start to go up the governor is then gets cold feet and doesn't allow the restaurants to open the unemployment rate stays high what if instead what if instead right here on July 15th the governor had said this is not the direction we want to be going and I'm going to say no more going to church services no more going to Little League games you've got to wear masks if you're in public and we're going to enforce it what you see is that those non-economic NPI's have a massive effect in terms of in terms of the overall death rate and enables the governor to open up a lot of businesses and because the death rates are going down people are going to feel more comfortable going to work this can be actually augmented this is this is just using the masks and not having so as many social interactions outside of work if you augment it with if you augment it with additional protections for nursing homes so you don't go to the lockdown that we had in April but instead you will have to you could have testing and contact tracing for nursing home staff and residents and you could allow limited visitors under some protections that that path can be even better because you're protecting the most vulnerable population and if you implement on top of this some quarantine with only a 10% effectiveness for the general population then you see that all of these things taken together all of which are non-economic they're not shutting down Airlines they're not shutting down restaurants they're not turning down non-economic activities all of these make plenty of room for the economy actually to reopen and for people to get back to work so let me just summarize this the main lesson of these simulations which was a surprise to me is that frankly I mean basic basic the basic idea basic observation is that only about half of the interactions that people have are actually interactions at the workplace and those are the ones where where the contacts can be mitigated to a considerable extent through picture plexiglass or masks or spacing out desks so so even making the workplace moderately safe means that there's room for economic reopening and and that economic reopening is is can have fairly limited effects in terms of this flat spread of the virus the real issue is what happens in the non-economic sphere we do people wear masks do people go out and about without wearing masks do they go to 4th of July parades and that sort of thing and so I think the real the main the main lesson here is the message is that reopening and reopening the economy are not in any sense synonyms now there is a lot of questions one can raise I've modelled the governor is having his authority to tell people to go back to work and course it's not like that factors as I mentioned a lot of literature suggesting that it's a volunteer that a lot of the self protective measures have been voluntary you can tell people that they can't open a restaurant but you can't force people to go to the restaurant once it reopens for that to happen the diners have to be comfortable thinking that they're going to be having a safe experience and a pleasant experience and for that to happen you have to be honest and you have to be on a path that's like this where the virus really is getting under control and the way to get the virus under control is to have these Nanak and I love the economy is to have these non-economic NPI's in place and is as vigorous a way as we possibly can
