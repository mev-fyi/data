so uh today I'm going to do a 30 minute overview talk on Market design and Healthcare so a really simple topic for 30 minutes uh and I think at the start it's useful just kind of going over some some high level points which I'm sure many of you are familiar with uh one of the key points which is probably the case for many of the sessions that we're going to have in this conference is that free markets with limited regulation really do struggle to deliver in healthcare if you think about kind of the classic econ 101 type market and there's a couple reasons for that one reason for that is that the right to care or the desire to make sure that people have access to care essentially it implies the need for non-price rationing okay and the second reason that's in play especially in kind of more privatized versions of healthcare markets is you have issues related to adverse selection especially in Insurance markets you have issues related to moral hazard and you have significant issues related to information asymmetries not just in Insurance markets but also in provider markets going all the way back to kind of arrows seminal work on that point and so there's quite a few examples of uh specific topic areas in healthcare where Market design has already delivered uh successful research and successful results uh I'm not going to talk about the residency match which is obviously one of those areas that we heard about earlier today but two areas I'll touch on where I think there's been a lot of success but also some nice areas for future work our health insurance market so health insurance Market design and the second area which Rachel touched on earlier is vaccine Supply during the pandemic not during a pandemic there's different issues in both of those cases but both are kind of uh very uh important for uh for Market design or Market design is very valuable in addition to those topics which are a little more uh studied I'm going to talk about some new directions or new areas that I think are potentially very promising and those include things like payment models for Gene therapies which are an important kind of Direction going forward but also a stand-in for kind of high-cost Curative drugs in general I'm also going to talk a little bit about outcomes-based payment models for drugs and providers uh robust eternalistic Choice AIDS and I'll kind of explain what that means and then addressing provider deserts uh issues where there's kind of limited access to Providers and in some which is in some sense a market failure in certain settings okay so I'll start on the first topic which is uh health insurance Market Design This is an area I've worked in a lot and over the past 30 years there's been both a lot of research but a lot of policy implementation of This research and pretty deep connections between the policy uh and the research okay and a lot of both the policy and the research has really moved forward over the past 30 years or so I'd say um when we're thinking about Market design in this space there's a lot of competing factors or a lot of competing objectives that you think about as a market designer one of those especially when you're thinking about Market design with using private markets is how do we set up a system where there's competition that delivers both price uh kind of cheaper prices as well as better product quality there's a lot of concern uh as I mentioned in Insurance markets about adverse selection where uh essentially the relationship between cost and risk leads to potential under provision of more generous insurance coverage on the Intensive margin and selection out of the market on the extensive margin there's a key objective of redistribution equity which I referenced before and then kind of layered under all of this there's significant issues with consumer Choice quality consumers have Choice quality issues and insurance markets Choice quality issues using Insurance choosing doctors and so these are kind of a core set of objectives that policy makers and economists think about uh some examples of kind of how these principles have been applied in practice there's many many markets where these things have been applied some kind of core large examples include Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance for consumers in the U.S which uses a lot of kind of Market design principles uh from the literature uh the ACA exchanges Covered California as kind of one example of an exchange style Market uh in this space that's been heavily influenced by market design uh and then this is not just the U.S Centric Market design issue for example countries like the Netherlands have uh applied these Market design tools in the context of kind of quasi-private public regulation so in the space you know with these objectives in mind uh what if people studied and where has a lot of the work focused so far uh and there's been a lot of work in these areas there's also quite a lot of room for future work as well so on the left here you see kind of different tools or different topics that people have studied within the context of these markets which are kind of specific applications of Market design tools so one one aspect that I've studied quite a bit is contract pricing and duration so there are some of the variables you think about as the market designer is to what extent should price discrimination be allowed by insurers in this market the more price discrimination you allow the more Equity concerns you have the more concerns you have about consumers being reclassified year to year so so-called reclassification risk but when you allow more granular granular pricing there's less adverse selection kind of holding the rest of the things in the market equal okay so that's kind of an important trade-off with contract pricing that's been studied contract duration is also an important issue uh that's been studied so in many markets uh health insurance contracts are regulated to be one year at a time and most people when they kind of when they study Health economics they kind of take this as a given for the first year first two years and then at some point you know I've advised many students you you see them the light come on and they ask this question well why one year why not six months why not two years why not three years I think this is an interesting research and policy area uh I have some recent work uh that Gilly at all paper referenced here that thinks about long-term contracts with one-sided commitment on behalf of the insurer in this market and there's all sorts of issues where when you think about kind of making the contracts longer it's good for cutting through this trade-off I mentioned uh between adverse election and reclassification risk in the one year the time Market because you can allow for more uh upfront price discrimination but it leads to all sorts of other issues where you need to have the insurers front load the contracts in this one-sided commitment environment and then you're charging consumers more up front which brings up life cycle income issues and kind of more macroeconomic issues so that's one area uh in addition to that area a study a topic that's been studied a lot is subsidy design uh so subsidy design it's important of course directly for Equity consideration so how much of a subsidy will you give in these markets for consumers of different income levels there's also been quite a lot of research on how should you structure these subsidies so should they be fixed subsidies that uh require consumers to pay the full marginal cost of insurance premiums in the market or do you want to tie the subsidies to the premiums uh also on the margin in some way there's a really nice paper by Mark Shepard Shepard and Sonia Jaffe that studies this difference and thinks about kind of how policymaker uncertainty trades off with giving consumers kind of the full kind of marginal internalization of uh of the premium uh in the market uh in addition to subsidy design there's been a lot of research on frictions and in Insurance markets uh and some other markets selection markets like credit markets uh Choice frictions have in and of themselves that cause an issue where consumers aren't necessarily matching to the right products that can lead to issues where insurers aren't uh dropping prices or innovating as intended in addition in selection markets there's an additional issue where as consumers are making uh kind of lesson form choices or choices where frictions are more present it can actually help hold the market together by kind of mitigating issues related to adverse selection so there's a literature where when Regulators think about implementing Choice Tools in this space they have to be very cognizant of the implications that that could have for adverse selection I'll talk about that a little bit more on the next slide when we talk about tools like uh targeted defaults which are kind of powerful tools for impacting uh consumer Choice quality uh finally two other areas to mention are uh kind of product regulation which is really relevant in healthcare markets where we're thinking about just defining what's what are the products that insurers are allowed to offer what's the Actuarial value that's allowed what services do they have to cover are they required to cover how do we structure cost sharing in Medicare Part D plans these are important features because due to kind of aspects related to research like Rothschild stiglet screening models Etc and selection and selection Market models if you allow insurers to offer whatever they want in terms of quality whatever they want in terms of product variety there's significant issues related to cream skimming and so the product regulation aspect of these markets is very important finally I'll give a quick mention to what I call adverse selection corrective policies and so here there's been a lot of research on things like the individual mandate and health insurance markets and risk adjustment schemes which essentially reverse um intensive margin adverse selection uh in these Insurance markets and these are Market designer tools that are used in tandem with the other tools you see here on this list so that's kind of a sense of research that's been done a couple areas that I'm interested in going forward one question which is it's not exactly a market design question but it's very important for the consequences of Mark different Market design decisions are is this question of what are we getting from private insurance markets at all and so there's a presumption in the market design uh setup of many of these markets that the reason we have private insurance markets is that insurers are going to innovate they're going to offer differentiated products they're going to do things that are going to be different than one another that's going to deliver value to the Health Care system that's a kind of a natural thing for economists to think it's it's it's it's in some sense I think it's a big presumption uh and so there's very limited research actually quantifying ensure productivity ensure Innovation ensure differentiation but I think it's an especially important topic when we think about kind of different aspects of how to deliver value through the privatized markets here in addition uh on the choice Dimension I think an interesting question going forward is whether we can leverage benefits from private insurance markets using more aggressive uh Choice AIDS so there's omnipresent ongoing discussion how can we help consumers make better choices in these very complicated markets most research shows that any tools that are really pushing tools so consumers where consumers are going to have actively engage in the market are unlikely to cause more than 15 to 20 percent of the people who are making who have Choice issues to re-optimize right targeted defaults or default options in general are a much stronger strategy the data is out there to design individual specific default options that can really help consumers avoid cases where they're losing a thousand dollars for sure by choosing a plan or something like that but there's a lot of issues I think that haven't been studied related to robust design where if you're creating an algorithm that's going to really strongly help steer market share in these markets uh what are the implications going to be for how firms compete with one another how can you make this design robust uh so that firm gaming of this algorithm doesn't outweigh the potential benefits from moving market share towards more efficient options so I think there's some interesting things there the last thing I'll mention uh in the insurance space is that uh is the question of what are the implications of vertical integration there are many kinds of vertical integration uh between insurers and other firms the kind I'm kind of specifically interested in here is vertical integration between insurers and medical providers in the past five years there's been significant uh concentration and movement for insurers to integrate more with doctors up and down the supply chain of healthcare and there's very little research in this space but you can it's kind of easy to see how that kind of vertical integration can impact a lot of the design decisions and insurance markets and a lot of design decisions um kind of in the healthcare markets in general so moving on to the next topic which is uh vaccine Supply Rachel teed this up earlier uh with her discussion and I think here this is a topic that I felt was very important to mention as as an area where there's been progress research-wise but also where there's a lot of scope uh to make progress going forward as Rachel mentioned earlier and so here kind of two leading examples of things that were mentioned before one of them is the uh pneumococcal vaccine Advanced Market commitment pilot and so Rachel described Advanced Market commitments earlier Advanced Market commitments uh are essentially a tool where you're where you're promising to buy a certain amount of units of this vaccine from A supplier and essentially giving them a pull or an incentive to come to the market offer that product at low cost and then give them a share of a donor pool or a fund that's related to their capacity that they've committed to so this is a very classic example of Market design that's also been very influential in practice and the literature here thinks about poll funding where Advanced Market commitment is one example as well as push funding and these different types of funding and how you kind of decide between these mixtures of funding there are a lot of variables in the market that depend which of these mechanisms which of these mechanisms you want to use so is the technology that you're trying to bring to Market very close to reaching the market and so are you trying to incentivize uh increased capacity is it very far from the market and so are you trying to incentivize RMV and so as a regulator or as an organization setting up these funds this mixture push and pull funding how you use these tools I think it's an especially especially impactful area and especially uh interesting area for research going forward uh this figure here relates to the pneumococcal uh pilot Advanced Market commitment and shows that whether or not it was caused specifically by the advanced Market commitment this is a very successful area where uh poorer lower income countries really gain significant access to this vaccine after the deployment of this Advanced Market commitment better uh Rachel also talked earlier about vaccine Supply in a pandemic here I won't kind of belabor the point too much I think that the uh really interesting aspect of this which was mentioned earlier is that the vaccine Supply and the pandemic some of the design issues some of the market design issues are quite different than vaccine supply for example for the pneumococcal vaccine deployment and one of the lessons from this literature uh that we've seen across several papers is that in you know one of one of the key factors is in a pandemic you want the regulator to incentivize capacity building in parallel with the clinical trials for the vaccine and in fact even more recent Recent research has research has motivated the use or the need for building capacity in quote-unquote peacetime in order to be prepared for when the next vaccine occurs so essentially using capacity building and those kinds of push incentives for capacity building as a tool to uh be prepared for when kind of the next pandemic happens or something like that okay so those are two areas where there's been successful research so far as well as a lot of work still to be done an area that's a newer area uh where I think there's going to be a lot of um of room for research and a lot of room for research to connect to policy is uh payment models for gene therapy here for gene therapy you could also kind of substitute in high cost Curative drugs that also kind of generate lots of savings in the medical system after these drugs are taken in gene therapy it's essentially a leading example of Novel drugs or novel Therapeutics uh that either cure diseases or kind of greatly front load the cost and the benefits related to a certain disease profile so these drug these kinds of drugs can potentially uh deliver significant value uh but they're very expensive so they come with a very high sticker shock for consumers and for policy makers two examples I have listed here one is uh these are both approved drugs one is zolgensma which is a drug for spinal muscular atrophy this is a drug that's given to children for a very debilitating disease this drug costs 2.1 million dollars so you can see why that's kind of you can see the sticker shock element here but it's it's a drug that really helps mitigate a lot of the very negative symptoms uh associated with this with this debilitating disease another example of a drug like this is Lux Turner which they they say is priced at 425 000 and then you look and it's four hundred twenty five thousand dollars per eye you need it for both eyes and so typically and so this is a drug that costs roughly a million dollars and is used to treat inherited retinal disease so these are drugs that have the potential to deliver really high value okay you can see here a chart from uh Recent research by John Gruber and co-authors that shows that right now the cumulative cost of these drugs if you kind of start from the present day the kind of marginal increase in public spending or overall spending on these drugs it's not that high but as you go up over time more of these drugs are coming to Market you can see that the cumulative spending is expected to kind of go up and up and up and the y-axis here the scale is 10 to the 11 so hundreds of billions of dollars and so you can see that this is a market where there's kind of significant cost and significant scope for policy to think about kind of important issues one of the issues in this area I think is kind of especially interesting is how Private health insurance coverage in the U.S will interact with this with this type of treatment which is very high cost but Curative some kind of facts that I think make this an interesting Market design issue first uh churn across Insurance products is very high in the commercial US market under 65. some studies suggest it's roughly 20 per year people switching across insurance carriers uh second as many of you know patients met many patients most patients switch insurers or payer sources at age 65 when they're typically moving from private insurance to Medicare which is government insurance and then a third important fact here is that coverage rationing or coverage denials these are kind of key strategic variables for insurers when they're thinking about their their policies for that they're applying to Consumers so an implication of these three things together is that insurers essentially aren't incentivized to internalize kind of the long run benefits or costs of of their consumers they're more focused on the short term especially in private markets uh and if you think about that about the fact that their incentivized think more about the short term that means that these treatments where you might spend two million dollars up front save money in terms of net present value of course save lives say kind of quality adjusted life years these are things that might not be that attractive to them from a financial standpoint an additional concern that relates to the churn in this market and these treatments is adverse selection without additional Market design interventions if some insurers cover these treatments some insurers don't there's a massive Dynamic adverse selection problem okay and so some questions I think in this space are a little more specific but it's but quite interesting are you know what are possible regulator tools or Market designer tools to incentivize appropriate coverage so there's been some discussion of things like long-term reinsurance of therapy use there's been some discussion of securitization where basically someone buys the expensive treatment and then either on the insurer side or the consumer side this is securitized and paid back over time uh these are possible solutions with maybe the reinsurance one being a little more potentially successful a second question is should Market designers uh intervene to ensure full participation in some of these mechanisms so the reinsurance mechanisms or the securitization mechanisms um and a third question I think is interesting is what are the if you think about reinsurance schemes or securitization schemes what are the implications of that for drug pricing and also for drug Innovation okay and so here this chart on the right it's meant to kind of capture some of these trade-offs here on the left-hand side of the chart you have the private Market so the the x-axis here is age with age 65 being the kind of vertical line here and here the way I've drawn this on the private Market you have two types of insurers the blue insurers who don't cover the therapy the green insurers who do cover the expensive therapy they're both due to churn and adverse selection you're going to get a number of Market design issues kind of going vertically up and down in the private Market and then when you think about passing through past age 65 to Medicare there's going to be a lot of Market designer issues that are related to uh how insurers incentivize that or don't incentivize that okay so I think this is a really promising area for future work uh in addition uh there's some other topics I'd like to I'd like to tease that are new and interesting topics but uh in a little less depth than the last one one of these uh well two of them relate to outcomes based payments uh these are areas that policy makers and health have talked about for some time but there's been quite a lot of difficulties I think implementing really successful policies related to outcomes-based payments one of the main reasons for that is measuring outcomes has proven to be very hard both for providers as well as for successful drugs in the provider space there's an additional issue where patients are often seeing many providers so attributing outcomes to specific doctors is uh Challenge from kind of an incentive design and Market design standpoint so even though there's been some significant attempts like accountable care organizations and insurer driven pay for Quality programs this is still an area where I think there's a lot of room for research and a lot of room for thinking about kind of the information asymmetries and how you want to design these kinds of uh pay for uh pay for outcomes programs in addition to that kind of the more macro level on the drug side I think there's interesting Market design questions related to reference pricing so many markets uh either in the US or many countries use drug reference pricing as a way to hold down drug prices as kind of a default or de facto uh negotiation tactic and so a typical reference pricing scheme will say you know we'll pay you X dollars for this drug and X dollars is kind of exactly what private insurers in the U.S are paying or the lowest price being paid by private insurers or the lowest prices paid by this other country or the average price paid by this other country so this is an interesting area for kind of thinking about uh research and Market design because there's kind of significant issues related to Optimal design of these programs in equilibrium are you internalizing the externalities that your program calls on causes on the initial prices or the drug prices being uh given into other areas for example if many countries have aggressive reference pricing then drug manufacturers uh in the reference markets will want to raise the prices in those markets and so that's an interesting Market the same question okay a couple other topics uh that are in health markets one is quality scoring design and so this is a really important topic in both Insurance markets so trying to rate insurers based on quality as well as provider markets rating providers based on quality there's been some really nice new research in this area by uh Ben vatter who is somewhere here and here there's a lot of interesting Market designer issues how do you want to set the quality scores if you're thinking about levers what do we want to measure so have inputs into these quality scores how granular how granular do we want these measures to be uh and our regulator is going to layer incentives on top of kind of the measures themselves that are given to consumers in order to incentivize insurers or providers to kind of change their quality in line with these tools uh factors that these uh tools impact include Supply elasticity so how are you going to supply quality as an insurer or as a provider relative to these quality scores how do consumers internalize and interpret these scores in the marketplace and what are their demand elasticities with respect to these scores another area uh that's a separate area but I think has been understudied is uh the area of Provider deserts uh and so here I'm thinking about markets which some in these provider deserts I'm referring to they can have different causes there can be different reasons you could think about a lack of providers in rural markets in the U.S where this is a big issue you could think about a lack of mental health providers which especially in the past five years has been a major Market issue where in many areas consumers have essentially no access to this kind of uh to this kind of provider and so thinking about how you how you deal with this issue whether it's relative to entry requirements for labor into these markets whether it's regulation of insurer networks uh whether it relates to do you require doctors to participate in certain programs like Medicaid if they're going to participate in private markets there are a lot of important levers here uh and these things will ultimately end up impacting factors like labor preferences who gets access to care what's the cost of care what's the quality of care uh Etc so I think that's another uh interesting area okay a couple final topics uh to mention I mean I I kind of I missed the biggest topic up front even though I mentioned it a little bit which is that you know countries when they're thinking about designing their overall health health care system this is in and of itself a huge Market design problem right and countries do this very differently than one another uh the US is a very specific kind of top-down Market design uh which is more based on private markets the UK Sweden countries like that have more nationalized markets where both the doctors and the insurance is basically government run you have intermediate versions of the systems and then there's also been recent developing uh country research that shows how those Market design issues at the national level uh interact with development issues like uh bureaucratic constraints uh limited uh bureaucratic capacity uh and things like that okay um so I'm out of time let me wrap up uh I think hopefully this teases uh some of the interesting research that I hope will come going forward in this area I think if I was kind of trying to advertise for working in healthcare Market design I think we're pretty far from the frontier uh even on kind of the set of current topics that people have been working on there's still a lot to do but also this is a rapidly evolving sector as you saw with the example of gene therapy I didn't talk about the role of AI in healthcare but that's obviously going to have a very important impact over the next uh decade or even sooner there's really tight links between the research that's been done in healthcare and Healthcare policy making we see that in Insurance markets we see that in the vaccine markets I think that's a really something I personally love about working in this space is that you can do really interesting Market design conceptual research and really get people to listen in terms of in terms of what you're doing uh and you can use a range of tools right matching tools auction tools tools related to design with asymmetric information the last thing I'll mention uh which I think is an important aspect is that I think the market design Solutions in research researchers should really work to kind of emphasize and think about the robustness of these tools with respect to kind of key environmental issues and key implementation factors I think in the talks this morning in the energy and environment we heard a lot about kind of the political economy of tool implementation and I think that there's more room for that uh in this kind of healthcare research thinking about not just what's the ideal way to design it as an economist kind of sitting in my office but also you know say we have to change one of these Dimensions because of political economy or alter one of these Dimensions what will that imply for the way I've kind of I'm thinking about this Market design thank you
