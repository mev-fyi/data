foreign let's get started um the panel this morning is focused on bank saldency or in the discussions among the panelists we've broadened that a bit to financial stability more generally uh and monetary policy I as we all know in in this room in response to high and Rising inflation major central banks around the world raised their policy rates starting in 2022 and also reverse their balance sheet expansions to some extent in the U.S this has led to a 500 basis point increase in the policy rate and balance sheet reductions of 600 billion dollars or about seven percent of the initial asset level so most of the discussion has focused on the pace of tightening and the which was more rapid in the US than in Europe and the magnitude and timing of the economic response to the policy tightening um and of course the trade-off between inflation and unemployment but cracks in the financial sector earlier this spring have put more focus on the potential for instability especially after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank Signature Bank in New York the acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan Chase and the collapse of Credit Suisse in Switzerland this has caused some to ask how central banks should balance their inflation mandate against Financial stability specifically asking whether central banks should prioritize Financial stability at this point and whether that requires a change in rate and balance sheet policy or if instead Prudence requires that rate and balance sheet policy remain focused and that other Regulatory and supervisory tools for example to such as capital payout policies and supervision you'd be used to address the financial stability concerns while acknowledging that the credit channel of monetary policy particularly in Bank dependent countries which we'll discuss more today would transmit higher rates through tighter Bank lending in any event these approaches have very different implications for the path of policy the need for legislation and other implementing measures and the risks for the economy which may also differ across countries so for the panel today we're joined by Christian forums the lemelson professor of management and Global economics at MIT and a former external member of the monetary policy Committee of the bank of England Neil Kashkari the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and a current voting member of the fomc and Philip Lane is a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and chief Economist since 2019 was previously governor of the Central Bank of Ireland uh so we'll start the panel with Kristen's remarks we'll have short remarks from each of the panelists first then some discussion and if we're committed to time we'll have questions from the audience yeah okay thank you very much so my role as the opening speaker alphabetically and uh also is the one who is not in an official policy job right now is to provide a little background on the structure of thinking about potential tensions between monetary policy and banking solvency so I'm going to start with a broad overview of what the issues are the Frameworks we use to think about these issues and then bring in a few examples from the UK and then leave it to my colleagues to give you more information about the situation for the U.S in the Euro area I'll let you jump right in the topic for today Maybe is ah there we go uh the two goals two worthy goals price stability and banking solvency these are both important they are both interlinked it is very hard to have price stability if you do not have solvent banks in a viable banking system banking system collapses that generally causes a deep and severe recession and undermines price stability the flip side it's hard to achieve banking solvency when you have volatile inflation and you do not have price stability so two important but Interlink goals how do you achieve these goals there's traditionally been a fairly standard division of labor where there's different tools to accomplish each of these goals for example solvent banks are best attained through good regulation and supervision Prudential regulation macro Prudential regulation and if problems do emerge usually best to address them through liquidity facilities flip side to achieve price stability the set of tools is generally interest rates just interest rates to achieve price stability pretty straightforward uh the one area the tool where it's a bit of a fuzzy line is asset purchase programs asset purchase programs have been used to achieve both for example when covet hit in March of 2020 large asset purchase programs were announced largely to stabilize financial markets provide liquidity so really aimed at sort of supporting the banking system and broader Financial system but then that morphed into asset purchase programs focused more on achieving macro stability price stability and supporting growth and employment hopefully going forward we're going to see more clarity when central banks use asset purchase programs is it more directed at solvency banking systems or financial systems or more broader price stability but the lines have been mounted in the past but more or less when we're talking about achieving these goals key role for Price stability to obtain price stabilities to use interest rates banking stability use regulation supervision Etc now where the line has become fuzzy recently in what is the focus of our panel is if there's starting to be more 10 of the need to raise interest rates to achieve price stability if that could start to undermine banking stability and banking solvency and it's this tension which again I think is the focus of our panel so how could this tension arise so what I want to do for the remainder of my comments is just go through sort of basics of bank accounting to understand why there could potentially be attention if central banks need to continue to raise interest rates if inflation is more persistent than expected how that could start to undermine the solvency of banking systems so let me I'm going to use an example of a stylized bank balance sheet called The Royal Bank Royal Bank of the UK where I'll draw some of my examples um here's again very simplified balance sheet of banks now I think before we talk about the risks to Banks from higher interest rates it's important to start with what usually is the standard sort of standard issue is that usually low interest rates are bad for banks and higher interest rates are good for banks I think there's actually a great irony the period when I was at the bank of England when interest rates were quite low Banks came in constantly complaining about low rates so now that they're complaining about high rates it's quite a switch but the reason why central banks usually like higher interest rates is because the bulk of bank balance sheet is loans and deposits and when uh interest rates go up Banks charge more on their loans but they also have to pay more on their deposits but the the two rates don't go up to the same degree usually when interest rates go up Banks charge more on their lows or increase the rate they charge on their loans by more than they pay depositors on the deposits so that differential the net interest margin usually goes up when interest rates goes up especially when you're off the lower bound and Banks can make a nice amount of revenues from this and I am this net interest rate margin a nice presentation by Philip Schnabel yesterday talking about this how on average when interest rates go up about one percent uh the the differential is about 60 percent so 0.4 well the rate charge on loans go up by about one percent so again Banks do well when interest rates go up and I think that's important to keep in mind as we look at some of the hits that can happen to Banks because of higher interest rates some of those losses and other areas of the balance sheet can be balanced by this increased Revenue coming in from the net interest margins okay so that's the good news for banks Now where's the bad news when interest rates go up let me just uh oh sorry one side just for the UK this shows the increase in net interest margins in the UK when rates were low the revenue they made on this differential between what they charge on uh what they charge or pay on deposits and charge on loans was low when rates were low it's gone up and banks are now making a nice Revenue stream from that okay so where can Banks make losses as rates go up um the first area that's gotten the most attention from the runs that happened in the U.S are if there's a run on deposits we all know even well capitalized Banks a lot of equity can go under very quickly if there's a large run um that risk is settled down I think the bigger concern for banks now is that as interest rates go up people are starting people in businesses are pulling deposits to put them somewhere else where they can earn a higher return this is sort of a slow bleed we're seeing in banks around the world um we're seeing some of that in the UK this is what's happening to house deposits in the UK they went up quite a bit during the covet when savings went up some of the drawdown we're seeing now is just people drying down the savings they accumulated to doing kobit that's the blue but some of that money is being reallocated to other forms of savings some of it is still in the banking system in other forms of deposits some of it is going into buying guilts the equivalent of Treasury bonds some is going into other assets so there's sort of a slow bleed of money coming out as depositors take money to earn a higher return this for me seems like a manageable risk this is traditional effect of monetary tightening um as long as there's nothing that triggers a severe Bank Run again this is part of the tightening cycle and if deposit outflows start to accelerate because depositors want to earn a higher return Banks could pay more on the deposits there is especially because their profits have gone up quite a bit so there is room to stem this sort of slow bleed if needed okay so that's one risk turning to the asset side of the bounce risk where other risks of higher rates another one that's gotten attention recently is the losses from Bank holdings of government debt guilts in the UK and we heard quite a bit about this yesterday nbu research has highlighted some pretty scary numbers from the U.S if you calculate the losses on government hold Bond Holdings in the U.S banking system something around 2.2 trillion dollars if all of that is marked to Market and realized right away that's a big number roughly equal to bank equity in the UK in the U.S um so but those losses will only be realized if the bonds are sold if they're held and rates come down a bit um you will not have those losses some of those losses could be paid off over time by higher revenues now it's important to realize from across country's perspective those losses aren't as big in other countries other countries are forced to Mark to Market um and this is a nice graph that the oecd has put together other it estimates unrealized losses on the overall banking system in different countries from A one percentage increase increase in interest rates looks like Japan also has a big problem in this area but then Italy and the U.S after that most other countries are fairly low exposures to losses in the banking system from Holdings of government bonds in particular the UK is far to the right so yes this is something that should be watched it should be you should be holding some reserves against this but especially if interest rates do start to come down we will not fully realize all of the losses that we're hearing these large numbers about today okay other risks on the asset side the biggest area is loans if the economy slows we're going to see more defaults and you're going to see defaults from households on their loans and also from non-financial companies how big a risk is that so and where there has been a lot of attention to the losses from higher interest rates in on mortgages people being unable to pay their mortgages and that potentially leading to defaults which could hurt Banks not surprised there's been a lot of attention that's where the last crisis occurred in 2008. so this is where I feel like we do have a pretty good grasp of what the risks are banks have been pretty good about Capital um um hygiene against this preparing for these risks because again we're always good at fighting the last war um and also I think these risks are not nearly as big today as they were in 2008 for example um couple reasons first here's the the key way to assess risks around higher mortgage interest rates putting pressure on household so they default on their mortgages you look at Debt Service debt household service ratio ratios or dsrs basically look at your ability to pay your debt relative to your income you see these are going up a bit in the countries we're talking about today um but the The Debt Service ratios are still quite low compared to where they have been in the past some countries these risks are quite a bit bigger for example Sweden Australia Canada that's from a combination of factors one those countries people have just taken out more debt and second more of the debt is floating rate so higher rates pass through more quickly but UK and U.S the risks are smaller partly because we have more fixed rate debt although in the UK it's only fixed for two to five years so those risks will come soon but U.S risks are slower but two other reasons why I think these risks are manageable one is although Debt Service payments are going up incomes are going up too incomes are going up in a solid clip wage growth in the UK just announced yesterday 7 percent annual wage gains that helps cover higher interest payments the other factor which I think hasn't gotten enough attention is that as mortgage interest payments go up this is data for the UK on the left mortgage interest payments are going up that's going to put pressure on some households but the blue shows that households are also earning more on their savings and even with any savings in the bank is now earning some real money granted it's not the same people people with Mortgage Debt aren't the always the ones with savings there could be different marginal propensities to consume but over on the right it shows that on net although people are still paying on netsum they're paying less because earnings overall on savings have gone up more than the increased payments they're making on their mortgages so again risk to watch those costs will grow as some of the refinancing of mortgages kick in but manageable now last one I'll talk about on the loan side um risks from defaults on loans to non-financial companies a lot of attention to risks in the cre market and that is a real risk cre Market has been hurt uh commercial real estate values have gone down some of that is from higher rates some of it is from a Readjustment of where people work cities that you're less people are working in cities so that's a double hit on the Sierra Market there's going to be losses there but again this is on the radar banks are calculating that in cap um holding Capital against it in the sector of the non-financial companies I worry about more is small and medium-ized Enterprises these are where sponge media number prizes don't have other places to go for funding other than Banks it's getting harder for them to get access to lending from Banks default rates have gone up for smes smes took on more debt during covid than larger companies and defaults have increased they've come down some but they're still high and smes are an important source of employment in the UK it's about half of jobs so if we see more challenges in this sector this will start to bite and is something to watch so the last one which I will not have time to talk about um set of risks is from Banks related to the non-bank financial sector Shadow banking system I heard quite a bit about this yesterday in in this room um I think these risks are so diverse um it's again hard to talk about in one minute um but hopefully in the panel we can talk about this is non-bank financial sector has grown in this era of tighter regulation on Banks and low interest rates the non-bank financial sector is now shrinking and that will involve some risks to banks that are harder to assess because it comes from some very different sectors so to title up some final thoughts key points to take away um some tightening and financial conditions is necessary it's part of the adjustment to achieve price stability inflation is too high in most of the world we have to tighten Financial conditions it's going to affect banks in the broader Financial system but the impact on individual Banks and Bank solvency will depend on the specific exposures and financing of the individual Banks some banks are going to gain through this process from higher interest rates um others will not um but should all this imply that we should diverge from our standard division of labor when adjusting rates should we back off tightening interest rates because of concerns for banking solvency I think that's a very high bar and we haven't reached it yet um yet at least we might in the future but at least not yet I think in order to sort of hold off raising interest rates to address inflation you must have a real risk to bank solvency that is not better addressed through other channels and at least for the UK I don't see much tension today between price to building Bank solvency the priority for the UK needs to be bringing inflation down this is core inflation uh take out the temporary effects of energy food prices core inflation is starting to turn around it's still too high in advanced economies around the world especially in the UK it's about seven percent in the UK this does not seem the time to back off raising interest rates because of concerns about the insolvency thank you thanks Christian say it on um and the next speaker is Neil Kashkari uh good morning thank you to the organizers for inviting me it's great to be here uh participating in this important conversation uh let me just give a preface that my comments are reflect my own views don't necessarily reflect others in the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee this morning just a few moments ago I published an essay on the Minneapolis fed's website and on threads that goes through my that goes through my comments in a lot more detail and so I'm just going to give you a very quick summary of that here and I look forward to the discussion with my fellow panelists with all of you in order to preserve anchored inflation expectations central banks must bring inflation back down to their targets in a reasonable period of time but price stability and in the case of the Federal Reserve also maximum employment are not our only objectives that central banks must aim to achieve as Kristen just said ensuring Financial stability is our is also a primary responsibility for central banks because Financial crises can cause great hardship to Main Street now managing inflation and financial stability are usually distinct and often complementary goals where central banks limited policy tools can simultaneously work to support both objectives but these goals can come in detention at times creating a dilemma for policy makers to decide which objective to prioritize in recent months such attention arose when some Regional banks in the U.S ran into trouble due to security losses triggered by poor risk management at these firms in the context of policy makers having raised interest rates to combat High inflation although today overall the banking system is sound and resilient Bank stresses nonetheless could emerge again in my view given the risks that these banks have taken on the outlook for some Regional Banks largely depends on what happens to inflation now if inflation Falls as markets currently expect then allowing policy rates to fall bank balance sheet pressures would likely reduce as longer term rates fall which would cause asset prices to climb however if inflation proves more entrenched than expected policy rights might need to go higher which could further reduce asset prices increasing pressure on banks in such a scenario policymakers could be forced to choose between aggressively flighting and fighting inflation or supporting banking stability increasing Bank resilience now could reduce the chances for such a difficult tension to emerge because Banks would be positioned to handle further Mark to Market losses that would stem from higher policy rates this would then minimize the risk that policy makers face a difficult choice between bringing inflation down and maintaining Financial stability however the historical record shows that banks are unlikely to take meaningful action to enhance their resiliency against this risk on their own in my essay I walked through all of the options that banks have and how there are very few good options for banks so Bank supervisors should instead use their own existing authorities today to ensure that all banks are prepared to withstand a higher rate environment so with that brief summary I look forward to our discussion thank you and the last speaker Philip Lane if you okay uh thank you it's a pleasure to be here um and it's I think a very well-timed uh session after you know a year of policy hiking at the ECB um we know the lags in monetary party are more than a year so there's a lot to to think about and to discuss and over the next year or two we will learn quite a bit and a bit like Neil I did put out on the ESP website a long version of what I'm about to say I don't think trads has been released in Europe yet so so I'm afraid you will actually have to go to the ESP website um so what I want to do is first of all raise a few issues about you know basically which you know falls under is this time different you know what is similar and what is different between the current configuration versus historical uh titling Cycles uh then I'm going to Sprint through a few uh basic charts and then offer a couple of final remarks but again all in the context of the more considered uh argument is on the longer essay so let me point out a couple of things about uh just as a reminder in terms of European situation in the last year rates have gone up by by 400 basis points um and there's been a a lot of shrinkage of the balance sheet and again to emphasize in the European context it's quite different to here in the US because yes there is a as a roll off of the asset portfolios but the big reduction the balance sheet so far has been the reduction in in at this targeted Landing program so there's a very large creation of Central Bank Reserves to to have a large Landing program to two Banks during the pandemic and that that is moving down quite quickly so the overall contraction in Central Bank Reserves so far has been mostly driven by that now what I want to emphasize is the banking Channel I mean you can go a long way of course just by looking at well how does the economy respond to interest rates but the policy rate but actually the whole yield curve you need to look at but then especially we know to your area is a bank dependent region you do have to think about the different channels we say okay uh all of this is going to be Intermediate intermediated by Banks uh one ounce of that is the balance sheet Channel which of course really is three components one is the balance sheets of banks themselves then the balance sheets of their corporate customers and also their household customers the second is the back Landing channel in the sense of you know what you know what are the incentives to to land as opposed to hold their bonds or make other decisions there from a bank point of view and then uh whether it's the third Channel or sub-channel of that is the risk-taking channel and again when we had this Titan cycle uh does the attitude towards risk taking change so let me say that there's four categories of topics which you know many people are discussing in terms of is this time similar or different one and again it's true in the US it's definitely true in the in your area if I go back to 2019 when I started ECB the dominant conversation in Europe is is Europe turning into Japan are we turning into chronically low inflation uh the pricing the surveys and the pricing had policy rates would be negative for a long time and might barely get to a zero policy rate by late 2020s which is not where we are now so before the pandemic that was the kind of conjecture so essentially what's happened now is really two factors one there's been a permanent change in the sense of unless something new happens No One Believes we're going back to negative rates the surveys we have in the market pricing basically says X years from now the policy rate will be about two consistent with a real rate around zero so minus 0.5 to 2 is basically priced in Forever and then on top of that the fact we're now at 350 probably going to 375 in the next meeting that is a if you like kind of cyclical tightening which people don't believe will last forever and then in terms of instruments No One Believes we're going to go back to large scale QE or large-scale targeted Landing anytime soon so the scale of the balance sheets uh is it going to be a lot smaller than was previously expected so compared to late uh 2021 before we've started turning uh the expected balance sheet now is probably running a trillion lower in turn in expectation which is you know quite a turnaround and then the question is uh when multiple how does Market policy work when you have not just a cyclical touching but a long-term shift in policy how does multi policy work when it's not just about rates but it's also about the uh the basic choices facing Banks and the fact uh this basic liquidity environment we lived in we also have to think about the fact that the balance sheets of banks households and corporates look reasonably good going into this shock the pandemic was a windfall for European corporates large-scale fiscal transfers uh helped European corporates and European households uh because of foresaving had a kind of a exogenous if you like Improvement and balance sheets and compared to 15 years ago banks have a lot higher Capital have a lot higher liquidity than they did beforehand and all of those matter but equally we do everything about in all those cases uh what is the behavior behind that as opposed to saying Well here here's my state variable and how it moves things I may I like make the last point which I think is quite relevant for this year there is a difference between how a supply driven inflation stock operates first as a demand driven so last year when we had this last year the year before when we had these adverse Supply shocks we had inflation going up and basically downgrades to the economy and both of those would be I suppose bad for for bad decision making uh whereas this year we have to reverse alert those Supply shocks so yes we do it for interest rate hikes but we basically do have a rising employment as Kristen said um and and Rising wages and so in the context of if you like the macro picture some of those are you know do need to be counterbalanced whereas if it's a reversal of a demand shop which is maybe more in the U.S style when that demand shock reverses then the economy slows down up repression unemployment and so on so so the interaction of the bank Channel with that macro channel is relevant okay so so those are some open questions but let me quickly point out a few issues here so in terms of the the funding costs facing Euro area Banks you can see both in terms of the last 15 years and the last year or so uh you've had this fairly sharper increase where of course the most spectacular increase has been in if a bank wants to issue a bond the cost to it of bond financing the blue line is is the composite uh change is the balance across the different funding lines of banks but let me emphasize is over time that is moving because over time uh many European households work out I need to make the efforts to move out of my overnight deposits into a time deposits or even into a money market account and so on so over time the the availability of these different options that moves let me uh point out and let me focus on the right side here in terms of a pass-through so the the dotted lines here at the US the solid lines of your area and even though the policy rate in Europe has gone up by less and more slowly uh maybe uh it's interesting to note that time deposits in the EU area have gone up more steeply than in the US and in terms of overnight and also marceny overnight in the area has moved us more so if you like in the uh in your area more of the adjustment is between overnight and and term whereas in America I think people go to money markets and more of the adjustments outside out of the banking system into the money market uh let me emphasize going back to this recurrent point I have which is the balance sheet reduction where is it showing up it is in our surveys uh both the QE the market policy portfolio and the taltro uh until the mid of last year the bags are saying this is a basically helping us we're creating so much liquidity uh we're going to provide more Crowders now that is turned around in the shrinkage phase they're not reporting one reason why we're tightening credits is the last of these highly liquid options to us so in other words it's you need to go beyond the policy interest rates and look at the balance sheet to understand the behavior of European Banks uh let me compare what's going on now to previous cycles and what you see here and we go beyond just the limited history area to also look in bundespanic history is that this is a fairly sharp tightening uh much more rapid than than before for a good reason um and so we we do have to think about uh what we learned from these more gradual episodes uh in the past but I won't dwell on this point for now uh but what we do see which is striking is there's very rapid adjustment in credit volumes in in the Europe so creative volumes were running about 40 billion a month uh at this time last year they've been basically around zero since last autumn so so this is a sharp uh change in credit volumes and on the right side there's some comparison to previous Titan episodes the dotted green line is what the models pretty like the vars predict if all that happened was policy rates went up and the solid green line is what's actually happened and it's a lot sharper and again the Gap there can be maybe interpreted in terms of these uh balance sheet reductions so let me compare again uh to the US I mean in terms of loan Supply credit standard indices I mean does RC attaching both sides and easy on the left but maybe I'll emphasize on the right the solid blue line is European credit volumes to corporates the Orange is creative arguments here in America and you can see here a much sharper stop in the European data so credit volumes have come down in in America but much more gradually and from a higher level whereas in Europe uh it came down much more sharply and it's not recovered even though the supply the supply shocks hit in Europe last year are reversing um so we maintained a loan Supply indicator to try and capture what's going on over and above the kind of uh interest rate Channel and it's uh moving up uh quite a bit um and in terms of loan Supply going back again you can link it to to uh the balance sheet as well as to the rising funding costs but maybe I'll emphasize is the history of uh loan Supply shocks is it does reduce GDP so so what I have here if you like the red line it is the medium this is captured as a if you have a loan supply shop that reduces credit by one percentage point of GDP and these calculations say that the meeting is that it reduces GDP by 30 basis points but there's a wide dispersion here this is a meta-analysis across many studies uh it can generate much bigger drops in GDP you can drop generate smaller um but if you like it what I'm saying is the median is a drop with uncertainty uh what we've seen so far is large corporates are less affected younger in smaller firms have seen a big turnaround in credit volumes and again going back to what Kristen said about the world of smes especially in the European context that's quite something so I know I know I shouldn't overstep on time uh so maybe I'll just finish by saying uh so far we've seen a lot of movement in the financial sector uh because you know people move slowly in terms of their behavior it's clear that that we're only at the start of the impact of that on the read economy throughout the whole thing I'm emphasizing there's an interaction with the macro developments which are being relatively contained in Europe so far but again going towards risk factors we have quite a good GDP forecast as ECB with GDP uh no doesn't grow in line with what we expect then this banking channel will probably interact with us and then going further of course all of this is in the context of essentially not much indication of significant stress whereas if we get an exogenous shock to stress that lasts more you know more durability than the marked shock uh then of course we would have to think about that so all of that put together saying we don't have a mechanical view of this this episode is sufficiently unique you can't just impose one set of calculations about how monetary policy works and that's why we're very data dependent in in calculating monetary policy in the upcoming meetings and we will we will have some news before the next meeting at this Bank Landing survey will be published a day or two before the meeting so let me let me stop there that gives us a lot to think about and we'll download your paper from the ECB website also can you hear me it's fun okay thank you um so let me go first back to to Neil who left uh a lot uh on on the table from his uh Fuller remarks that are that are available um you there seemed to be a lot of unanimity about keeping the eye in the US on inflation and using other tools to address Bank stability and I want to connect this to Phillips comments about uh The Lending Channel and the liquidity environment more generally but Neil you you said we should rely on supervisors and existing authority to focus on uh Banks and potential for insolvency instability so could you elaborate a little bit more on that sure thank you you know if you think about it from the perspective of a bank what can a bank do today that is already facing large Mark to Market losses the options are really limited number one you could say well go try to raise Equity well if you look in the U.S Regional Bank stocks on average have not recovered so it's very difficult for a bank to raise equity in that context investors don't generally don't want to invest in funding somebody else's losses and there's also the risk of a failed Capital raise which was the trigger for the svb run in March number two people talk about selling assets well if you sell assets that are already lower marked it doesn't do you any good unless somebody's willing to pay above market prices so that's not really a realistic option third is to restrict your payouts many banks have already limited their share BuyBacks so you're left with dividends how many Bank CEOs are going to willingly cut their own dividends very few because for fear of hurting their own stock prices so that just very quickly lays out banks are not likely to take action on their own so what could supervisors do one option would be to run a new stress test that is a specific High inflation stag inflationary scenario now in a traditional stress test that we run what ends up happening High interest rates as Kristin said the traditional view is high interest rates are good for banks so a high inflation High interest rate environment is a positive shock so that's typically not very interesting to stress so to speak so you'd have to run a dedicated stress test showing a stagflation very scenario High inflation High policy rates for an extended period of time possibly leading over to credit losses on the real economy side as well to really expose which banks are now exposed now overall as I mentioned the U.S banking system is well capitalized overall the U.S banking system is sound I'm talking about exposing or identifying which are the individual Regional banks that have a lot of exposure and then using those results of the stress test go to those individual Banks and say now you need to put together a plan to address this given the limited tools that the CEO has that would then lead you to some type of dividend payout restriction to build Capital the advantage is something like this that I see it is it reminds me of the 09 stress test you know the Federal Reserve did the stress test in 09 went through this very complicated analysis and then said this is the assessment where banks are if banks take these steps we have confidence they can endure this High inflation scenario so in a sense it'd be confidence I think it would be confidence boosting because The Regulators have said supervisors have said we think this plan works and now if inflation then Falls from here as markets expect and as we all hope then this will be this problem will largely go away and Banks could then return Capital to their shareholders once we're through this inflationary episode so I don't think we are uh incapable of addressing this I do think it would take some very sharp supervised reactions to make sure that every Bank it was in a position to endure this okay well well just quickly to to cross-reference at Neland stress testing uh for those who keep track the European banking Authority uh stress test of European Banks essentially does this kind of stock trading shock uh quite a big drop in GDP coming from a supply shock quite a big increase in inflation and interest rates uh and uh those results are coming out at the end of July so so you can you can see for yourself at that point I'll actually jump in there too the bank of England just released this morning a result of a stress test that was similar to what you you announced they hid interest rates going up to six percent which probably seemed High when they did the test now they're getting pretty close their Market expectations are five and a half but they had unemployment more than doubling to eight and a half percent inflation to 17 and house prices Falling by about a third and and then they ran exactly the scenario you did Banks looked like they were well capitalized for now but uh I think that is a good example of what should be done more in the future so the in the in the theme of thinking about if not uh if not working through policy rates what other tools can be used so supervision um Philip emphasized for the ECB the credit restrictions working through banks and through the lending Channel um so for the U.S what are the alternate tools that would work through the lending channel to I've changed the liquidity environment and you know we had talked about quantitative tightening taking a different approach to the balance sheet are are there options along the line for the U.S along the lines that Philip described were effective uh in Europe recognizing the very different institutional environment um I mean I think it's certainly uh theoretically possible if you wanted to you know you could change the balance she'd run off in the US to try to have an effect on the long end of the yield curve at the end of the day a lot of the Dynamics we've been talking about for banks is really about the shape of the yield curve an inverted yield curve does not work for banks because their funding costs are higher than their lending costs and if that's an inverted yield curve for an extended period of time a lot more banks are going to feel a lot of pressures as a result of that so ultimately in terms of your outlook for the banking sector you need to take some outlook for the yield curve and how long it's going to be inverted and how high rates are going to go um I for one would be loads to tweak our balance sheet runoff I think our balance sheet is running off in a at a Brisk Pace roughly twice the rate that we did in the last balance she'd run off it's been quite effective going on in the background financial institutions have been able to plan for it have been able to adjust to it I for me I think the ball would be quite high in tweaking our path for the balance sheet runoff jump in it's a tool I wish we could use except unfortunately the US did not sit in place well enough in advance is greater use of counter-cyclical capital buffers you know the bank of England has used the ccyb again I think they could have used it more aggressively other countries have the US has been slow to do that and that would be an easy fix right now without having to get into changing balance sheet runoff or other other issues of if there is more of a problem in the banking system without having to back off what you're doing with interest rates go back to to Philip with one uh question about banking stability before we open it up so you can think of your questions um we one of the additional we've we've mostly focused on the regional banks in the U.S but of course there was a a big failure uh in Europe writ large but the credit Suite is being taken over by UBS and Philip was quick to point out to me that that's a Swiss bank uh so um so so his responsibility and Authority is limited there but uh we did want to ask about spillovers uh for the rest of Europe uh yes so I I'm sure to switch people in the room will agree with me Switzerland is not part of the uh EU um and uh what I think I'll see uh with this case this was a kind of a essentially a a global bank it was not something that the problems were not emerging from the European situation it had its kind of business model issues if you like uh but but the potential spillover what was essentially uh the decision uh if you liked it to kind of surprisingly uh write down the value of 81 miles uh using kind of supervising discretion uh and since this was a not expected even though it was in the documentation there was a risk there could be a spillover to uh the 81 markers where a lot of contingent capital is raised by European Banks uh but the you know supervisory authorities in Europe were pretty quick to come out and say uh that what happened in Switzerland was possible under Swiss law it's not something that's envisaged under European Union law uh and that market has been reopening um and remains an open question of whether it was basically a temporary uh uh episode in terms of spillover or whether there may be some longer term Footprints but right now because the market is reopening uh I wouldn't say the worst case scenario is developing
