china seems to present and seems to present an enormous puzzle and here's the way and here's one simple way to see it that the world bank carries out a detailed survey of 185 or so countries in the world and they and they collect granular data on a bunch of different things that that private businesses do so things like you know how long does it take in order to get a license how long does it take to get a power cut how long does it take to get a power connection and if you look at the data in 2013 and now there's a reason why i end i i chose 2013 because something happened in 2013 to the warbank doing business indicators uh if you look at the world bank's data on on the ease of starting a business okay uh china ranks 151 in the world there were 185 countries in the survey in the year so it's it was it was near the very bottom of the world in terms of overall ease and basically what they're measuring is basically you know how many taxes do they pay the rules that you have to follow and just to get a sense of what 151 means the democratic republic of the congo so this is the the this is the uh drc of mo butu it's 152. haiti does better at 140. so when you look at metrics like like this since uh since here you know china looks very much like what da don would call a failed state uh uh uh so what we want to do is to try to explain this puzzle why is it that by metrics like this it looks like a failed state but in terms of outcomes it looks very different so the way i want to start so i want to start with just uh giving you a story of what is it that happens on the ground what what is it that happens to the ground and and this is the story that comes from a visit that my two co-authors made to a small city in southern china okay so uh chung en is here so he can correct the details if i have the details wrong but one of tongen's former students was a vice mayor in this city he was a vice mayor of the education department in this city so he and my other co-author went to the city i think was in 2013 but you can you can correct me in the summer of two so so just so you know this was the vice mayor in charge of schooling okay so when they went to the vice mayor's office in charge of schooling i think the story is that the vice mayor was actually not there so they met up with his chief of staff and the chief of staff handed him this flow chart of what is it that the vice mayor's office for education does okay so he proudly handed over this flowchart and said this is what we do in the vice mayor's office for and then here's a rough translation of what this flowchart says so so again this is a work plan of the vice mayor's office of education and he says that you know we actively look for quality prospects we have an initial discussion to learn about the investor we undertake a feasibility analysis we identify land and other need of services whatever it is they're talking about goes for the approval of the vice mayor and then we signed the agreement now if you think about this what is the vice mayor's office for education do it okay now you could think that this is about schools but very quickly and you know i guess that you know very quickly that this is not about schools what you learn very quickly is that what the vice mayor's office of education is doing is exactly what you think that they are doing that they're basically going out and they're basically soliciting business so what what i mean what i mean when they say act to look for quality prospects they're basically trying to get companies to come into this city okay so let me just tell you something more about the organization of the city of this particular city the number one guy in this city is the communist party secretary the number two person is the mayor there are nine vice mayors in the city the person that was strong in student was one of the nine vice mayors and by their metric it looks like roughly the so the way that this particular city operates was that each one of these vice mayors had roughly i'm going to use the word portfolio of about 20 projects or 20 companies that they were responsible for and what i mean by responsible for is that they're basically if you think about the world bank the things that the things that are being measured by the war bank doing business indicators it's about basically carving out special deals so that these 20 companies each one of these guys can basically get exemptions to these rules so the way that you want to think about this city is that it was roughly a city of about two million people about uh to a city about two million people employment about eight hundred of about eight hundred thousand so roughly about 200 to 250 companies have special deals which which bet that basically they got everything that they wanted in order to make things work and then we don't know for sure but our senses that these are typically the largest companies that are in the city so roughly you know you want to think that 300 300 of uh 300 to 350 000 workers work in companies that have access to these deals okay so let me just summarize what what what we think the system is and try to lay it out for us so here's a quote that i got from somebody who does business in china so this is the way one way in which you may want to think about it and so this is what the person says the way that you want to think about it each locality operates like a standalone company they prompt investments strong-arm banks for finance and often hold shares in the businesses themselves localities operate almost like a holding company for local business i i find that that a useful way to think about it at the same time the local parties overwhelming powers within its own borders effectively make each district its own separate jurisdiction with direct control over the courts and over local regulations governing business activities so think of the model as as basically it's the use of the powers of the power of the local communist party to to to make private private businesses work that's essentially what this guy is saying but it's incomplete it's uh so what we what we we want to add to this is that that it's not just the use of the power of the local communist part of the local communist party to make businesses work that it's a use of the power only for a subset of firms only for what i'm going to call the favorite firms or firms who who have access to deals the second piece that this that this quote doesn't quite capture but we think is an important part of the story is that it's not just one communist party that that does this but there's tremendous amount of competition uh between all the different localities that are trying to do exactly the same thing and i want to show that we we think that this is an important part of what has made the system work in some sense okay so the way i want to illustrate this is i want to talk about um how this a particular policy played out okay i want to talk about this thing called the strategic and pillar industry policy so the way that you want to think about this is that there's a lot of discussion now about chinese industrial policy about you know this this policy by the central government called made in china 2025 so think about the strategic and pillar industry as being the precursor of the made in china 20 to 25. so what is this in substance that that in the late 1990s there were nine industries that were designated as strategic and pillar okay what that meant effectively was that only designated state-owned firms were allowed to be in these sectors okay what you can show is that despite this policy empirically when you look at the data what you saw was that was that oh since the late 1990s what you saw was massive entry of unauthorized firms most of them private not all of them were uh private into the strategic and pillar industries and then the and then what local governments were doing was an important part of why this strategic and pillar industry policy didn't quite play out in the way that it was designed and the way i want to illustrate this is by talking about one of these strategic and pillar uh industries i want to talk about the chinese car industry okay and it i we believe it's a nice illustration of both the cost and the benefits of of how the system works okay so i want to talk about this company uh i want to talk about general motors in china so the story of general motors so general motors is perhaps the most successful u.s company in china it sells about a million a car a million and a half cars a year in in china it's the largest car manufacturer in china the structure of this company is that no why was you know so so so how does gn fit in the strategic and pillar industry policy well the way that gm entered into china was that it operates a joint venture with this other chinese company called the shanghai motor corporation which is one of the state-owned firms that was part of the strategic and pillar industry policy so it so gm operating china through this company called shanghai gm which is 50 owned by by by gm and 50 percent owned by this uh but there's a state-owned firm and the shanghai motor corporation it's a publicly listed firm but the majority stake is held by this holding company called the called the shanghai group and the group itself is known owned by the local government of the city of shanghai so just you get a sense of this company it also owns 50 of shanghai volkswagen so if you've ever been to shanghai and you wonder why all the taxis are volkswagen this is the reason why that you know there's a you know one way to try to figure out you know you know where the powers are in china is to go to each city and just look at the taxis i mean it's a really like if you ever go to beijing you will wonder why the taxes are on hyundai's there's a reason why i don't know whether you've noticed but but but uh if you ever paid attention that that's what you you're gonna see and the sic also owns a standalone car company that was the original state-owned firm okay that was the original standard firm that was authorized to make cars so what did gm want in china okay well the first thing it wanted was that it wanted monopoly rights so one of the things that gm got was that it had it got the monopoly to sell cars above a certain size okay so that's one that's one of just the concrete things of god but more broadly what gm wanted was i wanted to get the support of the communist party of the city of shanghai which at that time was effectively running the central government so this is the period of zhang zamin so here's a quote that i found that that that it illustrates this idea clearly that basically says uh the commercial goal of selling more gm buicks and chevrolets in china becomes a political economic campaign to enhance the power and the might of the city of shanghai so uh that basically this company gm becomes is an integral part of the portfolio of the city of shanghai think of it as a shanghai inc with the communist party secretary as the chairman and the ceo and somebody told me a joke that in two in 2009 gm became a joint venture of the communist party of china and the u.s treasury which it was there was one part that was bankrupt and there was one part that was made that was making money but what gm was afraid of like you know so what i've had discussion with people who are running gm at the time uh the guy happens to be running archer daniel midlands now uh but what they were afraid of was a theft of their intellectual property so there were detailed protocols that indicate that certain number of management positions certain number of engineers from the other company were to work in this indus joint venture so so and now you think about you know what's the cost of the you know so gm wanted the monopoly rights it wanted the it wanted the support of the local of the local city apparatus but the the cost of this was that well if your partner ever were to steal your intellectual property well you know which court do you go to uh uh you know it's you know the court that you go to is gonna be if the judge is gonna be the person that's appointed by the person that stole your intellectual property in the first place uh so the response that gm made to solve this problem so this is what what what what the person who ran gm at the time indicated to me that okay the way that we're gonna square the circle is that we're only gonna sell cars that we're only gonna sell cars that if our partner were to ever steal our intellectual property then then they're never gonna be able to sell this car outside of china so the first car that gm sold outside of china was this what was was the buick new century which they introduced in china in 2001 it had gone out of production in the u.s 10 years 10 years before and it retailed in china for about 44 thousand dollars at the time again you know that's what uh uh uh so so gm was doing really well now obviously you know for the uh chinese consumers weren't doing that well as as as the res as the re as a re as a result of this but let me tell you the sequel to the story so gm then the the what they continued to do later was that they continued to introduce new cars and they continued their strategy of basically bringing in the bringing in their older designs selling it in the chinese market at a markup now where they started to run into trouble was in the third car that that they that they tried to sell into the chinese market they took a design from their korean subsidiary daewoo and they rebranded it as a gm car and they began to try to you know start the process of building a new plant and trying to sell up sell that new car in china what what happened with this third car was that before gm was ready to sell their new car they found out that another chinese company had come onto the market before they were ready to sell a hold of the blueprints and and and and basically sold exactly the same car so somebody was ripping off the intellectual property of the shanghai party bus okay what was this company it's this company called cherry okay so i have a copy i have a picture of the two cars this is a picture of the gm car which is itself a clone of the of the of the daywood car and this is the chinese clone of the clone right so this is the the the cherry car and then the gm engineers would say that they went and bought a copy of this car you it's hard to buy this car in shanghai for the obvious reasons that you know that cherry is finds it very hard to sell in the shanghai market because you there's the local boston and then you can't sell in the market so if you try to sell you'll say well there are these 350 rules that you have to follow but uh um so let me tell you a little bit about the the the the story of this company because i think it illustrates where the competition is coming from so cherry is a company it's based in the city of wuhu which is not unlike the city that that that that's hong kong and my michael business a small city was a poor city of about two million people it was founded by these two people okay this guy called mr sun and and who was the vice mayor of the city and a guy called mr yin it's hard to just it's hard to know who exactly started the company you get different stories depending on who you talk to but the story of this guy mr yin was that he was the engineer and he had spent maybe 20 years of his life working in the state-owned company called first outer works and the main project that he had was that he was the guy responsible for a joint venture that first auto works had with volkswagen so one of the things that he did was that he basically went and and he he went and relocated an old vw plant outside of pittsburgh relocated that plant to china relocated that plant to china and they started to make card they started to make vw cars so the way that he describes it was that you know this this was a really important process for him because he learned how to set up a car company how to set up the plant how to how to set things up with some how to set things up with the suppliers and at some point you know he would say that he he wanted uh to do something of his own he wanted to set up a company of his own so imagine you you want to build a car company okay you need you need a billion dollars i guess i don't know how much you you need but in the case of china there was a very easy path to get this done what you do is that instead of going down sand hill road or whatever it is he knocked on the doors of several party bosses collected offers and decided that this that this particular city gave him the best deal okay so here's a quote from mr yin on what was the agreement that he had with the vice mayor though so the quote from the vice mayor was that you let me take care of the politics you just focus on getting some cars be built here so think about this as you know you have these two guys okay one knows how to make cars but doesn't have the farthest idea about politics the the other one doesn't have the farthest idea how how to make cars but knows about the policy what is the politics the politics is essentially the strategic and pillar industry which is that they were not allowed to make cars it was illegal for for the internet that's what he means by the by by by the politics so what happened well the first thing that wuhu vice mayor did is that they went and asked for an exemption to the strategic and pillar industry the answer came back very quickly no no no don't even think about it then what they did is that they got a permit to purchase a car engine which is because uh they they got a purple two and then they they took that permit and they bought an old ford engine plant in the u a for the engine plan in the uk they started to make engines then they went back and they got a license to make cars but that would only be sold in their city and then with that limited license they went and bought an old vw plant up in spain they relocated that uh to uh to china that's hard to make to to make clones of the vw then there's a process which uh i'm sure that uh that tongan will tell you more about how they got access to the full license but it involved their them basically giving 20 of their equity to the to the to the shanghai state-owned firm that was the partner of of of of shanghai gm then they got the full license to make cars they got the full license to make cars and then the second car they made was the clone so let me just end by just saying the uh cherry is legally registered as a state-owned firm the woohoo low government holds the majority stake it is the largest exporter of cars from china okay shanghai gm does not uh does not export so the way i think what this all tells you is that you know that the fact that there's a possibility of exporting your stuff think of this as being exactly what you would expect to see if your natural trading partner iraq has high trade barriers on you so let me just show you one last picture of my last trip to colombia so we were in this i was in the small town in via via the center which was a small city about 100 miles south of the capital city and the cars of the of the columbia middle class were the korean cars and cherry and the and the the cars are chairs so i took a picture i take a picture all right i'll end here
