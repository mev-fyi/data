what i'd like to talk to you about today is what we've learned about the distributional consequences of trade in this recent spate of research contrast this to what we've learned about technology's impact on labor markets say a bit about how we can tell the difference between trade versus technology on labor market outcomes and then close with some thoughts about what this research tells us in a quite preliminary fashion about the consequences of new tariffs that have been placed on on u.s imports so um oftentimes in a presidential administration it's it's difficult to pin down exactly what key decision makers think about trade because they they hold their cards close to their chest we're living in a current political moment in which that is not the case um if we read the president's tweets we get a pretty clear idea about what he thinks about trade and and it uh the the striking feature of this is this break with the us uh uh stance behind globalization in trying to create the institutions for for freer international trade which we started back in uh in 1947. um so uh the uh the rise of of uh populism and economic nationalism is is well documented the question kind of for us today is is did international trade play any role uh in the origins of that opposition i and and uh my sense is that the answer to that is is yes and this comes from the work i've done with david otter and david dorn uh and a number of other co-authors as well as the work uh that many of our colleagues have done and i'll talk in particular about the work that justin pierce and pete shot have done on this on this question so to understand how we got here go back to what we thought globalization was going to deliver us 25 years ago which was at the beginning of kind of this this great second wave the fall of the berlin wall trail realization sweeping the developing world and lots of new countries joining the wto you look at what president clinton said about the nafta signing and he was promising a lot not just a couple percent income gains which is kind of what your standard ge model uh was going to tell you i was going to clean up the environment and solve world peace now the danger in over selling is that it created a set of expectations about what globalization would do and what uh it wouldn't do now what we have learned from research over time is that to be sure uh globalization has led to uh aggregate income gains aggregate welfare gains in the united states we know this from a whole series of models that use uh the best quantitative insights we have to model the us in the global economy um and those results are not in in much dispute um uh and so that that that intuition we had 25 years ago is not really unchanged what has changed is our sense of what are the distributional impacts of of trade and where those distributional impacts uh come from so go back also now 30 years and and look at what uh leading writers of international economics textbooks would have said at the time about the distributional consequences of trade um and so krugman and ops felt just quoted basically the hector the hecturaline theorem and its manifestation in the stopper samuson theorem which is that trade the impacts of trade are going to play out in national labor markets and they're going to have differentiated impacts on individuals according to their skill level or according to their education level when we then took that approach in the 1990s and tried to understand the impacts of trade on late on national labor markets differentiated by skill we found impacts so some of the work i did very early in in my career uh jointly with rob feenstra what we also found at the time as we tried to look for quantitative measures of the exposure of industries uh to technological change is that it looked like the impacts of technological change uh were larger the labor economists were a little less equivocal about this at the time they said it's all technology trade is irrelevant so we kind of had that dispute for a bit but what wasn't in dispute was we want to think of this the frame we want to take is thinking about these shocks being transmitted through national labor markets differentiated by skill so what's happened since is we've had this incredible natural experiment in which we can examine the margins of adjustment to trade shocks uh and that natural experiment was uh the china shock so when i just uh you know many of us are are quite familiar with the dimensions of china's growth i just want to highlight two important features and why the uh the expansion of china's exports have been such an important tool for empirical research in trade one is the speed with which china made this transition nobody in 1978 thought that china was going to become an export powerhouse over the next two decades in fact nobody in 1988 thought that either in 1989 the wall street journal prognosticated that china would be one of the laggard economies of the 1990s owing to the stultifying effects of communist bureaucracy the story turned out to be a little bit different as we all know and china went from around two percent of global exports of manufacturing goods to around 20 today so that speed um is one important component that makes china a very uh useful laboratory in which to to study these issues the other is the magnitude uh china as we know is really really big so when you get a sudden shock and a very large shock it gives you lots of empirical leverage the second feature or a third feature of the china shock is that for a big country china was unusual in having an extreme comparative advantage and that comparative advantage initially was in manufacturing and within manufacturing in labor intensive activities so what this meant is uh depending on your position in the global economy uh the rise of china either meant a tremendous negative shock to the demand for the stuff that you produce if you happen to be specialized in china's export goods or a tremendous positive shock to the stuff that you produce if you happen to be specialized in the goods that china's manufacturing sector needed to import to make all of that stuff so those features are what have made china so useful what kind of we get tripped up on and as we talk about this research is the notion that china is the only thing that's happened in the global economy in the last 30 years no there's lots of stuff that has gone on nafta happened in the intervening period period the eu played itself out many other developing countries joined the global economy the centrality of china in the academic debate comes from the fact that it gives us so much empirical leverage so i'm going to use the china laboratory to talk about these impacts but i don't want uh at all to suggest that china is the only game in town when it comes to under uh understanding these shocks china has been played a disproportionate role in the empirical research as we try to understand what margins of adjustment are operative as countries face changes in the international economic economic environment that's what kind of reduced foreign empirical work is stuff stuff with stuff we can study shocks that whose impact we can causally identify when it comes to the ge analyses they've been more ecumenical they've been able to look at a broader range of shocks and help us understand uh the importance of trade versus technology and trade with uh with different nations um so what have we learned about the impact of of trade shocks through uh our ex the experience of china's explosive uh growth the most important thing we've learned is that that frame of national labor markets differentiated by skill is not really the right frame what we want to think of is the us economy at least is as a collection of small open economies in which labor is largely immobile now that's an extreme statement and a mobile we don't mean completely immobile just mean that regional adjustment regional movements of labor in response to negative labor demand shocks uh is slow uh and this is uh as we produce the first work on understanding china's impact impact on lower local labor markets what we found was very strong adjustment in terms of negative employment uh impacts on regions that were specialized in the goods that china exports that was uh those negative employment impacts came not from firms downsizing uh they came from firms exiting came from plant uh a close uh closure so steve just mentioned one of the papers in uh in the conference by asquith goswami um newmark and rodriguez rodriguez-lopez that paper doesn't use the county business patterns paper that david otter and david jordan i use they use a version of the dun and bradstreet data so they can look at what happens in terms of plant entry and exit and they find that the bulk of the employment losses associated with the china shock came through plant closure and that'll be important for some of the issues i discussed uh uh in in a couple of minutes so that margin the fact that you've got these economies that are locally specialized if labor is not moving then we don't have a national labor market for low-skilled labor what we have is a bunch of regional labor markets and adjustment to that shock in terms of labor moving across regions seems to take a long time well more than a decade um so that was uh uh the the first thing that that we understood second is now that we're talking about kind of small open economies that are subject to big shocks and in these small open economies where the areas and i'll show you maps in just a couple of minutes the areas that were hit you know primarily smaller and medium-sized manufacturing towns so plant closure in those localities is equivalent to a local recession and a pretty severe one at that and that then cumulates in terms of a negative aggregate demand shock for local economic activity and that perhaps helps account for why when these workers who lost their jobs in manufacturing did not get readily absorbed into other activities what we saw was prolonged increases in non-participation in the labor force primarily and increases in unemployment secondarily those broader income declines meant that in these locality work by feller incenses has shown us led to reductions in housing prices and an eroded tax base so these communities were then losing some tools some instruments that they could have used to kind of fight these local recessions because of what was happening in terms of uh local public finance so that's uh kind of on the uh the import competing side if that story is true we should see that uh the the reverse uh occurring in in regions that specialize in in import in goods that china imports so here we do have results that substantiate exact exactly that reverse effect regions that produce commodities that china imports or regions that produce machine tools that china imports have seen employment growth wage growth and increases in um real incomes in those localities the research though has now found any of that in the us it's found that in brazil it's found that in australia it's founded in germany the u.s context is complicated by the fact that many of the firms that produce inputs that that china inc imports are not producing goods they're producing services and so being able to measure the demand shock for the services derived largely from intellectual property that u.s firms produce has been much more complicated our intuition tells us that those impacts are there uh getting an empirical lever on on estimating those impacts has been more difficult so we've been kind of stuck with looking at at most of this as operating within manufacturing or near manufacturing any model if it was fully specified would suggest that part of that tremendous increase in housing values and incomes in silicon valley is associated with silicon valley's ability to export the services derived from intellectual property to china our economic models are poorly suited to get at the magnitudes of those impacts now what about uh impacts of technological change so here the empirical challenge is more difficult uh china was great it was big it was fast and it was concentrated with technological change our our ready measures um are are not so much at hand so what we've seen is tremendous innovation over the last couple day a couple of decades in terms of trying to gauge the exposure of industries of regions and of individuals to changes in uh technology so the approach that um that researchers have taken to just to kind of go back to the 1990s where all this started uh the first thing the first measure that we utilized was the intensity of industries in computer investment uh computers were kind of a new thing in the 1990s and their adoption in the workplace was kind of a new thing so we saw this substantial increases in computer investment across industries in the course of the 1990s and that varied substantially by industry according to their intensity in the use of what you can think of as high-tech capital equipment so that was the measure that labor economists used in the 90s it was a measure that rob finster and i used uh in our work subsequently we've come up with additional measures so one that david otter and david dorn pioneered in in their work in a 2013 ar paper was to say one of the important manifestations of technological change has been automating production so it's hard to observe automation directly because we don't know a lot of details about the type of capital equipment that that firms purchase we know it's computers we know it's not computers we know what's machinery versus not machinery we don't know which which of that machinery is uh replacing labor that used to do stuff by hand so they constructed a measure of the exposure of occupations to automation based on the task intensity of those occupations looking at how specialized is an occupation in routine tasks tasks that involve repetitive uh movements and what they found was results that are different qualitatively from what we find in exposure to trade rather than employment that declines in regions that were specialized in routine intensive occupations what you saw was a change in relative labor demand across the wage distribution with declines uh relative declines in the middle of the distribution increases in relative demand in the tails of the distribution and the result was a polarization in economic outcomes and what they call this this hollowing out of the u.s labor market now subsequent uh work by goose and manning by michael sedal then use similar approaches uh to document that those changes in labor demand not surprisingly were associated with greater uh earnings inequality in these regions that were more specialized uh in um in routine intensive occupations here again we're using the region as a laboratory which is consistent with the idea that labor is not sufficiently mobile across space to transmit these shocks uh nationally now the most the most recent innovation we have uh is comes from work by assam ugly and restrepo in which we actually have measures now of industry uh adoption of robots um so uh hint for young academics out there if you put robots in the title of your paper you will increase citations by three orders of magnitude um so i think asamoglu and restrepo set the record for a paper appearing in the work and the nbr working paper series to coming into print in the aer i think it was 72 hours or something like that i'm exaggerating so what they find is uh are our qualitative impacts that now look more like the china shock it's not just moving labor around the wage distribution what it's doing is actually uh decreasing employment in the aggregate in these localities uh uh average uh earning declines and increases in uh labor force exit so we've got these two things going on which empirical literature has documented this work is all reduced form so it's not well suited to kind of adding them up and telling telling us about the general equilibrium uh impacts um some of rob feinster's marks later this morning we'll we'll get at these but just in this context how do we tell the difference between trade and technology well to start in all of this work you want to control if you're trying to understand the the exposure of a region to trade you want to control for all the things we learned about in decades past about what makes particular industries more prone to the adoption of labor-saving technology and so that means how specialized industries are in computers in capital in skilled workers and you're controlling for regional specialization in those activities so all of this work already has those sets of controls in there and that absorbs a lot of of this exposure but more importantly we can look at the recent research itself and and learn some important clues that tell us that the places that have been hit by these technology shocks are in large part not the places that have been hit by the trade shocks so one important clue there is that if you look at uh the as i said the regions that have been hit by the china shock what have we seen we've seen plants close when you automate what you do you don't downsize you upsize you just change the factor intensity of production so rather than seeing plants close the areas that are automating see plants renovate and that's not what we've seen in the case of the china shock so that's uh an important clue now among surviving plants and that that comes that insights there go all the way back to the first paper on the china shock which was bernard jensen and uh um uh and shot uh and uh and is documented more recently in the ask with all paper in in this particular nbr uh project so what pearson shot show uh in this um in their contribution to this project is that among these surviving plants so they also find evidence on on this uh uh this this extensive margin adjustment plant closure in response to import competition among surviving plants what do you see not increases in investment like you would expect to see if trade were just uh operating in place of technology you see investment declines but second if we use our existing measures of exposure to trade and technology what do we see we see in fact that the places that have been subject to these two shocks are quite different um so this comes from work that uh david otter and david or doran and i did in a um in another paper on the top uh what you see are uh commuting zones in the united states differentiated by their exposure to increased import competition from china on the bottom you see commuting zones in the united states differentiated by their exposure to automation as measured by this initial specialization in routine intensive occupations what you see is kind of a quick glance is they don't look exactly the same so let's be a little bit more precise let's look at the set of regions that are highly exposed to both um and it's just a handful of locations uh and in fact the correlation across commuting zones in exposure to automation as measured by otter and dorn and to import competition from china is essentially zero there's a good reason for this those autumn the automation has hit larger cities it hits hit lots of non-manufacturing uh industries the china shock primarily hit places that were strongly specialized in um in manufacturing so on that manufacturing dimension there's an important piece that we've learned about and this was not so much work that as uh has come up in in this particular volume but work that uh i've done uh uh subsequently with david otter and david dorn and that justin pearson peter shot have done and that's understanding well if you are seeing job loss in manufa in manufacturing what are some of the attendant social uh consequences so the important feature of manufacturing for understanding those impacts is that manufacturing is unique in offering high-paying jobs to less educated males women are employed in manufacturing to be sure but manufacturing at the beginning of the china shock was still a male dominated profession and a profession dominated among production workers by individuals with less than a college education so what happens when you're in a region that gets hit by one of these shocks it's less educated males that get hit disproportionately hard so what hap so the the immediate impact of that is not just an absolute decline in male earnings for less educated males it's also a compression in the male female earnings differential we know from abundant research in um in labor economics that when that male female wage differential depresses is had immediate impacts on on the marriage market and on family formation and you see reduced uh marriage rates um and increasing incidence of uh of out of wedlock uh uh births so that's something that uh otter and dorne and i document in a paper forthcoming and uh aer insights um but that's not the only impact or necessarily even the most pernicious uh impacts now that that less educated men um are less disciplined by the labor market and less disciplined by the uh by the the marriage market they tend to get themselves into trouble and so there's evidence of increased incarceration rates and more troublingly uh increases in drug and alcohol abuse so in work that that pearson shot have done uh what they find is that these regions that are more exposed to the china shock have seen increased mortality that in and that increased mortality is uh uh in its uh preponderance due to deaths associated with substance abuse and so that loss of manufacturing livelihood then feeds into the opioid epidemic that we're seeing now now again i don't want to say that the china shock caused the opioid epidemic uh what the china shock allows us to do is to say does the loss of high-paying jobs to low-wage workers contribute to something like drug and alcohol abuse the answer very much seems uh to be ass and the aggregate the china shock might be way down the list in terms of the of the overall drivers of that particular uh outcome so that then gives us insights into why uh the scarring effects of of of manufacturing job loss uh are so extreme one is that it's hitting less educated men uh uh particularly hard two is that this job loss has occurred through uh plant closure uh and therefore is if not permanent at least long lasting and you get these extended local recessions and this may play a role in why the convergence in regional incomes across the united states which barrow and sally martine documented long ago stopped not long after they published their paper and now what we're seeing is regional divergence uh with globalization and technological change um all being potentially uh contributing factors and then the kind of the thing we really learned here about the the the origins of these scarring effects is this absence of labor mobility now where does that absence of labor mobility comes from um it may come from housing markets it may come from individuals being underwater on their mortgages and therefore finding it difficult to move it may come from family structure uh that is these individuals may be very reliant on an extended family for child care and given that in in many of these communities those with a high school education are less the majority of kids are now in single-parent households moving is not a two-body problem it's a two-household problem and so that it gets much more complicated to take advantage of wage gains elsewhere uh the third feature that that plays a role here maybe social policy so this is something i want to put out there as speculative uh we've uh and the drives from uh some of our original results on the impacts of the china shock that is if you look at the margins of adjustment in terms of uptake of government benefits in response to trade induced manufacturing job loss you saw something some adjustment that you'd expect to see increases in long-term unemployment insurance increases in trade adjustment assistance but then you saw some things you wouldn't necessarily expect to see and that is increases in social security disability benefits and what has happened in this instance as in many other instances documented by a large labor literature in which mark dugan david otter and many others have contributed to is that in response to adverse labor demand shocks workers are using disability insurance as a mechanism to adjust to bad things that have happened in their lives how this hinders adjustment is that those workers then tend to exit the labor force uh permanently we don't know yet the relative contribution of these different factors to low labor mobility uh in the united states uh there's ongoing work by danny hagen and rebecca diamond trying to understand other relative contributions of these things and what we're finding is impacts that are there um but are the the standard air bounds seem to be pretty large um so finally i want to close with just thinking about well based on what we've learned so far now we're putting um tariffs on uh imports uh from the rest of the world and from china in particular uh will these tariffs bring manufacturing jobs back okay so to really answer that question we want to arm up some g uh some quantitative trade models and uh and uh and and figure out uh all the substitution effects that are that are going to go on but i wanted to highlight two features of that adjustment process which would make us uh dubious about the prospect for the terrorists as we've seen them so far to bring manufacturing jobs back one is just kind of an obvious one is that these tariffs are not multilateral they're bilateral so we impose higher tariffs on china what will us consumers do well they might buy from u.s producers but just as likely they might buy from vietnamese or bangladeshi producers especially in labor-intensive activities so bilateral tariffs are a weak instrument for bringing production back to the united states suppose however the trump administration expands those tariffs so that they are multilateral so they imply to all u.s imports would then that bring manufacturing employment back now we could use tariffs to bring manufacturing production back if you shut down imports of manufactured goods we're going to produce that stuff at home but here go back and think about the nature of the job loss that we've detected as a result of the china shock it was as a result of plant closure so that ma that capital and equipment is offline that those production facilities use 20th century technology which was much more labor-intensive than the new plants being built today so even if we get to the point of having much more expansive tariffs and do bring manufacturing production back it's going to be in newly built 21st century facilities which are likely to be much less labor-intensive so if you had to think about we had to uh to think about that the tools that the us government has at its disposal to affect manufacturing employment tariffs as they're currently formulated would seem to have a pretty weak impacts so uh to close um i want to uh just reiterate the the the two key findings that that steve opened uh uh mentioned in his opening remarks um one is that you know what we've learned about the u.s experience with globalization over the last couple of decades is kind of what we what we had thought in the aggregate we see these nice gains from trade we're arguing over how big those gains from trade are that argument has to be over uh which underlying model is responsible for trade secondarily and but primarily about the magnitude magnitude of trade cost elasticities there's not a lot of dispute about the sign of the impact of expanded trade on u.s on u.s aggregate income what we have learned though is that these distributional impacts um are concentrated in uh and and that concentration has led to prolonged disrussion disruption in particular parts of the us economy lots of parts of the u.s economy haven't been affected those particular parts of the us economy have let their voices uh be heard those are areas um that have shifted uh the areas that have been harder hit by trade and truths manufacturing decline are areas that have seen a stronger support for economic nationalists uh when running uh for office and so the consequences beyond what's happening in these labor markets uh is real thank you very much
