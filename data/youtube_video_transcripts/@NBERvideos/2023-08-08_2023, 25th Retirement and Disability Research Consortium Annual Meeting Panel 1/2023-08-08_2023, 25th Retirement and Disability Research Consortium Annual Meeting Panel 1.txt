pleasure to be with you all today I'm really excited about this panel I think what I'll do is I'll do a brief introduction of each of the presenters and then after that we'll start with the first presentation which will be from Samuel Myers um so let me provide those introductions now um first is Samuel Myers Jr is an economist and Roy Wilkins professor of human relations and social justice in the Hubert H Humphrey School of public affairs at the University of Minnesota he's been awarded the Samuel Z Westerfield Junior award by the National Economic Association the Maryland J gattell activist scholar award from the urban Affairs Association and Sage publishing and in 2007 he was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of public administration next on our panel will be Cormac O'Day who is an assistant professor of Economics at Yale University he's also a research fellow at The Institute for fiscal studies and a faculty research fellow at National Bureau of economic research his research interests are in household savings retirement and intergenerational links in economic outcomes and then finally we will have on the panel um a little bit later uh Yang Wang is an associate professor of public affairs she is a faculty affiliate with the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for democracy and Ecology Center for democracy demography and health and aging Center for fiscal Financial Security and Institute for research on poverty and risk management and insurance department in the Wisconsin School of Business her primary research interests are in applied microeconomics Health economics and applied econometrics it's my pleasure to introduce this this this panel I'm really excited about the presentations I'll turn it over to you now Dr Myers for the first presentation thank you very much uh Professor Williams I'm delighted that uh the thing uh for this first panel is racial disparities because Bill Springs would have been very um dedicated um uh committed to her finger social Administration as well as the uh the Consortium investigating a health disparities so the theme for the ongoing research agenda of my colleagues uh William Doherty 11 condo uh uh as a question of Social Security design and how it affects Russia our disparities and wealth it turns out though that we need to focus first on the Baseline results before we delve into the impacts of specific Social Security design you know else Pakistan racial dispers wealth and so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to focus on uh three main key results of our our Baseline analysis the first finding is that the widening racial gaps in net worth as individuals age the second Friday and start personal growing racial wealth Gap over the life cycle and this is due largely to differences and rates of accumulation among the highest earners the highest most wealthy black and white you know households not the median households not the poorest household but the ones that are at the top 10 percent of the wealth distribution a third funding has Social Security retirement uh really doesn't dampen racial wealth uh disparators over the life cycle by what their main the current design of Social Security uh doesn't seem to play a role in narrowing the racial Gap in wealth they look specifically today at Social Security disability income and so there's a declining effect of uh of um uh participation in this program uh us uh growth uh increases so and also ultimate life cycle so let me first talk about the planting number one about start there's a widening racial Gap in welfare as households at HBO using big Ram uh health retirement software longitude Society it's a longitudal file and our initial analysis combines uh all of the cohorts and our main dependent variable is the net wealth uh change uh between time T and term you know t plus n and so this descriptive uh graph characterizes the main conclusion that uh there's a uh widening Gap and wealth as individuals age so the y-axis is the uh the black white uh uh Russia uh of a total net worth you know at each percentile and the x-axis is the age uh distribution as you can see uh and they uh um at the highest percentiles it's the top 10 percent uh the Russia's are of black and white um but not uh wealth is higher uh than the other uh you know portions but there's a declining slope across each one of the different uh um percentiles and I should point out that at the middle of this consistent decline you know and the black to white ratio uh and uh total net worth as individuals age now I should point out that this doesn't control for anything and it doesn't distinguish among the different you know cohorts I should also say on this left hand uh you know panel uh we replicate you know the uh the results but just for the initial uh health retirement yes of like cohort and the patterns are still the same so combining the cohorts is not particularly the cause of if they uh the declining of the show black to white you know wealth as individual's age uh and it's true that we're not controlling for uh assets or type of debt or the composition of people's portfolios and it doesn't account for family structure health or employment status uh at the time of individuals uh uh at the beginning in the survey but with those caveats I think it's also important to recognize that this is a surprising finding that's not well uh uh understood nor widely uh shared you know within the academic Community uh the wealth Gap so widening number two is that there's a growing ratica over life cycle and it's largely due to the differences of rates of accumulation among the wealthiest relaxing weight households and again uh the way we uh the um uh particularly synaptics is focusing on a dependent variable uh where uh uh there's the uh log of the net wealth um there will the change of the log in the net 12th and it's a function of uh ah raise and initial world and so one could look at this both at the time t two t plus one or term T where T is the initial um uh point of observation well two term two percent and now we report uh the differences in the coefficients so I'm blocking weights on wealth percentiles uh and so what we're asking and effect is how does the uh effect of where you stand within the uh the wealth distribution affect the Russia reflected right uh net wealth and so this graph uh which reports the coefficients birthday uh difference uh well and the effects of blacks and whites at each one of these so you know cohorts uh that's a particular coefficient interpretation is what's the um percentage difference and uh between blacks and whites uh and uh net worth for each one of these uh discographs now if all the confessions was at zero that means that there's no difference in the uh uh the net worth between blacks and blacks uh and then uh we asked how does this coefficient change as we move from the lowest uh you know uh percentiles to the highest percentage and actually for illustration purposes this fittedness to a polynomial so these are all coefficients but we're asking what does it look like you know it's a slope negative you know is it declining is it increasing faster and the answer is that yes it's not gonna yes it's increasing faster and it turns out that the uh the lowest percentiles of uh of wealth uh there's only about uh 1.3 percent you know uh between blacks and whites uh uh between they uh uh uh the initial wealth and the subsequent well whereas that uh at uh 25 50 tile that's four point six percent then at the 50 to 75 percent uh it's 10.3 10 or 75 90 top that's 12.3 percent and then at the uh uh the ninety percent so um it's almost 23 and so the uh key Point here it's uh uh as uh one moves to the more wealthy you know individuals the percent growth certainly uh and the net wealth uh smaller uh for black uh hustles than for black households which means that the lightning of the Gap but that widening Gap was at the top of the distribution you're not necessarily at the median of the distribution the next fair thing is that the wired racial gaps in Social Security income receives that all ages and neither Social Security disability income or social security retirement incomes close those gaps and so this is descriptive analysis that shows well what is the Social Security uh income you know for each of the age groups for each of the percentiles and uh not surprisingly the most wealthy whites and that's the 90 percent of not the top 10 of whites receive the largest um you know uh you know Angela as the um um about the uh uh annual Social Security benefits but if you look at this so of course all of the Just just this whites uh within it's saying uh um uh percentiles earn more than blacks but what is also interesting is that if you look at the top 10 percent of blacks they are you know Social Security uh uh income is actually uh about the same as the top 25 percent of whites but with that said I want to ask the question of what about something like Social Security disability income how does that uh affect you know Russia gaps and wealth and the answer is again there's a negative you know slope which means in effect the uh well let me let me also say that when that coefficient is positive then it's a Miller rating effect but when it's negative it's a uh deteriorating effect the slope is negative which means it affect that as we go uh to hold the higher edges the ameliorating effect of Social Security disability income or racial gaps and wealth beginning to decline and then by the time uh you've got to 80 years old it's virtually you know no real um effect at all on the distinct racial gaps it will so but that's uh our next steps are to account for changes to taxation for social security control for health and family structure composition of assets and verbs control for cohorts the Depression era the World War II the Baby Boomers and then the decomposed disparities between rates of returns or assets as opposed to uh differences in endowments yeah thank you very much thank you Dr Myers uh next on the panel we'll have uh Dr oday present all right can you see the screen there okay yes so thank you very much Professor Williams and thank you um uh to the SSA for funding this and um for putting it on the program this is Joint work with uh Taha shukman Jorge calumelares John rothbom and Larry Schmidt uh I've thanked the SSA for funding these views uh are those of our own and not them or any uh Federal agency I'd also need to acknowledge the sense U.S Census Bureau here uh we're using uh data at the Census Bureau and uh any data that I present has been cleared uh for disclosure um the previous presentation I think motivates uh this work uh very nicely and I think we're going to zoom in on this paper on one particular component of the uh of the uh portfolio and that is uh retirement accounts defined contribution retirement accounts and in the US it's well known that stir a lot is spent subsidizing incentivizing retirement saving and subsidizing Savers uh just on DC accounts so just on that one part of the retirement saving landscape it totals about a percent and a half of GDP and that comes from two different actors there's employers and increasingly it's common for employers to offer their employees a retirement account where they say something like we'll match your retirement saving dollar for dollar up to five percent oil matches 50 cents on the dollar up to six percent um so that's an incentive for saving and a support and institutional support for Savers layered on top of that is one of the largest tax expenditures that the U.S federal government provides uh and that accounts for about 120 billion uh dollars a year so this institutional design benefits those who can and do save more for retirement so the purpose of this paper is to bring together newly collect data on employer retirement plans uh to data on the saving of individuals where we can link the the rules of the game the details of the employer plan uh to the saving that individuals do so with two research questions the first one is do retirement saving incentives this percent and a half of GDP contribute to racial wealth gaps and why and the second broader one which I'll only touch on uh towards the end as to what extent do these incentives contribute to wealth inequality more generally and the reason that we sort of thought this might be an important channel for wealth inequalities I suppose four I think relatively well-known facts the first one is that retirement wealth is the second largest asset class held by Americans Americans only hold more wealth in their housing this is a very very important part of the portfolio it is also with one very important caveat which I'll get to in a moment and will feature quite heavily it can be one of the best investments going I said it's increasingly common for employers to match their employees saving uh the mean match on the first dollar is over 50 cents so this is a almost risk-free at least for those employees with modest tenure a risk-free 60 return you're very you're gonna be hard-pressed to find a sort of a similar return with at least that risk profile the caveat which is going to feature heavily is it's at the cost of illiquidity you're locking These funds away until the age of 59 and a half or at least you're locking you you can't access them without in many cases tax penalties many do not take full advantage of this incentive so the average foregone match is about a percent and a quarter of salary that is employees are earning percent and a quarter less by not fully exploiting their match and in sort of a thinking about the transition away from defined benefit accounts it used to be that for employees with employee or sponsored retirement accounts the main decision was are you in the plan or are you not and in many cases if you are offered one you're in it was more of an extensive margin Choice increasingly with the rollout of D DC or the expansion of DC employees are making an intensive margin choice and therefore the incidence of the retirement saving subsidies is potentially um going to be spread out in manners which it wasn't uh within a DB world I'm just putting these up here just to acknowledge that we're we're building on large literatures on wealth and race in the US wages and rates in the US this is a form of remuneration albeit one that is deferred uh literatures on retirement plan design and literatures on the intergenerational wealth persistence uh all of which we discuss in the paper so what is the data set that we have put together for this paper well we felt it was important to have a perspective on the employee and the employer and the survey data on the employee this is a very very large administrative data sets well survey linked with administrative data on employees it comes from the American Community survey okay so about 20 years of data covering race Education location occupation and much else and this is linked within the Census Bureau to data on W-2s so for these respondents their earnings can be observed on their deferred compensation that is what they are choosing to put into their employer's Bond if they have one their employer sponsored uh defined contribution account there's also data on early withdrawal well withdrawals including early withdrawals from these accounts now what we've also done is codified new employer data on retirement plan characteristics I think this is easiest shown with the picture so every employer in the U.S at least with more than 100 employees in its retirement plan and must submit to the federal government a narrative description of their retirement plan and it's in plain English and so for five thousand the largest 5 000 plans in the US and a random sample of smaller plans uh We've codified these into a data set where we can see what is I mean there's much in this data but uh most important today will be the matching schedule this what your employer is offering to match if they're offering at all so the in the I think six minutes remaining I think I'll highlight five facts many of these are well known some of them are newer so I'll just dive in I think the first one which has been studied before is and this does not control in any statistical sense for anything yet if you look at employees uh uh who are offered to find contribution accounts so it's a large but not necessarily representative uh section of the US population uh White workers are saving about five percent a year black workers are saving about 3.2 percent a year and Hispanic workers are saving about three and a half percent a year now that's just the employee contribution I've emphasized that employer matching is an increasingly important part of the retirement saving landscape and the more you save the more you get and other results employer matching amplifies those gaps so white workers are getting about two and a half percent black workers just under two percent and Hispanic workers about two percent in employer matching contributions now part of this in a statistical sense could be uh accounted for by differences in income it's income differences by Group by racial groups are well documented and individuals with lower lifetime incomes uh needs to save lower proportions of their income uh simply because Social Security is Progressive however controlling for income education County firm um I mean it it explains in a statistical sense some of this Gap but only about a third of the black white Gap and just under a half of the hispanic white Gap so these are as we show in the paper these savings differences are consequential for Lifetime wealth accumulation um what's driving them now we're certainly not attempting a full accounting of these patterns but we do want to highlight two uh two Market two related mechanisms which we think are playing some role the first is liquidity constraints so in starting off I motivated these retirement accounts as a great return on your dollar but the cost is it's illiquid and if you don't have other forms of insuring yourself against life life's risks and you may need to take an early withdrawal in many cases this is going to be tax penalized and there are very large black white differences and much smaller hispanic white differences in the probability of taking an early withdrawal in any particular year so we're taking this as a sort of an indicator of Greater liquidity needs and therefore a diminished ability to take up these employer subsidies and the tax subsidies which are layered on top of that so thinking of it beyond the individual I should have said everything so far has just been focused about individuals um outside of the context of their nuclear family or their parents and what we can do in the census is uh for a section of the population we can link individuals to their parents um and if you think of what having say wealthier parents might do is it provides another form of insurance which can enhance the ability to afford the illiquidity that is the the often the cost of taking up uh these matches um so holding own characteristics constant so in particular think of comparing two individuals today with the same income those with richer parents contribute really quite a bit more to their 401k to their defined contribution accounts so that is there is a comparing an individual with a parent in the bottom income death though to a parent in the top income deathile um there's about a half a percentage point a year that's half a percentage point of a base of maybe about four percent uh saving that's that's a quite substantial uh percent difference there's a half a percentage Point difference in the saving rate so the way we're taking this evidence is that those with richer parents that is those at the bot at the right hand side of this graph are perhaps a veiling of uh the insurance parental resources and access to parental and resources might yield those at the bottom on the other hand might uh be well certainly not availing of those resources and perhaps ensuring their own parents this layered on top of the fact that there is existing inequality in Resources by race um Can in a statistical sense account for some of the residual gap which uh which uh remains after we control for individual characteristics in a minute or so remaining let me just say there's a long tradition in the of the distribution analysis of the U.S retirement system and it's often emphasized that there are regressive and known to be regressive subsidies for private saving but balanced by Progressive Social Security and income-based non-discrimination testing so these in a sense are might be thought of as balancing each other out or mitigating the progressivity of Social Security might mitigate the regressivity of these private pensions the private retirement subsidies a limitation of this type of analysis is that a focus only on income can underestimate the system's regressivity uh so far I've been talking about race and it's quite clear that race um uh matters conditional on income and that's not in any sense undone by Social Security other characteristics parental income I've already spoken about education styles of support and family structures all of these characteristics conditional on own income have a bearing on the take-up of these retirement subsidies and therefore are relevant for the distribution analysis of retirement uh saving incentives the quite large uh sum of money that is spent on those there's more in the paper and uh uh which I won't have time to take it to talk about so on that I will just uh um pass it back to Professor Williams
