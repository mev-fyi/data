okay um let's move into on the next stage of our program which is learning from all of the wonderful speakers um who are so generous to come and present here um and our first speaker is stephanie cincheva from harvard who has a number of extremely important and influential agendas one of which is her work um on using surveys to better understand people's social preferences around public policies and perceptions around public policies um and we're lucky to learn about some of that from stephanie today so thank you so much for coming and thank you so much for the invitation it's really great to be here can you hear me um okay if it gets too bad it's uh already it's really great to be here to see so many uh excited new faces even though so today i wanted to tell you a little bit about people's social preferences and focus both on the theory and on the evidence so what are you trying to cover here so the goal of this lecture is to start a little bit with a theory of what social preferences are and i think this is particularly useful for those of you interested in behavioral because it is a way to capture much more general preferences uh related to our policies than we usually do then we're going to talk about the clinical evidence uh some of the work that i've done with authors and this will allow us to actually uh study about this new new type of tool that probably many of you will be using that i know the organizers have been using which is online surveys and experiments so let's dive into a bit the motivation so i'll be short here but in a nutshell you know when you think about public policy particularly with distribution policy there's some mental models we have in mind so implicitly we're forming some news about what would be the cost of this policy right what will it do to behaviors what will be due to economic activity so we can call those out perceived efficiency costs we also form some views about who's going to gain and lose structure policy right mechanically it will have some effects on some people versus others and then we have to form some things about how do we await these different people how fair do we think that is that these people gain versus other people lose and finally we also have some news about the government we're not going to talk about that today but the government as an institution um and our trust and belief in it will also shape our rights on policy and if we think about you know some some of these core things um and kind of in a stylized way look at what the results tell us typically they tell us that there's a big polarization between people on the left and right and what they think about all these things all to the level of even basic reality and in fact you know if you try to if you try to characterize someone on the left it would be you know someone who tends to think in general on average that there's smaller efficiency costs from these progressive policies that inequality is less fair that in general you know if you cut taxes at the top it's going to not benefit everyone it's not going to be trickled down and then you have to trust the government a bit more and even you know as i said we even perceive the current tax system the current inequality differently which is what we call the polarization of reality but what's important is that if you try to horse raise these considerations so try to say ultimately which of these ends up saying why someone wants more distribution or not it turns out that the most important factor by far is what people think happens to winners and losers and how fair they think that is so fast consideration sort of swamped the other considerations in which people differ and which we should keep studying of course but in the end what turns out to be sort of the biggest driver of people's policy views is who gains who loses and how fair do we think that is and so this is why i wanted to focus on exactly these fairness views so trying to think about how people follow their social objective essentially what are they thinking we should achieve as a society what do they think is fair so let's start with uh the theory which is how can we build a constructable way of capturing a range of social preferences because of course you know i i'm not here to tell you what the right ones are i don't know it and we want to incorporate a range of possible objectives and then look at the imperatives of this starting with the theory and this is based on a paper with a manual size which is called generalized social welfare rates are optimal tax theory but don't be scared i'm actually going to make this not about taxes i'll just illustrate it with taxes but it's much more general so the idea of this paper is to try and find a way to model social preferences and really go down to a very very basic level what are really social preferences well when we think of policies and it's it's you know related to any policy where there will be winners and losers you need to aggregate across people right you need to say you know this is the wealth i gained from this or the welfare box so whether you want it or not you are making interpersonal comparisons you are waiting different people in some way and so our typical weights are generally quite restrictive so they tend to come from for instance a social welfare function that is utilitarian for instance summing everyone or putting some weight on different people derived from you know some some objective but what we want to do is to make this much more general we want to start from this primitive which is let's say that every person gets a weight so every person i has a weight gi that values how much we care as a society about one dollar transfer to that person so it's our social marginal value of giving one dollar to that person and that weight can be specified directly to adjust to a very to a variety of fairness and justice considerations so let's look at it a bit more formally so oh generalized social worker weight on a person will be a function of various things and there's a bit of notation here but i'll show it also on a figure and it'll become clear when this is much more general so it can kind of force on standard things like someone's disposable income you know how much do you actually uh get to consume for you know a utilitarian weight would basically uh be declining in marginal utility consumption you care less about higher consumption people higher it can depend on the income to earn which is typically denoted by z and then it depends on these vectors which i'm going to explain here with this figure so if we have people's utility on the left at the top that depends on their consumption and then many other things so for instance they have some disutility of producing income of supply labor that depends on characteristics which we denote by vectors x i u for utility and x i b b or both because these x ibs will also be in the welfare rate so what could these be for instance it could be that your health status right affects your utility of working your your talent your passion for uh your education level all the range of things that affect how costly it is for you to work and to earn income it could also be that you just have different enjoyments um you have child care costs whatever it is all these can be embedded in these vectors now the social welfare wage also depends on things so presumably can depend on the consumption someone has doesn't need to but that depends on these important vectors x i s for social worker weight and b because it's common things in the utility and in the welfare weight and we can see it in these circles here there will be things that affect your utility but do not enter the social welfare rate and there will be things that enter the social welfare way that are not in utility so in our standard frameworks typically these two circles are perfectly overlapping when we write a social objective we care only about and nothing else nothing more than what people have in their utility and we can put random things in people's utility that they care about but the social objective is entirely what we call welfarist which means it only depends on individual utilities but here we allow for potentially a dissociation and so there's some overlap but there are things which we will not take into account socially so for instance consider an example which is laziness okay you're lazy that surely affects your utility right it's it's unpleasant to work but as a society we may decide well that's not something you want to take into account it's irrelevant for us whether you're lazy or not and so your laziness will not enter the social welfare weight we put on you you can of course imagine also a society that dislikes lazy people and wants to put a you know a lower weight on them but it doesn't have to so there's a judgment there what goes into the weights let's take another completely different example which is your health and so how how able are you to work it surely affects your utility but presumably it's also something we take into account in policy right um for instance we have disability insurance we try to take into account that uh you know there may be some child care costs related to parents working so real costs they potentially are at least b because they enter the utility and we also think these are things we should deem as relevant when we set policy and then the final example what are things that could enter only the welfare way to technology utility but one typical example would be your background your family background so often when you're an adult your family background is you know not necessarily something that directly shapes your utility beyond your income right it may have it may and personally has shaped your opportunities so how shape the income you're getting today but doesn't necessarily directly implement your children but as a society we may actually care about did you come from a poor or from a rich background and so this may be a factor that we put in our welfare rates when we talk about say quality opportunity but that is not in the individual's futurity and in the limit if these circles are completely disjoined that's when you have a fully paternalistic social objective which disregards individual utilities and just you know set social objectives based on other considerations so this is a pretty flexible at this point also very abstract but hopefully a bit clear with the examples it's a very it's a very general framework to think about what do we want to put into the welfare rates and once we do that sorry with taxation you know you can write out very simply the sort of the tax problem and the one thing that i want to emphasize because presumably many of you are interested also in many other policies what you really want to we need to specify is well your weight can depend on anything you want but your policy tools cannot depend on anything you want right your policy tools can only depend on what you can see so in the case of taxation our typical tax is depending on income z it doesn't depend on are you lazy are you you know what's your health so it depends really on z only so what we need to do is take all these individual welfare weights which we specified uh you know any way that we want yes so these weights depend on a given person's weight depends only on their characteristics right so um you know another kind of model um aversion to certain kinds of behaviors is we feel differently about someone who is not working depending on whether there's a large patch of people working or not because that's telling us something about um social norms and that would be a social welfare weight that takes into account both that person's characteristics and behavior in the whole population is that kind of yes that's good that's all yes that's okay uh now it may become harder to to look at it to study it but it just it is okay so i put i indices because you know it may depend on others so anyone except i for instance or and there could be constant factors across agents say the share currently not working so that's okay and in fact for some some settings it's super relevant as well one thing though which you're uh i forgot to repeat the question sorry so for those in the in the future audience dimitri asks whether it's okay to have things that depend on others characteristics or say the economist characteristics like to share people not working and the answer is yes and one other thing it wants me to think about especially for you interested in behavioral is you do face a choice in terms of where you're going to put put these things in are you going to put them into the utility or into the social objective so there are models for instance where you know people dislike inequality they are ready to burn money to reduce inequality so in that case there's no way to enter directly in their utility right and then the social objective can either layer something on top or just fully respect that individual preference etc in public we tend to typically leave individual utilities sort of as they are you know like very standard um consumption and income and you know hopefully in line with micro behavior that we see disciplined by micro behavior well the social objective is not disciplined by anything that's truly a normative stance on what things shouldn't so you know my view on that is basically individually should be disciplined by the evidence evidence for instance people you know as you'll probably see here people behave in certain ways because they care about certain things that should be in the individual utilities and then the rest is sort of a social judgment so especially if we're taking into account kind of social norms type things um then the social marginal welfare ways become potentially very complicated objects that could change how we do analysis you know it's not necessarily true for example if there are multiple equilibria and there are jumps they don't necessarily change smoothly with the tax function and so are these kind of issues to worry about are there some restrictions you can make yes that allows applications in our first order approach methods great question so the question is whether uh you know once you put in all these other things that could be you know multiple equilibria or the weights could be completely non-smooth and and the answer is that this is all about equilibrium so the weights are endogenous to everything that's happening the super simple way to see it is well they depend on your consumption which mechanically depends on the tax system since it is a result of your income versus the tax you take so they are endogenous to the policy and we're looking for equilibria between you know where the efficiency cost of the policy balance out the welfare gains as measured by these weights at that point so they can be multiple equilibrium um and you know there can be settings where it's actually very difficult to solve because you can't differentiate so you'll have to uh you'll have to look for equilibria either numerically or somehow else so if they're you know pretty well believed we can actually apply our standard textures which themselves are based on you know first order conditions and um like basically smooth problems if if that fails then you know even our standard formulas don't hold anyway so this is just a quick clarification of something that you said which which i didn't quite understand uh you you made the statement that if g depends only on xs that that takes you to the paternalistic extreme i thought that what we're doing here is evaluating welfare as the product of the gi's and that then makes it sound like you're conflating aggregation with deference to the individual's preferences still if you're if you're deferring to you then you're not returning listening great question so um i would probably get my attempt to abstract from the tax problem and probably then missing a slide which is the gi will be basically the only thing that enters your you know your problem the utility will be there to determine what behavior people have in response to a pulse so it's not a weight it does that it's just so it's it's the value of one dollar given to you so it's not like we're going to wait individual utilities by by the gi's uh i call it weight because it's basically relative to others you know how we're valuing one dollar i'm waiting you if you try to aggregate all the gains and losses we're activating monetary gains so the utility does not enter which is the agent does not enter into the uh into the objective here so the utility that you know determines the behaviors people have it will determine the reaction policies but the way we're going to evaluate gains and losses is going to be according to the ts so great question here and so for the tax problem basically we need to find a way to make a statement at the income level so what we have to do is to aggregate the weight for each income level very simply basically um our rates can depend on anything the weight that we put for people with income z is going to be the average weight of everyone earning z uh so we'll see some examples to give it some tangibility but for instance let's say you care about people from a low background which is one of the examples we're going to see from our poor family background you can't see background directly but you will know for instance that at lower income levels there's more chance that there's people from a little family background so the weights for instance will be higher because of that and so you can just aggregate these weights and for those of you who are familiar with the optimal tax problem um or know how the formulas look like you and you don't need to know this but basically our our typical tax formula looks like this which is i'll explain in a second and what is very nice is that it typically depends on standard welfare rates in a sense to ducks point that are derived from individuals utilities but we can just actually use exactly the same formula plugging in these general social world values and i put the proof for you in the slides even if you know nothing about the tax problem to basically think of our reform to the tax system and to find a reform that cannot improve welfare so that is optimal and the only thing you're going to basically uh the only thing that you're going to notice is that you can put in any welfare weight the same argument goes through it you're always going to find this formula which is really nice because it means everything that people have derived we can use just putting in more general warfare rates and this is probably also true for other problems you'll be confronting like when you think of other policy tools there's one step there in the derivation of those tools where you have abrogated gains and losses of people and so it's at that stage where you could plug in these more general weights and achieve the formula that you know um you already probably have but as a function of these more general weights in the case of taxation their conclusions are you know very simple uh and the derivation is not not that complicated either but the tax is always a balance between how much you care about you know people at income z so whether it is because they're poor or there's some other concerns you have that's embodied in the weight g bar at z the average weight of people at z and the efficiency cost of taxes which is embodied in the elasticity e which is how people react to taxes how incomes react attack is what you tax people more so that's the efficiency cost but again i don't want to you know i don't want to derive the optimal taxes that's not the topic today but this is one illustration where we already have these derivations they exist and we can just substitute the welfare weights into the proper step where we aggregate gates and losses so hopefully you will find other applications where exactly at that step instead of using standard weights or um you can put in things that satisfy some criteria that you want and so um yeah if you want to look at the truth it's here and then let's look at some very very basic examples and work up to slightly more complicated ones so two super simple examples are libertarian weights and relative weights so what are the battery weights well libertarian weights are this idea of all taxation is theft you know like individuals are fully entitled to their tax income so how do we model that well that's a weight where the weight only depends on the tax you pay so we're lying to anything else we don't care about inequality how much you're dealt with and what you started with we only care about the gap between what you started with and where you end up which is the tax you pay so your weight is basically a function of only c minus z which is t the tax and so what will happen here well regardless of how people react uh the the only possible equilibrium is one with zero tax because if everybody only has a weight that is um you know if everybody has a weight that is uh declining in the in the tax they pay as soon as they pay a tax they get a higher rate than everyone else and we need to put uh you know we cannot tax them what about the rolls in weight the rotten weight is the total opposite which is the most distributive objective you can have uh regardless regarding income which is all the weight is going to go on the lowest utility percentage so the person with the lowest utility will get all the weight which means your weight is zero if you're not the lowest utility percent your weight is one if you are and this will you know begin plugging it in basically into our formula we can see what that yields it yields what we call the revenue maximizing formula uh which is basically the the max tax you can sustain it's the tax that tries to maximize the revenue because that maximizes the transfer to the lowest utility agent and between these extremes there's lots of other cases so one of the examples i particularly like sorry one of the examples i particularly like is this idea of transfers and preloaders because this is actually a very good illustration of what you can do with these general voids that you can't do otherwise one thing that our standard objectives can't really do is to capture counter factors which means when we look at someone we cannot say oh what would that person have done after this generous tax and transfer system we can only say what do they currently do what's their current consumption or income etc but with general weights you can actually incorporate this notion of counter factor which is very key in the policy debate when we talk about things like a three daughter you know or a deserving tour inclusively we're making a stance about what these people have done in a different situation absent for instance is transferred and so how can we capture this well one way to capture this very very simply is to think about individuals having uh just the option to work or not so it's a zero one choice and if they work they have to incur a cost theta are working and etheta is private information so the government doesn't know who's had high customer work low cost of work so very much reflecting sort of the real world now someone's out of work we don't know if it's because it's truly costly for them to work or they just don't want too much and so if people work they will consume they will earn one dollar for simplicity and because there's a linear tax they're gonna get to keep one minus tau of it as they work if they don't work they just get zero which is the transfer for those out of work so people's decision to work or not is going to be if their cost is not too high they're going to work if their cost is too high given the current tax system they're going to stay out of the labor force so the fraction of people working is going to if theta is distributed with a cdf big p and theta the fraction of the working is going to be p of one minus tau and we can because we need some ingredients in our formula can we have earnings react to taxes what's our elasticity in this case since everybody's already the same if they were we need a distinct function of people choosing to work or not so the assistant e about the earnings it's going to be just the elasticity of p1 minus tau the fraction of people worship oh that changes when one might have changed and so if we just blindly applied our living attacks formula which is also in the slides and you don't need to think necessarily where where it comes from but it has this familiar shape of you know depending on the average welfare weight of people and the elasticity what's the average welfare rate here well the average worker weighs mechanically regardless of what the weights are is going to be the weight of those who are working and the weight of those who are not working aggregated okay it's going to be the average of the weight between people who are working and people who and if we use standard weights for instance we use a utilitarian objective what's going to happen is that well everybody who's not working they consume the same they work or not work the same so they they will get the same weight because our standard social welfare objectives they just depend on your current authority and so someone who is not working regardless of why regardless of their cost of working is going to work the same right there's nothing to distinguish someone with a very high cost not working and someone with a low cost not working and so because of that all the non-workers will get the same weight so this approach is unleashing to distinguish this idea why are people not working and so we can only look at the actual situation not really at why which very much is in contrast with the policy page instead if you can step out and just specify your weights directly you can say well i actually care about why people don't work and so in particular i'm going to say well workers are good they're fine i'm just going to give them their standard weight which is a weight that will transfer just on the amount of detergent consumption the deserving four are going to be people which i think you know deserve transfers which is people that have a really high cost of working and i'm going to define them as people who would not work even if there was no transfer no tax on transfer that's people whose cost is above one you know those people regardless of what the tax is they cannot work so i'm going to say those are my deserving people with and i'm going to give them again a standard weight so they're going to get the weight equal to the moderator consumption however i'm going to call freeloaders those who would be working absent attacks and transfer system because we choose to not work because there is a tax system for those people i'm going to give them a rate of zero okay i dislike them socially i'm going to not put any weight on them and so really the standard approach doesn't allow me to separate these two people because objectively they have the same utility when they're out of work they're getting the same transfer they're not working but here i can just say well i'm gonna disregard that i do not like pre-order so i'm going to put a zero social weight on them so what happens now well what happens now is that if i look at well what's the weight on everybody outside of who's not working on all non-workers it's going to be the average of those who are deserving for times their weight plus those who are three dollars times zero so the weight on those who are out of work is going to be lower than with a standard objective because i'm discounting people who are freeloaders so when i look at the pool of those who are out of work i'm saying well a share of them is food orders and i don't want to register towards those people so once i look at my optimal tax basically the composition of those out of work is going to influence my welfare rate it's going to say you know here in the the g bar at the top it's going to say well if the composition of people out of work is such that there's tons of free dollars in the limit it's only three dollars then i don't want to register i want zero tax and no transfer on the other hand if it's almost only deserving four i want a lot of redistribution and transfers so the composition of those out of work is going to matter and that's obviously something that we see a lot in the debates right like when there's a recession or when that was folded people are much more you know willing to give transfers to those out of work with this implicit idea that the composition is likely to have shifted towards deserving poor people who are there to no fault of their own rather than people who are hugely and then in boom period it's the opposite you know when there's um when we can think of something observable for those out of work and we can separate them we're much more likely to say okay there's lots of people who aren't for health that's a signal that they're actually deserving for or actually it turns out it's a lot of parents out of work so it's because a child can cause so these things are very much in line you know with what we debate about which we can capture here and then the final you know the final few of those is some you know some examples here given uh additionally and so the final thing that i wanted to uh to touch base um directly is this idea of equality of opportunity so which is another sort of core core objective we think about and how it actually appears here so the way it is here is that equality opportunity and your family's background is not going to really influence your utility directly but it's going to shape your ability to earn income so very simply let's say that people can be of low background or high background basically they're from a low-income family or high-income family and people people's earnings ability w is going to be a function of their family background so kids from better backgrounds will do better or else but also their merit which is the effort they put in okay so some of it is still your own individual action so how can we measure your merit how can we say this is how much effort do we put in well we can measure it by no rank within people with the same background so if we take people with a low background then you know this is all equal they're all the same in terms of background they're thinking that the only two things that shape they come well then people who have a higher income or have a higher rank in that group they put in more effort right so we're not comparing across groups because we don't think it's comparable but we are comparing with bigger if you come from the same background your income does measure your merit okay and so we can also say that for all levels of effort for all levels of merit if you come from a better background from equal one you're going to have a higher wage higher earnings okay so you're always going to be better off at the same merit if you're from a high background and let's say that as a society we're willing to redistribute across backgrounds so we want to help people from low backgrounds to high but we're not willing to redistribute condition on background so if you're doing better than another person with a low background you don't want to penalize you okay that's that's your merit so let's take these very stark views of course super simplified there's other things that enter uh you know income determination so because of that to capture these preferences what we can do is to say that your weight is going to depend only on your consumption relative to others with the same rank so it takes a while to absorb this why this is exactly capturing this idea that we want to redistribute across backgrounds but not within if your consumption is higher than others with the same merit that means we're preparing you to someone at the same rank and the highest congress and someone at the same rank and the low income these are people who put in the same effort as you so we don't want to give you more or less than those people we want to give everyone within the same effort the same so your weight is zero if you're getting more than that and your weight is one if you're getting less than that that's kind of your fair fair income we want to treat everybody it's capturing the notion that we want to treat everybody with the same effort let's say the same way if we put this weight what happens is that and remember these are our primitive weights but we need to aggregate them to the income level to be able to talk about policy so if we aggregate them up to the income level what happens is that we talk about the scrolling which is on challenger what happens is that the welfare weight at income z turns out to be the representation index which is what is the share of people from a disadvantaged background earning more than z relative to the share of people from a disadvantaged background in the population if you convince yourself of this by trying to aggregate these weights at each income level and it's just doing that aggregation so essentially the welfare rates will be saying how many people are there here from a low background relative to the overall share of the population and the rate will be higher if there's you know people from a low background are overrepresented in competency relative to the population and what's really nice is that this justifies you know a bunch of things we do first of all this will naturally lead you to declining weights with income as you move to the top of the distribution there's less and less chance that you find people from a poor family background and so the weights will be declining since you're going to have less and less of those people right that you want to target and help to another thing that is very nice is that we have data to actually calibrate this so say these are your social objectives you still need data on how many people are there at each income level and so this is what we do here based on the data by varaj and co-authors to basically say we know from the data that's probably one if we take low background as being below intending comfortable current and higher background being above reading into the parents we know from the data at each income percentile today in the income distribution what share of kids come from a low background so for instance at the 25th percentile there's 44 of kids from a low background and you see that it declines as you move towards the top of the distribution and you can basically from that immediately calibrate your welfare weights and you know if you put some some assumption on the elasticity you can get your optimal tax which is basically the the column 3 the implied optimal tax but of course it's subject to assuming an elasticity and so directly following from the welfare rates and you can compare it to say a standard utilitarian objective with logicality uh and how redistributed that is or not so you can put numbers on these things as well so these are some very short theoretical sort of illustrations of what we can put this to use and hopefully you can put it to use in many other settings which are you know completely different from taxation yes so you briefly have a slide that was discussing the connection between this and more are there ever optima that are ruled out under pareto weights that this would rationalize or is there always like an isomorphism between the two great questions okay i skipped it because i was like this is gonna get too long and technical but since you're asking so the question is is it questions on the side basically is it oh is it possible to always find pareto weights um that will you know rationalize this weight and vice versa what's the link between the weights which weights are fixed and generalized welfare weights are endogenous to the whole tax system and to the consequences to which you mentioned others etc so exposed and the three daughters is a very good example exposed you can always try and correct the weights that will rationalize you know the the social worker weights and that if you write them as a standard objective we'll give you exactly that tax the problem is it's exposed so the three dollars example is very clear remember that the weight you put on someone depends on the tax because your free order if you have a high cost relative to the current tax but not high enough to be above one and so who's a freeloader is the dependent on the tax system so yes once you've sold for your optimal tax you can plug it into your laboratory and just write your objective that way but it's circular because you don't know what the optimal tax is before you sold for it and so that that's the sense in which this can capture counter factuals which you cannot write with just one objective you know you cannot write something that's a counter factor with just one objective in many simpler cases like libertarian or the walls yes there's a simple corresponding social welfare function so in many cases you will be able to recover that but not always great thank you yes so i think he's we're suggesting that the social marginal welfare weights kind of capture um the distribution of social preferences in the population you know as reflected in public debates that we've seen during coconut support um but then these weights are themselves some kind of aggregator um and that raises the question of you know what do what is an aggregator of kind of with necessarily a probably very diverse social preferences across the population how do we aggregate them for public policies is that something it's an extremely difficult i you know yeah i don't know if you have some thoughts on this i'm just curious how you think about this question great question so dimitri is asking um where do these weights actually come from i'm talking as if there's some distribution of these ways like you have some ways to address some ways i have some ways to find what i want for society and then how do we even aggregate them so these weights can come from basically two different you know two different approaches one is the approach by political philosophers and um who basically go the axiomatic approach which is let's specify criteria we want to be true like foreign efficiency like dalton principle a ton of things let's specify extrematically what we are trying to achieve there's another approach which is more let's say political economy uh which is well what are the ways that people have and how to spend the political process aggregate them a very simple model is the median voter theorem right that the weights that may come out from a political economy perspective will be the median voter's weights and what i'm going to show you now empirically is very much in the spirit of without even talking what should be the objective and how should we aggregate them rather well what do people have in mind for these weights so what is sort of the distribution of weights of people in their population and then again one way in which this will be is simply through the political problems either the median voter or if it's like the lobby groups social work preferences or the elites whatever social preferences that's then you know the political process aggregating them then just yeah interpretation um is it also then suitable to think of the income tax schedule as resulting from the standard mechanism design problem because they're then potentially other political economy things that affect how income taxes are constructed even setting aside yeah the social marginal doctor would be no great question so you know if you think that um there is some relevant political economic constraints i think what dimitri is asking is you know when i say oh the standard tax formula is valid and you have to plug in the weights that uh correspond to social preferences you make sure you're saying if there's truly some political economy for a chance then even the optimal tax formula won't look like that which is true uh if there's frictions on you know like how people respond to income because of political economy or the spillovers between them you know we have also more general formulas exactly for people with political economy working on them that that would then apply absolutely so this is this is a formula where everything's perfect all markets are perfect there's no spillovers between people people of the mind it's just about the welfare way the social objective we put on yes so you mentioned uh there's some freedom to look at the role that uh recover disparate the ways [Music] [Music] yes so yes sometimes the weights are not gonna be very uh you know very nice to work with like um very often we have and i think that's fundamentally a bit true about what comes out of this research that we have some sort of lexicographic rates in the sense that first we care about this once this is equalized across people we can go to the next level and think about this so that's a little bit sort of hierarchically how many people feel about uh you know how deserving others are they're not gonna at the same time think about is someone lazy and what's their family background and um are they consuming the things i want them to consume etc etc but more like in terms of priorities and so those are not extremely tractable uh you know like take derivatives of importance so i think the best guide would be to look at a few examples in the paper again it's targeted to taxation entirely but we do cover a range of cases where the weights are really not not easy to work with and so you have to think about more you know what's equilibrium trying to find a deliverable that they're equilibrium so hopefully that can help um think about it and i just won't have time to to cover all that here we start from the data and think about the rewards system based off this language yes first thing you suppose uh within the low background group you observe let's think of the extreme no variation in export whatsoever how would you distinguish in practice between lazy versus the one that often doesn't open yet or just because the status quo and the incentives in place of success oh yeah you so there's what you want you know ideally so that's embodied in your weight which is i don't like basic people i don't like this or that and then there's what you can achieve you know with the blunt tools that we have which are subject to the information we have so in the pre-order example the only thing you see is uh is someone out of work so what's their income either they're out of work and have zero or they're in work and have become one and that's the only thing you're conditioning them and so to be able to allocate the weight you need some information about the share of people based on for instance that cost distribution p of theta right about the cost of working you know you infer from that the share of people at each tax level that is preloaded but you need some info about your population if you don't have that for instance you don't know even the distribution then you have to form a guess about the distribution of p theta right so that is very common in in tax problems we need some information about the distribution of characteristics in the population um you know at least an estimate of them um otherwise we have to go to an even more sort of primitive level where our food is super blunt and we cannot even know the distribution of acoms or so it's always a race between what what do i want ideally that's my way it's definitely unconstrained versus at what level do i need to aggregate it to um in order to in order to actually do policy yes a question that you you answered earlier about equivalence uh with greater words yes i've been thinking about your answer and i would understand your answer if you were explicitly in your analytics dealing with the simultaneity issues that dimitri referred to in one of his questions but in fact i think when you write down the optimal tax formula you're basically saying well the equilibrium values of these g's are going to be some levels and let's work out what the optimal tax looks like which means that you're not actually getting any mileage from solving the simultaneous determination part of this so in the end it doesn't look like you use that what you've used is there are these welfare breaks which nothing about the analytics tells you what they are it just tells you what that implies about the task so if that's the case why not just go back to the standard welfare rates and say you know this is the welfare rate that we attach to the port taking into account their composition i mean is it the added value here the fact that that composition may change but that's not in the analytics unless you unless you close the wall it is so it is um so it will uh obviously for instance here it is completely closed like i you know you could i started by saying this is our linear tax problem no i understand i understand that it's implicitly folks but i'm saying that when you write down the textbook yeah it's just expressing things in terms [Music] [Music] so you're looking for equilibrium so you're taking a tax with one approach and looking at equilibrium where you can no longer improve uh you know the with any perturbation on the tax system but the way that you're evaluating at any point to find that equilibrium they depend on the track system so they're indulgent yeah so it is truly close there is no um you know it is entirely exactly not just i'm trying to find the equilibrium in the three dollar example i just did not rewrite the derivation of this tax cuts but you can just write it the same way so now imagine that i want to give a dollar to those out of work this is how i'm weighting them it depends on the tax um this is how much the others lose this is the reaction in terms of elasticity um we have to make sure that we can't improve with without any tax perturbation to zero and you will end up with this formula in a sense you always end up with this formula for many many weights the question is what value will these weights take and if you start from the very general ones you will you will end up with this composition effect now what i was saying here is that yes once you've solved it you can specify them as pareto weights and write a weighted objective where everybody of typhita gets this weighted specifically which you see depends on telstar the optimal tax but how can you ever write that down as an objective to sort of top down maximize unless you know the cost are and then it becomes circular but there is there is truly like it is all closed and there is truly like an added and added thinking relative yes there are a number of papers on fairness ideas and the notion that there's a distribution there are some libertarians america and i'm trying to think how that literature relates to this approach is it's the case that someone from this ideal is embodied with genes or eye or is a different approach you mean somebody's like agents friends ideas or is it like the question for dimitri like where these voices come from or how yeah or more generally how the literature of furnace ideas is completely compatible with uh this approach or is it interesting yeah no it's a very good question because um the goal is exactly to sort of be able to incorporate other fairness ideals without having to [Music] always start from scratch in terms of you know rederiving everything and and give more framework so in the paper there's a two part there's basically two parts one is what puzzles that we think are puzzled in the policy and the three orders was one example what puzzles are they that we can't explain with our standard uh sort of objectives and the second part is let's take some of the core you know sort of political scientists of their approaches like high quality opportunity was one of them uh there's a fair wage theory of manikin corvette and some other technologism poverty minimization and how can we capture those with weights so it is you know it is a way to sort of unify a little bit all these disparate objectives out there by indian saying what does it apply to the weights you put on perfect so thanks to your very excellent questions uh we're really running out of time and so i'll i'll give you just a basic overview of what i was what i wanted to tell you here which is the imperfect site and we we basically already explained all this the idea here is simply to go out and say well what are the ways that various people have in their minds you know let's just try to explore first and it's all about like the distribution policy what do people have in mind when they think about uh redistribution and one of the sort of toy you know uh toy things you can you can do is to first do some very very basic estimations and more generally you can leverage these surveys and experiments which are really great mostly exactly in a controlled way in a framework actually elicit from people what they you know how they feel about various uh various things and how they think about it so i think it's a really critical tool that's super important to you and so i was going to cover a cool illustration on how to estimate social preferences which i will have time to do and then i was going to talk to you about factors that actually shape how fair people think um the redistribution is basically various things that enter people's welfare weights and important ways uh these are views about mobility and the chances of making it views about how different are others from me it turns out people put different weights on those who are more different for instance on immigrants and when they think that it's immigrants benefiting from a distribution they tend to want less of it um racial attitudes in a similar spirit people tend to have very different welfare weights put on those from other other races and then another thing which is um people very much are influenced by where they think right they rank relative to others um how well they're doing well the drivers so i won't have time to cover it but they're they're not very difficult to understand by any means so either based on the slides or the underlying papers hopefully uh hopefully you'll get a flavor if you're interested in these issues and you of course pick and choose but just very simply like if we if we stick to our current very simple framework and think about how to estimate these social welfare weights you can do it in a super super toy way just to illustrate so for instance let's say our weights are some sort of intermediate between the purely uh libertarian weights that you know decline you know if someone has a pays a higher tax you get a higher weight and uh there are the utilitarian rates when you put weight on those who are lower lower people higher weight on those with lower consumption or poor so let's say the weights we need to parameterize them to estimate it let's say your weight depends on this your consumption minus a weight on the tax you pay okay so this is basically your uh your wealth what do people think about that what's the weight if we specify this in a very io like way this is our function we're going to try to estimate it what you can do is to give people fictitious examples so you can randomly draw families that you give to them and you ask them which of these families should get a thousand dollar tax break you have to pick one of the two and you're going to vary the income of those families the tax that the family pays and hence the seed that that family gets so you know like in io you're creating your own variation here you're going to try to vary cnt and see what do people pick so as to trace out the welfare weights so intuitively what you're doing is to ask people okay we're in this space of t and c that's a two parameters my weight depends on you could go 10 dimensional if you had a very complicated weight right and i'm asking you should family a or family b get the transfer people make some choice next question ask them what about this should family a or family b get the choice etc etc and so intuitively it lets you trace out the social and different spirits right like similar to individual in different church by this revealed preference approach here they're very simple and they're linear because of how we parameterize them and you can infer the slope basically the trade-off that if you have between giving you more disposable income versus an aversion to make people pay taxes you can estimate this and um we did that basically and so what we what we find for instance is that um you can see the alpha sort of the um the implied alpha in the bottom panel that trades off how much you care about duplicate taxes versus inequality versus equalizing consumption and if you actually look at the last two forms you can see it by liberals and by conservatives so liberals put a much lower weight on the tax you pay they care much more about equalizing the consumption of people makes sense uh conservative subjects will tend to pick in such a way that they reveal that they care a lot about the tax someone pays much less so about equalizing consumption um and so you can of course then if you want to plug it into the tax formula and see what this implies and so the other um the other things were more sophisticated than that than this for example by really trying to look at these much more complex views about you know capability immigration etc sorry that i don't have time to cover it but you're going to email me happy to chat and hopefully this will be of interest if you dig into it so thank you
