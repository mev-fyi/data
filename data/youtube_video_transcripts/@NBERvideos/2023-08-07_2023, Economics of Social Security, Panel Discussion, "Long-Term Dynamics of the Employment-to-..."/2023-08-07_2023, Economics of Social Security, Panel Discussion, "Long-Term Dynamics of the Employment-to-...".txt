okay so we are now going to change gears a bit uh and do something quite different from listening to papers because one of the one of the features uh that we've included in this social security meeting for a number of years now is to have a panel discussion on one of the core issues that relates to thinking about the long-term viability and sustainability of social security and disability systems in developed countries and we those of you who are veterans of this of this meeting for a number of years know that we've talked about fertility issues about mortality forecasting about disability forecasting about productivity and how to think about the the potential distribution of wages going forward and of course you know those of you who are from the us know that we're facing a set of projections at the moment if you follow the Social Security trustees reports that suggest that the you know the oasda I funds will will be running out the trust funds sometime in the early 2030s the exact year depends on some of the the projection details uh and consequently you know thinking about them building blocks for for those projections becomes quite relevant in trying to loop back to what my policy responses be and how would the the political economy of these programs evolve and when we've got the kind of expertise that we have in the room today it's just a great thing for us to be able to pick one of these topics and and discuss it so so this year we agreed that the topic would be essentially the future employment thinking about the number of employed workers or scaling that by population thinking about the employment population ratio going forward we picked this uh you know number six or seven months ago and modesty and I were back and forth on what would be reasonable here we pulled in some of our friends from the Social Security Administration uh those of the labor economists here will know that we actually have seen some recent numbers that have just come out from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the the labor force participation rate for the 16 plus population is now about 62.6 percent which is taking us back to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S for the 25 to 54 year old population I think it's about 83 and a half percent that's back to 2007 levels so there have been some interesting recent data on what's happening with regard to to labor force participation and total employment levels uh so what we're going to do today is to have a panel with four panelists uh the first person is and and and due to some congestion and weather issues yesterday and getting from Washington to uh to to Boston and we will have one of our panelists in person here and that will be Nicole mastis who has been a co-author on one of the papers already this morning and of course leads the nber's retirement disability Research Center which is supported by SSA uh Karen Glenn who is the Deputy Chief actuary at SSA is going to lead off the presentation today and she'll actually say a bit about when and Trisha we might actually tee up Karen if she can we can get her on the screen she will actually describe a bit the the long-term forecasting that SSA does at the moment uh we'll then move on to the second presentation will be by Julie topoleski who is from the Congressional budget office leads their long-term modeling in particular some of the work that CBO does around around the Social Security System uh and we thought it'd be very useful to get the you know the perspective from both SSA and CBO on how they have approached some of these issues and I hope that that will you know get a little bit of refinement on how to think about the the differences where there are some between the forecasts they make and and along the way I hope we'll be getting some you know open research questions that that a group like this can think about taking out and going forward with uh then Nicole will be our third speaker she'll come to the podium here and uh and give us an in-person presentation and finally Steve Goss who's the the chief actuary of SSA uh will be batting cleanup and offering some comments on these issues and it will open up to the broad discussion so so I think without further Ado Karen we're delighted that you're on the screen with us and we see your slides and take it away great all right hopefully you can hear me as well yes loud loud and clear excellent all right good morning everyone we are really glad to be here today um to get the expertise of the folks in the room as Jen said this is one of the highlights for us every year getting to present these issues that we're facing every day so I am going to kick it off kind of set the stage for the really good panelists we've got following me so I'm going to lead off with why employment matters and just some of the factors we look at related to employment so number one why does employment matter for Social Security projections uh first order obviously higher employment population ratio leads to more workers who are making payroll tax contributions and therefore more payroll tax revenue coming into the system second order over time those same workers uh mean the more workers get benefits so or more total years of work per worker and putting that all together that means an increase in benefit payments um same things go the other other way lower e to pop means things in the other direction the net effect of a higher e to pop tends to be a positive effect on the financial status of the trust funds because the increase Imperial tax revenue happens before we get the increase in benefit payments so factors in our model I'm not going to go through this in a lot of detail if you're interested you can see at the bottom we've got a link to a detailed study our office puts out on this by Paulina flesenko and Judith abuaji um factors in our model include age sex marital status the presence of children under age six the state of the economy disability prevalence educational attainment and a couple of factors that affect the timing of the retirement decision so the social security benefit replacement generate Social Security retirement earnings test um cohort effects we do have in our model lagged cohort effects for those ages 75 and older because those patterns haven't really been reflected in the historical data as well as we would like so we build that in as well and we do have a Time trend for some of the younger groups so where are we this graph shows where we were for the ratio of employment to population historically and through the 75-year projection that we do for Social Security in both the 2022 and the 2023 trustees report 2023 trustees report is the most recent that came out in April one thing to note is that we set these assumptions back in December 2022 so some of the things we were expecting over the near term didn't really pan out you can see that we were expecting a Slowdown in growth in 2023 obviously as Jim mentioned at the beginning that hasn't really panned out so the Peril of making any projections at a point in time um bottom line we are expecting these ratios to return to the peak level of around 2019 in the future gradually drift up very slowly over time um and we're expecting the gap between men and women to remain about where it is now so zooming on a little bit more on the nearer term um do we think the labor market has fully recovered from covid and the ensuing recession um we've got labor force participation rates on the left here employment rates on the right and note that our lfprs are all age adjusted to the 2011 population so this may look a little bit different than the gross rates many of you are working with um but what do we note from this graph um basically both rates employment and lfprs have recovered to the previous recession level for women not as much for men although those recent data we've just gotten looks like things are looking up for men as well but definitely everything's looking a little bit better for women um one other thing that we just we just think this is pretty interesting this graph looks at the ratio of e to pop versus the quits rate um the eat a pop is the blue line here it's exactly what you've seen on the other graph in dashed Redline is the quits right you can see that since about 2001 until we hit the pandemic period these two lines followed each other very closely um in the pandemic and following the relationship kind of blew up so what does this mean obviously these elevated quits rates mean that there's a tight labor market people are changing jobs and it's easy for them to do so um but will this relationship hold in the future or has it just changed going forward so something we're thinking about um this is a new graph we put together recently and this was actually done by Mike Stevens in our office who's one of our Disability Experts there's a lot here so let me Orient you a little bit the the top graph is focusing on employment data for those who are self-identifying as disabled and note again this is self-identification this is from the CPS so it's not really the same definition as we've got in the DI program but obviously obviously there's a lot of correlation there so um in that disabled graph at the top you can see the blue line that's pretty steady near the bottom this is the percent of people who are self-identifying as disabled and you can see that that's been really stable over time um the fluctuations we see in the gray and orange lines at the top those are eat a pop and lfpr again those are not explained by the changes in disability prevalence over time so the one really interesting thing to note here is that since about the beginning of 2020 really right after the pandemic employment of the disabled has been increasing quite a bit and if you look at the bottom graph which is the non-disabled we're not really seeing those same patterns so are there changes going on that are allowing these disabled folks or self-identified disabled folks to be able to work more seems like that's certainly a possibility and I know some of the other presentations have talked about that some um but it's just really interesting to us to see these patterns going on recently and my last slide here another thing we look at is employment of folks over age 65. so this breaks down eat a pop men on the left women on the right by age group and you can see that since 1990 employment of those older folks has been steadily trending up uh obviously a little blip around the time of the pandemic and the recession but seems to be going back up again um Willow's patterns continue uh obviously we are doing projections at 75 years so considering whether those patterns will continue is very important to us so with that I am going to pass it over to Julie thanks very much thank you um it's a real pleasure to be here um on this panel today and I'm sorry I'm out there in person and about 8 30 last night my flight was canceled and so we pivoted and now I'm on Zoom um and I know the topic today is the employment population ratio but we are actively working on thinking about our labor force participation rates and so I thought I would take advantage of that as that is on my mind and sort of stick um with that throughout my talk Jim asked me to give a little bit of background on a sort of CBO and how we fit into this process and so I'm going to try to go through the next I think it's three slides pretty quickly um and talk first about sort of cbo's primary mandate which is Baseline budget projections which are over a period of 10 years um and cost estimates again over a period of 10 years um our Baseline is done under the assumption that current laws governing spending and revenues generally remain unchanged um I will note that for Social Security um obviously under current law benefits um would not be fully payable after um trust fund exhaustion um but for Baseline purposes we assume that benefits are paid as scheduled uh CBO also does long-term projections um so each year we put out a 30-year long-term budget Outlook our most recent one came out a couple of weeks ago and we also um do 75-year social security projections and again our most recent report um came out uh just a couple of weeks ago and just to note that our analysis is independent so um thinking about why that matters is that we have um I won't go through the sort of how we think about our our analysis but um it does mean that one we are independent we have a different set of projections than do the trustees for their trustees report and another note that the demographic and economic projections that CBO uses for its analysis are consistent with those that it uses for its Baseline projections and for other purposes so we spend a lot of time thinking about the first 10 years we obviously extend those to 30 and then to 75 years but the analysis the projections that we use within CBO are all consistent and all based on the same set of projections which sort of uh puts another level of constraints on it the one you're thinking about the social security system in isolation um and then just really quickly putting those pieces together so um just to sort of set the stage and look at what outlays and revenues look like um in our projections revenues are roughly constant as a share of GDP we have payroll taxes declining over time but income taxes on benefits rising over time so revenues are pretty stable but outlays as you can see are growing um as our population is aging and we end up with a larger share of the population being of claiming age those outlays continue to grow uh just to put up a chart that'll be familiar to all of you um blade before participation rates both historically from 1970 and then through our projection um and the overwhelming takeaway from this of course is that participation rates are downward sloping that is largely attributable to aging um and I don't have a nice chart like uh Karen did but we also of course think about the effect of aging on labor force participation um and if we run a hypothetical scenario where we assume that the population isn't aging we end up at the end uh this is after 30-year projection but um in 2053 with a participation rate that is uh 3.4 percentage points higher than in our Baseline projections um so very much like um the chart that Karen just showed we end up with a pretty flat chart there um and one final chart um this is sort of uh inspired by a Washington Post article a couple of weeks ago um shows a number of people in and out of the labor force by age group and year um so on the y-axis we have age group and then we have the number of people in millions on the x-axis and what you can see over time what's a really strong takeaway from this picture is the growing number of people over age 70. um so in our projections we do have some people 70 plus in in the labor force and actually in our models um because we assume all unemployment in the Social Security world because we assume unemployment spells are all less than a year um those things are pretty equivalent um but you can really see the burden on the working population of supporting this this older population um and just a couple of slides about how we project our labor force participation right now um so our projections are really um based on a set of models um by Stephanie Aronson and others um it's a cohort based model that estimates participation rates within age sex education and race subgroups um what that turns out to in our modeling is that we end up we project participation for 516 age sex race and education groups um and actually if you're interested in our projections they're not quite available at this level of detail but they are by agent sex available on our website um and just to note that each age sex race education group is estimated as a system of equations where we constrain the cohort effects to be consistent and as you might imagine with 516 groups um that's a lot of stuff to keep track of um and because we use these projections for multiple purposes not just to create our aggregate projections but we also use that in our long-term Social Security micro simulation model we end up having to apply a lot of judgment to do things like creep um keep participation rates by age from Crossing so you don't don't end up with weird results in the micros which you'll you'll see that we're thinking about um ways we can simplify this analysis um so each um group equation um has the um an Atrix is a fixed effect a cohort fixed effect an array of time varying covariates and of course because we're doing projections we have to not only estimate but then project each of those things and um as Karen alluded to projecting cohort effects can be really tricky um and the results of the modeling are very sensitive to how you project those cohort effects and one final note before I sort of turn into a slide with some of the things that we're thinking about is CPU also uses this model or uses this model to project potential labor force participation because that's really what matters for our macro modeling so that just adds another layer of complexity into thinking about this problem for us um and then a last slide um so as I said we are revisiting how we project labor force participation um and I've listed here some of the questions that we are grappling with so thinking about relationships between participation and H6 education and immigration um will those be similar are they similar to they were in the past and how should we think about projecting those how should we think about relationships between participation and changes to tax policy and transfer programs um so we know under current law at the end of 2025 um the 2017 tax tax act the individual tax cuts associated with that will be expiring how do we think about the effect of that on participation and how should we project that we also think about the relationship between the data we're looking at and earnings from payrolls and Survey measures and are are those going to be similar um are they similar now to what they were in the past we know the gig economy is growing how should we think about that um and then finally can a more parsimonious and traxxable model in cbo's current one projects produce more accurate projections and I would add to that produce projections that we can um explain um one of the the nice things about being at CBO is our work is widely read but our our primary client and our audience is is Congress um and so how can we explain what we're doing in a way that is understandable to them um and I'm sorry I'm there in person to be able to sort of talk to some of you about some of these questions that we're having um but I hope that I've given you some things to think about and I look forward to the conversation and now I think I am hold handing over to Nicole who is who is coming to the podium as as you switch over so this is great uh thank you Julie that was great thank you so just to get us going I am going to uh cover four nobody can hear me right yeah I'm going to cover um just try to briefly address four four things first of all like what do we know about the decline in the employment to population ratio so far um particularly for this period 1999 through um 2018 and then I could talk a bit about population aging and what we know about its effects on the economy um next um a bit on groups on the margin of labor force entry and exit and in particular that will be older workers and people with disabilities to build on um what what Karen discussed um and then um I'll finish with some things I'm worrying about so what do we know about the decline in the employment population ratio I think um like the sort of the the best take on this comes from um Catherine Abraham and Melissa Carney's work published in 2020 and so what they analyze is the reasons for the decline in the employment population ratio from 1999 to 2018. so that was a 3.8 percentage Point decline over that period and they do this decomposition analysis where they they separately they separate the role of changes in in the share population in older ages from within age group changes in employment rates and so the thing the thing that I really want to highlight here is that if they assume they just hold all within Group employment rates fixed at 19.99 values and just let population age group shares change as they did population aging can explain the entire 3.8 percentage Point decline okay now of course there were other things happening other offsetting effects and in particular there was a decline in employment among people 16 to 54. that was a 2.7 percentage Point decline there was an increase in employment among 55 plus that accounted for 1.6 percentage points of the decline and then there were these interesting interactions where a greater share of population was flowing into these higher higher employment rate groups like The 55 plus group right so actually you know one lingering last benefit of um the the baby boom they're sort of last contribution to faster employment growth before they head into the retirement age cohorts so you know on net we get 3.8 percentage points now the the pay their paper really digs into the decline in the employment to population ratio within age groups in particular the 16 to 54 age group and the major reasons they find and so this is a a survey across all the literature of across you know these various potential effects on the employment population ratio a focus on causal evidence here and the biggest the biggest Factor was adverse shifts in labor demand they find in particular import competition in particular the China the China shock from Otter's work but also industrial robots that's from the assamoglu and Restrepo work those were the biggest contributions much more modest contributions they find were the DI programs and this isn't just SSDI this is also the VA program accounting for about a decline of 0.17 points in the of that 3.8 decline higher minimum wages increase incarceration those are smaller effects and importantly not important at all were expansions in the social safety net so snap Medicaid the eitc immigration similarly didn't matter much and they all also thought that lack of family leave was also not a factor there were some things that you know they thought needed more study there just wasn't the evidence for them one of them quite you know possibly an important one is is opioids and the impact of the opioid epidemic on on employment um but also things like social changing social norms and occupational licensing and the like the one you know the one offsetting factor here was Rising education okay so this is this is um one that in particular is attributed you know is sort of part of the reason why we see this rise employment among the 55 of 55 plus okay um so so that's what we know so far about what's kind of happened takes us almost to the eve of the pandemic um let's talk about population aging and so now I'm going to take like a really long view here and what you're what you're looking at nothing fancy here this is just the employment population ratio downloaded directly from um from Fred the federal reserve's you know data source and um so so so this is a graph from 1946 epop all the way through the present period and the percents here on the y-axis are ranging from 50 to 65. so we're just really zooming in on the shape and then these you know the gray bars are you know they will automatically and very nicely put the recession periods in Gray for you so you can really see you know at a very you know detailed monthly level you know the cyclical fluctuation in the employment population ratio over time but what I think is super interesting about this Long View is the shape right so you really see 1946 that's when the baby boom was just beginning to be born right um and then you know so you see a flat flat you know sort of flat flat epop and then as the baby boom is starting to enter the workforce and fill out the workforce epop is rising it flattens out about as they begin to retire it starts declining in 2010. um and so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a curve and I'm going to graph it on this exact same scale okay so it's not going to have its own scale on the right hand side we're going to use the same scale what I'm going to plot is the percent of population ages 16 to 64. and this is just data that's just the demographics here this the age structure of the US population and you can see that it has this very same similar shape now there's some really interesting departures where we had more population than we had employment um but but but you know the demographics really do um shape what happens with epop here and it takes a lot of positive news on labor demand to really offset some of these um this this really important drag on on the employment population ratio and you know just looking ahead well what you know the orange line here what if you know what's the projection for uh 2030 or 2060 it's this right so you know does this mean epop is going to similarly kind of follow this this downward Trend over time I don't know but it is remarkable how how um in sync these two these two curves move um you know that's not surprising of course we do know that um you know from Theory and now from evidence that um population aging does impact the economy in important ways it slows labor force growth that's what you were seeing there it also slows productivity growth we find um and you know in the U.S over a period of the last three decades and those two factors together absent offsetting effects on Capital um lead to slower GDP growth and that is a study that Kathleen Mullen who's in the room here and I did that just came out in AJ macro finally after many years um we we calculate there that there's been an annual loss in GDP of about a third of a percentage Point um from the 1980s to 2010 we lost as much as maybe 1.2 percentage points off GDP in 2010 through 2020 and currently we're losing about 0.6 okay so that's about one-third due to the employment population ratio and two-thirds due to the productivity slowdowns now when you talk about the productivity slowdowns um you know people automatically think about technology what and in these forces like Capital deepening where we have more Capital per worker um what you know could technology make it easier for some people to work older people people with disabilities um and really anyone and the evidence so far you know in our study we find very very suggestive evidence that may maybe there's been a little bit of a positive effect from Capital deepening but by and large the evidence from asmoglo and Restrepo finds that it's largely been about technology so far robots in particular has largely been about employment displacement more than productivity enhancement okay so that's sort of the thing we need to switch going forward is start getting more productivity gains and maybe they're there and we you know we just haven't found them yet and we'll find them for the current period um but but that's sort of where kind of where that literature stands on Aging now older workers of course you know this is similar to what Sharon what Karen showed a moment ago is that what I'm plotting here is just employment to population within within age groups it's exactly the same thing hopefully that she showed and you see that the red and orange line are the older workers where we've seen a rise in the employment rate um so why while epop has been declining for the younger age groups uh it certainly has been decline Rising for about 30 years for the 55 plus group and so what does the research say about that and whether that's likely to continue well so far the research concludes that there is substantial work capacity among older older workers um and modest rates of Decay and work capacity with age the caveat of course is it is is heterogeneity right and um working longer of course is not a possibility for everyone um in particular people and very physically demanding jobs um and I think importantly for thinking about well could you know how much can older workers be part of the solution to the slowdown in employment um due to population aging Older Workers are quite sensitive to working conditions they value certain job attributes quite highly in fact more highly than your your than younger workers do and what you're seeing here is another study with Kathleen Mullen where we ran stated preference experiments in order to elicit valuations for different job amenities and then we just um the these are the valuations broken up by age groups so the orange bars that always jut out to the right here are are your older workers who value schedule the ability to set their own schedule more so than the younger workers they value moderate physical activity as opposed to heavy work sitting as opposed to heavy work I've got a whole list here these are valuations as a percent of the wage that we were able to back out from this design the bottom line is you know about 38 percent will tell you that yeah I'd be interested in coming back into the labor Force for the right opportunity well this is what the right opportunity is about here and employers have to be willing to offer positions that um that that can you know offer these kinds of um amenities if you will now the rise in disability employment is something um that I just think is absolutely remarkable since the The Narrative here was you know only a decline in employment among people with disabilities for for decades but as you can see in this graph what you're looking at is the blue line is people without a work disability and there have been some question changes is um you know as you heard earlier in the CPS that are rather unfortunately timed but um the um what you're seeing in red is the um the employment population ratio for people with work disabilities running back to 1988. um and and so we do get this level up reading in um so the the you're seeing the there's the the red line and then it shifts kind of to a pink line for the same periods so that the CPS question was revised to include temporary disability so there is this like level up shift um but you can see these curves all start so the epop for people with disabilities really does start um turning turning around and it's true in absolute terms and relative terms so what I've done here on the left is we're just kind of we're zooming in on the um you know around the epop on the other graph for people with disabilities and you can see there's a clear upward pattern in employment here across both measures and it is also on the right an increase in employment in the employment rate relative to the blue line which is uh the the people for the employment rate for people without disabilities as a group okay now um these these this turnaround you know so we have this like turnaround among older workers and employment now we have a turnaround and disability and employment among people with disabilities coming a decade later I was very worried that the pandemic would just erase all of those all of those gains um and um fortunately that has not that has not been the case and this is work with Ari Neiman who's here here in the room um and what you see here so what we've done is we've this is again just like the data what the data say comparing relative employment for people with disabilities and without and um the top figure is is normalized to the first quarter of 2019 so we set both both groups to their to their employment rate in that quarter and you can see what's what's really really quite remarkable here is that people with disabilities didn't lose any more employment in relative terms than did than did the general population of people without disabilities and their recovery has been on Pace and then it has is even pulled ahead and if you break this apart into um in fact I don't think you actually can't see my bottom my bottom pictures here um anyway what the bottom pictures would show you if you could see them are that um that this is this this gain is strongest and concentrated among occupations that are teleworkable okay so what this is telling us is that there's something about the willingness of employers to accommodate people with disabilities that has to be you know driving this great success in the labor Mart coming out of the pandemic um and lastly you know um on on this point before I tell you what I'm worrying about and I promise I'll stop um there has been also a really like interesting increase in the number and the percent of people who are exiting SSDI the the great absorbing state it turns out that people have been leaving SSDI those rates have beginning about 2013 have increased um quite substantially so what you're seeing here I'm measuring percents now people who exit SSDI is only half a percent you know roughly right so we're not talking about a large group but this very sustained Trend in both you know number and percent is is very interesting and then if you go look and see well who's having their benefits withheld because of work effort while on SSDI well that too has been going up at about the same rate okay so so I guess what what you know what my takeaway here is it's something really interesting is happening in the labor market that is making it easier for people with disabilities um to work and it's it's not just that the DI program became less generous because of course you know these are folks who are already in the DI program and even they are being kind of pulled out of the um out of the program and back into work okay so two things I'm thinking about you know so so Karen had a disability incidence graph that was relatively flat and you know when I zoom in here um I see maybe a slight increase in the percent of people self-identifying as having a disability over time um you you know you you don't see it as much on um you know these are the three different questions that you get once the C CPS redesign those are the curves here and you know me maybe you know it varies a little bit across the um the measures but you know there is this like if you look at the orange the the Orange Line there that shows a post covid uptick when you decompose that you do find that it is driven by people with difficulties um concentrating which is a very common long coveted um complaint and and so you know I I can't say what's going to happen here but I think it is something to watch and there is a you know kind of a longer term Trend that we're seeing slightly more and more people reporting disability and I would say this you know you could this is again this is all CPS but you know Angus Deaton and case have some very interesting data where they kind of look at the health and pain reporting of of cohorts as they're you know like it's not just in middle age that people have more pain but all the the younger cohorts that are coming along behind are reporting pain at higher at higher rates so something is going on here that has me quite worried um and then lastly um I wanted to say a word about the employment population rate by by gender which brings me to caregiving um so this is just again the same picture for men and for women and um you know there was a decline among women just like a decline among men since 2000 after a period of very strong growth and I and many of us like thought that this trend um would continue but it but but it didn't um and you know this so so you know this is what's happening by gender and then you have juxtaposed against that Rising need for long-term care an aging population of course creates a need for more long-term care of Elders and you know over half of all long-term care is informally provided by family and friends and nearly 70 percent of people over 65 will require some assistance with basic functions at some point so you know this is like kind of the the coming storm um population wise um as you know we like the baby boom has not yet fully exited the labor force right so I mean it's just going to grow um in in terms of caregiving need now we know from from the research evidence that caregiving reduces work um but um Yulia truskanovski and I um got to link look at the life cycle earnings and employment patterns of caregivers over their whole life cycle in order to really kind of begin to understand you know when do these impacts arise and how do employment earn earnings change at the start of caregiving or they like changing you know well before the start of caregiving and so the dark red lines these are these figures are just a little on the small side and I apologize for that but the dark red line is the employment and earnings of of caregivers you've got women and women's earnings women's employment here um whereas the the dashed line is a matched control group and if you can see that you can't really see there's some population averages um in the background that just aren't showing up but um you know for women you see very sharp drops around Time Zero which is the start of caregiving drops in earnings drops in employment and so you know our takeaway here is that is that um you know and caregiving of course is not randomly assigned and we've done as as much as you can to get a very well matched and you can see actually going back 15 years these these groups are actually very well matched on earnings and employment um there's more about that in the paper but there is a a very discrete notable like disruption in earnings employment for women when caregiving begins um but for men these disruptions in earnings and employment start much much earlier and our thinking here is that it does appear like women will leave work to take on caregiving if if they're if if they have to the men take on caregiving when they're already out of work okay and so you know you know epop's been declining and so there's been some men out of work maybe we're you know about 40 percent of caregivers are men um but I think these very different um patterns of life cycle earnings and employment for men and women kind of just you know they they should light on they draw attention to just how complicated um this is and raise important questions about you know like what are we going to do here and what will the policy Solutions be so with that I'll stop okay so so Steve I think we have about 10 minutes left until we really do have to adjour into lunch with this group so I'm going to turn back to you to see if you have any kind of remarks reactions to what we've just heard in the three presentations and and if we have time we'll open up for a few q a from around the room uh Jim I hope you can hear me we're good yeah Jim I I actually had a presentation uh uh as the other three did uh and I assume we don't have much time left but so let me try to run through this quickly uh first of all uh uh the the the thinking on this road emanated from back discussion with you Jim back some time ago about uh concerns about the changing age distribution of the population pressures that's going to put on everything and the possibility that with this changing age distribution employers will as we have seen in the case of uh people with limitations from some level of disability uh might become more open to being more accommodating not only for people with with limitations through disability but people who are older or people with limitations in many other ways will we have an increased demand for labor as we have a big shift in our population here you see the the often looked at age uh uh age of dependency ratio indicating the tremendous uh increase in the number 65 and over compared to 2064. uh Ergo the standard population uh at 20 to 64 that we depend on is shrinking relative to uh the overall adult population over time and what are we going to do about that in terms of maintaining uh an adequate number of people employed so next slide please we see another way of looking at essentially the same thing thank you Karen for showing the sides I'm having computer trouble uh unfortunately just like Julie had airline trouble so on this one this slide uh also deals with just the adult population and shows you going all the way back to 1940 uh what the trends have been for the 25 to 44 45 to 64 65 to 84 and then the even higher age and you can see some very interesting swings the main thing of course is that by the time we get out to 2030 we will have had the baby boom shifting entirely out of uh working age population replaced by lower birth rate Generations having this massive shift in our age of dependency ratio that is going to be uh is going to be a big change for us so the next slide uh we see looking at uh employment rates uh uh for uh these are employment population ratios basically for different age groups by sex what has happened from 1970 out through 2010 and what we're anticipating uh uh going further out to 2030 and 2050 and what's remarkable here is uh the drop-off uh in the mail rates after 1970 and the dramatic increase for women especially uh up to age 55 uh between 1970 and 1990 dramatic shift that that went on so so men have really fallen off in our in their unemployment rates not worried about Labor Force participation because unemployment rates can be anywhere so we look for where the money is that's actual employment and we can see that uh men have dropped off a fair amount but women have really pulled up that have made a big difference so on the next slide uh you can see that uh interesting little graph here the orange line here indicates the number of osdi covered workers roughly employment as a percentage of the total population all ages and this is fascinating because between 1970 and 1990 this jumped way up well it jumped up for two reasons one is as we saw women up to age 55 had a dramatic increase in their employment uh whereas uh the population under 20 because of lower birth rates through uh after 1965 the pop the population under 20 dropped actually literally dropped between 1970 and 1990. so uh therefore the number of Cooperative workers per total population all ages uh actually went up and our projection is that even after 2010 it's going to basically stay up in that territory the bad news though is the projected number of covered workers in the population relative to our beneficiaries for Social Security and that's a very very different story uh there obviously because of the aging and where the concentration of our beneficiaries are one thing to note is that you'll say uh why would the big jump up in workers to total population if we have to drop down uh uh and workers per beneficiaries part of that was actually the maturation of the GI program between uh 1970 1990 it was a new program in 1957. it didn't actually start allowing people to get disability uh under age 50 until 1961. so there was a maturation process since then it's been all about the uh uh the population Dynamics uh that have been going on uh that have uh of course are are long known uh problems with population Dynamics so the next slide question is what can we do about this so what if we were to posit that uh The Mail rates that dropped off significantly after 1970 what if we were to imagine all the mail rates would go back up to where they were in 1970 and not have the drop off that helps a little bit it certainly helps in terms of the level of the uh overall uh Workforce uh number of workers uh per total population that kicks that up a little bit even further uh but for our workers per beneficiary it helps proportionally about the same but really not much it's not the answer to getting to where we would like to be if we're hoping that employment can be a major factor uh in financing Social Security to the Future it's just not enough work we would need an awful lot more increase in uh in employment Beyond just men getting back to where they were in 1970. so next slide uh we can see here what we would need uh now we have the 16 and over uh men and women on the right hand side you can see the drop in men uh and the increase in women we'd have to have an increase uh in these levels overall by about one-third from where we're projecting them to be in order for this to be a major factor in adequate financing of Social Security and getting us back to a level of uh employment to number of beneficiaries in the population that simply does not look plausible so the next slide please uh just a little wrap up here so the increasing population uh it's it is definitely going to increase the demand for goods and services and thus demand for workers uh in the future we're seeing that uh in the current type of Labor markets which might be cyclic uh but on the other hand we know that in the future we're going to have this continued change towards a greater and greater share of the population over 65 of course partly balanced by a lesser population under 20. so will there continue to be a pressure uh as we saw both in the quits rate and in the uh the tendency uh towards more and more people who've identified disabilities to be in the labor force is this a harbinger of things to come where and where employers are going to continue to modify the nature of work whether they want to or not uh and therefore employ uh more people than we might expect by simply extrapolating participation rates and employment rates by agent of the future so question is will there be increases and births and immigration uh due to Future National policy I think it was Nicole who mentioned how about uh you know child care I was actually put in the last president's budget these are possibilities that could really help but that would have a real effect on the changing age distribution of the population immigration is certainly something that is that is very much as a possibility quite quite uh you know a substitute for a big drop in birth a possibility for the future not something we're anticipating at this moment uh will there be increased demand for workers in the face of the Aging uh uh in general but how about the Aging infrastructure in our country we have massive massive aging print infrastructure talking to somebody at the Department of Labor yesterday he says why don't we have bullet trains uh how about also uh needs to address climate change right we start hiring a lot of people to build solar cells and and uh and wind turbines uh there are real opportunities here uh will Innovations uh to greatly increase labor productivity is I think Noah's a Nicole was alluding to will those help uh and and the question is will they help or hurt demand for labor if we have much more productivity will employers uh respond by saying we don't need to hire as many people or will there always be things our society can benefit by by having more people on board so finally I guess the question is if we don't make real progress in these areas we will need increase in taxes or lower scheduled benefits of social security or some found in hivs too uh as in most past major legislation so again the impetus here the desire of the Hopeless to see how much of the shortfalls in the future that are resulting from the dramatic change in the age distribution of the population we might be able to address by having increased demand for Labor uh it looks like there's a possibility for some especially as I forget whether it was Nicole or Julie mentioned there is a there's a further untapped resource for 65 and older that is going to have an increasing average age but on the other hand with a modification of the nature of work we should be able to keep a lot of those people at work longer and that could benefit our society so lots of possibilities and also Jen just trying to bring this back a little bit into the Social Security realm here too Steve just to you know to run for a second with what you've just said I think as the group thinks about these issues right the the automation question the what's the what's the AI impact on the labor market the the shift for you know labor intensive service demand demanded by high income workers and the implications of changing income distribution for level of of earnings of of employment demand I mean these are all issues that you you and Nicole have have touched on here and I think that was some of what we hope to you know get out onto the table as the group is thinking about this to just recognize that uh this is not just a mechanical calculation as it were of let's look back and look forward it it is a crystal ball calculation but hopefully there are some things which a group like this and other groups that are meeting here at the Royal Sonesta today can potentially address and think
