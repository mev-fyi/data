um it's really exciting to be able to introduce this afternoon's panel on sanctions and the global economy as you all know sanctions have risen to the surface the kind of economic issues of today's contemporary policy debates uh the recent book by the historian Nicholas Mulder actually sort of emphasizes that originally sanctions originated as kind of wartime blockades part of wartime conflict and then over time they've increasingly evolved to being seen as an alternative to direct military conflict and have led to this increasing debate on to what extent sanctions are ultimately successful in changing behavior in a targeted country and also in terms of the costs or impact of those sanctions on the countries doing the sanctioning and so you know one of the things Nicholas smother stresses in his book is that on the one hand in an increased globalized World sanctions become more effective because the costs are being cut off from International Commerce are obviously greater yet on the other hand the very threat of those sanctions in the globalized economy can lead to a walk back from globalization I think countries increasingly trying to a substitute from foreign sources of supply and we've seen some of those recent substitution in in recent events over the over the last few years so we have an absolutely Stellar panel to discuss this set of issues uh containing sort of Frontier research on these questions including David backy Rudy go backman um Ollie gets cocky this year's bass Clark Medal winner Lorenzo Caliendo Guido lorenzoni and Ivan verning and so I'm going to ask them each to to speak in turn for around 15 minutes proceeding by alphabetical order of last name of the research team members and then after each of them talks for around 15 minutes and I think Rudy and David will split their talk between them we then have around 15 minutes at the end for Q a discussion and debate so without further Ado I'm handing over to you really great so thanks for having us I'm substituting in for Ben and his choreography was that I talked a little bit from the machine room of having recently you know sort of worked in the political enemy of sanctions and and David will do the hard economics so I'm going to start and then I hand over to David and then he he will hand back to me so the starting point for our paper was really just these remarkable claims by German politicians about an energy embargo on Russia in by the end of February uh beginning of March for example the minister of economic Affairs Robert kobeck was saying if we did this there would be mass unemployment poverty and social unrest Chancellor Schultz millions of job lost and then later that was in May the lobbyists came in for example someone from the Bavarian Business Association six million jobs in danger and of course if you know a little bit about German history every school child in Germany now it's 6 million unemployed that's right around 1932 1933 that means if someone uses 6 million unemployment figures Hitler comes afterwards basically um so this is so we wanted to get you know we wanted to make sense of these claims and uh you know we were thinking about a framework to to help us think about both the mechanisms that would would be involved presumably something to do with trade substitution using Imports and the numbers namely substitution elasticities our point was not to make a point prediction in a way you know you would do it as a in a regular business cycle forecast but to kind of get the order of magnitude right in other words would this be a Corona type of recession um or or much worse that's basically really at least uh my view of of what we were trying to do we wanted to open up a discussion or close it um and we also in the paper did not make a policy prescription in terms of let's actually do an embargo let's have a tariff of a price cartel um it is really a what if paper um although that's kind of got mixed up because admittedly some members of the team me included Ben as well Christian buyer also signed various um you know memoranda actually going for an embargo but those was political activism not science um but we did make and this is going to be important later for the city to understand the situation we are right now in Germany we did make policy recommendations conditional on a gas import stuff how to fight it basically or how to make it less worse okay so what we did is we just assembled an individual interdisciplinary team of macro economists energy economists um with uh and policy advising economies and then David ended up doing all the work so so I'm responsible for anything that's wrong in the favor thanks a lot Rudy um so uh as as Rudy mentioned uh our objective here was just to try to get some um back of the envelope order of magnitude type sense of how costly this would be for Germany um and so the headline number that we came up with or the order of magnitude that we came up with was something on in the order of a half a percent to a three percent reduction in aggregate output and you could think of this as GDP or domestic absorption if you like there's differences between the two of course and I'm happy to talk about those differences later on so that means that we would expect this to be something um slightly less severe than the covet recession which was about four and a half percentage Point decline in GDP and it's certainly not something that you could put on par with the Great Depression which is really kind of the thing that we were pushing back against we just thought there was great depression-like scenarios were unrealistic um uh good so how do we think about this I mean this this is a lot of math I think for a policy panel but I think this equation is very uh helpful it certainly helps me to think about questions like this um so to start with when we want to think about this question I think the obvious place to start is just to start with perfect competition and think about if we have a perfectly competitive economy what do we expect should happen to real domestic absorption and real GDP um if there's a problem importing some good from overseas so so this equation I've got at the top is a change in real consumption you could think of it as a change in Wildfire if you like in a trade model um and the first line is basically giving you first order effects and the second line is giving you um non-linearities that are associated with this shot so what are these uh what are these terms so um this is the change in the different so this is a an open economy that's trading with the rest of the world um if you think that there's a shock that's going to adjust and change the amount of imports that you're going to bring in well obviously that's going to affect the home consumer by some amount that's commensurate to how much the home consumer is spending on the good that you can no longer get so this is a very standard effect there's an effect that has to do with the amount of exports that you have to sell to the rest of the world in order to be able to buy this good so if you suddenly have to start selling a lot more in order to be able to finance your consumptions then that's going to affect you as well and then finally there could be a change in employment so if there's a chain change in the employment of different factors then that's going to affect real consumption by the extent to which these factors are earning income for you as a share of your total income so um these are kind of like straightforward in the sense that we can uh put numbers on these we know something about how much uh German the German economy spends on different kinds of goods and then how much we might expect each of these Goods to change um but of course something that's special about uh natural gas or energy in general is that we would expect these effects to be very non-linear energy plays a crucial role in Supply chains um and so we want to be able to think about that I think it's a little naive to just say the effect is going to be the expenditure share on energy times the reduction in energy that that that's true in a cop Douglas world but but not outside of it so what the second term is taking into account is these non-linear effects now in a competitive model the way these non-linear effects are going to manifest themselves is through how quickly the expenditure on energy changes in response to the shock so I think it's useful just to think in terms of these numbers just how much do you imagine the expenditure share on energy could plausibly increase in response to this shock that's going to help you put some discipline on the on the aggregate consequences of the shock and down there we've got a similar equation for real GDP which is production as opposed to consumption so if we wipe away what what I'm claiming to be unimportant terms then the key uncertainties that we have to sort out are how much do we expect energy to fall or natural gas to fall in uh in Germany um how much do we expect the expenditure share on energy to spike in response to this shock this is going to capture the role of complementarities essentialness everything about the input output that matters will load into this term here and then finally how much do we expect employment to change in Germany and so obviously this last one is something that's really going to depend on how German policy makers decide to react to this um to this episode this is not something that's got anything to do with physics this is more a matter of monetary and fiscal policy okay good so here's an order of magnitudes calculation uh we have a general we have some energy economists on the team who advised us a reasonable number to go with for the reduction in natural gas Imports into Germany from an embargo or from cutting off Russian gas would be something on the order of 30 percent or 30 lot points and then the initial expenditure share of gas uh in GNE or GDP is about 1.2 percent yeah so what we did is we said just to get a sense of the magnitudes we might imagine that in response to this shock perhaps the expenditure share on energy quadruples in Germany so this would be comparable to the increase in uh expenditures on oil during the 70s during the oil crisis but this is so simple you could just do your own exercise and say no let's suppose it goes up by a factor of 10 instead of a factor of four and see what happens and so here just that calculation holding employment constant this is sort of the physics part as opposed to the unemployment part of the effect on welfare and you could see that if the effect on the expenditure share is that it quadruples then you're going to get something on the order a reduction of on the order of about one percentage point if you thought that it went up by a factor of 8 or a factor of 10 you could get this up to like 1.6 or something like that so that that's sort of right in the middle of that range that I mentioned at the beginning of between 0.5 and 3 percent now on top of this you might expect there to be some Keynesian effects so for example if this policy is inflationary and this inflation is not accommodated by the central bank then this might result in some unemployment in Germany and so to to kind of like add that in you can roughly think of doubling this number because this is an inflationary impulse to Germany if you try to counteract this in inflationary impulse I mean maybe the Central Bank chooses not to do that but if they do try to counteract it then it's going to cause employment roughly um equivalent to the size of the initial shock so that's just sort of a back of the envelope thing here what we do is we take a sear so this is like the First Column is the back of the envelope what we can also do is we can take specific structural models of the Economy Feed in the shock calibrate elasticities and see what sort of numbers we end up with so the first one is uh simulation done in this paper that I have with the manual where we try to build a model with a full input output structure of the world economy with lots of complementarities in production and we get numbers that are quite a bit smaller uh than than the the back of the envelope that I just did I can explain why this is in a second and then we also just try taking a simple CES production function calibrating an elasticity of substitution and feeding in the shock and again as long as the change in the expenditure share is not bananas the effect is not going to be crazy in terms of how it affects welfare so for example for these numbers we use an elasticity of 0.04 to get really big effect actually really need to go close to zero at which point the expenditure share is going to shoot off the infinity in the limit now I'm going to hand this back to Rudy but before I do that I just want to mention some limitations of what we have what's missing from the calculations on this page that I'm showing you the first one as I mentioned is business cycle amplification effects to do with Keynesian unemployment the other thing that I think you could criticize the this uh big trade model uh um is that it uses the standard assumption that the trading technology is linear so I think that's probably pretty reasonable for longer run calculations but in the short run you probably would think that trading Technologies are have a quite a bit of decreasing returns in them so that's not something that we built into the big model and so it's not there that means that the reason this number is small is because there's a lot of substitution that happens once you cut Germany off from Russia well you could start importing from other people that you're connected with and you can scale up that in those Imports linearly because of the way the technology works in the model as I say if you were to change that assumption it would just result in the Energy share spiking by more so you can go from there directly um and uh yeah uh the other thing I want to say is in our simulations while it's true that the trading technology is linear and I think that's a shortcoming one thing that we did think about and one thing that we did put in is we we made employment and um capital in each sector um immobile so we don't have that in response to the shock the whole structure of the German economy shifts towards producing completely different stuff there is quite a bit of decreasing returns to the scale within each sector because capital and labor can't move across sectors with that I'm gonna hand that to you so what came out of it failure mostly you know the the lobbyists were there before us this is from the financial times on the 21st of April German boardrooms and uproar German government officials say they have been inundated with letters from industry insisting how systematically relevant everyone is chemical sector the ba industry in Germany claimed to be systemically relevant even the which is true even the salt pretzel industry claimed it was systemically relevant in an article believe it or not we got sharp attacks from Trade union employer Association economists models can't be trusted the chancellor of national TV said it is it is irresponsible irresponsible from economists to use these models um and you know sort of being self-critical in hindsight I do think that at the end of the day we perhaps focused a little bit too much on being right about the numbers and debated these numbers and um we focused to a lesser extent on say intermediate policies why why why defend the Gaza embargo and rather think about harder about a tariff or a European demand can't tell but at some point the political debate was poisoned so you wouldn't be even listened to for these ones and certainly what is in the paper and this is really important for the discussion now is there was an utter neglect of the discussion of the policies conditional on uh uh uh a gas shortage mostly or most probably now not instigated by by Germany itself but Putin uh Putin as a as a as a measure in the economic Warfare okay and so there's you know things like stop using guards for producing uh electricity and using lignite coal with Germany as an abundance we didn't do that there's still a gas subsidy in place can you believe it it for industry and then no hard incentives for household to save until now because they sit on a long-term gas contracts so we have an important nominal rigidity I would call it a fatal normal rigidity um in the system um public opinion turned against us and certainly against the Embargo I will say what the ministry of Economics did and his team they did remarkably well on the on the supply side they really did a good job they worked with Norway the Netherlands the UK the US stepped up they the floating LNG terminals are probably going online in December that's the plan and they can substitute a ton of guys even one of one of uh the things so it's it's really remarkable and so roughly rather than the 55 percent that we used as the starting point and cut it down to 30 percent the the the the the dependency of red on of Germany and rad guys it's Now 37 already okay my remaining pet peeve there's still a Pyrenees gap between Spain and France and because France refuses to let Spanish guards into the EU for reasons I I still cannot really comprehend so if you do the math The Prodigal institution in in in Brussels has done this very recently currently we are at a 30 gas Gap in Germany um so it demand has to be reduced by 30 to kind of not ration and this does not just so and we still have the easy measures like substituting electricity production uh uh that would help us cut down these numbers the LNG floating LNG terminals also not in this number one one LNG terminal basically would cut this down by five percentage points I just talked to the guy so there was some success we got a scientific debate going many many studies so that was actually positive a positive surprise a lot of think tanks that should have should have done these calculations instead of uh with you know with staff of 10 20 economists doing this should have done these calculations even before us uh stepped up and did and mostly they find orders of magnitude similar to uh to what we had and finally just in in a few recent days there's and of course this is weak uh soft evidence but it is evidence nonetheless beginning evidence to see that now with the impending gas shortage some of the mechanisms we have assumed in our paper actually uh uh beginning to appear so this is I just copied this uh from Oxford uh analysis uh you can see a spike in chemical Imports uh sort of intermediate chemical products are now being imported to an increasing degree and chemical production stays flat so it seems to be that in the chemical sector people are starting to to um to enhance their international trading Network and a very concrete example of this is now BASF the biggest German uh chemical firm has a has a plant in the United States that apparently can completely substitute for his ammonia production which is important for fertilizer production and this was a big a big topic also with the world hunger crisis that's currently going on uh in Germany finally um there's a recent study on on how much gas German household have already reduced these guys found it it was six percent and if you if you come compare this with effective natural gas prices for households that have gone up but not fully to the market price that's the nominal the aforementioned nominal rigidity you can compute there is an elasticity on the household side of roughly minus 0.1 and this is close to the numbers we have used so we have seen some confirmation there as well so I would say on the science side partial successes I think and uh um but on the political economy side uh more or less utter failure what's important now is the Outlook uh I would say the the political debate on Gaza embargo gas tariff gas demand cartel is over uh what we need to focus now on is a serious demand reduction measures we have unfortunately legal massive legal hurdles these are EU hurdle so if you change that uh you have to get an EU consensus there's a lexicographic prioritization of private households over industry if that stays in place and we run into a gas rationing um then there will be serious damage in Industry indeed we have to get rid of these nominal rigidities in the gas contracts and you know ideally you do some kind of econ 101 thing you really don't have to invent the wheels I think where you let the prices work the market prices work quickly uh in this case probably by government Fiat and you compensate poorer households based on previous demand payment but so that at the margin everyone has an incentive to uh to save my only hope is that we get this done I'm somewhat positive still because it's pretty clear that politicians fear political rationing as the devil fears holy water because you really do not want to be in the business of telling people you know you you can't shower uh on those days or something like that all right handing over to you Lauren oh thanks thanks to you Steve and uh Bobby look for basically uh putting this uh putting us in basically in the program this is basically a work with uh with Fernando parro and we will be actually trying to think about the economic global economic effects of uh trade sanctions and it could be more specific about what do I mean by trade sanctions uh in a moment so as we have seen countries have imposed uh trade sanctions to Russia that restrict basically the possibility of Russia getting access uh this is Russia to export certain Goods to the world economy there's a there have been imposes I mean residency imposes today and there's like a commitment that supposedly at the end of the year is going to be even more restrictions we posted on on Russia's exports so we want to understand is what are the global effects of these trade sanctions so one of those basically we're going to build on uh or new developments on the quantitative literature in fact we're going to basically build on calendar 2015. we're going to think about a world economy with multiple countries multiple sectors uh it's going to be trade in some tradable sectors of course it's going to be non-tradable sectors importantly Supply linkages and the role of Natural Resources you're going to see in a moment why of course I mean the previous talk was very complementary to what we're going to be doing why it's so important to include natural resources into this discussion about train sanctions in particular to Russia in terms of the day Source we're going to try to get to access to the most We Believe comprehensive data source today to think about answering this question so we're going to be using the gtab 10 data source that has 121 gun through 65 sectors 65 in a 121 inputable linkages and importantly it has bisectors and in particular sectors that matter basically the use of Natural Resources in production and the focus of this talk this five seven minutes are going to be talking is going to be focusing on sanctions on Russia's oil in in gas sector so let me let me first talk about the geography of production in the world of gas and oil let me tell you who are the big players in the world in terms of production who basically exports more who Imports more in these two sectors and then tell you why we need to basically move away from a very standard model and add the role of Natural Resources to think about this particular question and then I'm going to consider two particular policies if you want in terms of trade policy to study the effects of sanctions in Russia and in the world economy so in terms of the geography of world production what you see in the map is basically a well who are the largest producers of oil in the world and of course no surprise Russia actually is one of the largest prices of oil in the world and of course you see the Middle East it's very clear very dark green and then of course it follows Russia and if you look at gas it's even more there you are so that's oil that's gas you see that Russia of course in gas is also a very large producer of of gas so when you're thinking about in this case this trade sanctions you're basically sanctioned in a country has a very particular characteristic in the world it's a large supplier of two important inputs in production in the world economy because they have access to these natural resources so if you look at for example in terms of exports who are basically large as exporters nor surprise I mean is these countries are basically are the largest producers that also exports basically this world this could store World economy and uh that's exports of gas and in particular of gas Russia is a larger player as a large exponent to the world of gas compared to oil and of course Imports then you have to look ahead to the rest of the world and you see like China and India large importers in the world economy of oil and we look at gases kind of more spread out something you cannot see because it's a matter of scale I mean Europe of course Imports import soil and when you look at gas of course Europe I guess you guys were looking at Germany there but I mean okay so Europe of course is a big importer of gas into the world economy so bottom line it's uh we're going to consider the effects now of let's say U.S and Europe okay European countries unilaterally imposing we're gonna what we're going to call restrictions trade restrictions into into Russia we're going to allow other countries in the world China India Etc to still import from Russia so we're not going to do zero consideration in terms of like is the world going to basically coordinate in this essential we're going to assume that U.S and Europe directly are the ones that are going to impose in the sanctions to see how far we go in terms of the effects on Russia and the world economy of these sanctions what are sanctions for us I'm going to consider two scenarios Wednesday is going to be the U.S and Europe ban Imports of oil and gas completely into their own countries the second decision I'm going to consider we're going to consider it's going to be that U.S and Europe impose a tariff that maximizes Global income and what I mean by global income means income real income of the world economy without Russia so it's like suppose the US has an object U.S and Europe objective of maximizing Global income and of course to the fact to the extent that we're going to allow as I said here we're going to Model Natural Resources as a fixed factor in production in the oil and in the gas sector in Russia those friends generated from this fixed Factor production are going to be used as the international economy in this case in Russia so you're going to be seeing how the rents of these local factors of these fixed Factor natural resources are going to be basically changing as the US and Europe impose tariffs into into Russia so these are the two actually we're going to basically consider and look at and look at the effects and then I'm going to basically summarize and tell you kind of what we're looking for to continue doing in this research agenda yes so first so what you see here is again so this is us and Europe group of is in Europe basically restricting completely the Imports of a of oil and gas from Russia a small point to consider which I say here is like importers need to substitute away from Roy from gas and oil exactly what you were saying David however only countries would actually have access to the Natural Resources can actually Supply this one so there is substitution going in but at the end of the day you can only get access to these inputs oil and gas if I'm in those countries are actually produced it actually continue supplying those those those goods but we're going to think about think about this as a medium one because we're going to fix this Factor production let it fix basically the natural resources to basically produce a oil and gas so what do we find so very heterogeneous effects in the world economy so of course Russia is a country that basically loses loses the most the world economy loses from basically this indirectly imposing tariffs basically restricting completely sorry the Imports of goods from from oil and gas from Russia and meriteral genius effects you got against many countries of course those countries are dependent on the role of Russia basically losing more respect to others in other countries gain Norway Etc are able for example to gain as a consequence of what they are now become important suppliers of oil and gas to the world economy a second exercise we did which I'm not going to show you now which is but I'm going to basically relate that exercise is this is the US and Europe not buying goods from from the rest of the world from we're not buying goods from Russia oil and gas suppose at the same time the rest of the world signs up free to remaining oil and gas to the point that basically they import these oil and gas at zero costs among each others right it doesn't change too much the magnitudes and that's part of the consequence that still it's very low today the cost to basically import this oil and gas across these economies to their lower economy the second exercise that I do is I'm gonna basically move around and think about okay suppose the US and Europe impose a tariff on the Imports of oil and gas from Russia so this is like we're talking about two sectors we're talking about U.S and Europe unilaterally imposing a tariff of imports of oil and gas from Russia moving from something like so this is one plus the Alba Laurent tariff so it's like one percent two percent that will be twenty percent forty percent sixty and so on and what I'm plotting here is the global effects what I mean is the world real income change from imposing this unilateral tariff into Russia and the effects that it has also on Russia's uh real income of course part of this is driven by the fact that they have this fixed Factor you know they're getting less rent from this fixed Factor yes they can sell it to China and India but the fact that the world economy is demanding less from them that's basically reusing their Sprints and of course hurting in this case real income in Russia so bottom line what we find there is an optimal tariff although we're thinking about two sectors there is an optimal Turf that the world actually can think about in this case as U.S and Europe imposing a tariff to to Russia a tariff that actually maximizes if you want a welfare in their world economy I mean what would happen there if we were to impose that optimal tariff it would not be a tariff that basically minimizes runs in Russia it will be a tariff that of course maximizes well well GDP and of course I'm not making any discussion about how you distribute this incomes across the world right I'm thinking about how the world income will increase but very heterogeneous effects in fact how do you see these heterogeneous effects you see in this in this next map this is if we were to actually impose that optimal Target that we find numerically which is roughly close to 13.5 percent unilaterally U.S and Europe in both in Russia or in oil and gas what we find is that very delicious effects yes Russia loses a a but it's not the only one country that that loses I mean other countries in the world also lose on aggregate you do find that the world income increases but of course to actually obtain these gains you need to find a retribution scheme across economies in order to basically achieve achieve those kinds so I guess both online I guess we find that trade sanctions generate aggregate welfare losses we find that they generate in trade sanctions by here what I mean is basically sanctioning let's say not buying goods from this country that we want to sanction or imposing a tariff generates very detergents effect with maybe some unintended Consequence the fact that other countries are going to in fact be worse off on the fact that you are sanctuary in Russia uh we find that there's little space for trade policy to reshape the geography of oil and gas uh production and especially to offset these these losses and that's related to the substitution question that we're talking about before that you guys were talking about before both online we find that it's a a hard to escape from the economic losses of train sanctions to a large producer that's important I guess I guess in this particular case we're talking about sanctioning a large producer in the world economy producing an important input in production which is oil and gas extensions and where we have seen ways that in the median land and long run you can actually find sanctions that can actually hurt well that would re that would actually entail reshaping the structural Global Production and that of course takes time one is if it is a case that we improve productivity in these sectors right oil and gas and the rest of the world relative to Russia of course you're going to see that Russia actually loses more and the rest of the economy will actually gain more another option will be reductions in non-tario barriers that can facilitate the access to oil and gas across countries in the world that's another option that I could actually generate a potential larger gains to the world economy not necessarily a larger losses to Russia we find I mean I I mean our preliminary estimates means that reducing reducing basically a non-tario trade cost by less than one percent uh will generate basically that every single country would actually be better off eventually and we're working now on effects effects on growth thank you that was terrific um and great to get insights from quantitative trade models that very much complement two presentations very much complementing one another and then our third presenter is like I think his slides are also here awesome thanks so much Steve and Pablo uh so unlike uh Lorenzo's focused on what's actually happening in the Russian economy and and like David and Rudy I will try to do it with not a single equation uh so this this is based on my work with Dima who is here and so tomorrow he will be presenting a companion paper sort of this analysis is based on a optimal exchange rate policy paper that we have with him and he will show some equations tomorrow right now uh ifm session so basically the starting point for this paper was this puzzling behavior of the Russian exchange rate against the dollar so before the War uh it was kind of very stable at 75 rubles per dollar for the past eight years since 2014-15 right so the Central Bank kind of supported this value of the exchange rate probably using open market operations you know it's selling and buying reserves but then as soon as the war had started on um 24th of February there was this massive devaluation right oh yeah yeah yeah so uh so as soon as the war started there was this massive deviation there was a bank Panic uh sort of the value of the ruble collapsed um the rest of you know Western countries imposed the same like unprecedented sanctions on the reserves of the Central Bank and on the Russian Central Bank uh but then suddenly Ruble stabilized sometime in you know late March and then there was this completely uh puzzling uh appreciation of the ruble so first Ruble was going back towards its uh pre-war level and then appreciated beyond that and sort of like by the by June it was already stronger than before the war and it kept appreciating uh uh in June to like a level around here and now it came a little bit back with the decline in the recent decline in oil prices and so the question is what was exactly going on with Russian economy right and so you know in fact if you do a quick Google search of best performance currency of 2022 uh you can find a lot of you know insightful read on that obviously if you are foreign investor you couldn't quite take advantage of that so invest in you know Ruble assets so it's not quite available for you know foreign assets but if you were in Russia and you chose to keep your savings and rubles you know indeed you did better than keeping your savings in in in dollars or Euros right and so here's another picture this is what happened with the policy rate and so it's Russia against Ukraine here well so the policy rate in Ukraine you know skyrocketed and keeps going up while in Russia it went up fast but then by now the Russian Central Bank cut the policy rate that you know kind of coming back to the normal levels uh you know there is a recession in the Russian economy probably lower than what is anticipated before but overall um sort of like the banking crisis didn't realize and sort of the financial Market has been stabilized and so the question is exactly what's going on there so the last picture that I'm gonna show is uh a trade so this is Imports and indeed import sanctions were imposed and you can see this is like monthly Imports they have collapsed by about 50 percent and what's interesting here is that it's not just from countries that impose sanctions but imports from China have decreased as well quite a bit and so the Russia has closed a lot of the data sources so this is constructed indirectly from trade of that the other countries Report with rash question like aggregating and so it's actually quite hard to find Direct data in the Russian economy now and then if you look on the expert side well you know in this blue bars the sun precedentedly high levels of expert revenues the 100 you know billion euros uh that Europe transferred to Russia is somewhere in there during the months of the war and so the black line is the trade surplus which also reaches you know unprecedented uh levels uh you know and mostly it's because oil prices you know this is the chart for oil prices they started at 70 and they reached 120 and just recently they started coming down back to like 90 95. this is uh and on top of it indeed there was a discount at which Russia was you know from what we know at which it was selling oil internationally from some of the over-the-counter contracts that you know we know about it looks like there is a pretty sizable discount on sales of Russian oil to third countries you know obviously going forward probably there would be some type of evasion of import sanctions and this might mean revert there would be you know some type of sanctions are facing then from Europe so expert might Decline and then you know we don't know what will happen with that discount right so there are arguments why the discount can get bigger if Europe stops buying ration oil and gas or you know the discount can get smaller as Russia finds alternative you know places to supply oil so what we try to do here is uh we want to sort of address some of the uh positive questions normative questions are hard what's optimal to do is really difficult and you could kind of see it from uh you know we're just discussion why it's so difficult to sort of conclude what's the right thing to do but some of the positive questions can be answered and you know we can find Common Grounds using these are fairly simple models here right and so first of all you know what exactly happens with the ruble it appreciate it depreciates and it appreciates does it make sense you know can we conclude from that that sanctions are actually not working or we cannot conclude that or we can actually in fact that it's a sign that sanctions are working um there is an argument uh in the debate that maybe you know on the financial repression and financial Authority ruble exchange rate is completely irrelevant so if you're like a foreign investor you cannot invest in Russian assets anyway so maybe that exchange rate is altogether relevant that's another question we can address and sort of like what are the implications of all of this for government revenues which in a way is one of the important questions because you know this revenues is used to find the war and sort of like the ultimate goal of the sanctions is to limit the you know Financial fiscal ability to to fund the war like can we say something what happens with the revenues right and so to do that we build on our recent work and kind of like in a nutshell the answer is sort of like really simple so you think about exchange rate as being a uh price that equilibrates the currency market so you really have to think about demand and Supply in the currency market and if you uh sort of think about what is the supply of currency to the Russian economy well there are two sources it's either experts and it's net foreign reserves not foreign assets and in particular the official reserves of the Central Bank and so that the sanctions could have targeted experts they did not uh not yet and then uh there was indeed an asset freeze on the on the central bank so those this type of sanction was in place right then if you think about what is the demand for currency there is again two sources of demand for currency one is you need currency to buy inputs and the sanctions really targeted Imports so like the heaviest part of sanctions was uh was was centered on import so it reduced this massive source of demand for currency which you need currency to buy imports and now you cannot so this reduces the demand for currency and then the alternative use of um you know of currencies as a vehicle for savings right if you sometimes you might want to use foreign currency as a safe asset in cases when other safe assets are unavailable and you know the bank run the collapse of the uh stock market that happened in March they all kind of pushed people to want to save and foreign currency use foreign currency not to buy imports but use it as a vehicle for savings and so the response to that was not Financial repression inside the Russian economy by the central bank so so kind of both things happen like the demand for currency increased as a you know safe asset but also there was a financial repression by the central bank to undo it right and so then what does the exchange rate do well it has to equilibrate demand and Supply so if uh you know current currency scarce in the in the in the market than Ruble depreciates if currency is abandoned and through will appreciates right and essentially the whole story here is about the balance of these two forces and you can kind of see how initially it was the asset freeze that led Ruble to depreciate it was the shift of people and to saving and foreign currency when you know the stock market collapsed and there was like almost a bank run and the Russian economy but then the government you know cranked up Financial repression and then experts succeeded a lot inputs and so this was kind of the sequence of events that was happening that largely explains what uh what's happening with the dollar and like the most recent developments is Drupal is so strong that the government essentially rolled back most of the financial repression on the economy to sort of avoid further appreciation of the ruble I'm gonna largely so so guided Navan have a paper that focuses specifically on the Goods Market I'm gonna kind of say just too quickly two words so this was about uh the currency market and sort of thinking about the nominal exchange rate as the price that Equity rates the currency Market obviously you have to think about the real exchange rate at the same time which is sort of like a price that equilibrates the Goods Market in some ways and so you know what's the link between the two between the two the link is monetary policy if monetary policy stabilizes inflation it actually creates a link between nominal and real exchange rate right and so far there has not been monitored inflation in the Russian economy right so the central bank did not monetize the debt of the uh Ministry of Finance and or didn't help the budget yet so there was really inflation really reflected the scarcity of the import Goods but not the monetary inflation so as a result this link is there and if you kind of understand what happened to nominal exchange rate you have to figure out the forces on the Goods Market side of what's happening with the real exchange rate and sort of like I'm gonna go very quickly well the answer here is learner symmetry so basically this is the you know classic result that helps under appreciated that expert taxes equivalent to an importative in terms of allocations but not in terms of the exchange rate movement in fact you know the idea here is that you need to achieve trade balance or in the temporal budget constraint for a country you must hold and so if there is an expert tax on impact expert revenues go down but that's not an equilibrium you need Imports to adjust as well and how that happens well you need to reduce Imports that happens by depreciation of the currency you make you know Imports less affordable and that will balance out the market so like expert tax requires a depreciation but then if you can achieve exactly the same allocation with an imperative and import sanctions actually do play a role of an imperative they reduce Imports on impact that's not an equilibrium because of the inter-temporal budget constraints so you need to reduce experts as well and how does that happen well that actually requires an appreciation right and sort of this is the diverse side of the coin of what is happening uh in the financial Market with supply and demand for currency but this is now purely real mechanism and this is what drives uh the real exchange rate you know is that interesting I usually start with learner symmetry my you know Master Level undergraduate lectures because for example this you know this logic exactly tells you that trying to fight current account deficit with an import tariff is kind of a non-starter because in the end of the day you just end up with less trade on both sides but it doesn't affect the current account deficit uh or Surplus be exactly because of the exchange rate adjustment and so the idea behind learner symmetry is all relative prices stay the same so real wages kinda are affected in the same way by import and expert tariff but it requires in the background a differential exchange rate adjustment to guarantee the same adjustment of the allocation relative relevant relative prices and so kind of like you know having said that then it becomes clear since sanctions were mostly concentrated on the import side and not on the expert side the appreciation is sort of a natural uh natural outcome here what's much more surprising you know learner equivalent learner symmetry the celebrated result but what's much more surprising and kind of comes out of the recent work in particular this paper with Dima is that the equivalence is stronger it's not just in terms of like uh some allocations but for example if you start thinking about uh fiscal revenues or real cost of living for people the effects again are the same in the sense that it's kind of very intuitive if the government draws a lot of revenues from Experts of Natural Resources an expert uh you know an expert embargo will limit the law of the government revenues but it turns out by uh by learner symmetry turns out even import sanctions by adjusting the exchange rate kind of end up having the same effect on fiscal revenues and that's perhaps surprising that you can use the import tool to achieve exactly the same physical physical outcomes and the same is true for a real cost of living for people who are more dependent on the import side but if you do expert embargo you will impose exactly the same cost through learner equivalence again and sort of what's interesting here the situation is somewhat different than the way to think about it if you do expert sanctions you make currencies cares yeah you don't get revenues from the rest of the world but you know foreign goods are available it's just you don't have money to buy them right uh if you do import sanctions the currency is abundant you get all those expert revenues you have plenty of euros and dollars in the Russian economy it's very difficult to buy to buy imports right and so sanctions are inherently leaky and so the question is which sanctions are easier to go you know around right so obviously if sanctions were Bulletproof the allocation is equivalent under 10 input sanctions and 10 expert sanction but here you have plenty of currency and you need to figure out a way to go around the limit on buying goods right if you pay mercenaries a lot of dollars you know if they are willing to accept dollars as payment right you sort of resolve the issue right and here you don't have those dollars to pay right but all the inputs are available right and so in a way theoretically it is the same but then like which sanctions you need to go around so in this case you have to go around the oil export sanctions and try to sell your oil to some countries that are willing to buy it so you have to go around different sanctions that's sort of the differences between the two and the last thing which in the policy debate sometimes people said well if you did import sanctions you really don't need to worry about expert sanctions this is wrong because they are the sanctions are not substitutable they work cumulatively and unless you reach full water in terms of trade which is clearly has not been reached right then the sanctions kind of add up on top of each other and so that the optimal question is again very difficult but you cannot you know you might have thought that I'm saying that they're substitutable well they work cumulatively but they have very very similar effects on the end and they will have a cumulative effect so finally I want to talk about financial repression which was an essential part of the policy response right and so the point is again when currency comes into the country you can use it to buy inputs or some people want to hold it as a safe asset and these are competing uses for currency and there is big demand for either it will lead to a depreciation so you can limit either of the two and curb the depreciation basically if you see what the bank of Russia did they did lots of stuff that was Financial depression right so basically they forced exporters to sell expert revenues in in euros and dollars back to the central bank and they gradually phase that out by now they imposed limits on what you could ex what you could transfer abroad in terms of you know foreign currency at first you could not export anything in terms of foreign currency then it was increased now the limit has been uh has been given up uh there was a limit on how much you could withdraw from the bank in March and April there was a tax if you wanted to buy currents in the domestic market so these are all measures of financial repression that the Central Bank did in response to you know Reserve sanctions uh sanctions on the reserves of the Central and in response to peoples wanted to hold dollars as a safe asset and that essentially allowed to curb the initial phase of the depreciation before the export revenues uh kicked in into the economy so then there is a question why do that well this obvious answer is to stabilize the bank run which the central bank was uh uh you know successful at doing but then beyond that once you stabilize the bank run is there role for financial repression what's very interesting it's not the optimal policy but if this is the only tool that you have left if you don't have reserves anymore and if it's the only tool then this is a very important tool of redistribution uh between savers who want to use currency to save and consumers who want to use currency to buy the available Imports and if the goal of the government is to kind of like redistribute towards poor hand-to-mouth consumers not the Savers right then Financial depression Can Be an Effective too and then the question is once you've done that and stabilized it can you relax Financial depression and create extra revenues for the for the government and the answer is actually yes again that if you like Financial repression it results in some depreciation of the currency and it alleviates pressure on the fiscal balance so in that sense you know the question is is is is exchange rate relevant terrible or not the answer is yes because you know by moving exchange rate inside the Russian economy it's completely irrelevant from the point of view of the foreign market because foreign investors cannot take advantage of that but inside the Russian economy it's a it's a way to redistribute between different uses it's a way to distribute between Savers and buyers and it's a way to relax the pressure on the fiscal constraint because the strong Ruble is really bad for the Ministry of Finance that needs to pay you know the the budget expenditures and rubles so they actually want a weaker rule there is a very nice experiment to check that the second isn't actually work but I'm gonna skip that and so going back to this picture this was the phase of depreciation driven by you know sanctions on uh reserves and being driven by the panic when people really wanted to take dollars and Euros as savings vehicle which was curved by Financial repression and then experts exceeded Imports and so that led to this Force for appreciation this is defeated when the central bank said well this is going way too far we need to relax Financial depression and they started relaxing Financial repression trying to curb the appreciation right and so this is kind of the storyline of what happened in the Russian economy I'm not going to conclude one last thing in the end I want to say this is a sign of sort of Russian resistance to the war every Russian knows that it says no to the war it's a little kind of it's a tone death to kind of talk about the fate of Russians given that you know the destruction in Ukraine and the loss of life and Welfare that kind of happens as we speak but at the same time for saying that the war is war you can go for 15 jail 15 15 years a jail in Russia and in fact it's being implemented also as we speak so like the few independent politicians who left in Russia can are going to jail now for saying that but like every Russian knows that this says no to war cancer let me let me stop here fantastic and fantastic to draw out all the connections between trade and international macro um our next two speakers are going to join us online so thanks a lot thanks a lot for for inviting uh me and anyone uh to participate to this panel uh this was uh uh and to this um and to this uh section it was uh learned a lot in the past few days so um yeah in a sense uh kind of like the first two uh papers in the panel where on sanctions that we would have liked to see but uh or many of us would like to see and and we're not actually implemented so like uh severe sanctions on on energy experts by Russia and in a way uh the people that Oleg just presented and and a paper I uh I'll be talking about is more instead about the sanctions that that did actually take place uh and on why the type of sanctions that did take place uh did some hurt uh had some kind of counter-intuitive effects on the ruble exchange rate uh and uh and and and and that's so that's what I want to talk about so I want to talk about the sanctions that were actually implemented uh and whether they reach their goals uh or not so kind of the the questions I want to talk about are kind of the basic questions are sanctions working uh at least in the sense of of achieving the economic effects that they want to achieve there's a bigger question of course if then they they achieve the the the the the political effects that that's a much harder question that I I don't have many expertise much expertise uh there is another question that also many are asking these days in the especially in the policy sphere which is how large will be the recession in Russia uh originally there was a larger session anticipated of the kind of order of 10 of GDP but now many experts see a smaller recession and there's a question like were the sanctions is the fact that sanctions were not strong enough why we're nothing we're not going to see a big enough recession in Russia um so that's that's the kind of questions that that are open out there uh I'm gonna just make three points and then raise a question that I find hard really and on which I I really don't have a strong view so I'm gonna make my three points and and then erase my question so the point number one uh which is closely related to to stuff that Oleg talked about and is based on the uh on the minimalist model in in my paper wediban uh is uh is this is that you can hurt a country by buying less stuff from the country and in staff here I include both good services and assets or you can hurt a country by selling the stuff to it uh and that's uh that's a general observation but the interesting fact is that what happens to the exchange rate really depends on which side you heard more not on the total pain you're causing so in a sense looking at the exchange rate as a measure of success of sanctions is probably not a particularly a good idea and I'm gonna make this point using a very simple graph of the currency Market so think of the currency Market as as the market where we trade foreign currency for for rubles and the exchange rate is on the y-axis and there is a demand for foreign currency and a supply so there is a a very basic form of sanction which would be for example a tariff on uh stuff that we buy from Russia uh and the effect of that would be to shift uh the the supply here to the left and so it would actually lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate to the the the exchanges would go up and as usual an international macro when the exchange rate go up is actually at depreciation because it means that the foreign currency cost more uh on the other hand uh our claim in the paper with Divine is that a lot of the restrictions that were put in place at the beginning after the invasion where restrictions that took more the form of restrictions on stuff that Russia could buy from the rest of the world those restrictions mean that now because Russians can buy less stuff from from from the West uh there's going to be less demand for shortcut foreign currency because there is less that you can buy with foreign currency and that will shift down the demand for foreign exchange and would actually lead to uh uh uh appreciation of the ruble which again uh because of the convention of how the exchange rate is defined means actually the exchange rate goes down so it means that it's cheaper to buy foreign currency that's that's the basic point there and to give you an I mean of course there were many different restrictions that were put in place but to give you an example for example if you think that you're a wealthy Russian and suddenly you cannot really enjoy your house in London so then the demand for houses in London by Russians will go down and so there will be fewer Russians that want to convert to the the ruble's wealth into uh pounds to buy a house in London uh and so the basic observation is that a lot of the uh restrictions some legal restrictions and some informal restrictions that have affected Russia because of the war our restrictions that actually can lower the desire of some uh Russian Nationals to convert their wealth into uh into uh into foreign wealth and and so reduces their demand for foreign currency that that was the basic observation of course not all of them right so they're still the demand for example if you are a foreign multinational who has a factory in in Russia and then you want to actually get rid of that factory because you realize it's not gonna you're not going to be able to operate there anymore so then you probably want to convert uh rubles so you're going to sell it for rubles and then convert it into uh foreign currency because you can still use your foreign currency your your multinational you can do what you want with your dollars uh so that demand is still there um and potentially the demand by uh Russians that are afraid of a collapse of the financial system would be also a demand for foreign currency that is there and that's why uh uh Russia imposed very severe Capital controls at the beginning because there were also very strong forces for depreciation so but but this is the the basic observation there is that there are a number of restrictions that were causing uh the the ruble to appreciate uh and that doesn't mean that those restrictions were not painful uh the Russian uh wealthy Russia was still unhappy that he couldn't enjoy a house in London but that effect on the ruble exchange rate of of the fact that he couldn't enjoy the house in London was actually to appreciate the ruble so that's my point number one now my point number two is a more uh specific point on instead on the on the more kind of the financial crisis side of the story so and here I'm going to make a very simple observation so if one objective of the sanctions for the way they were designed uh and in particular the the idea of freezing the assets of the of the Russian Central Bank and the number of uh kind of uh kind of breaking the the Russian Banks from from the international payment system my impression is that some of those sanctions were put in place with the hope of delivering a blow to the Russian Financial system and pushing Russia into a financial crisis and so if we take that as the initial objective of the sanctions we have to be honest and say those sanctions failed they didn't work if the objective was to cause a financial crisis we didn't cause a financial crisis in Russia why uh well for various reasons but the basic point is that if you ask this question can you cause a financial crisis in a country that is running a large current account Surplus here sorry here there is a typo here this is Surplus with sound public finances and a well-functioned in Central Bank you cannot really do it so it was probably misguided the hope that just by using very strong financial power you could force a financial crisis in Russia and this is perfectly consistent with standard theory of financial crisis in open uh in open emerging economies uh I mean we we know how financial crisis in emerging economies work uh the work when you have a large current account deficits when you the the public finances are not very sound and you need to print money or the Central Bank makes large mistakes and none of these conditions were there in Russia uh there is this term Fortress Russia which I think uh was coined by Illinois bakova at least I I credit her for that which is a brilliant uh representation of the strategy that Russia followed in since at least 2014 uh and and it's true that one of the elements of the strategy which was accumulation of foreign reserves failed because Russia did not expect uh the assets uh the foreign assets of the Central Bank of Russia to be frozen uh but still all the other legs of the policy worked very well um so that's I think that's one uh uh kind of uh that's one uh consideration that we must make at this stage in terms of uh whether sanctions worked or not definitely this approach uh had limited success um now there is a third point I want to make and this is actually um related to also something that a point that Oleg made at some point and I think it's it's an important point to remember which is that again the reason in the policy debate there is a lot of discussion of what's going to happen to Russian GDP and there is a concern oh we're not really going to be causing a large recession because a lot of the larger session was predicated a lot of the predictions of a larger sessions in the early weeks of the invasion were predicated on the fact that there would be a financial crisis in Russia uh now we see that the financial crisis will not happen probably uh it may be that some restrictions on energy Imports will take place and will hurt but probably not enough to cause a major economic crisis in Russia however I think a second thing that we have to remember is that what happens to GDP uh is not necessarily what happens to consumption and Welfare especially in our economy I mean we know in general that's that's that's true and I mean of course all the all the trade models tell us so but it's particularly true in our economy so I think we have to uh also realize that you can still cause a lot of hurt by imposing certain type of sanctions like against sanctions on stuff that we sell to Russia at least on the consumption side even if we're not causing a larger session so when we're trying to measure the success of sanctions it's important to keep that in mind that I mean you can still have rationing of of some essential goods and of a high quality imported goods that can still hurt the population even if GDP is not collapsing so these are the three points I wanted to make about sanctions so first point yeah the ruble is not a good measure of where the sanctions work or not if sanctions wanted to achieve a financial crisis well they failed on the other hand the type of sanctions that we're using so far can still cause pain especially if we focus on consumption now the question that I want to erase and is a question on which I I really scratched my head is uh very related to something that that was said early on during this panel about how do we deal now with the large energy crisis so suppose that still there is still some room for imposing some tariff on on energy Imports for from Russia there is still discussion to impose some form of price cap uh I mean I know the draggy government has been very vocal in trying to convince uh the West to impose some type of price cap uh as they are gonna work uh and how we're gonna deal with the scarcity of gas of natural gas and oil in the west and and here I the the question that as economists we should know the answer to but I'm afraid we don't know the answer to Is the following we are in a high Global inflation environment I mean inflation is is the headline and it's the big concern and especially in the EU inflation is really driven by energy like it's pretty much energy now I'm gonna for example if we're asking the question is it better to put a cap on uh on uh for example inputs of Russian gas or to put a tariff and you know from Theory we know that they're equivalent because we can put a price cap it means that we're only going to pry buy uh gas from Russia at this price and then the supply of gas is here so we're going to get less the difference is that with a tariff we have a very efficient way of allocating this cursor scarcer resource right because we're going to have the price mechanisms doing its work and as Rudy was saying you know Rudy was saying the price mechanism is always the best and that's our kind of instinctive reaction as economists is to say that the price mechanism is the best the concern and I think a big reason why Mr draghi loves a cop is that that means obviously very high energy prices uh and I'm not sure that actually politicians in Europe today prefer to tell people turn down your thermostat uh you cannot shower on Tuesday but the price of energy is still low and so so my my impression is that they prefer rationing because in a high inflation environment high prices are just psychologically bad even though we know that the price mechanism is usually the best so this to me is an open question whether we're gonna have to deal with scarce energy whether because we do it or because Mr Putin decides to do it the question is uh the natural response as economists would be less the prices do the job uh in a high inflation environment I honestly uh actually am don't know the answer
