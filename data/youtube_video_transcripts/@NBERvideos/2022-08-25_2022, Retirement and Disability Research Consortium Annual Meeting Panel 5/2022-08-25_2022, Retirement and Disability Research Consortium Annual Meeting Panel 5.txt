thank you everyone for joining us for panel five here um so the topic of this panel is factors driving trends in health and disability so we'll definitely be building on and continuing the great discussion in the previous panel we have three terrific papers the first which will be presented by stypica mudrasia of the urban institute examines how the evolving nature of work is affecting health and disability the second will be presented by gull wetstein of boston college and that one will explore how covid has affected the mortality of older adults very timely subject and the third will be presented by emilia simeonova of johns hopkins that will look at the effect of income on health using evidence from native american tribal casinos i just want to remind you like the other panels we'll have time for q a at the end of the presentations so you're strongly encouraged to put your questions um in the q a as the talks are going on or and or during the discussion period the presenters and their co-authors may answer some of those questions um in the q a and we may also weave some of them into our discussion um after the presentation so without further ado let me turn things over to stypica thank you courtney so let me just share my screen with you okay i hope everyone can see this so uh first of all uh thank you for the invitation to pre-to present this uh ongoing work um i want to recognize my co-author barbutrika and also here's the uh usual disclaimer uh as well as acknowledgement of funding from ssa but obviously everything that you hear today or that you're gonna see in the materials uh both the current and the final one uh are solely opinions of barb and me so we started this project with the idea that uh there there have been many many changes in recent decades um to uh the nature of work and uh that has impacted uh uh potentially how uh we perform job tasks so uh with that idea then uh we wanted to examine how the relationships of job demands uh with work related disability prevalence and disability applications changed over time and what the impact may be on the relationship between health and and and those outcomes of interest what we know about this well uh we know from prior studies uh that there is a strong uh relationship between uh health and disability and job demands uh as well as uh that there is a strong relationship between receiving disability benefits and job demands the more recent evidence however shows that health limitations may be preventing fewer workers uh from uh performing essential job tasks uh than was the case uh in in the past uh which uh tentatively suggests those those uh that the job demands are are indeed changing over time uh in this um research uh we use data from the health and retirement study and supplemented with uh date on job demands from the occupational requirements survey and as well as uh own it we focus on adults age 55 to 61 so those who are under the early retirement age and our key measures of job demands are indices of job requirements based on the questions in ors and own it now it would probably take up all of the time for the presentation to explain um how we uh developed these uh indices but in a nutshell uh for example when we look at ors there are several i would call them domains such as for example cognitive and mental requirements or environmental requirements of jobs such as you know exposure to heat exposure to cold uh exposure to wetness and then those questions provide answers of how many jobs within an occupation uh have that as a requirement and so we use several thresholds to uh dichotomize those variables so the default for us and that's what i'm going to be presenting today is a 25 of jobs within within an occupation but we test also for sensitivity uh one third of the jobs as well as half of the jobs uh having having that requirement and then uh uh we sum up uh the those dichotomized measures and so if within a domain we have about uh let's say 10 questions uh that would give us an index that goes from zero to ten uh all net questions are somewhat different but the the basic logic of what we are trying to achieve is is similar uh so uh our approach is to uh provide descriptive overview of trends in occupational requirements and then uh to test two methodologies uh first by various probit analysis of the link between work limitation and the applications with job requirements and then uh structural equation uh model as well we are still the work with uh by various probit is still ongoing and and uh the scm work is is uh forthcoming uh so uh here are some just basic descriptive results uh over time uh we see across different domains and let me just say job flexibility essentially is a subset of questions from the cognitive demands um so uh we came up with this uh measure that that looks at uh issues of um whether people can telework or uh whether whether they can uh they have the ability to stop to stop their work uh and so we see that the on average uh job flexibility has increased over time as well as educational requirements of jobs uh and uh environmental and physical requirements have uh gotten somewhat somewhat lighter but all of that happened uh until about 2010 at least using the hrs data and since then uh we are seeing that uh those those changes have either either stalled or that there was some small reversion [Music] looking at those who applied or received disability benefits relative to others we see that they come from jobs that offer less flexibility and have higher [Music] job demands with respect to the physical requirements as well as to environmental conditions environmental hazards that the workers are exposed to interestingly when we look at after the period after the great recession uh with the period before um that the the idi applicants uh and recipients seem to be increasingly a select group of people who uh since their job require their job requirements are uh increasingly uh physical and environmental uh and uh their their jobs they come from jobs that offer less flexibility unlike other workers where the trends are different owned results uh really mirror what i just uh told you so we have fewer workers over time who come from jobs with high physical requirements or difficult work conditions uh but more of them from jobs with high cognitive requirements and stress over conditions again these changes happen through 2010 and then afterwards uh there's some uh reversion or uh across most domains uh the the there's no further change um the pre and post great recession trends for the applicants relative to other workers again show that the applicants seem to be increasingly select group group of workers related relative to the types of jobs that they are they're working in uh here are some just preliminary and partial uh inferential results um [Music] we see that there is a statistically significantly uh negative association between job flexibility and work limitations and bi applications and positive association between physical requirements and work limitations in the applications the magnitude of those relationships however is much stronger in the post great recession period than earlier which is actually consistent uh with what i just showed you descriptively that the i applicants seem to be an increasingly select group of people uh the results from uh based on own it just confirm uh what i what i've described using the the ors data and so uh what are some very preliminary conclusions well as i said relative to non-applicants the i applicants are increasingly select with respect to the occupational requirement profiles of their jobs um tentatively this suggests that changes in the occupational mix of the u.s economy may partially account for fewer than expected via applicants since fewer workers work in in jobs that are highly physically demanding and increasing number of workers are working in jobs that offer higher degree of flexibility such as you know developer self-paced work and and have higher cognitive demands on the flip side a limitation of what i just presented right now is that these preliminary results uh rely only on interoccupational differences in other words they they assume that the current job requirements are are static with occupations over time so we are using the the job requirements uh the most recent ones and just looking at the change in the composition of jobs in the economy as opposed to changes in job demands within occupations and therefore our next steps will be to first refine prohibit analysis we'll be examining and we are in the process of examining various interactions uh such as between health and in other personal characteristics and job requirements uh and uh importantly uh and this is something that we definitely need all net data for is to use that historic information so that we would be also able to examine uh the impact of changes in job requirements within occupations not only across occupations and there is evidence in the literature that those um those uh changes uh are at least as if not uh substantially more important than the changes that come just from the differences in the composition of occupations so uh with that i'm gonna conclude my presentation and i'll welcome any feedback or questions that you may have thank you thank you so much um we'll save all our discussion for the end so we'll just move straight on to gull's presentation thank you courtney share my screen all right so thank you um again to courtney and to the nbr for organizing such a wonderful conference and thank you to ssa for funding so many fascinating uh projects and for funding this one so this is joint work with um my colleagues at the center for retirement research at boston college nilla for coke angie chen and alicia manel and i'm going to be talking about how the selection in covid19 mortality is likely to affect the mortality of older adults in the next few years standard disclaimer just to provide some motivating uh facts um kobe has caused over a million deaths in the united states um about half of that happened in the first year of the pandemic which is what we're going to focus on and these deaths have been focused on populations that generally have high mortality rates uh to begin with so um in particular we know that covid was particularly dangerous for older individuals and here you can see on this slide that for example 65 to 74 year olds were two and a half times more likely to die of covid than 50 to 64 year olds and it got progressively worse at older and older ages but in addition to age we know minorities were at particular risk of covid it was both perhaps a matter of exposure to covid and a matter of the deadliness of the disease conditional on exposure so hazard for um hispanics blacks and native americans was substantially higher than for whites um but of course at the same time we know from a lot of work including the interesting um presentation yesterday by michael stepner and the keynote address today that mortality for blacks in particular has been much higher than for whites historically and in particular during the pandemic and then finally um covet deaths were also particularly uh focused on populations that had uh specific chronic health conditions um in particular the ones listed here relative to healthy individuals and so given that um all of this death took place in populations that had high mortality rates irrespective of coped our question is whether the people who lived through the first year of the pandemic are likely to have lower mortality rates because of this selection effect and so our analysis here estimates how existing ssa life tables might have to be adjusted to account for this effect that would be useful for ssh to know in terms of predicting mortality patterns ssa is all about predicting mortality at least the actuaries job and the the question um that we have is kind of what we should expect um going forward and what we mean by going forward is kind of a bit loose in order to do this we we kind of assume that kovit is over which is obviously not true um but i would also like to stress at this point that what we're talking about is definitely a second order effect so the selection uh effect of covid is much much smaller than the main effect the direct effect of cobra which clearly uh dramatically and devastatingly increased mortality rates over the last two years so this is all just on the margins relative to that much much higher baseline of mortality so the way we proceed in this analysis is we start by categorizing sorry characterizing the 2019 population of 60 plus year olds in terms of their demographics and health status we then turn to the medical literature to find pre-covet and covet mortality hazards for each such group we don't estimate these things on our own we we take it from the literature we then construct a new 2021 population where we've um subtracted out all the people that we know have died from covet end of other causes by demographic and health status and we estimate new life tables for this new projected population as of mid-2021 and as i mentioned to do this we have to assume something about what's going to happen with covet going forward so what we assume which we know is wrong is that there's no direct impact of covenant mortality going forward so that's two things it's one that people are not going to die of covet directly and two that people who have had covid are not going to have going to have any longer uh term effects from covet in terms of mortality so for example that long covid doesn't affect mortality as i said we know that both those things are wrong but we don't know exactly how in what way and so our assumption is both easier in the sense that we don't have to make presumptions about what's going to happen in the future too much and also it's the most conservative assumption in terms of social security's finances so what dimensions of the population do we need to consider well we know demographics and health play major roles and so those are our focus focuses in terms of demographics we know that gender race hispanic ethnicity um and age were very important in hazard from covet and so that's how we define the population in terms of demographics in terms of health status we just went with what the cdc says or what they said at the time that we started this study so they listed six um or rather seven conditions generally speaking that they knew at the time were associated with higher covet risk that's cancer cerebrovascular disease etc what you see on this slide they also listed kidney disease but we can't observe that in the hrs which is the data we use to classify people into health status so that's kind of a missing piece a little bit also at the time that we started the study they hadn't classified these as high risk yet but since then um mental health and dementia have also been associated convincingly with higher mortality rates from covet and that is observed in the hrs so we are considering expanding the study to include those conditions in the future but for now we'll stick with these six conditions so to categorize the pre-covet population we use the 2019 american community survey to classify different demographic groups in terms of their size before the pandemic and then we use the hrs to partition each of those groups into the six health statuses plus a healthy group in quotation marks that doesn't have any of these six conditions obviously they could have lots of other conditions as long as those conditions aren't associated with increased covert mortality they shouldn't affect the estimation of the selection effect of covet on the live tables that we asked so just to give you a sense of what we're working with these are essentially the first results um but in a slightly schematic way so i'm showing you the breakdown of the population in 2019 by our estimates into by gender age and the health conditions within each gender age um as i mentioned in the analysis we do a slightly finer partition into also race and ethnicity but here you can see that as you might expect the prevalence of the healthy group declines with age for both men and women whereas the prevalence of various health uh problems increases like heart disease you can see dramatically increases between 60s and 90s that's a sanity check that all looks the way you'd expect so then we take these people that we have in 2019 and we want to ask who's survived to mid-2021 so we use the national vital statistics system which records all u.s deaths by cause of death based on death certificates and it has limitations as we heard in the keynote address but we're going to take it at face value for now we know the demographics of each decedent and we know their cause of death but we don't know their chronic health conditions so we might know that a specific decedent is a black man in his 60s and he might have died of a heart attack but we don't know if he was diagnosed with heart disease or if he was diagnosed with diabetes or anything else what we do is we take for causes of death that are clearly associated with any of these six conditions we assume that the death came from the group that has that condition so for example that man that black man in his 60s who died of a heart attack will assume that he came from the group of black men in their 60s who had heart disease if we have enough people in the group um for example if we have uh black men ages 60 to 69 we know there were just for example say 50 cancer related deaths and there are 75 people in this group who have cancer we assume all the cancer deaths came from that group of cancer if there were more deaths than we have in that group we assign them to the rest of the population within that group the demographic group by size and that's also what we do with all causes of death that aren't directly linked like accidents so that accounts for all causes of death except for covid when we do covid we know how many covet deaths happened in each demographic group we don't know of course again how many occurred within each health status group within the demographic so what we do is we use the epidemiological literature on hazard rates to assign coba deaths based on their relative hazards to each of the different health status groups within each demographic group that's um going to essentially assume that um we allow for uh different exposure rates by demographics so that is flexible enough to account for the fact that uh hispanics were more exposed to covid than whites for example um but it does assume that all the health conditions within the group were equally exposed and of course crucially it does allow for the different hazard rates conditional and exposure since at the time we did the analysis we only had reliable death certificates for 2020. we extrapolated 2020 deaths to the first quarter of 2021. and so finally the main result is um the relative changes in mortality rates by each 10-year age group by gender and you can see that there is some effect so based on this selection you would expect about one percentage point decline in mortality for people in their 90s about a half a percentage point declined for people in their 80s and so on declining as people get younger that's because there was less covet death in the younger group so there's less scope for selection so is this big or small well it's not big certainly um but how big could it possibly have been was kind of what we asked ourselves and so what we did to answer that question is we looked at what would have happened had all the covet deaths that occurred um been as selective as possible so what would have happened if those 500 000 deaths in the first year had come first of all from the highest mortality groups um the high mortality group then when that was exhausted from the next highest mortality group etcetera and so we get the maximal possible selection and what we see is that covert was extremely selective and the red bars you see would actually is our estimate and in the gray bar is what we estimate would have been the maximum potential change and remember that a zero change would have happened if cover deaths had been random so we would have had the same life table as we'd had before so what we see is that um for any age group covid was at least half as selective as it could possibly have been and for the younger age groups it was in particular very selective so for people in their 60s only the most vulnerable people in their 60s died from coped for people in their 90s it was slightly more broad-based and so that's the conclusion uh there by page so let me wrap up kovid has led to over a million deaths they were concentrated in populations with otherwise high mortality rates so as a result survivors are slight likely to have slightly lower mortality rates going forward that of course assumes heroically that covet itself will not be a large driver of mortality going forward um that's obviously not true but it is a conservative assumption and particularly among those over 80 where the toll of code was heaviest we see relatively large although still fairly small deviations from pre-pandemic mortality expectations and that's it let me hand it back to courtney thank you so much for that very interesting presentation uh so we have a little bit of time for uh for some discussion here and again just wanted to encourage people to continue putting any questions or comments they have on any of the presentations into the into the q a so let me start let me give amelia a chance to catch your breath and go back to stipika and ask you a question about um your presentation so i was curious about some of these changes you saw over time in um one in particular that the um post-great recession period as opposed to previous um that workers are more like workers who end up applying for ssdi are more likely to be in physically demanding jobs in this more recent period but that runs a little bit against the overall trend right of jobs becoming less physically demanding so i was just curious if you had any thoughts about that finding in particular or just any comments in general about some of the changes you're seeing over time so that's a that's a good question and it's something that we are just trying to figure out why that might be happening i mean one thing that we are seeing uh as i said is that people seem to be increasingly select uh on on on what types of jobs they held before they applied or before before before they started receiving so but uh so so so one possibility is that maybe people have uh job opportunities that allow them to stay attached to the labor market and only people who are who are really uh in in uh who are sort of quote-unquote stuck in in in in jobs that are uh uh highly physically or environmentally uh challenging are the ones that are that are applying for disability benefits so they they simply may have more uh uh attractive uh uh alternatives to applying for disability benefits uh and that may be consistent with the fact that there are more jobs uh uh that there seems to be increasing number of jobs where where uh uh people can can uh perform in those jobs uh as as opposed to uh um you know uh have certain certain physical abilities right so so people may have more alternatives economy was getting better uh they may have more options and that may that maybe that may be behind it so basically only the people who really really really uh need to apply for disability benefits don't have any alternatives they may be the ones that are applying and that's that's why we may be seeing more selective group of people um that that that is increasingly unique from the rest of of of uh workers so but again it just uh it's just one possible explanation one one that we really need to uh begin to to save it then certainly yeah i'll just add on to that not to prolong the conversation unnecessarily but just to say i think it's interesting to think about how much of it is uh sort of specifically a business cycle effect of people sort of getting dislodged from their current job you know because of the recession versus these sort of longer time trends that you might be able to pick up so just anything that you're ultimately able to say about which of those um it might be i feel like would be interesting um yeah let me just yeah go ahead oh so one thing that i just wanted to say i mean since we are the the work is really ongoing and so we'll have many more results within in the next month or two uh as the project trips up uh what i can say is that uh even with very preliminary uh runs of of uh you know some some of these interactions and i i didn't have time to sort through the results but but i see that that there are some you know statistically significant associations uh um uh with with you know uh interactions of health and job job demands uh which is one of the one of the key things that we wanted to explore uh in in this project and some of these are getting attenuated some of these are getting amplified but as i said this is uh just uh ongoing work and i and i need to sit through the through the results to really say something more specific yeah i'm tempted to ask you follow but i want to get around everybody so let me let me ask a question to all so um you were very clear in your presentation about um the that the focus of your paper is on this selection effect and there are other effect direct effects of of kovid um that you were sort of putting off to the side you know one of them being just continued covet mortality effects and then the other one being um potential effects of long covet on mortality um so i'm asking you i guess to go into the land of speculation here because it wasn't the sort of direct focus of the analysis that you've done so far but how might you expect these kind of ongoing more direct effects of covid to affect your results your selection results yeah that's a good question an obvious question um because covent still seems to be around um i think i think the magnitudes that we find are sufficiently small that they would really be swamped by even the current levels of cobit mortality which are low in in the context of the whole pandemic but are still fairly high in kind of an absolute sense so i think that that would be what i would expect going forward and i'm not sure this is this would be really speculation but i i think it would really depend on how effective probably vaccines uh would be in the future in preventing uh death if kind of more tailored vaccines are are better or things like that i'll just ask a follow-up here i mean can can you help us a little bit think about so you presented your results in terms of the first and percentage point effect on mortality rates is it possible to give us a sense of kind of like the number of deaths we're talking about or even put those percentage points um for those of us who don't uh keep the life tables right at the top of our heads um you know relative to to mortality rates to kind of get a sense of of how large these effects are yeah um so i think um there's there's a full uh working paper version of this that will be on our website shortly i think once once ssa has approved it once we've sent it into ssa to approve but i think let me quickly pull up some numbers the overall mortality rates for 90 to 99 year olds um were very high um because we're looking at 10 especially since we're looking at 10-year uh mortality rates and so uh this is the probability of surviving for a full 10 years um in in your 90s which is kind of a big lift um i am [Music] just getting the table up here uh yeah so the base rate of mortality for for that oldest group that had the one slightly plus percentage point decline in mortality is 94 mortality for men and 90 mortality for women so this is a fairly marginal change uh relative to the baseline mortality rate great thank you i still think it's really interesting this uh you know we sort of know um from all the newspaper coverage that we've read that covered mortality is not random but um i love the attempt to really um look at that in a in a more than anecdotal kind of way um amelia let me ask you a few questions i i there's i have a lot of um you know questions about your specific paper but i actually want to start with something that's more general um because one of the things that's so exciting about um your work with randy is just that you're studying the native american population which has been relatively um understudied in research um you you touched on this i think a little bit talking about you know deaths being mismeasured potentially you know more likely to be mismeasured in this population for example but you know could you just even take a step back and elaborate on some of the special challenges in studying the native american population and then maybe any thoughts you might have about investments in data enforce infrastructure or other kinds of actions that could could you know help to support more research of this important population yeah thank you courtney that's a that's a great question and it actually relates to the keynote that we we heard um so yes this is uh it's particularly challenging because of the misclassification of race and how we measure rates in different kinds of settings is it self-reported and whether people are allowed to select more than one racial group and uh for example the u.s census only allowed people to select multiple racial groups only in the year 2000 and so if you go from um if you if you actually look at how many native american potentially native american people you get when you go from just one to four the size about triples um in in how many people you will get if you look at the population and uh and and so it's it's a small population relative to the us and in particular uh on tribal on tribal areas and as a lot of the of the issues that marcela brought up apply very much to this population um and and and partly partly because we we we study them because we we know very little and there's very little data this has been getting better in the past past years more data sets have been we've been able to merge more data and work with large administrative data but absolutely not sufficient to say anything anything very conclusive we can study now how badly the data varies across different different sources but the other thing is she she mentioned this as well when you study a certain population work with a certain population it's important to get that population involved as well so um you know um community mentioned community councils and and groups and we we we have tribal advisory groups with some of our research and that that has that helps a lot um and i think over sampling would be great for some of the some of the surveys that we have um you know psid um hrs would be fantastic to have more people um that requires extra funding so i hope that some of what we're doing will help um create awareness and um uh about this pro about this subject and and and help us get better data thank you so much for that suggestion we've got a lot of people on the call and including people who i think are uh you know maybe in the position to advocate for what you were just uh speaking about so that's really helpful to have some some concrete ideas let me just follow up with a specific question about your study because i'm also very interested in the specifics of what you all did um in terms of um i'm just curious if you have any thoughts actually about the mechanisms um for finding these beneficial effects of income in terms of reducing mortality um and and also whether you know in future work there might be some possibility of even studying those mechanisms either with the data that you have which has health information or perhaps some other data um you know do we think it has to do with with nutrition with access to health care like what are some of the other you know possible mechanisms for the kind of effect that you see i think it's mostly and the paper has earned income and unearned income so so i guess if you have any thought that you know is any of it work work work work related um and anyways any thoughts about the mechanisms so we're we're working with the again we're working with people who are on medicare so they're 65 and over or they are so they they are disabled they have been on social security disability insurance for two years or more or they have esrd or lou gehrig's disease so this is it's not your average 40 year old healthy working individual um though we will look at that group um once we get um we're working with census data and looking at that group as well so we will complement this with with that work um the what what what's very likely happening and i'm i'm i'm just stipulating here because we haven't run the analysis but again i think what's happening is that when you're looking especially people who are younger than 65 and on medicare income might matter much more for them because they are already disabled they are challenged in many ways they're families as well if you have end-stage renal disease you have to go to a dialysis cleaning pretty much every second day you need to get there you need transportation you need people to spend time taking you there taking you back so having unearned income um some just somebody just gives your family money or household money would help a lot with with relaxing some of these constraints also um yeah you may be able to afford different type of of health care and different quality health care those are the things that we we can see um how often people see the doctor what kinds of things they see the doctor for how often they get hospitalized and this is what we're going to be looking at next so we can see this in our medicare data and we also have medicaid data in which we haven't even started looking at these things but i think that will be very tremendously helpful in unearthing the mechanisms for what's going on that's great it's exciting to hear this might just be part one of of many definitely um i think we can squeeze in maybe just one or two more questions before we turn it over to the next panel so let me um let me come back to stypica um i was actually really intrigued by the comment you made that the work that you've done so far shows us changing um the effect of changing changing occupational composition and the piece that you haven't had a chance to look at yet is changing requirements within occupations over time but that that's something that you'll be adding and you mentioned that the literature shows that actually there's quite a lot of shifts over time within occupation so i just wonder if you might want to elaborate on that even though it's in the world of the you know yet to do on the to-do list so we're in the speculation category um about that piece of it and how that might um impact the sort of takeaways of your studies if what you find is also kind of in line with with what what you mentioned the literature has tended to find in the past yeah so what the literature that so most of the literature that that we reviewed actually uh had this approach of you know uh assuming that uh that the job demands don't change too dramatically over over time um and and and then you know you get you get what you essentially get by assuming that the job demands are fixed what what you actually pick up is just the change of of uh what what jobs people do so the composition of jobs but uh there's been some work that that looked at uh change changes within um within occupations and job demands and that work uh work actually uh showed that that the changes in uh within occupations are actually more important than changes uh in in in in in the uh composition of jobs uh simply that because of the technological advancements jobs have uh generally become less uh you know physically demanding and so that then opens up the possibility for or people who have some some let's say relatively minor disabilities to uh uh continue performing uh critical job tasks in a larger uh uh a larger range of jobs and so uh how however uh i i believe that that work also showed that there's a there's an educational gradient there uh and that this mostly uh is true for those who have a higher level of education and those who have lower level of education still are are you know in in in in situations where where they don't have as many jobs available to them so so that it's it's another important distinction and something that we'll have to take into account is you know this this potential bifurcation by by education um so so there are many layers to the story but look looking at it just overall uh there seems to be a trend toward uh you know uh somewhat lower uh uh physical requirement uh the requirements of jobs which then opens up possibility for for people to work in more more uh occupations as opposed to uh having to uh apply library disability great well i think on all these papers we're really going to look forward to seeing the final version so we can you know hear hear more about um all these exciting next steps i don't want to eat into the time of the next panel so i'm going to go ahead and um just with my thanks again for the three excellent presentations i'm going to pass it back to nicole so she can introduce our next moderator
