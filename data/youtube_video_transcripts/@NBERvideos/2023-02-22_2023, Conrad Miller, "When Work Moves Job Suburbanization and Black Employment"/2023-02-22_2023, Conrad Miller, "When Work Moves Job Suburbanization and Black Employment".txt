okay so the broad motivation for this project is that there are large and persistent racial disparities uh in employment rates in the U.S so for example since about the 1960s black unemployment rates have roughly doubled the overall unemployment rate we actually don't know much about what's causing this uh while there's been a lot of work studying racial disparities in wages there's actually been much less work looking at disparities in employment outcomes or employment rates and what this paper is looking at is one old idea for one potential cause of these disparities in employment rates and that's what's called the the spatial mismatch hypothesis which originates back in the the late 1960s there's a few versions of the spatial mismatch hypothesis but the basic idea is that you have black workers concentrated in segregated black neighborhoods typically in the central cities of metropolitan areas and you have job opportunities particularly after World War II becoming increasingly uh concentrated in Suburban areas so moving from the Central City to the suburbs and uh the idea of spatial mismatch here is you have mismatch between where black workers are living and where their potential job opportunities uh exist and so what this paper is doing is is it's it's it's looking testing this hypothesis and in particular what I do is I ask if we look at jobs of urbanization from 1970 to 2000 so in particular changes in the geographic distribution of where jobs are located moving from the Central City to the suburbs did that cause declines uh in Black employment rates and black earnings uh and so to get at that I use combine two sources of data so I use data from the decennial Census from 1970 to 2000 I also use establishment level data from the equal employment opportunity commission from about the same period and what I do is a a few things but the basic idea is look at variation across metropolitan areas in the rates of job suburbanization over this period so in some cities there's a lot more movement of work from Central cities to the suburbs than others the question is is that variation across cities associated with variation in in relative declines in Black employment rates and black earnings and in general what I find is is indeed there is a connection there so for every 10 percent decline in the share of jobs located in the Central City black employment rates decline um relative to White employment rates by about two percent uh now uh and broadly that could if you take those estimates seriously uh the jobs of urbanization that we see over this period could explain over half of relative declines in Black employment rates for black men in particular which declined by about 10 percent relative to employment rates for white men from 1970 to 2000. one key concern with interpreting that correlation between job supervisation and changes in Black employment rates is that there might be other changes happening uh in these metropolitan areas so there might be some structural changes in cities that see more movement of work from the Central City to the suburbs that even in the absence of changes in you know geography would have led to changes in Black relative employment rates say changes in what kinds of sectors are represented uh in those metropolitan areas or say some Shock to labor Supply that predicts where firms relocate and so I do a couple of things to try and address that potential concern the main thing is I use variation in interstate highway infrastructure as a sort of instrument for changes in supervanization across metropolitan areas so this is building on work by Nate bomb snow in his 2007 qga qga paper looking at the relationship between interstate highways and suburbanization what I do is essentially use that same research design that should show that when you have uh metropolitan areas that are more exposed to the United interstate highway system that leads to increased rates of jobs and urbanization and that also leads to increases in the gaps between black and white workers in terms of employment rates roughly consistent with what you find just in the kind of Baseline OLS estimates another exercise that I do that I think supports the causal interpretation of job supervisation on black relative employment rates is I use the EEOC establishment level data and show that when we look at establishments that relocate from Central cities to suburbs within metropolitan areas over this period uh what you see is immediately coinciding with those movements with those relocations steep declines in the black share of employees in those firms so the idea is take the same firm that's relocating from downtown to some suburban area what you see is with those relocations the black share of employees at those same firms drop sharply after those relocations and the magnitude of those changes is roughly um roughly consistent with what you see with the kind of Metropolitan level uh variation into job supervision job suburbanization and so overall what you find is it looks like over this period from 1970 to 2000 job supervisation uh led to large declines in Black relative employment rates over this period
