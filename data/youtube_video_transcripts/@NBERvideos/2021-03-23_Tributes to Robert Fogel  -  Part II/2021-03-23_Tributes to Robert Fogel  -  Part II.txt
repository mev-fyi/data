so i met bob first i think in 1967 at the economic history meetings had some chats with him and stan and bob was the kind of guy that i think tom referred to it too if you got to know him in a situation like that you were his friend in my case for 46 years i think he was that kind of person i always thought he was a very serious scholar i mean it was always kind of business there was there's serious work to be done but he could also be quite humorous but i thought he was um often humorous in a sort of yogi bear away he said that he said things that were funny that you know but he didn't really need them to sound funny but at least to me they were funny and i want to share not one but three stories as quickly as i can the first story has to do with something that claudia i think you will think that bob was more like you than you hinted because when bob was doing research on time on the cross he got in touch with me this was four years after we became good friends and said i'm coming to north carolina to do work in the archives i'm going to stay a whole week or so could i stay with you you can save money on the hotel room and so he stayed at our house and what i remember is that um edith and i eat us here today and had a like a three or four year old daughter then and vogel stayed in the room right next to our daughter annie and after he left after a week she always referred to that room as uncle fogel's room and i thought that was interesting uh and then of course she grew up and got married and had a family and now she has a son for my oldest grandson 14 years old who happens to go to stuyvesant high school in new york and so now i'm i i think bob might be pleased if he were still here i didn't tell him this before he passed but that he has a grand nephew at his old school styles but on that trip vogel what was he doing he was going to the north carolina archives and reading plantation records and probate records to find out about the inputs that went into producing outputs and southern plantations and we talked about that a little and then one one day bob said toward the end of this trip you know it's a bit ironic that i'm here looking at these farm records because he says you know dick i was eight he's a new yorker you know i was i was 18 years old before i realized that the normal condition of the surface of the earth was not to be covered with asphalt we were on sabbatical and bob was on sabbatical in the mid-1970s and he was sort of a big celebrity uh so there were debates somebody referred to him as being a debater and one we attended in oxford you know there were 200 people there and some uh one of these british know-it-alls jumps up and asks him a question in the q a afterwards and it was you know very sort of a pompous you know you all remember those questions where you start to go to sleep you get annoyed because the question goes on and on very convoluted and the guy was clearly out to embarrass folks and what i remember i don't remember his answer exactly but i remember the first thing he said after listening to this long question that was a bit hostile because the guy was kind of saying you know actually this crazy focal would think slavery was okay and listen to this for a while then he just looked at vote he said i bet you think i don't know the answer to that question [Laughter] and okay so then he went on to give some answer but the third story is that the i wish dad were here because i was going to tease him and say there was a conference some years back to do up in rochester to celebrate something like stan i was going to say stan's 100th birthday but bob gave a talk there and i always remember it because this was at a time and we still talk this way you know health care expenses are out of control rising the costs of health care bob comes up and says i don't understand why people are so upset about rising health care that you know our health care is really good and there's all kinds of great things you need your hip replaced you get your knee replaced there's viagra and you know we really have very good health care and so he was saying you know we should be happy i mean people are paying this because they think it's worth it you know i think he was being a serious scholar but it struck me as being kind of humorous too the way he said that healthcare is really good so i have these fond memories of bob's sort of yogi berra sense of humor things so i'm no kid but i've probably known bob that i'm sure for less than anyone on the list of names that claudia put up at the beginning besides hoyt but i met him when i was 22 years old and an undergraduate at williams college and lee had bob come out to give a talk and i was tremendously impressed not just by the fact that lee was able to get this really famous guy to come all the way up to williamstown massachusetts but by the fact that after the talk bob was interested not so much in talking to the other faculty who were there all of whom were eager to bend his ear and talk about their own research but in talking to the undergraduate students and asking us what we were working on because a couple of us were writing senior thesis and economics so that made it really easy for me to decide to go to the university of chicago when it came time to go to graduate school two years later so the first thing i was struck by was the fact that he was interested in what other people were doing and not just in telling us what he was doing and that's what i saw continually throughout the time that i knew him at the university of chicago he would come every friday to the quad club for drinks before the group went out to dinner he suddenly went to the dinners but he was almost always there for drinks at the quad club and that inevitably be some discussion of some current issue and it was never the case that whichever graduate student who were all completely anonymous for their first two or three years at the university of chicago would actually advance no opinion was too outrageous or student too lowly to advance an interesting opinion in bob's bob's mind and he would engage the student and talk about that issue and debate it in just the way that you've seen and debate things academically then later on when the workshop was not nearly as active and bob had his own workshop over at the graduate school he'd have famous people come through and give talks and if it was a particularly prominent person bob would also schedule a dinner party at his house and those dinner parties for a young faculty member like me were just fascinating not just because you got to see all these famous people that bob would invite through but because again if you were the one who was lucky enough to be sitting on either side of bob you got to have him ask you questions throughout the entire evening he'd ask you what you were working on how your work was going what things you wanted to do he'd ask your opinion about current issues in politics or in the economy and again there was no opinion that he wasn't willing to debate and no issue that was too small for him to be engaged in the actual discussion of and i've been at the university of chicago when there were plenty of people who won nobel prizes in economics during the period that i was there from 85 up through 91 and in that experience of having plenty of non-classroom time with nobel prize winners there was never a one apart from bob who was ever as interested in engaging people at their own level on their own terms and speaking about what they were interested in rather than telling them what they should be interested in based on what they themselves were doing so the lesson i took away from my experience with bob is to always be more interested in what other people are doing than telling them what you're doing and especially so with graduate students and that that kind of non-classroom social time with faculty members is an invaluable time not just for graduate students but even for junior faculty and to sort of commemorate the benefit that i derive from going to those dinner parties with bob i personally plan to actually kind of institute a tradition of a similar sort at northwestern and have those kinds of gatherings for faculty and students because at least at northwestern it's something that happens far too infrequently and as a result i think a lot of people would would benefit from it and i could only hope to do half as much as as bob did in the course of those gatherings to instill the same sense of interest and engagement and affirmation in the students that we actually have at northwestern thanks [Applause] well i am very grateful that claudia gave me the opportunity to come and talk to you people have alluded to the genealogy of intellectual life so in that genealogy simon kuznets is my grandfather and richard eastern is my father now since they were both students of kuznets bob vogel is my uncle and that makes all you fogle students my cousins and it's been wonderful to have such stimulating cousins and then all the adopted children who come to the dae which of which bob was a founder of the feast back when we were in these dorm rooms in the hottest week of the summer where the air conditioner has never worked but we've graduated to these wonderful surroundings okay so i was already aware of bob even as an undergraduate because we've heard about his railroad book and so i i'm just starting graduate school at the university of pennsylvania it's early september 1967 and i've already heard mentioned that by dick um and there was a session on slavery and it was very heated i mean you know douglas dowd was ragging on elf conrad and you know bob is there and he's you know i said wow this is really a cool discipline i'm glad i i i want to do this and i have not been uh disappointed and he's done all this wonderful work for us you know transport slavery demography health now i would ask a question of you all i think bob gave the longest presidential address in the history of the economic history association in toronto in 1978 okay i see some nadia so there's a there's a record you read the entire paper on social saving it was great but you know i'm not sure people were quite expecting that he does all this this wonderful stuff more recently moved on to you know demography which was my area does genealogies gets all this great mortality data uh the health data the incredible job that was done with those civil war records just what a logistical nightmare to get that done well he got it done he was relentless his personality just would not let it go he's decided he's going to do it and he did it and then found the center for population economics which i think is you know it's a wonderful institution and i hope it prospers uh hereafter so uh you know i i've encountered him on on many occasions i'm very grateful uh to him for his contributions to to demography in general to health economics and so on and so forth so finally and i hope you'll forgive me um one of the most salient memories i have are the the dinners we had or you know buffets we had over at his house when i was invited over when i got to meet enid and i just i remember her so vividly and so the very last time i met with bob he was here was it last year in the spring he came and i was sitting opposite him at the table and since you know i lost my wife six years ago i felt i could you know mention this and i just mentioned enid to him and i said you know enid was such a wonderfully warm person you always felt comfortable with her and bob with his fabulous humanity said you have described her perfectly thank you um this fall it'll be 20 years that bob fogle and doug north won the nobel prize together and i may certainly be the rare person if not the unique person who was a student of doug's and then got to be with bob in january 1981 i was on the job market and i had an interview with the business school of chicago with mike moussa and roger cormendy and we were having a great conversation and about 20 minutes into the interview they said this is great we'd love to have you come and give a talk in chicago but folks coming back from harvard in the fall and we can't hire an economic historian and i was like okay so they said but you should go talk to george stigler the center for the study economy in the state like rick's story and so 45 minutes later i was in talking to george stigler and a week later i was at the business school and george offered me a job it was kind of a fun it was a short time to use they offered me the job before i left and there was one condition and the condition was that i not work with bob local and i was like okay you know i was one that had to go back and decide um but uh the fact that pogo was that that george was concerned that i would work with bob i think reflected some of bob's influence and presence in chicago and influence on the field and when i got to chicago that fall i went to three seminars i went to the becker rosen applied micro seminar i think on mondays and the i o seminar on thursday with george and on the economic history seminar on friday and those that met every every week i read three papers and i went prepared to talk about them and they were really enormously important in um helping me grow up as an economist and as an economic historian and the thing that i really remember about them was that they were all the same in the sense that they were all economic seminars and they were different but they were the same and one of the things that i really learned from bob because this is when he came back to chicago he was arguing about keeping the history field and he was saying you know economic history everybody should take economic history because we have the best empirical standards of any field and one of the things i really learned from bob was that i could be an economic historian and an economist in an economics department and so that meant i had confidence to get a job and get tenure right and that was something you could do and because i was a student of doug's and it was 1981 doug it just structured change had just come out you know in fact it came out the week i left for chicago and i got this signed copy and many of you may not know doug very well but this was when type's basic opening line was economists don't know well apple better so as a model for a junior professor you know i kind of had this mentor thing of going and telling my colleagues they really didn't know anything which was not going to be a good way to get a job or get tenure or any of that sort of stuff um and i think you know doug and bob had enormous respect for one another but they had very different styles um and i i know that i would have had i did have it took me 20 years before i could actually write thank you economic history like doug did it was enormously difficult because what doug always did was to say we need to ask new questions and what bob did that was so successful was he asked questions that he would already tell you were important and you asked them differently and so people were willing and already primed to take seriously what he was saying because they knew it was an interesting question um and so my last story is when i got to maryland i was the organizer you know with cynthia and dave mitch of the western area economic history seminar and and basically what that meant initially was my job was to go pick the person up at the airport and make sure they got to the seminar and back to the hotel so bob and i were talking outside of this hotel for like two or three hours as midnight and he said to me you know john the the measure of success in our in our in our profession is influencing the way other people think and you know i kind of i was an assistant professor i said no the measure of success is you know how many articles i get published and he's and he was saying to me no it's taken me 30 years i'm still learning the implications of that so every you know march and july we're here and other this room gets filled up with people and it's filled up with people who want to learn right but it's always fill up with people who don't want to be taught okay and bob understood that in a very intuitive way he was very warm and generous and he was also very tenacious and understood that these conversations would always be debates and that you had to convince people you know and that this business of listening to what people were saying was an incredibly important part of convincing them right so they think you're not listening to them they're not listening to you yeah i kind of thought of apple butter you know that was not the best rhetorical approach it takes had we all followed doug there wouldn't be very many economic historians and bob actually as an echo we couldn't i couldn't no way do what bob did at the level or the intensity or the scale but i could follow that model in a way that was much easier than following doug and so that statement about influencing the way people think really influenced me and i think bob was a great example and in fact that we're here to sort of honor his accomplishments and his life and his memory is a real monument to that influence thanks [Applause]
