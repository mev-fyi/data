uh i'm super excited to be here i've put together a pretty long summary of the household finance literature it will necessarily omit lots of stuff but i'm going to move quickly and i'm giving you lots of citations and you can dig more deeply into whatever you find interesting so i want to go through nine facts one of which you've already heard but i want to include it here because it's so important to the hospital finance for the richer they are households have low levels of financial literacy they have very few liquid assets uh they basically a lot of them look hand in hand they have substantial illiquid wealth they have a high marginal propensity to consume out of liquid wealth and liquidity but they have a low marginal potential to consume i'll say mdc from now on out of their illegal portfolio wells uh they tend not to choose optimal financial service products there's lots of uh rip-offs out there and people go after them um people unfortunately are not that prone to change their behavior after light touch financial education interventions so picking up on what raj was saying you know if you spend 2 500 you see some effects but if you do the kinds of light touch educational interventions that come to the mind of an economist uh those tend not to work uh they have misaligned financial intentions and financial actions that's an introduction to present bias which all comes with the end and they make financial and health choices that are seemingly easy to manipulate and that's the nudge material that i think doug touched on earlier and i'm not going to be doing because you've already heard it so let's get busy and start looking at this evidence we'll start with financial literacy so there's a lot of work by sardi and mitchell i want to just immediately warn you that whatever level of rationality you ascribe to a typical person if you're anything like me your orders of magnitude off and um that's very important to remember as we write down a dynamic optimization model or even worse the dynamic game of the sort that i typically solve in my papers uh people just don't know as much about the world as i think we organically assume they do so here's an example a compound interest question asked to us adults age 50 plus suppose you had a hundred dollars in a savings account and the interest rate was two percent per year after five years how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow correct answer more than 102 this could seem like a pretty low hard question uh here's another question we'll come to the percentage right later imagine that the interest rate in your savings account was one percent per year inflation was two percent per year after one year would you be able to buy the money in this account more exactly the same less don't know refuse to answer there's another question uh do you think the following statement is true or false buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund true or false which is the right answer uh don't number two so um here are the responses for uh us adults uh let me see if i can put this on my screen responsibility um so the combat interest question which is is sort of just you know the most basic understanding of what compound interest means not even being able to do anything fancy two-thirds get it correct inflation 75 get it correct the stock question one stock or a mutual fund only half understand that one stock is riskier than a mutual fund so you can basically flip a coin and do as well on that question um only 34 correctly answer all three of these very foundational questions or very simple questions now another aspect of this whole problem that makes things much worse is that people tend to do poorly at age 50 and then go downhill from there i'm 55 and so let's see where i am already there it is um so if you ask this question and this is estimated by looking at people answering the same question basically two years apart so if anything they should be kind of getting better with practice but the question is if five people all have the winning number in the lottery and the price is two million dollars how much will each of them get and at age 50 about half people can divide 2 million by 5. by age 90 only 10 percent can divide 2 million by 5. so when we think about all these retirees with all of this retirement wealth they've accumulated now spending we need to think twice about you know their ability to do that kind of rational thing okay the second set of issues i want to kind of move into a big set which is households have very few liquid assets they live hand-in-hand they have substantial illiquid wealth so where you see wealth in the portfolio or on their balance sheet it's in the illiquid category they have a high mpc out of liquid wealth and liquidity and they have a low mpc out of their liquid wealth and portfolio wealth okay let's take a look so there's this uh lucardi and tufano question from a 2009 survey how confident are you that you could come up with two thousand dollars if an unexpected need arose within the next month this is from any source including credit so about half of u.s households say that they could come up with two thousand dollars in the next month only half here's uh more widely discussed questions on the survey of consumer finances the sdf which is a spend run survey 46 of us adults report that they either could not come up with 400 bucks to cover an emergency expense or would have to borrow or sell something to do so let's look at balance sheets and begin taking them apart so we're looking here at the health and retirement survey 2008 wave and this is really free financial crisis um this is work like the term eventian wise and this is very consistent across time so i'll show you later data from later sef cross sections but you know this is the data i'm going to show you first so if we look at the median household in different categories so let's look at all households median net worth for households age 65 to 69 2008 is 548 000 now that includes social security in the hrs we have measures of social security wealth so media and social security is 187 000 median defined measurement pension wealth is zero that's becoming less and less relevant part of the us economy is essentially the defined benefit pension world vanishes then we get to non-annuitized wealth and we see that median financial assets for households right on the brink of retirement or just retired fifteen thousand dollars so their total financial assets at the brink of retirement is fifteen thousand dollars after a lifetime of savings their personal retirement account assets five thousand dollars so basically the median household has nothing in their retirement accounts when they reach retirement in the u.s of course congressional security so they've got something that has been kind of forced on them and which is illiquid but they don't have the kind of thing that we mostly think about which is retirement wealth accumulated in a 401k plan or an ira but you know the big asset out here is their housing month they have 120 000 of net equity in their home so i've broken out showing you other uh demographic categories i'll let you think about that yourself here's um work that i've done with john beshears and jaden troy and bridget madrian and here we again we're trying to understand the liquidity in households and we thought about a kind of net worth concept across different domains of liquidity so let's begin with a1 which is liquid assets excluding retirement accounts let's think of a2 as liquid assets including retirement accounts let's think of a3 is all assets but in this particular data set the scf we don't have social security now let's work out the debt side of the balance sheet so d1 is non-collateralized debt excluding student debt d2 is non-collateralized debt including student debt d3 is all that so now we have kind of the network basis conditional on different types of liquidity so this is the kind of liquid net worth this is less liquid or this is kind of inclusive or more assets some of which are less liquid and this is inclusive of all assets again except social security so let's now look at these numbers and i'll focus on let's say net worth in the final column here you can see here for households in their 50s again after decades of work their liquid net worth is 780 and if we add in retirement accounts their liquid net worth is still fifteen thousand dollars and only when we start to get into these non-liquid categories notably household home equity do we start seeing a meaningful increment in the net worth of these households so when you think about the kind of typical household even in a developed economy like this one but alone in a place where there's not a financial system you want to think about a world where kind of there's very little liquidity sitting in most of the balance sheets now if you're interested i've made these slides available these are deeper dives but let's not dwell on them for the last time here's another way of thinking about it again using the scf and here i want to focus on the credit card borrowing that councils are doing so this is where um sean lee and peter max head and this is sdf data from the 2013 2016 and 2019 cross sections and you can see here that households that have negative liquid network by definition have credit card debt but a lot of them are carrying credit card debt where they report that the interest rate exceeds 10 on their credit card debt and then even when we start to break out into households that have positive liquid assets is the ratio with annual income we still see a lot of this credit card debt so households that manage to hold some liquid wealth often are holding it to pay a bill or holding it because they're not managing optically and nevertheless carrying credit card debt so let's say we go out here and we're looking at households that have 110 to their annual income wealth you know they're still holding about 40 of them high interest rate credit card debt on average about half of u.s households are holding high interest rate credit card debt and about by that i mean paying debt not just rolling over not just paying in full and essentially getting the float i mean actually paying interest on their debt and about 60 of us households are rolling over debt from month to month on which they're paying interest credit card debt now let's talk about npcs there's a huge literature measuring npcs um i'm going to kind of pick out a couple papers and then discuss um some papers that offer a bit of a high-level view and some big data sets so one example is splintering home and not big they study lottery winners and they study the marginal propensity for expenditure so not just spending on non-durables but spending on everything including durables and they report that low liquidity winners of the smallest prices around 1500 prizes are estimated to spend all of their winnings within the year of the win the corresponding estimate for high liquidity winners of large prizes so these are the people that we would in theory think would have a very very low npc like percent or ten percent their mpx is about one-half so gerard and eric tony are studying brazilian workers who lose their job and get a severance tape and also get unemployment insurance so there's a period of time when they're getting these very big payments from their firm and from the government to kind of take them through the transition to the next job what you might think in classical theory is that they would kind of suppress their spending during this period because losing your job is bad news for your long-run well-being financially exactly the opposite happens displaced workers eligible for both unemployment insurance and severance payments increased consumption it layoff by 35 despite experiencing a 17 long run reduction in their permitted income so they kind of have a consumption boom and then eventually the benefits run out and they have to settle with a 17 reduction in their one run spending we saw this during the most recent financial crisis when i should say pandemic crisis when people got checked from the government and if you were unemployed and got checked from the government your spending actually went up whereas if you stayed employed your spending actually went down charlie so is there some sense in which people are subjective well-being smoothing with these unemployment shocks where if you get a bad unemployment shock you can imagine like oh yeah i'm going to splurge because i just feel really bad and unemployed is that something that you know it's a cool idea it's not something that people have pursued the the model that these folks did is a pleasant bias model and it fits the data perfectly but i agree another interesting angle like a kind of my marginal utility is higher during this period when i'm really depressed because i'm out of work temporarily and i'm going to spend more um i would have actually thought it would go the opposite way that when you're depressed spending doesn't make you happy um you got to be kind of being happy and spending money or kind of complimentary um being on vacation you're depressed doesn't really feel like a great thing but um maybe and it's an interesting idea okay there's so many papers what are the different measures of consumption on the previous flights like in the factory paper do we know that they're not spending that to pay off debt like is that excluded yeah so that's excluded but but the key thing is durables which you could argue is you know not really spending and so i'm going to show you breakdowns where durables are and are not in the analysis so this paper is the review paper that i promised you um havernick and ova and they look at 246 estimates of the npc for non-miracles so this is really spending um fun well i wasn't asking a question so one of the devices that sendol often uses maybe it was your id originally is to draw analogy between the npcs and then how people spend our time so you know low income people are money poor and i am a pilot and i wonder if there's a paper written or already written that looks at what happens when you get a windfall of time and my guess is that most people just blow that time and then they wake up the next day they're just as if they would have been yeah you think that's right i guess it's so right um you got me yeah that's a cool paper i think that paper needs to be written see the the inefficient use of time and how often we're so desperate for an hour and yet when we get that spare half day we blow it on youtube videos or too many new york times articles and you know i've read an hour of the new york times and i'm practically falling asleep i am falling asleep and i keep reading another new york times article which is which is really wasteful but i have better things to do um in the 61st minute so yeah i think you're absolutely right that time is another interesting resource that is not allocated efficiently and is kind of you know overspent when we have a lot of it and then we we're desperate a week later nice idea so in this survey paper they look at 246 estimates and the mean mdc for non-durables is 0.29 and the median npc is about 45 now if you want to move back and forth between npcs or non-durables and marginal propensities to expand money on all categories including durables you can look at this paper that i've written with peter maxton and ben mall and basically using theory and also looking at the empirical evidence it's about a 3x adjustment so you would take these numbers and you would scale them by two and a half to three to get the mpx and depending upon your question if you're a government trying to stimulate economic activity you want to know the fdx if you're a theorist trying to understand whether people are consultants moving you want to know the nfc but the key thing is that you know the life cycle theories that we all learn when we take our first macro course tell us that we should be spending the annuity value and the numbers are just you know sort of an order of magnitude higher than the annuity value of these windows now here's another paper that i would refer you to if you're thinking about npc's mdx speaker just about i mean consumption is so hard to measure like we have to remember there is paper like the gnome and the wall stuff where they have a better measure but i don't think it's quite complete um either so is there any pattern and count of these for example estimating if this is vary with the quality of the data and it seems like there's so much so that's sort of what this paper is about okay um so so this gonog and all paper from 2020 is is essentially saying hey we have millions of people in the jpmorgan database and we've got because we can select the sub sample for which we've got a very clear picture into their spending patterns we can actually do a much better job of estimating npcs than other folks in literature and so what they do is they compare their estimates and the whiskers around the phenomenon at all estimates you see are very small so here they are with the small whiskers and they're comparing their npc estimates to npc estimates and mpx estimates in the literature from three of the leading papers and you see that you know they get very very tight estimates and it's this sort of data that's i think finally enabling this literature to deal a bit um both surveys like this where we kind of gather up a lot of data across studies but especially these big new data sets where we are really getting a tight picture and the thing that i want to highlight here which is a critical feature of their paper is the finding that there's lots of variation in npcs and the variation is predictable by how liquid the household's balance sheet is so if you have a lot of liquidity on your balance sheet you have a very low npc in the final bucket if you have very little liquidity on your balance sheet you tend to have a very high npc and that's the sort of thing that models we're going to come to at the end will exactly predict and you might notice that their estimates match the other estimates except for the fingering at all papers and that's because their estimates are npcs for non-durables whereas the fingering of all estimates are mpxes for non-durables and variables so if you want to adjust these numbers you want to multiply that by approximately three and then you'll see that in fact it won't be that far away okay now um johannes i think you're here do i see you behind the ass you're out you're on this slide um so um you know i've been talking about npcs that are calculated typically when liquidity lands in people's um checking accounts but you can also think about npcs or mdxs when people have wealth windfalls that land in other accounts like portfolio accounts or retirement accounts and we see kind of interestingly an interesting lack of fungibility across these two categories when wealth lands in let's say your home equity or when wealth lands in your stock account or when wealth lands in your ira or your 401k we see npcs that are more like five percent um but when one lands in your checking account then we see npcs that are more like 29 so another interesting thing to keep in your back of your mind and there's lots of explanations for this that are behavioral could be mental accounting could be self-regulation um it could be narrow framing there's lots of reasons why i you know lose or make tens of thousands of dollars in my retirement account that doesn't really affect my day-to-day spending but if you were to drop fifteen thousand dollars into my checking account it would affect my day-to-day spending and that money at least for a typical household will get spent pretty quickly okay next category households don't choose optimal financial service products and also they barely change their behavior when they're kind of educated about how to make better choices so let's think about this so um this is a paper with james troy and bridget matrion uh we did this experiment with um employees at harvard and we asked them to allocate 10 000 real dollars across four s p 500 index funds so they're allocating the money across honest to goodness index funds that are essentially replicating exactly the same portfolio and we unbundled what they were going to get in the experiment from actually interacting with the firm we said you'll get the return that the firm will generate but we'll make the payment to you so it's really just about you know which of these index funds is going to have the best return we did this with 400 subjects and we promised them all a ten thousand dollar portfolio and the net upside net of fees of their investment which meant that we had a four million dollar short position in the stock market during this experiment which we covered with the hedge so ourselves in complete jeopardy um and this experiment was one of those moments in my life when i kind of had an awakening a behavioral awakening about the level of rationality of people in the world um the first awakening came when we simply gave the experimental subjects the prospectus is for the four index funds and we said allocate your ten thousand dollars however you fit um and we're going to pay you the the net return when you're done and they only three percent of them put all the money in the low cost s p 500 index fund and their average fee out of the 10 000 was 518 in fees and if they had chosen the most expensive fund they would have paid 581 dollars in expenses and expense ratios and fees and how did they end up doing worse than random well they ended up chasing the s p 100 index funds that had higher historical returns because they had better inception dates and or a better brand now this first result was a bit of a surprise we thought that you know they would do better than this but we thought if we gave them a tip about how to choose well they would choose much better than they chose here and so in another arnold i'm about to show you we gave them not only the four prospectuses one for each index fund which of course contain the fees of them but also a one page sheet written at about a ninth grade level explaining the fees for all four funds one row after another both in percentage terms and in dollar terms so they could see exactly the fees for the four funds and then in another arm we also gave them a one page paragraph you know whole paper third of a page paragraph explaining exactly what an index is just in case you didn't know but these are all people that are investing in the stock market because they're all employees at harvard who have money put into the investment pool on their behalf by harvard so these are not kind of naive non-investors these are people for whom all of this does matters for which they have experience well our one-page cheat sheet which i was convinced was going to completely transform their lives and you know turn them into masterful investors when it came to index funds um you know completely largely failed so rather than having three percent put all their money in the low cost to get started we had nine percent put all their money in the low cost of the next month and the average fee went from 518 to 494 again still worse than throwing darts in this exercise so this is an example of the kinds of kind of disappointing and kind of shocking results for a communist who was thinking that people would take a hint more than we were leading them by the nose to the right answer but they weren't eager to follow us to that conclusion here's another example um this is work in this last experiment the stakes were kind of 500 bucks you were going to lose by making the wrong choice here's an experiment where the states are many thousands of dollars of losses um this experiment or this study done with james joy and virgin adrian focused on people who were over age 59 and a half in the u.s who work at firms where you can put money into the 401k plan get the match and then take your contribution right back out and keep the match so it's basically pure arbitrage now you know already it's weird that people aren't taking advantage of this but we thought maybe if we just explained it to them and again gave them a kind of very easy to understand worksheet where they worked through with us how much money they were losing by not putting money into the plan and then if they needed it taking it back out and keeping the matching dollars if they work through the calculation with us surely they would understand that this was a great thing and that they would then receive a save more and take advantage of the free money on hand by doing this so we did an educational intervention and it had absolutely no effect and we know that people were paying attention because we paid them to work through the worksheet that they used to calculate the thousands of dollars they were losing each year by not exploiting this arbitrage opportunity now yes did you have them yeah before yes so we did partly this is procrastination so by and large people leave the exercise saying oh my goodness i didn't realize this was such a great deal i'm gonna join the plan now that i know and yet when we followed up the control group and the treatment group had equal join rates over the following six months so so i think to a certain extent this is good intentions being overcome by the busyness of life which raj was describing you know when you've got the kids and the chaos and everything else going on this is not a priority especially if you're present biased and you're thinking that you'll do it you know next month what's the loss just one twelfth the one year is matching money you know no big deal except we know from the data that people often go for years without joining these plans so david um yesterday i talked some about financial education and i shut down this um [Music] uh by amrit co-authors that came out in jaipur last year um and they i mean it's a lot of studies on financial education at this point that are out there and it what it shows is of course a distribution but you know on average uh studies have found significant effects of intervention so the question is why would it fail in one instance and succeed in another what's what's our insight about that so so there's there's other better studies that are much less encouraging um the screen that they're using in the study that you showed is a stream for successful publication in top quality journals which is going to have the more successful interventions there's an earlier better study which shows on average no effects by a different group um i remember the first author um but but you know there's controversy uh sure sure but i think it's clear to find quite a distribution that that's the characterization alert right if the mean is zero you worry that that you have publication bias if you pick out the studies that are successful because they show up in top journals um so so i think that that by and large the educational intervention studies if you think about them in aggregate and don't introduce screens um you end up with pretty disappointing results and these events here and we've got a couple papers where we also other papers i didn't have time to throw up that also show no results um uh with big samples um the picture that you're talking about it passes the screen right yeah right so this paper i haven't checked whether it made it into into their uh survey but um but i do think just to get back to your your question that there are some domains where probably people are deeply confused and they're about to make a decision and you precisely show them what to do and um and there's no gap between getting the information and taking the choice and in a domain like that i would guess that an educational intervention would be you know more possibly likely to work however you know in the study that i just showed you here they were getting the education at the moment they were making the decision so i'm actually pretty um [Music] pretty skeptical that we're gonna see major effects of financial education um when we include you know the universe of studies including the studies that don't publish well because they get with no results well there are two reasons to have a study could not publish a lot of science that gets a result people are interested in the other is that it isn't as good it's not done as far as one thing the screening does for us is screen perspectives that need a certain quality question right and it's not a perfect screen but that's a reason for paying more attention to expense i agree with you the stream can either bias us or or move us in the other direction my belief is that when i as i have done this things myself read other people's studies dug into the details um i don't i don't think that there is um compelling evidence that financial education it's is going to move the needle much if you told me it's going to move needle a little bit especially when done very well i would say sure if you told me you think it's going to make a big difference in the behavior of the aggregate community of decision makers i would say i'm i'm pretty guilty of that okay sure you know um explanation that makes sense for one of the developers of the study but i guess like what a harvard one like do you know what's going on there and also like when you notice that people don't know how to divide like 2 million like that like maybe a lot of people just recorded like forty thousand or something and like that doesn't seem like a bad mistake because like as long as they knew like two million divided by five like they just got into it so i was just thinking like do you remember like what's what's what exactly is going on so what i think is going on i mean we see we see lots of debriefing evidence in this study that tells us what people say they're doing and they actually say that they're a lot of them say they're keeping me minimizing that that's a strong motive for them so despite not feminizing they claim to be minimizing um but they're also intentionally chasing historical returns in an index fund they say that they're doing that and they also say that they're mindful of branding even though again it's an index fund so and even though in one of the conditions of the study explained to them that it's an index fund and here's how it works you know these are the elements that make an index fund essentially a um commodity like good with no differentiation across burns so my my high level sense is that the things that i used to take for granted about economic choice in the realm of finance we should stop taking for granted that the idea that people know what a stock and a bond is and a mutual fund and an index fund and the idea that people understand even what a fee is on a mutual fund i'll tell you one okay so one very quick story um i sat sorry of one of the most sophisticated mutual fund management companies in the world and i asked about my spouse's mutual fund and i said what is the fee on her mutual fund and the person on the phone who had been through months of training and who had answered thousands of phone calls said there is no fee on your spouse's mutual fund and i proceeded to argue with them this went on for hours 20 minutes um and eventually they revealed that the reason they knew that there was nothing on my spouse's mutual fund is that it wasn't done reportedly reported now you may or may not know that these funds do not appear on quarterly reports so they don't you will never find a mutual fund fee on a quarterly report so this person running the phone bank highly trained answering thousands of phone calls about mutual funds from one of the leading mutual fund companies in the world was so deeply misinformed about the very product that they were instructing or answering questions about if they don't know the most basic 101 elements of this industry you know why do we expect everyone else in the country to understand it so i think i think the confusion is very very deep and and i think all of our um presumptions that we just make in our models willy-nilly are drastically off relative to the reality of what people truly know about the products they find yes that one's complicated because there's a lot of virtue signaling and you know good feeling purchasing building to themselves not to others but you know i'm a good person i'm buying the fund that's environmentally socially and governmentally you know good uh i don't think they probably understand much about the guts of it indeed the overwhelming evidence as you pointed out is that these are very very close to replicas of the existing index um but um you know open questions that that i haven't seen okay i want to get to the eighth point here so alignment between what people think they're going to do and what they actually do and this is going to take us to procrastination and present bias let me begin with some survey evidence and this is actually you know i realized as i was sitting here doug you started as literature back in the early 90s you wrote that book with the data survey from merrill lynch about people's normative savings rates versus their actual savings rate so we should be crediting i should be crediting doug for getting this literature um off the ground where you kind of you know ask people and we'll come to other evidence in a second you know how are you doing with respect to your saving and you know doug found in this path-breaking work in the early 1990s that people said they should be saving about four times more than they were actually saving um so here's a more recent survey um uh this one we actually have administrative data so for every 100 surveys for every 100 people that we survey two out of three say that they're saving too little and 24 out of the 100 say that they're going to raise their 401 pay saving rate in the next two months and when you actually look at their administrative data and check to see you know who actually did something you see that three out of 100 actually did something and this is four months later so we doubled the look back time um sorry we doubled the amount of time we gave them just in case they didn't do it in two months it took you know three months so what we gave them four months and only three percent of the 100 uh actually did the thing that 24 out of 100 how do you interpret the 68 you know because i could say i'm saving too little i wish i could save more but i just can't or is it too little relative to what i think is my internal optimum yeah so i think i think dimitri is right to probe this sort of evidence taken in isolation that people saying i'm saving too little you know what does that mean i mean you know maybe it's just aspirational and no one actually thinks this is a normative benchmark they just you know i want to exercise more i say it but i don't really mean it maybe um and maybe they say it here and don't really mean it um and so this evidence i think is just illustrative and by no means something that you would take to the bank and say now i know that people have self-control problems this is related evidence but the same problem that dimitri just highlighted which i think is a real problem but that's why we're going to come to structural models a little bit later so uh couchler and pagle in a 2021 paper are studying data from us from a firm that is set up to help people cut back their credit card debt so the fact that these firms exist is already interesting uh these are firms that are kind of helping people coaching people into changing their spending patterns so they can actually reduce their credit card debt when people sign up their median debt sign up is about 11 000 their median plan for paying off their debt over the first 90 days is 1900 and their median actual pay down over the first 90 days is 234 and again these are self-selected people joining up with the firm that is charging the money for the service of helping them pay down their debt but maybe we come back to dimitri's point and worry about you know whether this is um just too far so another way the literature has gone is to introduce structural models where we're not relying on people's cheek talk we're just looking at their empirical balance sheet moments here's one of those papers this is um worked with sean lee pierre maxdev andre robetto and jeremy spockman and we build a kind of rich structural model i'm not going to write down all the equations for lack of time but in a nutshell above all has mortality child dependence and goal dependence three educational groups everything is is broken out by educational group stochastic labor income tax course variation we have a dynamic budget constraint there's credit cards with credit limits there's liquid assets there's partially illiquid assets the state variables are liquid wealth illiquid wealth and all the correlated labor income and we're going to have present bias we're going to study the naive case but similar analyses using the sophisticated case yield similar results um then we have constant relative risk function um so the methodology here is a standard method related moments methodology where we take balance sheet moments calculated from the sef and we ask whether the model can reproduce the balance sheet through those moments second we're going to look at 16 of those moments and for what i'm going to show you today we'll be looking at u.s households with a high school education and not a college education so i think you've already been exposed to beta delta discounting or present bias so i'm not going to labor this slide here we've got the discount function on utils and of course it's just a standard exponential discount function with a single beta wedge that distinguishes now for multiple articulates so let's begin with the empirical balance sheet problems these are of interest kind of independently of anything else just potentially to know what fraction of these households are carrying credit card debt and the answer is that for young households 81 are carrying credit card debt on which they're paying interest and that slowly declines as the households get older um if we look at the average amount of credit card debt and normalize it by the average amount of income for this group in the 20s that's 14 and then it slowly rises uh up to 20 now part of that increase is due to increasing credit limits so some of this is the fact that they can borrow more it's not that they're becoming more kind of financially problematic if their credit limits are going up as they get older and they have a better credit record or a bigger counter record now let's kind of break out their wealth formation by whether they do or don't have predict so again these are the empirical moments that we're studying of these course the empirical moments that we're studying right now in this column um so if we look at households with credit card debt so these are households that you know are kind of borrowing by and large paying a lot on the margin and interest their ratio of average net worth to average income starts at one and then rises as they age to four whereas if we look at households without credit card debt and again this is a kind of minority um we start at two and we go up to eight so these are the 16 moments that we're trying to fit um in this analysis now let's kind of look at the um results of the method of simulated moments analysis that's going to pick the parameters that get us closest using a kind of quadratic objective to the moments where the quadratic objective is inversely weighted by standard errors at the moment and you see here that when we introduce the present bias model we end up with a beta of about 0.5 and a long run annual discount factor of about 0.99 so long run discounting close to one percent but the short run discount rate of 50 and when we estimate relative risk aversion we end up getting pretty close to the logarithmic case when we restrict to the exponential case we end up of course with beta equal one by assumption and now we need more discounting with exponential discounting in order to kind of come close to the moments that we see in the data and again close to log utility and what you'll see here is that the model of present bias does pretty well at fitting all of these moments um it's still not going to generate enough credit card debt so we'd like 81 to be borrowing if we wanted to exactly get the data we're only going to get 58 borrowing so we're still low here but we're you know better in this column than we are in this column here again we're still low but we're better here than we are here and then when we get down here to the wealth moments the two models are basically doing about as well okay so in the blue since the interest people are earning on their wealth is probably not equal to the apr and the product like that and doesn't that we just immediately reject the exponential model or is there an alternative which is like a housing commitment that's not actually which was exactly so i mean it's totally plausible and this is why i think structural knobs are kind of useful as an additional contributor to the body of evidence um it's possible that i might have a house that's pretty eliquid in terms of my home equity in terms of my mortgage in terms of my ability to extract liquidity and a shock comes along and i end up having to borrow my credit card at twenty percent maybe for a year even as i'm holding a house that's generating a return of six percent real and so you know simultaneity of holding an illiquid asset and having a credit card debt that i'm paying an interest on is not inherently a smoking gun but you know it's the cumulative propensity to do this in the economy with the frequency that we see in the data that becomes evidence in these in these sorts of structural models but there was like one while um that would be a reaction and then sometimes there's plenty of good imagine that um i have a mortgage payment to make at the end of the month of a thousand dollars and i've got credit card debt that i'm paying interest on of of two thousand dollars you know i still need my liquidity at the end of the month to make my mortgage payment and so there's lots of households indeed i think most households that are simultaneously carrying a lot of credit card debt and holding a lot of liquid wealth are doing so for perfectly kind of locally rational reasons because there's a expense coming that has to be made with cash meaning with a transfer from my bank account not on my credit card and so i truly need to rationally keep that liquidity in my checking account even as i'm carrying three thousand dollars of credit card debt and i think a lot of what we see in the simultaneous holding literature is driven by factors like that now in a in another paper in this literature um this one with peter max and ben hall were also using household balance sheet moments to calibrate these models and one of the things that we're finding is that if you want to explain the kinds of npcs that we talked about earlier it turns out that these present biased models to do a good job of doing that this model was not calibrated to fit npcs it was calibrated to fit balance sheet moments but then when you take the model and you simulate npc's you get exactly the sorts of results that we see in the meta study that i showed you earlier um with the exponential model we end up with a much lower mpc that's the black um consumption impulse response function down here that's the that's the exponential model with the present bias model in red we see these very high short run npcs you give a family a thousand dollars and very quickly that money gets steady which is why in a normal recession it's a very good idea to write checks in a pandemic recession where people can't run out and go and visit grandma with a plane ride it may be a less good idea to write checks because those checks to the round unused for a while and then eventually get used when the economy is already on the path to recovery um but there's other structural work that um indeed some of it i think you probably dimitri and puns have been doing some of this work this is just a kind of you know illustrative set of papers um but there's other structural work using household balance sheet facts to um you know estimate custom bias so i think a lot of the stuff that we see in the household of appliance literature is well explained by president bias indeed i see nava out there there's a kind of emerging literature where she wrote the canonical first paper in on commitment in household behavior and that's another area where present bias has been used to explain what we observed in the field studies maybe not we'll be telling you about that paper later um so that ends my kind of lightning summary of the household finance literature and again there's this critical piece that i've left out which is you know how nudges work or don't work to change behavior and one of the key things that i want to highlight is um nudges do work to change short run wealth formation and i imagine don't talk about that but one of the things that is just now emerging is the finding that if you follow people over a long period of time they undo the effects of those short run nudges so that indeed the long run effect of the sorts of nudges that are very commonly discussed are relatively small compared to the short run effects and that makes a lot of sense in a world where people are biased and a big chunk of liquid cash again i'm sitting in an ira is a tempting target if i've got a huge credit card debt so that's a topic for another time um there's one more thing i wanted to add but decided i didn't have time to cover so i'll just mention it which is it's not just that there's a lot of credit card debt in the household sector there's a lot of households in developed economies and in developing economies especially borrowing that crazy interest rates like 20 interest rates over a two-week period and of course you're not going to see that if the supply of credit lowers the equilibrium interest rate but in many developing economies where there isn't a very sophisticated banking sector and there's very limited supply of credit you do have markets where the only credit available is available at sky high rates again 20 for two weeks and you see a lot of borrowing at those sky high rates let's get another film for you to worry about and think about and think about how you're going to model um but that's not something that i had time for today so i think i'm actually ending on time um huh thank you so let's start by thanking let's open up this floor for questions um and we we have again flexibility and type of questions let me start off with one actually which is um of course yesterday doug actually let off the camp with discussing behavioral welfare analysis and the long-run criteria in particular and i wanted to share your views on on using the paper so i've been all over the map in my personal paper writing career in terms of the criteria that should be used i generally agree that the walmart criterion is the best criterion for welfare analysis in a present biased world and just in case anyone has any doubt about what we're talking about that's just you know so i've got this discount function i think this is what you're talking about right and you know the question is how do i want to evaluate utils as the policy maker as the you know what objective should society be trying to maximize and one objective is to use the long run criterion which is to ignore present bias and just say we're going to add up the utils discounting with parameter delta and we're going to treat that as the social objective and i do think that that's the best way to think about it but i'll happily acknowledge that there are many other legitimate ways to think about it radio criterion for example you could think of each self having a set of interests and trying to achieve the location in terms of resource allocation other creative fronts here that would be another way to think about it so another way to think about it by the way that that many people have proposed in the historical literature so people like marchessan is to say you know even if someone has a delta of 0.99 or nicolas stern in the climate change report that he wrote famously about a decade ago they said you know there's really no reason to be discounting almost at all so we're going to use what i'll call delta star where delta star is something that's much much closer to one and they would say you know any discounting is kind of frailty of human forecasting or a frailty of the way we think about the world and so nick stern or justin many philosophers of literature going back 70 years of argue for delta values that are of course not equal to one because then you have objects that don't um geometric sums that don't converge but if it's at least close to one you have geometric sounds that do converge and you have a mean criterion so um i think it's an open question and um if doug said use this that's what i'm using so i'm with you the question that i'm raising is what is the objective criteria by which one arrives at uh as the welfare standard and merely saying this resonates with me is not i think the answer to that question it's you know how is it what what are the objective criteria we could be applying to any problem where there's a plan of bias what are those criteria that happen to be applying in this situation to reach that conclusion how my funky path came to eventually saying why don't we just use this i began as you probably maybe remember afraid of my hearing saying you know that's like the possible way to go and i don't want to impose my preferences and i just want to be maximally like good economists and and then i realized after working with the red criterion for a decade that it was very very close to this in terms of the the points that it picked out and once i realized that it was very very close to this criteria and this criterion is so much easier to describe i began to think you know um why am i getting so hung up on pages and pages of writing about the very criterion which is more easily defensible intellectually when i could have just said why don't we use this but you know if you really pushed me i'm gonna probably say if i have to have a kind of intellectually deeply coherent or you know for me deeply i'm not very deep so you know my standards um way of thinking about it i would say use pareto but then when you use pareto you start discovering that criteria like this or very close to this emerge and then you know you end up um not getting so hung up on the difference so um the way you applied for it if i remember is that you assume that each generation doesn't care about [Music] no i actually am pretty agnostic on you know i mean i don't think i had a huge argument with my family last night um [Music] you know it reminded me that the positive economics i know how to do and ethics is nothing but thin ice and um [Music] and i uh i'm very comfortable encouraging all of you to do ethics in the following way which is to do um if then ethics so so you write your paper i would suggest by saying you know if criterion x is the appropriate one then policy equals identity policy equals y but the thing that there are surely situations in which you're not that constant to be pretty skeptical of you know claims like we know this or that about the world so i am i'm actually pretty ambivalent um this is not a bad description of where i live intellectually i think it's a great a great place for people to live and to be able to make defense statements to say if you buy this by that standard if you're unsure you have all sorts of different ways to go you know when i worked out tools to do that so i agree with that but on the other hand i think that there are situations you know we we do apply um that evidence can always be questionable but at least we know how we are trying to marshal the governments to say there is a bias in this case for example because we demonstrate that somebody doesn't understand something whereas in this case it just feels more like this going you know this uh this field well i don't want to say that when we conduct our conversation with an if then structure that we never offer an explanation and i agree with you that saying it feels that was part of what was getting in the way of our conversation at the dinner table there was a lot of feelings um and uh i do like to have a conversation where we kind of appeal to um you know philosophical principles um uh but um you know you know we we all know that a claim like that camera is 13 feet away from me positive plane you know subject to some hypothesizing about whether we're all in a video favor not aside know i could measure the distance between me and that camera and you can measure and replicate my measurement and we can debate about standard errors and you know that's the thing where we have a kind of scientific methodology for resolving that question but like the question of what is ethically right what is the right social objective how do i weight the well-being of future generations um you know does the fetus have human rights i mean there's so many questions like that where we are um at you know but where ultimately it is axiomatic um as opposed to something where we can um you know point to some objective measurement and say all i'm making is an empirical claim and i'm not layering on some ethical or moral layer uh i think just you know us all to just acknowledge that that ethical moral layer is in some sense unavoidable when we and by ethical moral layer i mean assumptions that don't don't come to us from um scientific measurement but come to us because ultimately at the end of the day we're making a statement about what um seems logical sensible defensible et cetera but is not a positive statement about the physical world i think we would agree about that yes i necessarily got all the implications but i'm going to stop and you and i'll pursue this at another time okay so let's see let me just one more thing i'll just not thought that it matters [Music] but i i personally have become uh so i think this is super important and so i don't think it's a for me at least it's not enough to do that and the reason is how the policymaker thinks about present focus is super important like present focus underlies i'd say sixty percent of the paper public policy questions right and so i think it's important for us to say something about it and i've become active [Music] if uh beta delta carbon focus is just a reduced form for a characterization phase so david you're working on this sort of thing with zavier you know this yeah so i i very much agree with with hunt's observation which i'm not going to add to which is the whole thing about normalizing at one which is just the normalization development but then saying that you know as the horizon tau increases you know we care less about it and we care less maybe you know in some way that's hyperbolic or we care in a way that's exponential or whatever it is you know i worry that a lot of that discounting of the future which we which we economists have overwhelmingly taken as a set of kind of normative statements often with respect to a discount factor is very problematic and the philosophers like wrote on these topics 70 years ago and there were many of them not just said you know they thought discounting is a bizarre framework to use normatively and we should really challenge ourselves to think about a very different way of handling noodles now versus google's later now that raises all sorts of really fundamental problems like how do i possibly compare my own deals across time let alone my noodles versus the utils of some other human or intelligent life form on this planet in 200 years um you know these are super hard problems and i think we've been very lit and um i've been hurt i certainly stand like guilty as charged uh from my whole career i've been very polite and kind of saying well you know one more criterion or pareto criterion or just use delta ignore beta these are superficial answers and um you know it may be that discounting nava has written i think a lot about this in terms of the classical scholars um uh who you know who all thought in the 19th century that that basically you should be perfectly patient and anything that has a lot of discounting is just normatively wrong and it doesn't matter whether it's exponential or not you know that's all failures of our cognitive machinery and not something that has morbidity so you know and then nick stern comes along and writes this climate report i don't know at this point 10 15 years ago what was the date of that thing probably 10 years ago um and he basically said look the only discounting that i'm gonna allow in my final report is the chance of an asteroid destroying the earth and of course that makes all the difference right if you think that your discount factor should be essentially one it's one minus epsilon which is the chance of the asteroid destroying the earth but it's essentially one then you care so much about events that are 200 years away and you're willing to invest a lot now a huge amount down to first all climate change that's going to change the planet we think adversely at a horizon of 200 years but if you're someone else you're thinking well no the annual discount rate is two percent so events that are 200 years away are worth a lot less and these events a thousand years away are worth banishing the illegal financially little so that's not sacrificing the generation of generation huge important philosophical questions comes right we should be worried about them um but um gosh i mean there are two separate issues that feel like they're getting that study why is there generation you know within uh we should also understand the future and that argument has to feel to me uh you know we should listen to classical music and not run it's just you know apples versus oranges come on this is somebody's preference so if you're going to call that into question why stop there any expression of individual practices either side theater generation which i agree with retirement that's acceptable but allocating my own resources over my lifetime what is the difference between today versus tomorrow and possible musicians so yeah i know you you called it right i'm i'm quite um on the one hand i want to be a good economist and so i want to say your build weapons are built up for real preference on the other hand i want to um think outside that box and recognize that just because people choose it doesn't make it normatively right and and even things like you know a rip your head um like there's so many things that humans do that you look at it and you say this is deeply destructive to what seems to be your well-being by every measure except the fact that you choose it like the person who's taking opioids and is living a life of profound distress have you written about this issue with antonio i mean not about opioids but about addiction um and you know do we do we give normative credence to the choices of someone who seems to be ruining their lives by their own admission by everyone else's admission by the admission of physicians by the admission of you know every person in society except with one deviation from saying it's a mistake which is this person is choosing to consume its opioids so um you know i don't know i'm i'm you know i'm not not so convinced that i think we've overweighted revealed preference in the world of economics i don't think we should discard it i definitely think you know asking nava you know do you want an orange or an ice cream sandwich is a legitimate question and i should probably listen to not his answer when i decide what to give her for her birthday um uh but um but you know i'm not completely convinced that there's nothing else that i can appeal to when deciding what is in nava's interest and if you know if nava asked me for for synthetic opioids for her birthday would like some fentanyl or an ice cream sandwich nava i [Music] you know maybe there's an aspect of appreciation to that which i would then say is the classical music versus why would it be that it will raise some degree of possible music or you take some appreciation lessons you have a different taste for it so julian said that the ability for example in this case the ability to imagine vividly and precisely and even take it a step further the ability to imagine someone else's utility so precisely that it can feel as good to you their happiness is yours if to the extent that that's a skill that can be investigated but you know then i i think we're talking about a different moment of question now it has a great paper um that i was like literally just rereading a couple days ago um where um she and our co-authors do an intervention where they improve people's ability to visualize the future and people start acting a lot more patiently so it it begs the question that um you know what is the normative benchmark is it the preferences they had before the visualization intervention which were more impatient or the preferences they had after the visualization intervention which were more patient um you know i don't know um i i don't feel paralyzed by these questions in the sense that i don't feel like oh my goodness we've lost our formative anger how do i possibly become an economist don't worry you can do economics without being completely confident about the answers these questions i do think that they're real questions um it's good that you have doug here as a guy to thinking about them endometrion i um you know i struggle with them and i expect that you will too ethics is hard one thing i was going to say at the doug's point about wrong and classical music is if you survey philosophers i've seen at least one survey of kind of leading philosophers where most philosophers told the view that there were objective standards of aesthetics as well and then some forms of heart are just objective so i think a lot of philosophers would probably just fight that bullet very happily but there's a reason there is a um i would say a movement away from higher versus low art in in you know in the in the post-modern philosophy of the last four years but i certainly agree with you that that if you surveyed philosophers in 1970 they would all agree with the distinction between good high art and bad little art um and then you know post-modernism and andy warhol and a lot of other things came along that challenged the idea that that there's better that there's higher level but these are huge open questions i have run those surveys i haven't actually interestingly meaningfully published those results i've published them in various optimal corners when you ask people what they think the when you say to them um what consumption path do you want in a world of zero interest rates can you say look you have a budget and you know you can you can have this or you can have this you know whatever um but you have to satisfy the budget constraint and the interest rate is zero or even any interest rate you can ask the question you basically get people expressing um a slight preference for rising personal consumption paths now economists have interpreted that as evidence for intrapersonal platformation so they've said well it's not that this person likes the upward sloping path so this is you know age this is consumption and people go for the blue path um it's not that you know maybe so george lloydson has an early paper looking into this and you know there's plenty of evidence that people like other smoking pads holding a bunch of distinctives and even like i was looking pads even if they have a lower net pressure value so even if the interest rate is positive um they'll they'll take the upward sloping path even if it has a lower mpv so economists have said well it must be reference points and some kind of out of formation today's consumption into yesterday's consumption and that's why we'd like to move it so they haven't interpreted that to mean that your discount factor delta is greater than one i do think it it it does take the question of you know what we know that when you give people resources they don't implement anything close to that they tend to spend early and up with much lower levels of resources but this is what they say they want for themselves um don't know what to make of that so if i can jump in on that last one um i have a paper that came out last year on journalism where we have people make uh decisions about elevator money over time now or later and other people can restrict those decisions so this is an expression of you know what i think benefits somebody else but i think some of the impressive wealth is and what we find is that people tend to think that others uh would be well served by being as creative as they are so it's a you know i take them on to scavengers for others but the other thing that we find is that introducing front-end delay doesn't change the intervention in fact the retention goes up a little bit with front end delay which is opposite what a behavioral economist would think you know it's when there is financial aid you don't need to so thank you very much
