very briefly uh this is an obviously an extraordinarily important topic um at the absolute forefront of what macroeconomists are concerned about now we are very lucky to have an extraordinarily distinguished panel headed by a moderator ragu rajan who is the um katherine dusak miller distinguished service professor of finance at booth and i will let ragudani do any other further introductions as he sees fit so the format is yours thank you uh and good afternoon everyone um uh what i hope we will see is uh is three fantastic minds talking about a very important topic tradeoffs of a higher federal debt we have larry summers former secretary of the treasury former president of harvard university and currently the charles elliot university professor at harvard university ricardo rice phillips professor of economics at the london school of economics and carmen reinhardt who is currently the chief economist at the world bank and also the mino zumba nakis professor at the kennedy school of government so uh rules of the game we start with seven minutes per person uh with a one minute warning at six minutes after which i start talking loudly so that i interfere with your conversation uh that's to convince you to get off after seven um seven minutes per person and then we uh go into a discussion where i will ask questions and they will be pointed at someone but then others feel free to respond others on the panel feel free to respond the audience feel free to ask questions by our chat and i'll try and uh um sort of put them into the conversation but maybe after an hour we'll have an open uh session where anybody can ask and and if if it gets unmanageable perhaps you cannot buy a me but let's see how that plays out for now we start with uh with opening statements by the panelists i need larry summers to start but he is missing uh so uh ricardo if you are prepared to start at this point perhaps we'll turn to you for your seven minutes uh sure absolutely oh larry's here uh just one time uh larry are you are you there you're a mute okay uh ricardo why don't you start and we'll uh we'll get larry on second okay great uh everyone can hear me yes i hope i guess so well thank you very much for the invitation to be part of this panel uh raghav had asked that in this initial intervention i focus on what some of the domestic trade-offs um are of having a large debt and importantly what have we learned about government spending and debt both looking back as well as looking forward and i wanted to make three points in this international in this initial intervention first on what are the trade-offs for public spending and public debt during a pandemic and a lockdown while the u.s may be looking at the pandemic in the rearview mirror now as vaccination advances it is important keep in mind that this is not the case almost anywhere else in the world france just centered lockdown a couple of weeks ago and many regions in europe are facing a third wave not to mention that most emerging markets will be vaccinated in 2022 in the best case scenario and actually even in the us of course michigan is still peaking and as new strands emerge it may be that more lockdowns are on the horizon i think one trade-off that we learn is not so present is the old classical crowding out trade-off when we have a large aggregate shock of a temporary nature the ability of the government to borrow from the future would allow for instance smoothing seems to be key important both in providing for consumers given gaps in social insurance as well as for employment as the chart in labor market that for instance we're learning about from bob hall and mariana kudlyak earlier made the introduces slow recoveries and finally for firms and sectors as differential effects may may lead to long-term scars instead the trade-off is between the targeting of these not targeting in the microsense but if you want more with a macro goal should one privilege firms in providing support as was in some ways done in europe or should one privilege and firms and keeping existing employment relations or should one privilege households in the unemployed should one have broad policies that send a check to everyone or shouldn't have very targeted ones that only send check to those that are deemed to have been more affected or whose impact of the pandemic will be higher importing those the trade-off between administrative speed and effective targeting as we have learned but importantly during a pandemic and a lockdown the government seems to have a role in stepping in borrowing largely from the future and then worrying more about how the targeting of these is second point is a trade-off in the recovery and here if you want under the broad name of stimulus if you look at the last 12 months and if you only look at agar data you would think that the ricardian model of consumption of recurrent equivalence is just right the government sent checks to people people deposit them in banks banks deposit them at the central bank and the central bank bought government bonds now at each of these steps there were leakages some of the checks were spent some were put in stock markets as opposed to as opposed to deposits than the fed and the fed didn't buy all of the government debt certainly or the central banks are not the fed this is true broadly in advanced economies but it is quite striking how on aggregates if you only looked at aggregates the recurring model wouldn't be too far off government savings were matched by a large increase in private savings and indeed even if you look cross-country the countries in which the governments had larger fiscal packages were also the ones in which savings rates increased more and more persistent and and and likewise the timing of those government borrowing seemed to coincide with the timing of the spikes in savings even if you look at micro data and heterogeneity that certainly places more of a challenge because you see poor households with very large margins consumed that is spending the checks as opposed to saving them in their banks but even then simple simply allowing for borrowing constraints on the poor or just the fact that many of the poor are not going to pay any of the taxes against the transfers they received you would end up with again a representative agent permitting a hypothesis model as saying bob hall seminal work didn't do badly at all rather the main objection is not the micro data say is rather whether these were voluntary savings or not were they indeed safe to pay for future taxes as bob and robert barron many others taught us and milton friedman or rather were they because one was unable to spend that is in many ways the key trade-off that will come up now in the stipula when one talks about stimulus and recovery whenever it talks about stimulus and recovery looking forward it says that the discussion of marginal penalties consume canes in cross-type effects are in some ways not quite the point the the the thing to emphasize those are about marshmallows consume out of income but it's rather the marshmallows consume out of these past savings out of wealth if you want that becomes the crucial uh determinant of what will happen as we move away from the non-riccardian world maybe the required world will just continue but as i think we'll move away from the regarding world in the last few months in the the dominant models that i think we have are those are precautionary savings and in those the prediction of those if you put them in your computer it says that the spending should happen very quickly why because in those models of very strong force of buffer stocks you would want to converge back to your buffer stock of savings but if so that savings will come with a rise of a quite significant rise in real interest rates third trade-off the trade-off in the future of the debt the gap between g and r the growth of the economy and the safe interest rate on government debt is the relevant one if one wants to think about one-off deficit gambles a very large increase in spending that's very short-term and that will be rolled off by buying a long-term bond now note that in the u.s in the uk certainly in europe that is not what happened we did not lock in a long-term interest rate quite on the contrary through quantitative easing we have the material of the us that privately held has become if anything shorter and secondly this was not a one-off deficit gamble as recurrent spending has become the norm and more spending plans are announced now for a current spending that will be rolled over more relevant r minus g or g minus r is rather the gap between the return on private assets and the return on government bonds call this a measure of convenience yields of bubble premiums on the debt of senior age they are driven by safety or the liquidity of government debt by whatever it is they make government bonds special this is the source of revenue on the debt and that is one minute one minute financing the debt will uh will depend on on that and understanding that is the case that then leads to uh some trade-offs of which i will highlight three first that if we are financing recurrent spending that we're rolling over as we certainly seem to be then inflation risk as the one that has risen in the last couple of months is very worrying because it endangers the safety of government debt relative to save real investments the private economy secondly that market freezes in treasuries as happened in the last march or even relatively low coverage in auctions for treasuries has happened just a month ago are particularly worrying because they question the liquidity of the government that and thirdly and still in trade-offs that spending on infrastructure that potentially raises the mars part of capital and therefore leaves the key gap between mpk or m and r the interest rate on that versus the return on private capital well spending for structure has the potential to even if r goes up that m will go up as well thus allowing for the financing through the scam where they're just pure transfers where probably at best just neutral respect to m or the mars power of capital are certainly more worrying so those are the three trade-offs that to get the discussion started to start i think i'm just out of time so i'll stop there thank you very much ricardo uh and for sticking to the time uh next we have larry summers uh larry are you with us i am thank you uh thank you raju thank you for the invitation uh to be here um i have i find what's happened in the last year in terms of fiscal policy to be the most remarkable policy experiment uh that i've ever observed let me just give a little context on my views my views from about 2012 onwards emphasize what i thought was an emerging major macroeconomic issue which was which i called rightly or wrongly secular stagnation but had as its essence that at extremely low real interest rates the nature of private savings behavior and private investment behavior was such that with historically normal fiscal policy the economy was going to struggle to get to full employment and was going to have a deflationary tendency and therefore the large issue for macroeconomic policy was much less containing the excess appetite of central banks to print and the excess aptitude of governments to spend but was to ensure sufficient savings absorption along with microeconomic efficiency and to push us to full employment and i regarded the fact that from the time i said that in 2013 until 2019 we had much more deficit spending than people expected much lower interest rates than people expected much more expansionary monetary policy that people expected and yet slower growth and less inflation than people expected as being broadly corroborative of that set of views that emphasized savings absorption as the problem and in general i felt that pre-existing understandings about fiscal policy needed to be modified both in light of the savings absorption problem and in light of the reality that secularly lower interest rates meant that whatever kind of reasoning produced the master criteria when the real interest rate was five and a half percent needed to be different when the long-term real interest rate was zero with all that pretending never could i have imagined that any set of events would call for fiscal stimulus on the level that we have seen or are now seeing in the united states as a rough approximation the obama stimulus which was derided as too small represented about two and a half percent of gdp in 2009 against the gdp gap that was judged to be six or seven percent in contrast the current stimulus represents 14 of gdp against a gap that is regarded as being in the neighborhood of three or four percent so relative to the gap we are engaged in fiscal stimulus on the order of seven times as large as uh the obama stimulus maybe the obama stimulus was too small probably it was but i'm aware of no credit who suggested that it should have been seven times as large to put the point in a different uh way the usual concept to which we fall short is that fiscal policy might be energetic enough to prevent disposable income from falling at all during recessions the idea that fiscal policy should be sufficiently expansionary so as to lead to large increases in disposable income and i think it's plausible that the disposable income of the bottom fifth of the population will rise by a third this year relative to any pre-covered benchmark was something that was kind of unimaginable and so it seems to me that this is being coincident with extremely expansionary monetary policies on almost any uh measure and so either the kinds of forces associated with secular stagnation arguments depressing private consumption and private investment are going to be operating with extreme force or it seems to me that we will have demand being created in substantial excess of capacity with likely inflationary consequences will they um or we will have some substantial undoing of the current policy path will that take place in the latter part of this year will it take place in the middle of next year i don't think anybody can have a uh confident uh answer but it seems to me that unless one believes that policy is going to be substantially adjusted either because the fiscal policy is going to be phased out very quickly an idea that looks increasingly unlikely every time political leaders explain that what they're most proud of is that they're doing the biggest revolution in policy since the new deal and the great society which is completely inconsistent with the idea that it's going to be phased out very quickly or there is a substantial uh monetary policy adjustment it seems to me that an overheat with substantial consequence either in uh measured in measured product price inflation uh unsustainable asset price inflation or monetary policy adjustment which is likely to take place not smoothly is a very high probability and i have to say that the arguments being made by policymakers that emphasize anchored expectations seem to me almost entirely inconsistent with their constant claims that it is a whole new world of policy with an entirely different rejection of the neoliberal order on the part of macro policy and the new caring and compassionate fed and imf in uh the area of monetary policy i am struck that very dominant to what seems to be a much smaller increase in fiscal policy to meet urgent objectives and a much less accommodating monetary policy during the vietnam war period inflation went from having a one handle in 1966 to a six handle in uh 1969. so i find the choices we're making stunning uh the risks large and the general commentary of the profession with the exception of olivier blanchard in characteristically less vivid ways has said the same kind of thing i just said um but in general i have been amazed that there is not more commentary on along these lines and i'm hoping that somebody's going to explain to me why i'm basically wrong to see this as a huge overshot in uh taking on board the secular stagnation idea and i feel a little bit like somebody who is advocating a minimum wage increase from seven to fourteen dollars or seven to fifteen dollars and then they went and proposed a 22 minimum wage and they didn't know quite what to say because it was kind of in the direction of what they've been saying before but it was just way disproportionate to the problem thank you larry um carmen so raghu i think you you had asked me to talk about uh the risks uh where are we are we approaching the risk uh and primarily to focus uh or or or to focus on on advanced economies so so just as a recap i might i i hope i interpreted that correctly um so um i think i'll start with the observation that uh 15 years ago the consensus view was that sovereign defaults only occurred in emerging markets uh and [Music] at the time i remember having debates when it became clear that the situation in greece uh was one in which was unsolvable without a debt restructuring um that that that view was very much in the minority until it became evident uh that that was the case why do i start that way um i think that the the reason i chose to start that way is never say never um you you asked about risks and and the advanced economies and the advanced economies encompasses uh you know periphery europe and it encompasses the us with the world's reserve currency uh so i think the nature of the risks um first of all are we in the danger zone secondly what are the nature of the risk the nature of the risks is different uh depending uh on where you sit um the idea that you know i i've never embraced the idea that uh high levels of debt are something benign um i think even absent drama even absent a currency crash a default an inflation spike even absent all of that i think high levels of debt uh uh historically at least have not been uh uh associated with with with sustained and i don't mean cyclical ups and down i mean sustained averages over long periods of time high levels of growth so i think for a variety of reasons which uh also include that higher levels of debt um you know uh i think uh at some point um do create uh constraints in in do create constraints for central bank policy they create constraint for responding quickly although certainly what we're seeing is an exception uh to that but in general higher levels of data have been associated with with slower slower responses to to to to amber shocks um and i think we are going to discuss the central bank issue later but uh i would add that if you look at accidents through history um i've not encountered cases of where the concern is our debt is too low uh that that you know that really hasn't uh hasn't come up it's generally you're you're in a in a in a multiple equilibria region you're in a region where bad shocks can pivot you uh in an undesired direction and what what what might those shocks look like um you know i think you know we're we're all used to you know the headline numbers you know italy's very high level of debt and so on but to me going back uh and let me start with periphery europe then i'll work to the u.s very quickly let me start with the observation that ahead of the global financial crisis there were two countries in europe that already before the crisis had debt to gdp above 100 one was greece the other was italy here we are more than two decades later and today the per capita level of income in italy is below below what it was 20 years ago and the same is said for greece that's an outlier and per capita levels of income in the us and other countries are to the order of more than 20 percent higher than where they were to so so let that's that's just on the point of of growth but let me turn to what it might look like what might it look like and here is picks up where uh where where larry left off i think in a high debt world uh central bank responses are going to be constrained and not going to be constrained uh symmetrically meaning uh central banks are going to be much more willing to lower rates if they can then raise them precisely because of the concern that uh you have very highly indebted countries uh and very highly leveraged private sectors as well so from both uh the cost of uh you know the potential cost of financing and from a financial stability i think the the the nature of the game has only has not only changed for fiscal policy for but for monetary policy and i think that that that is likely to impart a uh an inflation bias uh in central banks i've noted in the past that the heyday of central bank independence was not accidentally taking place after the inflation surge in the advanced economies at a period in which actually levels of public debt had gone down to their uh post-war world war ii lows so that's one type of risk the other type of risk which is more germane to the in the advanced economies and for the us i think one of the things that gives the us quite a bit of rope uh to have done what it's doing uh is the fact that very it as far as i'm concerned there are no viable alternatives to the us dollar as as a reserve currency so the rest of the world is you know willing to to to buy a lot of uh us debt that that can mitigate things that we can talk about the triffin dilemma uh perhaps in the q a and revisit the triffin dilemma the modern triffen dilemma uh which is sort of a day of reckoning in which uh the rest of the world uh doesn't have to reject the dollar it never did in the last round but scales back uh and that can be a currency crash and currency crashes which have happened and did happen uh can can also add to to the inflation story that's one type of risk and i'll stop on the more classic risk which is a replay on a grander scale of what we saw after the global financial crisis uh you know greece ireland and portugal combined have a level of gdp that is smaller uh than uh italy and italy and spain certainly um i would add and just i'll stop right here that if the underlying levels of debt for for uh italy for example um which you know uh has already you know uh a uh debt of about 157 percent uh and for spain debt of about 118 these dona and i have no time to go in detail here um these don't include even the target 2 balances which is an iou it's debt from central bank to central bank from the bank of spain to the bundesbank from the bank of italy and those are running to the tune of 40 percent of gdp for spain so 118 becomes over 150 uh and uh almost 30 for italy let me stop there that does you know that does pose the risk of more of a uh you know a scenario on a grander scale uh of what we saw after the global financial crisis so there are different kinds of risks for for the us and different kinds of risks for uh periphery uh eurozone thank you thank you carmen uh so let's go through a few rounds of questions then i'll come to the people who've raised their hands and i'm taking a note of who's who's raising hands uh larry i want to take off on your your point that the profession itself has expressed little surprise i mean here's a pandemic which is obviously tragic in its effects the human toll continues to be felt every day but you wouldn't know seeing the growth forecast for the united states you know tremendously strong for this year uh of course virus willing so have we found a new tool to deal with downturns massive government spending with the easy monetary policy where everyone is happy uh you know except perhaps those who've slipped through the cracks corporations are happy banks are happy even the imf is happy and is saying only uh don't stop too soon just keep continuing uh and and uh don't end abruptly so we've achieved the economist's dream of painless downturns uh what's what's different i mean why is it that this is happening now is it that this is a different kind of animal from a normal recession and therefore these these tools might work is it that the political economy of spending now is different because of uh you know the uh the issues in the united states but also the nature of the pandemic or is it something else i mean you're obviously suggesting this is not going to be an effective tool but why did why did we embrace this and why is there so much consensus behind it the answer you can answer your question at many levels raghu uh just first a fact that might be helpful uh the shortfall in labor income compensation of workers um estimated relative to a pre-covered trend is on the order of 20 billion dollars a month you might argue that it's as of now you might argue that it was 30 billion a month you might include some proprietors income but we're in the 20 or 30 billion dollars a month as the shortfall obviously going down through the year as the economy recovers against that 20 to 30 billion dollar shortfall we are putting 2.8 trillion dollars or about four or uh whatever that whatever that is about 250 billion dollars a month now in part the in part that's because we're in part the stimulus is the reason why the shortfall was projected but the main thing to understand is that the stimulus is vastly disproportionate to the lost income uh from cove it is much more than the amount of income that is being lost so household incomes the lower you are the more true this is household incomes are vastly greater in 2021 than anybody could have expected them to be before uh coving so we're doing something quite disproportionate my main view is that we're making a mistake why are we making the why are we making the mistake um some of it is that it hasn't been a great period for conventional sound economic advice um that's why we got donald that's part of why we got donald trump uh elected that's the lesson many people prove from the financial crisis so you know as as i said in a different context uh many years ago it's not an accident that there are no quack cures for broken arms uh or strep throat and there are a lot of quack cures for cancer and for the common cold and so when orthodoxy doesn't produce outcomes that people like there's a tendency to gravitate to unorthodoxy and sometimes that unorthodoxy is right i think the there has been a complete failure to impart a quantitative dimension to the discussion of economic policy what has stunned me about the administration's rhetoric frankly about paul krugman's rhetoric and discussion of these issues is that there are no arguments made in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar package that would not also be arguments for a five trillion dollar factory for a ten trillion dollar uh package there are qualitative arguments for taking a much more keynesian approach than we have taken in the past and i anybody's listened to me at these conferences over the last 30 years knows that i've usually been on the side of taking a significantly more uh keynesian approach i don't how could i turn out to be what how could this turn out to be wrong and what i'm saying turn out to be wrong and there's a fantasy it could turn out that the economy has vastly greater potential that we have been the demand creates its own supply and that vast increases in demand will call forth vast increases along some kind of highly elastic aggregate supply curve without uh without supply to believe that you have to believe that either there's been a productivity miracle in the last two years or that in 2019 when the unemployment rate was three and a half percent we were operating way below capacity that's so that it could be the case that the economy has been much more secularly stagnant for much longer than i dared to suggest previously and that big increases in demand are therefore just what the doctor orders it could be this is probably the best defense of current policy that we can't really manage the fiscal policies that are appropriate on an ongoing basis because the austerity advocates are too strong so but if we just give people huge amounts of money this year they'll spend it gradually over the next 10 years and so we'll get the spending expansion that we need and that the only politically feasible way is to link it to an emergency albeit disproportionately um and emerge uh an emergency that would be a story for understanding this but i don't understand the rest of it and i also don't understand why in a country that has all the problems the united states has the major high priority use of a trillion and a half dollars in resources should be improving the balance sheet position of the household second which is the argument being made by people who advocate this plan on the grounds that the multiplier will in fact be low so you don't have to worry about over and this will improve the balance sheet my question would be wouldn't we be better off improving the infrastructure wouldn't we be better off with a set of investment activities so those are some reactions to what you've asked ricardo just taking off from uh what larry just just said uh you know you've talked about prioritizing spending uh i mean clearly we've spent the initial dollops of money um you know to prevent scarring making up balance sheet losses both for firms and households and of course there are some new welfare programs which have been initiated ostensibly temporary but but may be more permanent now what else uh do we need to spend on we have the investment both in human capital as well as in in physical capital coming down the line uh we have potential uh stimulus uh uh there is also uh perhaps spending needs uh you know for protecting against climate change uh for changing the economy to a green economy how would you prioritize amongst these and do you think that we have enough room to do everything let me answer that while also responding a little bit to what larry as well as carmen said earlier adding some i mean in part in my initial intervention i well from a very different perspective from larry already partly answered that question i already said that you know looking forward at the stimulus what i call the second trade-off more than thinking in terms of npcs out of income it's really about the mpcs out of the household balance sheet as i said i think the type of models that explain the increase in the balance sheet that we've seen whether one takes a more buffer stock model the world or even a more recurring model of the world neither of them justify a large increase in household balance sheets going forward and both predict indeed there will be potentially a very large amount of spending coming soon so even if i'm coming at it from a very different angle i think from what larry did i end up i think finishing in the same spot which is it is hard to justify why giving checks or to the household balance sheet um would be important now whereas as i noted as well um win-win looks instead from a sustainability of the debt perspective which was again the different very different perspective from what larry used but which i use in my intervention it also seems that thinking about how to increase the marginal part of capital in the economy if indeed interest rates are about to rise and i think that's a possibility even if secular stagnation continues to be the true but even if solely because of the stimulus and other developments we have some increase in interest rates then i would be really focusing on on things that increase the margin of capital because otherwise the us following a little more carmen said can itself find itself in some fiscal trouble so it would be things i would be focused on gaps which on marginal part of capital maybe that's infrastructure maybe not again we can discuss the different ones and climate being a potential example of that so that would be kind of my immediate response what you said which is that i i started and use a very different frame of mind than what larry did in my intervention related to his but we do end up actually perhaps surprising perhaps not in a very similar prescription uh when it comes to the near future now i wanted though to likewise though comment on two things both your question to larry as well as karma's intervention first is the world different so larry answer to you in the sense of policy let me answer instead from a perspective of economic models if you want which i think given our audience some people at least will appreciate um i used to think of business cycles or i think the way in which we treat about business cycles and there's some trend level of output and there are some fluctuations around it the goal of counter cyclical stabilization policy is to diminish the amplitude of those fluctuations but modeling them as if you want brownian motion type shocks or um to a trend line with more or less reversal depending on what you we may discuss was roughly what then policy was about was diminishing amplitude i think if you look at the last 20 now plus years we see on the one hand great moderation the volatility quarter quarter your tier is lower risk crashes hap sorry recessions happen much more infrequently but when they happen they're now much bigger we had a great financial crisis 10 years ago and now we had a great pandemic if i was to do a simple time series model of output now i would have a constant again trend and every so often a poisson shock not a brownian motion shock now we learned i think 2010 from the research after that that understanding the non-linearities that come with poisson as opposed to smooth brown continuous path smooth battery motion shocks can actually be quite different we understood that the responses may be different i think also with this pandemic we'll also understand that that in a sense the impact things like precautionary savings the impact of large shocks on balance sheets of of uh of uh households and how different sectors are affected i think will be important so i do think that our policy prescriptions change having said that again i don't think they change to justify what's being done in the recent past but i do think they change i think that's a big challenge to the many participants in this conference is that i think the way we'll model those fluctuations should change somewhat and think more in terms of large infrequent shocks rather than recurrent fluctuations and then thirdly um on what carmen said i would i really want to emphasize something she said which is the the sometimes um the great belief that the treasuries us treasuries and the dollar are the supreme pillar safe financial asset in international financial architecture i think in some ways we've grown to not question that in any way um but i think looking forward and i think the last 12 months have really at least to me shaken that belief that that is the not just a stable equilibrium but the only possible equilibrium we did see we have seen fail some small cracks in the treasury market showing that the plumbing and treasuries is somewhat more fragile than we thought we have seen that the foreign demand for treasuries usually i was i always thought you know in a crisis you have flight to safety money flows into the u.s treasuries money has flown out of u.s treasury in the last nine months justify versus the fema reaper facility and others at the fed but more generally it's continued to flow out we're used to seeing well domestically there's always robust demand and yet what we've seen is the fed absorbing more than half of the supply of trash in the last few years that u.s governments in the tradition of alexander hamilton are always about being very fiscally responsible i think we've seen and talking immediately about how we're going to adjust for excess spending we're not seeing much of that and finally fifth that unlike what happened 10 years ago when there was no alternative to the us dollar in part because the euro and ecb had responded in a way that made the use of the euro more difficult given the sovereign debt crisis as well as for instance the delay that the ecb had in in extending swap lines unlike the us what we see now is that an rmb that was zero is now four or five percent and is um fighting certainly for some part of international payments at different times uh we see the euro we saw the ecb extending swap planes and others in a way that tries to create the euro safe asset so there's now some alternatives more importantly ragu and to conclude that point let me be clear maybe the right policies for the u.s i think they are were to run very large deficits and for the perspective of the u.s wealth for inflation output um the it has been doing what is right and using the treasury market as it should but i do recall or at least my economic history points me to what happened around 1970 around the collapse of red and woods uh when likewise following the vietnam war the u.s pursued domestic priorities and that led to a shake-up a change in transformational system note that 1970s did not mean that the dollar stopped being central and so i'm not in any way say the dollar is about star being central but it started being central in a very different way in post-bred woods than pre-renwoods and i do wonder whether um in line with what carmen was saying that there's so many there are many cracks in international finance architecture and that the role of treasury in the dollar may be itself for a change in the next few years carmen uh i want to you mentioned central banks and there's a lot of belief that you know this new uh cooperation between the treasury and the central banks will also play out as interest rates start rising whether for inflationary reasons or because real interest rates are moving up somehow market participants are looking at the central banks as intervening yet again in in long-term interest rates and expecting that they will stay on hold uh you know even as they see inflation pick up and many of them have said that we will be patient what's your sense will have central banks got enough independence that they will break at the right time and then to ricardo's earlier point that you know part of how the central banks intervene if they intervene directly in markets to keep long rates down expanding their balance sheet is really by shortening the effective maturity of the consolidated debt of the central bank and and the government doesn't that have risks of its own uh maybe not when the central bank has 20 of government debt but when it starts getting to 30 40 50 doesn't that expose the uh the consolidated balance sheet much more to increase the interest rates and perhaps a negative dynamic so this is really a question to ask you to find more broadly on central banks so um let me uh start with the uh where we're also where ricardo left off uh on the issue of of the dollar and and this will take me to to the fed and the central banks in general um look even assuming the dollar perhaps i didn't make this clear even assuming the dollar remains the reserve currency that it it is not supplanted by something else um we've had spectacular crashes in the dollar before uh and and and you know the breakdown of britain woods um in effect you know this goes to your question directly uh raghu uh what was the role of the central bank the idea that central bank treasury cooperation is a new phenomenon is is kind of fiction right i mean um of course during world war ii you had uh ceilings and these ceilings on long bonds uh persisted into the 50s i remember people saying wow when the boj introduced the ceiling on the long bond that's that's that's a new one uh no it's not new and in a fed in effect um the the issue uh that larry mentioned that you you know when certain unconventional things conventional things don't work as well you start to get more unconventional um everyone remembers the 1951 fed treasury accord as the establishment of real central bank independence what people do not remember and i've alluded to this i it's it's also in my paper the liquidation of government debt um is that in 51 uh at the time of the accord um both the fed and the treasury were very preoccupied with the fact that the u.s still had a very high level of debt from legacy of world war ii the economy has started to pick up an interest rates short-term interest rates had started to pick up and this is germaine to also your comment about maturities part the lesser-known part and you can check out the minutes uh of the accord was actually a debt conversion uh in which short-term uh treasury held by the fed were converted to a 29 and a half year bond non-marketable bond uh so you know i think this but this goes to the issue that fed fed treasury coordination persisted under the even keel policy for a very long time the bottom line i am suggest is suggesting is that i am not looking for a change the journey on central bank independence but the fact though absolutely uh and de facto i think we started down that route uh in in around the global financial crisis when really monetary policy became more and more uh like uh fiscal policy with redistributive effects and i hope we do get a chance to talk about taxes because you know we talk about inflation on one hand as as you know or or we you know the consequences of high debt being inflation or austerity in the end you know debt is being always brought down by one form of tax or another whether it's the inflation tax or more orthodox taxes but i'd like to talk a little bit uh more about that perhaps later on well we have a fairly limited time before we go to question so i want to give you the opportunity and then if you can spend a couple of minutes let's keep the next round of answers short how do we bring down this debt where you know we certainly have massive levels of debt in on government balance sheets but private data has also gone up corporate debt gone up by about 10 percent across the world 10 to gdp over the course of the pandemic household debt by about five to six percent so massive increases in debt how does this get down other than through inflation so uh look look look raghu uh what is the menu the menu is in the best of worlds you grow your way out of it uh you know this is the scenario where of what larry was saying what could be the surprise that that all of its own you know potential growth is a lot higher and then we grow our way out of it i don't attach a high probability uh to that being the major uh driver of reduction the second is uh we stopped acting like in the u.s like we've acted over the last few decades and actually do something closer to at the end of the war uh which is we run balanced budgets for a while and even with some growth and modest inflation you know that that starts to work down but that also importantly involves taxes um so that i think it's a tax story rather than a reversal uh a draconian reversal in expenditures um then you know you uh have the inflation tax which by the way is very regressive because you know lower income households don't hedge the way that or don't have the capacity to hedge uh the way uh higher income households inflation is a tax financial repression is a tax uh which i think it's not that we will use i think we've been using it for for over a decade it is a transfer from savers to borrowers and specifically attacks on bondholders and finally my point about periphery europe debt restructuring debt restructuring is a tax it's a haircut on the bondholders or you know the creditors but they're all taxes uh so that's the summary of how i think the end game uh what the combination of orthodox versus less orthodox taxes are but but it's all about taxes yeah it is interesting this issue of higher revenues there's a lot of faith that whatever is implemented now will stick but of course we could have a change in administration certainly a change in congress and and then uh you know the question is how much these these tax raising measures persist um larry uh i want to just shift uh a little bit from the u.s just to bring in the rest of the world you recently worked on a report on on debt around the world and relief measures and so on what is your sense on where the rest of the world is and what can be done both by multilateral institutions as well as in debt relief i think the world is the world has lucked out on uh debt over the last year the industrial world boomed much more than people expected risk appetites came up back much more quickly and so the wave of defaults that many people feared uh did not get better the basic reality of the international debt architecture that uh more of the holdings are by private bond holders who set up their holdings so they can't be negotiated with more of the debt is held by the chinese who don't participate in the existing international fora and more of the debt is quasi-government guaranteed private debt or local currency debt in the developing countries means that if we were to have another serious period of emerging market financial distress i do not think we have a remotely satisfactory architecture for working it through with uh any uh speed uh at all there is a deep tension in this area that planning for defaults it is widely feared probably correctly will encourage the faults and make defaults more likely and so nobody wants to do it the borrowers don't want to do it because they don't want to pay the higher interest rates and the creditors don't want to do it because they don't want to encourage the defaults and so everybody kind of pretends that there aren't going to be defaults and it's allowed a little bit you know it's handled in the same way that kidnapping policy is handled nobody wants to establish policies for paying ransom in time of kidnapping and the same philosophy operates these are defaults for more or less the same reason but it's a big problem and i would say the single biggest global financial gap that i see is actually something different but i'll take this moment to say for 10 billion dollars a year the world could materially reduce the probability of there being another cobit epidemic in the next 20 years my sense is that the return time for covet-type epidemics is on the order of 15 years that we probably could make it 25 to 30 years for 10 billion dollars a year and that we are not on a path to allocating those uh funds as a global system and that would be my single biggest priority if i were making policy at the spring imf world bank meeting thanks uh let me go to the audience questions and uh perhaps uh um you know uh bob uh you're first on bob hall okay thank you um so thinking about larry's review of u.s uh fiscal policy um uh first of all it seems kind of obvious that the huge uh expansion of aid to to families uh has demonstrated that the marginal propensity to consume under those conditions is way lower than we thought um the evidence for that is it didn't didn't trigger you know what you should have but it didn't trigger the the big expansion that larry's so concerned about um so yeah it's used to me that let me finish larry let me finish so in terms of where the u.s economy is today uh judged by unemployment which is generally regarded as the best measure of the cyclical stance we have uh 4.9 unemployment among people who don't have jobs and 1.1 among people who do have jobs that 1.1 is going to continue to decline and it's been declining and that'll no longer unemployment of people with jobs they're getting they're getting their jobs back um that leaves us kind of in the middle uh in terms of how you rank unemployment of 4.9 percent a number which is likely to continue to decline but very slowly so the basic reading that we we're at i believe the natural unemployment rate of which is currently about 4.9 so so there's no sign of there's no sign of the the tightness in the economy that would trigger inflation that larry's concerned about yet the fed is wisely adopted a policy of saying well if this inflation's going to come around for once let's wait to until it actually happens um and i think that's uh that's smart um but but since since the expan fiscal expansion of the the uh debt handing handing large amounts of the debt to individual households doesn't seem to gain anything uh but it does obviously tie our hands for the future uh in terms of what's appears now to be a a completely unsustainable growth of debt if you look at if you look at the cbo's projections of debt it is it just goes off to and that's obviously not sustainable the the big concern that i would have is there so far just tiny trembles of of lack of faith in the us's ability to repay its debt but uh keep your eye on that uh ricardo mentioned that um but certainly it's certainly the thing to watch out now is is the world losing its faith in the us's ability to to pay off all this debt larry then ricardo so you call me yeah uh you want to respond to that yeah sure um look bob i the question is i i'm surprised that you're so confident lots of people are predicting seven percent growth this year i wouldn't have expected if we're at the natural rate now yeah then i would think after we had seven percent growth this year and four or five percent growth next year that would be pretty problematic we get ourselves to a pretty problematic uh place maybe the fed will raise rates sooner because it'll seedy inflation and achieve a so-called soft uh landing maybe the the idea that the fiscal policy is ending therefore we're going to have lots of contraction next year doesn't really work if your theory is that the fiscal policy is mostly not getting spent and is going to spend get spent over time i agree with something ricardo said ricardo emphasized and i don't think the profession is well calibrated on this um how should you think about fiscal how should you think about households that receive checks this year and don't spend them should you think on one extreme well that's going to be wealth and the marginal propensity to consume is five percent out of wealth or should you think in some buffer stock uh kind of way or some de-leveraging and then re-leveraging kind of way that it's going to be that that marginal propensity is going to be more like 20 or 25 my hunch more informed as a hunch from anecdotes than from uh optimizing models is in line with ricardo's buffer stock model that you're going to have a pretty high propensity to consume so it seems to me that i would have expected that we wouldn't have inflation yet and that we're going to have the mother of all booms for the next 18 months to two years and that that's likely to generate some kind of inflation and uncontrolled uh breaking and i i i've argued in the past that the fed should avoid being preemptive with respect to inflation but god with 18 uh with with this kind of um boom forecast i mean i'll give you a i'll give you a bet that's available um markets are saying that the odds are about 1 in 15 that the 10 year will be above 3 um one year from now i would have thought the odds were about one in three you've left out something critically important and you mentioned these uh uh forecasts of growth but there a major supply shock is impending and you're you've left out supply shocks from your analysis there's nothing about growth i'm not sure what the major supply shock exactly is uh i'm assuming that contrary to all the talk about scarring that potential growth the potential in the fourth quarter of this year will be three and a half to four percent above where potential was two years prior just before covid in the fall of 2019. so yes if if the view is that kovitz got us all using zoom and so it's induced a major positive productivity shell i am leaving that out i'm leaving it out if you think that by killing a lot of zombie firms covet has produced a major supply shot but i'm assuming supply shocks at the level of eliminating a hundred percent of the scarring from code ricardo you want to come in i wanna yeah i wanna pick up on the inflation thing that came up in bob when he said well i think the fed is doing the right thing or at least waiting for it to happen and that's come up also a couple of times in the in the discussion so far um so let me let let me try to describe what i think about inflation or how i look at inflation right now i mean we have to start from the fact that we have 20 years of a capital earned hardly earned with great sacrifice if you run by central banks that has made inflation expectations certainly longer place rotations be essentially anchored at two percent plus white noise if you want now start from that well then let's look at our four leading theories or for our three leading theories of where inflation will come first the philips curve view of the world well with inflation stations this will anchor then we have a very static phillips-like phillips curve and then it will be whether the output boom leads to inflation and on that i think many estimates on the slope of the phillips curve are relatively flat so not a lot would come in the short run but if there's an increase in inflation that can precisely lead households to wake up from their rational attention of the last 20 years or they've stopped paying attention to inflation um we've stopped having any kind of wage indexing in the economy or not and start upgrading to do that and we would shift from the static phillips curve to an acceleration as phillips curve in which case inflation once it increases then increases in a accelerationist path and then becomes very hard to stop as we learn for instance post 1970s second year of inflation a more monitors theory as i said earlier now we have uh households depositing very large amounts of the central bank at the sorry at banks who in turn upon central bank and which they potentially will be withdrawing in the next few months now if they're withdrawing and turning them into spending or end or investment in other normal assets but in particular if inflation expect inflation continues to be all anchored well not much velocity fell a lot velocity will increase some but not much inflation but if there is again a perception inflation is on the rise the withdrawal of deposits in nominal terms and banks will will mean putting them instead into real assets and as substitution from nominal to real happens then we will have again inflation increasing and increasing in ways that are accelerating third fiscal dominance theories of inflation based on fiscal dominance and karma's already touched on these the key question there is if inflation increases somewhat will the central bank raise interest rates as it has convinced us it always will or instead as carmen was noting well but look at history whenever debt is very high central banks are very weary of raising interest rates they're much more happy to put ceilings on interest rates not raise them at all now i'm certainly i don't know what will happen i will note that certainly the statements from the federal reserve bomb as well as from the cb and from the bank of england so not to pick just on the fed are the most dovish i've seen in 30 40 years of reading statements i mean there's barely any statement of inflation when anyone ever brings up inflation in a in in the press conference nowadays they're told why i talk about inflation let's talk about unemployment and inequality and whatnot so we do seem to see a lot of dovishness there so while i agree uh that yes we shouldn't put on the brakes too early i think that's a mistake that's very often done and that while inflation conditions are anchored that is the right thing to do across all the main tiers of inflation that i care in my mind as well as across i think what is the historical record in the empirical evidence the key is to see when inflation nations become unanchored and once they do they are very hard to bring down for the fiscal reasons for the monetarist reasons and for the philips curve reasons carmen carmen i want to give you the the last word because we're running out of time one moment yeah it's just marty uh this is such a terrifically interesting session that if the panelists and you are happy to go on a little longer we are certainly happy to allow that to happen uh so i would not want to prematurely you know give it another five minutes or something if that's okay let's let's go for another five minutes we'll take another question after this let me just give carmen the chance to talk about two things one maybe respond a little to what ricardo said if you want to amplify on that and second you know one uh set of countries which have been left out of this whole debate are the developing countries as chief economist for the world bank would you want to talk a little bit about their situation right now okay so one thing that i'd like to mention in the discussion also just before turning to that very quickly uh we've talked a lot or heard a lot about the fiscal impulse the monetary impulse um i was surprised to hear larry thinks there is no scarring uh you know we do have substantial uh forbearance policies on the financial side that are temporary some of those debts are going to have to be repaid uh i think there's a lot of small and medium businesses where we are grossly underestimating the number of bankruptcies and so on so uh the what i'm throwing out there is i think there is the the view that we're in for an upsurge i think that's not being debated i think how sustainable that of surge is uh i do question and i do question it on the grounds of some other financial fragilities that i think will be legacy coded but let me turn uh to to i want to bring up the issue of uh especially the emerging markets in developing countries this is uh the discussion we we we we are having here would be the envy of any country to be discussing this you know oh are we gonna overheat so that inflation goes up what they're seeing is actually uh you know um inflation going up in many cases with um you know very negative growth prospects um you know the issue the issues are many but uh about half of the low-income countries entered uh covid uh with already pre-existing debt problems at the moment more than half of them are either in debt distress or quickly approaching it i think the bottom line ragu is that um you know the the the recovery and and and i i thought the the larry's report in the group of 30 did an excellent job on and and i agree with like 99 of it on the on the dealing with the debt side i think dealing with the debt side is filled with hurdles i don't see that getting you know the debt overhang for for the developing and emerging getting resolved soon so i think the the growth the the balance towards lower growth and higher inflation i think the canary in the coal mine on inflation is going to be in the uh uh emerging market developing countries here let me stop there let me uh take uh the questions uh if we have three people who want to ask questions michelle alp and mervyn if you could ask your questions as succinctly as possible then we can just open it up for a last round of responses from the panelists so michelle yeah so my question was on so larry pointed out to the unusually large stimulus and there was some debate on sort of the what the point of the stimulus isn't working and so i was wondering wasn't part of the purpose of these checks also in some sense for political economy reasons so we're closing lots of businesses we're telling restaurants and hotels um to just stay closed we need people to adhere to all these social distancing policies so aren't we in some sense buying um the ability you know that all peop that everyone is participating in this with all this money so on these policies isn't one benefit of the policies also basically lower infection rates and hence we basically say you know bought a lot of or um lives with the money so it's a very different kind of stimulus so i was wondering what people's thoughts were on this yeah i think the political economy of the stimulus is fascinating right trying to figure out why exactly under the these circumstances help so it's a question uh for larry it's related to what she has said so uh one driving force behind secular stagnation is rising inequality it has grown and weighs a greater demand down and i think it is every reason to think that it will keep growing from what we know from labor economics now if you take the view that that is a key driver of secular stagnation and if you add on top of that the fact that the pandemic hit low income households harder for a variety of reasons and finally if you also add that these packages have big relief and redistribution elements they distribute to low income people does that change your view on the social value of these packages as well as how they might affect aggregate demand over a longer horizon especially if households use them to build up their balances they might not be the ideal solution but seems to me that they help at the margin if that's your that's a key driver or secure signature mervin i think it helps to think about the particular shock that we've experienced the office of budget responsibility in the uk had a very interesting chart where they plotted the movement over the last year or so of aggregate demand gdp and a separate line on the chart for potential output if you look very closely at the chart you can just about see some small differences between the two lines but very little so if aggregate demand and potential output have been falling sharply then recovering then falling again and are expected to rise again in tandem larry must be right in saying what is the case for a large fiscal stimulus or indeed a large monetary stimulus to try to close that gap which is probably relatively small so larry's point about the mismatch must surely be right if you look back at the way that europe handled it you could explain the very large deficits in terms of transfer payments from taxpayers at large to businesses to enable them to maintain paying wages even though revenue had fallen to zero because of government decisions to shut down parts of the economy so during the period of restrictions i think it's very easy to explain why you get large budget deficits once you end the restrictions and come out of that period it's very difficult to justify the scale of fiscal stimulus or indeed monetary stimulus to which larry has rightly drawn attention er steve davis if he's still there he had raised his hand sometime ragu mike thanks my question's already been covered okay so let's then go back to the panelists starting with garmin and uh in reverse order we land with larry carmen last closing remarks so uh look i i i think that the pandemic will leave uh different kinds of scarring and i am not uh not really sure on what the supply side may look like but as i noted earlier i think you know uh the inflation can come about because of overheating but inflation can also come about because of central banks drag their feet uh and react slowly and the markets basically lead them by the nose which was um the experience of the 60s um so i i think because the uh world at large i mean what we're seeing is sticking to the theme of debt is you know you buy uh an antique um tea cup and it's tiny and then they get bigger in the post-war and now we drink tea out of buckets that are uh the mugs and and this is what's happening with that the the the both in the advancing in the emerging world the pandemic has left us with a much higher legacy of debt and as i noted earlier i do think that that does constrain uh policy so you know my own view is is not is not a particularly optimistic one i have concerns about the sustainability of the recovery uh and i have concerns that we are going to be shifting to uh higher inflation higher tax rates uh and and and more uh um you know uh a a a sustained sort of muddling through uh environment that that that we will be uh in that mode and in that mode uh accidents one one becomes more accident-prone that's the multiple equilibria uh of being in a vulnerability region thank you carmen uh ricardo i wanted to follow what michelle said which i thought um was uh that's right and very insightful but there's both a benevolent and a malevolent way to think about that political economy the benevolent one is to link what just happened in the last 12 18 months to what happens whenever there's a world war or even just a large war that's exactly what we say we send the young men and nowadays we send the young women as well to war we accumulate a large amount of debt to tell them you're not going to be taxed by having fought the swore we're going to pay for this over the next 30 years future generations will pay you for the peace we've left us that's the benevolent perspective and as you said it justifies having a large amount of debt and i would add by the way that if indeed our star psychostagnation forces and is linking a little bit to what alpha's saying and inequality numbers persist then we can perhaps live with 120 130 percent of debt that gdp in the u.s that's only gradually brought down without any large increase in tax or inflation so i'd have a more optimistic view than say what carmen does note though that even with that benevolent view that requires looking forward that we have a sustainability plan for paying that debt when one looks at the end of world war ii or any other large war what sees a clear distinction between countries that either are like the us post world war ii with sustained balanced budgets with a clear plan on how to pay this over 10 20 or 30 years and one sees many other countries that did not go that way that did not have the plan to do it and as a result and or are unable to convince markets and investors that would be the case and they'd end up having very troublesome debt crisis times much more like what karma was describing in the years following a war now that's the benevolent view the malevolent view of michelle is that that story that the current generation must be rewarded for the sacrifices it's doing either response for shock or because uh there's a great structural transformation going on that will pay great dividends is exactly the story of every latin american country in the 1980s and 90s that ended up with hyperinflation it's always that the story that the current generation we're doing reform we're fighting communism we're starting a new regime we're moving in some way we're going to accumulate a lot of debt this is just like a war it's a dividend that will be paid and then you know again without any plan to regularize public finances you end up with a crash thank you thanks ricardo for those uh hopefully not prescient remarks uh larry um thank you uh thank you and thank you for the discussion i won't respond to mervyn since he agreed with me uh in uh what he said other than to say that i agreed uh with him with respect to michelle's question michelle that's why i was your reasoning was part of why i was wildly enthusiastic about the stimulus package last year if you look at the stimulus package this year versus the amount of staying home that people wanted to purchase um or could sensibly have wanted to purchase i don't think you can explain a large part of the 2.8 trillion dollars on the basis of your kind of organs uh al i agree with uh your basic point as part of what i always talked about as regards secular stagnation and in a way you're saying something i said which is if all this works well what it will prove is that the secular stagnation forces were much greater than i dared to imagine uh that they would be and that is certainly a uh a possible uh outcome i would highlight the tension between the in the discussion of this uh the administration can't quite decide whether it thinks that these are temporary measures so you shouldn't worry about inflation or whether these are the most important revolution in social policy since the new deal they can't very well have it both i think it's worth remembering because people don't that child credits to children in poverty represent one and a half percent of the 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus i think they're a fine idea on social policy grounds i'm in favor of it it's fine but to allow the whole thing to be seen uh that way is i think a uh complete uh is i think a complete uh error um could uh so that basically where i'm on that i guess uh the last thing i thought ricardo's um summary of you could have any different theory of inflation and you still should be worried was uh exactly to the point that i had gone through exactly the same kind of reasoning myself i don't understand why people who are aware of the vietnam war experience and who listen to the declarations that it's a whole new era at the fed imf and in social policy should think that expectations will be anchored uh for a long time everything that is being said about the posture of policy in the united states is about how this isn't a war after which we're going to return to normal but is instead a new normal for the first time in history we have a fed whose rhetoric is no longer directed at preempting inflation but is directed at preempting the idea that it might get afraid of inflation and that seems to me to be a quite scary thing and finally i i want to associate myself with uh something ricardo said about the right way to understand uh fluctuations my almost totally unread brookings paper in 1989 with brad delong basically made a very similar point the literature on plucking makes the point and the way i like to make the point is to say suppose you were given a time series on the body temperature of a human being what would the right way to analyze it one way would be to look at a lot of cyclical components there was a daily component there was the monthly uh component there was the secular component there were a lot of things another way to look at it would be that there were these periodic spikes upwards that were hard to understand that could be grouped into several different syndromes that produced upward spikes and you could think about how to contain them but there was no particular notion of a downward spike that was parallel to the notion of an upward uh spike and that the job was to figure out how to contain the episodes that produced the upward spikes i think that is the way the science of medicine proceeds to our go to our great good fortune and i think the study of macroeconomic policy around short-term fluctuations should have that orientation rather than the orientation we have been misguided to towards uh focus on the second moment and uh towards uh variances i think that's what you were trying to capture ricardo with your reference to croissant events uh rather than cycles but think about the unemployment rate in the way you would think about the fever on chart will i think lead us to be more fruitful and useful in the future
