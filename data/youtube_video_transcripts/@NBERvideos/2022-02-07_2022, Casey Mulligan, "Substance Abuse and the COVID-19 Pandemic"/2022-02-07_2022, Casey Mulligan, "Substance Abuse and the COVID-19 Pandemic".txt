you know the paper topic is a bit morbid but as an empirical science you know we we look at what's actually happening in people even if it is a bit unpleasant so the basic data in the paper are from the center for disease control's online tool for tabulating death certificates you can look at the underlying cause of death on those certificates as well as other contributing factors cited on them now suicides are included in this picture figure two from the paper uh you might say no news is good news with that series which i divided by three just to keep it out of the way of the others which are going to be the focus of the paper but also we may think about these other series differently when we know that suicides did not increase in 2020 and 2021. the other series are drug and alcohol related the green series shows deaths from alcohol-induced causes which includes acute alcohol poisoning but also deaths from chronic alcohol related liver disease by by the cdc's convention it does not include drunk driving accidents although their tool does permit you to tabulate those separately the black and blue series here are deaths with drugs found separately for findings of narcotics and findings of psychotropics narcotic deaths are almost all involving opioids of one type or another although technically narcotics also includes cocaine lsd and cannabis as well deaths involving psychotropic drugs are primarily involved what's commonly known as crystal meth you could add the three drug and alcohol series to get a total now if you did that some of the death certificates would get counted twice because they cite instances of both narcotics and meth but others would be missing because together a number of certificates only cite unspecified drug so in fact the two the too close to cancer for the purpose of calculating total death certificates and if you're wondering only a tiny fraction very tiny fraction of the death certificates here cite covet 19 is one of the multiple factors my purpose is a bit different which is to look at substance demand so if somebody participates both in a narcotics market and a meth market i want to recognize their demand in both the markets it's well known that drug and alcohol deaths were increasing before 2020. less known but important for my purposes is that these deaths have a significant seasonal pattern so that figure two in the paper includes dash series that show trends and seasonals estimated with data through 2019 and not beyond that and the paper focuses on the gaps between the solid and the dash which are historically unprecedented and really large enough to show up in macro measures of health and longevity the paper begins with the demand model which i calibrate from studies conducted before the pandemic there's one demand function for each of the three substances taking the income effect by itself i assume the same percentage for each of the three alcohol has its own price changes which i relate to the shifting of drinking from bars and restaurants where alcohol is expensive to home where alcohol is much cheaper on a per gallon basis that shift is less relevant for dangerous illegal drugs for them i focus on the full price which is the sum of the money price and an opportunity costs consuming these types of drugs uses up time to acquire administer and especially recover a lot of overdoses aren't fatal but you may end up as a hospital inpatient for example so the full price involves the value of time which is where the unemployment bonuses come in unemployment benefits have always been around but what was novel in the last two years was to have the very large bonuses these are policy and due shocks to the value of time in addition of course to other changes in the value of time coming from other sources i need to tell you a little bit about the theoretical distinction between narcotics and math but i want to wrap up this slide by noting that the point here is to get quantitative predictions as to the contribution of income and a few price effects and then compare them to what actually happened math is in a synthetic product narcotics and opioids specifically come in both organic and synthetic forms the distinction between organic and synthetic is that farming is an important part of the production of organic products the poppy fields in mexico for example a synthetic product is made in a factory perhaps a very small factory but is essentially an industrial exercise using chemical ingredient ingredients that have many other uses than making opioids or meth therefore synthetic drug supply is a lot more price elastic also quite cheap these days whereas an increase in the demand for an organic product would be partially or perhaps entirely dampened price increases movement along an upward sloping supply curve an increase in the demand for math is not that's what this picture shows opioid markets you might say are more interesting because the expensive organic products such as heroin or prescriptions that use the poppy plant coexist with the synthetic products namely fentanyl and its analogs in effect supply slopes down an increase in opioid demand increases induces some of the organic customers or perhaps their dealers to switch to cheaper fentanyl it's the same analytic framework really that i use for alcohol but there the switch i said was from bars and restaurants to homes you might say that opioid demand shifts are amplified relative to what they would be with horizontal supply which is what i've illustrated in the picture so i assume the same underlying income and employment effect unemployment bonus effects for math and narcotics but the narcotics are have those effects amplified this approach has several predictions and these are literally forecasts because my nbr working paper from exactly two years ago was all about this switching effect and one prediction is that the organic opioid quantities would not increase and might even decrease during the pandemic and this actually happened at least as we measure it as deaths another prediction is that opioid quantities would increase proportionally more than meth that's the amplifier i mentioned even though the opioids include some categories with reduced quantities again this fits the data a numerical value for the opioid multiplier if you want to call it that was provided in my two years ago paper and is used here in the demand modeling the time that we have let me show you the sum of the three model predictions one for each substance namely what do we expect to happen if we just had an income effect a switching from drinking bars and restaurants to homes and two episodes of unemployment bonuses of course the second episode would have half the bonus of the first and that's what i've shown here in the red series which includes the trend in seasonal that i mentioned the circles are the data and they follow the same basic pattern both the amount of the increase which is peaking twice at 180 000 annualized deaths and the timing of those peaks there's a lot more other patterns by substance by demographic group by time that are accurately predicted by the demand approach too i will show you some of those on my last slide in particular let's take if you'll if you look here at the end of 2020 and we see kind of a v shape or a u shape in the time series let's look at that u shape and see whether it varies across demographic groups this last part of the paper is a pure regression exercise no calibration here there's no use of theoretical restrictions the mortality data though is separated by age group and the regression residuals are are normalized so that every age group is at the origin during the pandemic months with zero bonus and the dependent variable is the log of mortality from alcohol or drugs for those age groups and time periods this means that time does not move monotonically in the picture chronologically we start at the right that's in uh april may june july 2020 then we go to the origin that's the end of 2020 and then we go back to the middle when the 300 bonuses turn on again the horizontal axis is the product of the statutory bonus amount which is a national time series and each group's ui participation rate which is a cross-section variable 0.2 for example means that either 10 of people were getting a 600 bonus or 20 percent of people were getting a 300 bonus we see in this figure eight that every age group has a u-shaped mortality series except the elderly and coincidentally the elderly the ones least exposed to ui now perhaps it's all coincidence that actual mortality resembles what we'd expect from historical substitution and income effects certainly welcome other explanations for these patterns but i want to end with noting that incentives really distinguish economic understanding from public health more broadly and i think incentives here deserve serious consideration for the purposes of understanding the causes of drug and alcohol mortality thank you
