where we want to sort of focus is um the intersection of um tracking as best we can the real-time policy response to covet 19 with a particular focus and interest on the lower income population um so to start out for some reason there we go um so to start out uh you know there's there's a lot of attention to uh already in this conversation to these two very large portions of the response to the crisis uh unemployment insurance and the uh emergency impact payments the relief payments from from treasury um and and as i'll show you in just a second go back there for a second uh those are the the categories where a lot of the spending is going on but with the focus on the low income population and an interest in looking at the sort of transfer program so i'm not going to be talking about the ppp but more the direct transfers to households uh in addition to the importance of unemployment insurance the 600 weekly top-up that underlied what evon was talking about in terms of the replacement rates as well as importantly very importantly it turns out the expansions of an employment under the pua which include expansions to categories of workers that typically would not be eligible for unemployment insurance and interestingly our calculations show are very disproportionately represented by the lowest income uh americans so very high rates of self-employment and ineligibility for unemployment because of self-employment or insufficient work history so another expansion under the pua is that some of the work history uh and levels of earnings requirements were relaxed uh to be eligible uh particularly for the six hundred dollar top-up um uh under the pua program so that's unemployment um then there's the emergency impact payment that twelve hundred dollars per adult five hundred dollars per children that's phased out starting at 75 or 100k depending on whether you're single or married filer in addition to that there were two important expansions to the sort of food and nutrition programs um uh in the united states so the snap program uh was expanded in a way that for everybody who didn't already get the maximum benefit which is about 60 percent of households that typically are combining um earnings and snap receipt their benefit was under this quote emergency assistance program was increased to the maximum benefit and that turns out to be on average about 160 per month for those who were affected by that program and some important sort of administrative hurdles that were waived temporarily you don't have to go through re-certification requirements which you clearly see in the data there's drop-offs at those six-month intervals and the in-person interviews which typically are required in most states were also waived and then in addition uh to address the fact that about 22 million children in america uh receive free or reduced price lunches at school or and in addition growing a number of schools also have breakfast programs an enormous amount of children get one or two meals a day at school and so a particular aspect of this crisis is the school closure which for those families which is a lot of families also incurred this real shrinkage in terms of access to um meals for their children so it was a way to sort of combat that there's a new program called the pandemic ebt program uh which is designed to sort of cash out the benefit that households would be getting in dollar terms from those meals and provides to families in a way sort of modeled off of a pre-existing program called the summer ebt program where some families would get a debit card or snap top-up amounts uh equal to the value of those meals that they could access in the summertime where you see these very seasonal patterns of worse outcomes um for nursing for low-income children and that's about 120 per month so those are the four main ingredients for low-income families uh through the response so how much are we spending on those four programs what we have here is just in the ad from the daily treasury straight uh uh statements that come out where we've uh the graph here shows the cumulative spending um where we've been it up by week and then added up cumulatively as we move through time and it's a first difference from the same week last year because there is some seasonality in uh payments out of treasury for example when tax refunds come out in february and march for low-income families and so that's a difference doubt and so what you can see here is we've you know indicated on the graph when the cares act was passed that is where the unemployment and the emergency impact payment were legislated the usda policies actually came in the first or the second bill the family's first coronavis act which was passed a couple of weeks before that um and that's when the the snap and p ebt programs are passed so what you can see from this is first of all on aggregate uh we're spending a lot on these programs um more than 400 we'll be updating this soon uh uh a billion dollars on these programs you can also see as john was pointing out the timing of the direct deposit dump out of treasury for the emergency impact payments which here are in green you can see this big dump of that when all the direct deposits were were pushed out and after that a sort of slow trickle of the paper checks that come out after that of which a lot of people are still getting paper checks and as i'll talk about at the end another 12 million americans who are non-filers but eligible have to jump through additional hoops of application in order to access these benefits that they're eligible for so that's the green bar the orange bar are the unemployment insurance payments and the bar you can barely see the blue at the top are the total cost of this snap and p ebt payment so it just sort of puts in perspective these much more targeted benefits um to the larger broader scale uh um cost of these programs so at the same time that we're spending this enormous amount and the 600 top-up for the unemployed is sort of unprecedented in terms of protection through the unemployment insurance system we see you know real-time measures of hardship that are quite significant and so what has been tracked in both the census household pulse survey uh initiated during the covid period as well as the covid impact survey have both been uh tracking food insecurity and we measure food insecurity it's a standard federal statistic that's been measured since the early 1990s i'm showing you here historically from the national health interview survey which is one of the surveys tracking food insecurity and you can see the rate of food insecurity in the blue line among all households and in the orange line among households with children that tend to have higher rates of food insecurity and what that looked like just in the time series leading up to the covid period and our most recent statistics on this correspond to about uh 2018 and we can estimate a model showing the relationship modeling the relationship between food insecurity and unemployment rates to just predict out what we think food insecurity would have been on the eve of covin 19 and you see about nine percent of households with children and eight and a half percent of all households uh that are having trouble uh having enough income to support food consumption and this is a seven question series in the in the national statistics but in these uh pulse and covet impact surveys um there's a shortened um survey instrument um and you want this what we're showing here is answers to the question our food just didn't last and we didn't have enough money to get more and the the very consistent finding as we've moved through the crisis is this enormous spiking in food insecurity at about 30 percent of families with children um in the covid period being food insecure and 23 of the population um overall and if you take this sort of out of sample prediction of the relationship between food insecurity and unemployment almost all of this increase could be quote unquote explained admittedly out of sample prediction uh from that relationship between food insecurity and unemployment so food insecurity has gone up a lot we also see uh also measured in the household pulse and covet impact survey unprecedented increases in the share of households that are visiting poop food pantries um increases by between five and ten times uh the kind of covid pre-covered rates um which i'm not showing here so one the main thing that we're interested in in this paper after documenting these uh uh real-time economic uh insecurities is what could explain the simultaneous big amount of spending yet some real-time hardship and so we focus on four things and i'm going to just show you some graphs that that sort of dig down into two of them the first one uh which which um i think is likely quite important and continual tracking will see whether or not uh indeed this sort of comes down has to do with the timing so i'm going to show you some evidence that shows just how long it took in particular for new programs to get out to households so between legislation and dollars starting to come out uh is two months or more which is a significant amount of time if you're living um on the margins number two outside of ui the benefit increases are pretty modest and i'll just kind of leave it at that number three despite the expansions under the pua program there still does seem to be uh there's definitely a lack of coverage categorically and a lack of access due to reasons that uh we're still trying to understand why not everybody is converting to receiving uh unemployment that data is incomplete we're still monitoring it and then lastly uh there are certainly some groups that are categorically ineligible for these programs that add up to millions of americans largely the undocumented population and mixed status households where you've got itin filer parents and citizen children are not eligible um for the emergency impact payment so let me just show you a couple of graphs to try to kind of lay out some of the empirical evidence on these on these factors that we think are important the first is the delay between policy passing policy and dollars translating to household budgets on the left hand what we did is we tracked for each state when the first dollars started to show up in terms of spending and then uh just weighted that up using population weights to show for example on the left the share of individuals in the labor force who lived in states where the pua payment was start just started not that everybody was getting it because there's huge amounts of hold up uh in the applications uh but when did households first start to when did dollars first start to flow and what you can see is you know the cares act was passed in mid-march and what you see is by a month later uh only about 50 of people lived in states that had pua dollars flowing uh a month after that two months after passage only about three quarters of states had dollars flowing so there's a big and this is a conservative this is a kind of generous estimate because it's not means that the dollars are getting to everybody in the applications but that they're just starting to have dollars flow the pandemic ebt program and i illustrate these two in particular because these are new programs that required a lot of work to get them uh translated to dollars the second is the pandemic ebt program this replacement for school meals and you can see that that was even slower to be dispersed this uh i've separated out the tracking of those families that got the benefits topped up to their snap card so if you already have a snap ebt card it's easier for this payment to be dispersed but there's a lot of folks who are have income above snap eligibility or are not eligible for snap due to say immigration status but are still eligible for the school meals program where they had to uh actually disperse new debit cards so it takes a while that's the point of showing this uh in addition um there as i mentioned before uh it's estimated that 12 million americans are eligible for the emergency impact payment the 1200 per adult payment but because they haven't filed a tax return in the last year our social security or va benefit recipients were not automatically issued the benefit payment and so this requires uh applying uh through a new irs portal with essentially an abbreviated tax return in order to process their payment and this is where we this is data that is not available yet exactly what's happening with that um but the dollars we know are going out very slowly in this process and that's it's worth pointing out that this group is some of the most disadvantaged um part of our population so i know that i'm getting close to running out of time so let me just show you a few graphs about what we think is going on with unemployment insurance so again we're still monitoring the data i'm going to show you two graphs one based on survey data and one based on administrative data the survey data here comes from the covet impact survey which asks individuals did you receive unemployment insurance in the past seven days this is kind of problematic because a lot of states pay bi-weekly so what would you say if you got to check you know 10 days ago i'm not sure but the point here is to show that among workers that were furloughed that's the population we look at here from the covet impact survey we see these disparities and access to unemployment insurance and these disparities lower rates among lower education levels is something you see reflected in recession after recession after recession if you look at data from california that is tracking initiation this is through the california policy lab and heeding it all what you can see is that in that administrative data we can see that among initial claims and what percent of them have translated to payments in california we see again these disparities of lower payments translating to claims um across education level with 64 of those with less than or equal to a high school degree uh having the benefit uh claim translate to benefits paid versus somewhat higher levels for higher education levels um so then just lastly um not all of the another reason why we might be seeing this rate of insecurity is simply there are some groups that are not eligible uh for the benefits that have gone out unemployment required unemployment insurance requires being a documented worker many workers are not eligible and the emergency impact payment as i mentioned excludes all households where anyone in the household is an itin filer so i could be a citizen married to a non-citizen with citizen children and we would as a household not be eligible for any component of the impact payment which is more stringent than any previous stimulus that we've had so um let me just then wrap up and say that you know looking forward and perhaps in our conversation we can before we can we can look forward this this is sort of against a backdrop of a fairly a safety net with a lot of holes in it you know we've essentially built a social safety net that's largely based around work which is not great when there isn't work and in the absence of the expansions and the cares act we've got very low rates of ui coverage there's a lot of particularly among poor workers a large share of workers that are not eligible because of insufficient earnings documentation status being self-employed worker with quite varying replacement rates across states so this is this is what's there when the policies that have been passed expire
