all right well uh thank you thanks to the organizers um we'll thank them again later uh I I did I did find it interesting that Al opened up that by describing Mrs Mark design 25 years later she is uh as near as I remember uh you know we we began our work uh Al and I both were doing our work in 93-94 um the uh the law authorizing the Spectrum auctions which I worked on was uh passed in 1993 and we got the option to set up uh going in 1994 now was working on the national resident matching program in the same period where are you well there's someone that's when you did your work right so that's so so this seems like in fact the organizers when they invited me said you know well this is going to be in Washington DC it's like 30 years after the Spectrum auctions in 30 years anyway so 30 years I'm gonna I'm going with 30 years and Market descent was really you know what if you consider this the beginning and Al and I taught a class at Harvard in in 2000 where um actually parag you were a student in that class and Michael was too okay the uh when we first uh taught the First Market design class um at Harvard and back then it was the class on matching and auctions um and you know there was some auction stuff going on and uh Spectrum auctions National resident matching program uh we had a school choice hadn't happened yet getting the exchange um hadn't happened yet and uh and and this is where we started and then you know now a holy cow um I was trying to I'm I'm teaching you know I teach an undergraduate class in Market design and it says so what's the discipline here what is the con look at this list what's the commonality among the uh items on this list apart from the fact that we're all concerned about making something happen in the real world there's just such heterogeneity uh uh down this list you know uh uh when we're doing electricity everything from well everything from traditional i o topics to computational complexity as uh Martin vickler was telling us about an environment I mean just look at the things that come up when we do our organ transplant Market design was we're interested in the organ procurement organizations and replacing them is that what Market design is about uh is it about you you just heard what what comes up in AI so I'm trying to figure out um how I should update my undergraduate Market design class and trying to find some themes here if anybody sees themes here please tell me about it because uh uh apart from the fact that we care about resource allocation and we now know that markets don't organize themselves it's not just a matter of there's a supply curve and a demand curve and transactions take place at a given price there are lots of details and and I think the one of the other big things is is that is that the details vary one of as you go down these things the important details what you have to get right seems to be different in each of these settings and I think that is one of the one of the big and important lessons of of uh of Market design of practical Market design that we've learned from experience and and the theory is is often very useful in in helping us make progress and I'm not going to go back over all these things because that's what the whole new directions conference was about instead I'm going to tell you about one more um something that has been of interest to me just um in the last year and water um now you might have thought if you're new to this that water is the obvious you know homogeneous divisible commodity that uh what is there to say about water but you'd be quite wrong uh if if that's what you think and I'm gonna tell you about it um in a moment here I want to emphasize first of all that the the person who really brought this together and did most of the work is Billy Ferguson was a graduate student at Stanford and and I don't want to steal any of Billy's Thunder he's responsible for um most of what we're doing but we really want to solve the water problem my co-pi on this uh on the project which is funded by the the door School uh the sustainability school at Stanford um is Buzz Thompson Buzz was was the head of the woods Institute the environmental Institute at Stanford and is a lawyer by training he teaches water law um at Stanford and water laws extremely complicated as you'll see in um uh in a few moments so uh those are the people that I'm working on water with and um I just just as a general opening water is a problem worldwide four billion people in the world face severe water scarcity at least one month a year uh Global Water demand is expected to increase by 20 to 30 of percent while water availability is decreasing and there's uh 700 million people expect it to be displaced by 2030 because of intense water scarcity so uh so water is a huge problem I we're starting for ourselves we decided to start with water in California which is enough of a problem um oh by the way Solutions uh historically the what water policy has been about is Supply augmentation you know you divert a stream or you build a dam or or perhaps build a desalination plant to uh to add to the water supply that's most of what water policy has been about water markets have not been very important important around the world there's a Active water Market in Australia which I may refer to when the Murray darling Basin which I may refer to a little more soon but but water markets uh help us use the scarce resource and direct it to its most valuable use so you might wonder why don't we have what do we need Market design for any time I I hope one of the lessons if there's any lesson that came up at all uh during the course of the of the seminar here is that when you get into the details there's there's something there that that's specific to the application that you're looking at so by the way Mark Twain commented on this long ago whiskey is for drinking water is for fighting over so um so that's what Mark Twain had to say um so when we are going in the wet in the Western United States through the worst Mega drought in more than a thousand years um before this year we we fortunately just had a nice rainy winter very rainy winter in California but the uh uh this is you're looking at a reservoir uh as of last year um all of That's supposed to be full of water as you can tell and the boats are stuck in a little mud Pond over here that was all that's left from uh this is Lake Oroville um fortunately with the rains these reservoirs in California uh the California reservoirs are refilling but uh but there continues to be uh big problems the Colorado River which is one of the major sources of water on the west gets about 12 million acre feet of flow every year and it had there's about 17 million acre feet of commitments and um the obvious imbalance and and the government has been meeting those commitments mostly by drawing down the big reservoirs behind the the uh the Lake Mead behind the Hoover Dam and Lake Powell behind the Glen Canyon Dam which had massive when they were full they had 52 million acre feet of storage um remember this is that they're on the Colorado River which is a 12 million annual acre foot flow so massive amounts of storage which have been drawn down and are almost gone and uh just before this conference this is from April 23rd the federal government issued their near-term Colorado River operations uh supplemental environmental impact statement uh which included this uh the potential impact of low runoff conditions uh in the remainder of the this period pose unacceptable risk to the routine operations of the Glen Canyon and and Hoover dams and therefore moderated operate operating guidelines need to be expeditiously developed so we're expecting there will be change we began work on this because we thought there was a crisis approaching and we wanted to have a plan in place so that when the government was finally ready to do something we would have we would have a plan in place and uh it things are moving very fast as uh sorry I can tell you about that okay so why why is there a problem with water it's perfectly homogeneous divisible commodity well um I'm going to talk mostly about surface water first we distinguish surface water and groundwater surface water is the stuff that flows through the down through the rivers and groundwater you drive underground Africa is that were most of which was deposited Long Ago by melting glaciers and such um and uh the the problem can be explained by classical economic issues externalities from trade I'll show you exactly how that arises diverse and outdated property rights there's no uniform rights that for which a nice market price uh exists that provides good signals uh to Value difficulty the accurate and accessible measurement of usage and externalities and and thin markets due to inadequate information so uh you know these are traditional problems so what kind of externalities are there from Trading water well here's a um an area outside Sacramento California just to give you an example of water rights and the hydrological situation so if you look here the red dots on this picture let's see if I can well anyway that I'm at a funny angle but the red dots on this picture indicate the um location of farmers who own rights to draw water from these uh surface water and the green arrows on the picture uh denote uh diversions so there's a location for example up here where a water is diverted from the river to uh to these three major users and um uh from the streams are in blue the canals are in uh in red and the Red Arrows indicate return flows from the streams back back into the streams and canals what are return flows and this is the essence of what makes this so hard uh if you put uh 100 Acre feet of of uh flood irrigation on the field some of that evaporates some of the transpires that it goes into your plants and gets used and some of it goes down into the ground where it either flows back into a stream or gets added to an aquifer that um uh that it's it's going down down into and you'll see that why that's important in a moment here but use May return water to the original stream or the diversion talk they go into a different stream something happen okay so so let's take a look at how this uh Works in terms of externalities this is a simplified example of Billy's we have a two streams here each with uh 40 acre feet flowing down through them and uh Alice and Bob and Charlie each have rights to draw from the stream uh Alice has a right to draw 25 acre feed Bob 20 acre feed Charlie 45 acre feet and you can see that those things don't add up that there are there's only 40 acre feet in the flowing down the river on the left and and 40 acre feet uh on the stream on the right and there's 45 acre feet of of diversion rights there but um it turns out that Bob's evapotranspiration the water that gets evaporated or used up is is just half of the 20. it's 10 acre feet and as a consequence of five acre feet flows back after Bobby uses it into the stream on the left and five acre feet flows into the stream on the right and that leaves just enough flow for Alice and and Charlie to uh to get uh what to have their rights built okay now um so this is a hydrological network users May return water to the original stream uh or to other streams uh in the uh in the network okay so let's take a look at what this means about trade suppose that Alice has a higher marginal value of water than Bob and wants to buy eight acre feet of Rights from him so uh there's eight acre feet I've just added that Arrow uh uh that that Bob is going to sell to Alice and what that's going to do since Bob is using only 12 acre feet and since he returns half of it the return flows uh are going to be three acre feed into the stream on the left and three acre feet into the stream um on the right and uh Alice is now able to divert 31 acre feet um 12 is taken out three is is returned uh add that to the 40 and you get 31 acre feet available to Alice now uh but Charlie only gets 43 acre feet and he had a right to 45. so there's an externality from this trade um Charlie who had a right to 45 acre feet is only getting 43 acre feet as a result of the trade between Bob and Alice and in California this is illegal um the uh Charlie can say wait a minute that they can't do that they're taking water molecules that belong to me and um and this trade is uh is legally blocked now things aren't as clean as this in this uh example that I've given you people know what the return flows are they know what the usages are all of this is as if measured and you might ask yourself why don't they just bring Charlie into the deal and if they knew how many acre feet uh Charlie was uh was was suffering uh as a as a loss that might be possible um but part of the problem here is this all ends up being litigated Charlie hires a hydrologist that says no no I actually lost four acre feet and goes to court with this his hydrologist and Bob and Alice hire their hydrologist and say no you're wrong and uh we have a mess so uh California just bans these trades okay and the California Supreme Court had this to say about it it says that the scope and Technical complexity of issues concerning Water Resources management are unequaled by virtually any other type of activity presented to the courts so the hydrology is complicated and um I mean again we start with when you first hear about it water the visible homogeneous right but it's not it's uh it's very complicated the uh which exactly who's affected by which flows is is very complicated and you can imagine that if what was going on on the previous slide is that Bob was trying to sell his water to Los Angeles um and he's got uh uh the the water that he withdraws then both Alice and Charlie are losing um our losing return flow and Alice and Charlie are both objecting to the ship shipment of that water through through a pipe to uh to a city so these are these are quite complicated um transactions okay so I what we've been up to uh now I'm not the first one to say this and and uh the we have lots of people at door school who uh the engineers and so on who know a whole lot more about hydrology and water flows than I do um and uh so you you might wonder what what role uh I have as a market designer well part of the role that I have have as a market designer part of it is talking about uh what the end point should be but another part of it is talking about the transition and um uh Kevin Leighton Brown was up here a little while ago where are you Kevin somewhere back there hi Kevin um who did brilliant work in the incentive option by the way thank you Kevin for making that a vet project a success um the uh what we did in the inside of auction part of what we did was change one kind of right to another we were buying television broadcast rights making some changes to the system and selling mobile broadband rights which are sold that which are different uh they they involve different interference restrictions they have have different needs they're cut up into different Geographic areas different frequency bandwidths they differ in a lot of ways from the underlying um uh from the previously existing rights and part of what we want to do in this system is to homogenize the rights to replace the old rights with new rights that will be tradable and any Economist will tell you why that would be a good idea if it could be brought about but part of the reason it's so hard to bring about is that the these rights their property rights they're constitutionally protected you can't go in and tell a farmer you're going to have to trade off your your old right for a new right farmer can just say no and uh it's a property right and you can't do anything about that so uh the question of how we get to uh uniform rights that are tradable um well what the the concept that I was taking from the incentive auction is we don't need all of it uh just as we didn't need every television uh broadcaster to go off the air we don't need every farmer to trade his old old rights for new rights in order to create an effective market and so uh stepping toward reform there's a lot of steps and these are Big steps I don't mean to make this sound trivial but if we can do something voluntary as we did in the incentive auction so that nobody is forced to change their rights uh so that you know it's an actual Pareto Improvement uh that that we bring about that should make it politically much more palatable than something where we somehow try to take away constitutionally protected rights or even rights where the farm Lobby is pretty strong even just uh just in that way so um one of the things we need to do um turns out another complication that we have is the rights that you might think belong to the farmers don't always belong to the farmers they sometimes belong to the Irrigation District so in the the in the Imperial Valley in Southern California the Imperial Irrigation District is a huge user of water and Tech 25 percent of the flow that's allocated from the Colorado River goes to the Imperial Irrigation District in Southern California which has a very high priority uh water right and it has no incentive to see you know these guys are politicians who are not allowed to spend the money on anything interesting they can they can generate power which is virtually free down there anyway or they can build canals and that's all they you know they don't want to be paid to sell water rights but the farmers um many of them we know would be happy to sell their rights we want to force the um the irrigation districts to uh to distribute the rights to the users as a step toward making these things um uh tradable and I'll tell you a little bit more if I have time about how we want to do that um second in order for there to be trade we got to know who owns what we need a public database of of surface water property rights we don't even have that right now this was uh this all emerged out of historical use in California it all started in 1849 with the gold rush but water was being used to blast mountains to try to bring get out gold ore and we have this at this first in use first and right system um anybody who was using water then had first priority over people who came to use water later nobody has records of all this stuff and the uh and we don't have a complete record that needs to be done um the we need uh what one of the first things we did in the incentive auction even before any of the things that Kevin described to you as the Federal Communications Commission um uh ran its interference study where it said you know which broadcasters were interfering with each other if parag was on uh uh channel uh 22 and and Mike was on channel 23 would there be interference between them or not and and uh that was done and it became the basis for this is what constitutes unacceptable interference we need to know what's um unacceptable uh what unacceptable trades are we need to prepare and maintain a legally approved hydrological model we need a study done that will fix those constraints so we know what they are so that not every trade is being litigated um we need to adopt and recognize measures of consumptive use now how much water is actually being used when when Mike takes you know 20 acre feet and uses it on his land now once upon a time we were unable to measure that it turns out today there are new technologies we have uh open ET is a website that you can go to um where you can look at a map of the western United States until acre by acre how much water is leaving the land and going up into the air that evapotransfer transpiration from each acre of land we can actually tell what the use is and um and and so measurement has become possible and we need to have a recognized measure which is uh legally understood to be an accurate measure of of use uh we need to offer voluntary conversion now here's the here's the essence of of the uh change we want to bring about for economic reasons we want to replace these old rights which were the which every every farmer had a different right to take a certain amount of water from a certain stream if there's sufficient water there uh where you know if Barack got his uh rights before Irene then uh then if there's a shortage of water he gets all of his water before she got any of hers we need to homogenize those things so that these rights are are uh within categories at least are all the same so there's a market price and so that uh if uh parag now sells his rights uh for a price of 200 an acre foot Irene will know that the price of water or water is 200 an acre foot and we will uh we'll have price signals that are guiding use and and and uh that are guiding use and uh we need to do this carefully however because uh some Farmers right now in California if you did that they would say fine I will sell my water rights but I will pump groundwater out of the aquifer underneath what we call groundwater substitution um California is in the midst of uh it has the sustainable groundwater management act it's in the midst of setting up groundwater regulation and only in areas where regulation where that regulation is in place does this make any sense we also want these rights these rights would be secure not use it or lose it rights so that you could uh you could sell your rights one year when there's a not enough rain so water so Los Angeles gets enough water and then use them again the next year and we'd also like if it was a really rainy year and I I had more water than I needed for the plants I was growing I'd like to be able to tell the federal government keep it in the reservoir I'll use it in a dry year right now you can't do that if you don't use the water you lose the right and it just seems so sensible and in addition by the way once these rights of once you have marketable water if you want to do a water saving projects and you need to invest in a drip irrigation system or whatever these rights once they're you can use them as security for a loan because they're marketable there's so many benefits that come from um for making these things marketable now we have some ideas in mind about how to what kind of offers to make where we would swap your old rights for your new rights but in order to ensure that we got enough of these things going we're imagining a procurement auction in which uh to launch the system the government has a fix up some of money just to spend it's trying to encourage at least 50 percent of the rights to be switched from the old rights to the new rights and it's a descending clock auction very similar to what we did uh for the uh for the FCC where we will pay their Farmers initially the the first uh the first users who agreed to sell to swap their rights from the uh from the old kind of right to the new kind of right in addition the new kind of right is more secure new kind of right is something they can store new kind of right to something they can borrow against we think this would be pretty attractive for them and we might be able to do this at very low cost to get uh to get a good initial um uh initial conversion going to uh to launch the system and um and then finally for to to pull some of these rights out of places like the Imperial Irrigation District I told you that one of the things we need to do is is get farmers who are growing Alfalfa which has very low value and using lots of water to be to be happy to uh sell that well there are farmers who would do that but they can't sell it because they don't control their own water so um it turns out that in California law the um you're right to use water uh is contingent remember there's a it's a use it or lose it right and uh you have to put the water to a beneficial use to keep the right and the California Supreme Court recently ruled that uh the definition of beneficial use can change over time um which is great right because well we would then propose that the legal definition of beneficial use is if you have a use that's worth those economic value is less than half the market price it doesn't qualify as a beneficial use this would force the some of these government agencies that are wasting water uh to find ways to do you know for the farmers would say give us the water we'll sell it you know the uh would would find a way to help move the resource to its uh more valuable use okay um I'm down to my last minute and I want to do what I think several people have already done which is oops conclusion Uh current Western mega mega drought highlights how climate change is going to continue to disrupt disrupt Water Resource allocations Australia has an active Water Market which I didn't have a chance to talk about that uh is has been shown to uh combat the problem of scarcity from climate change when there is uh when they have low water years the water uh trades a lot um the successful U.S incentive auction is a model for some of the steps to uh restructuring rights to build the well-functioning water Market and uh for Irene and Mike and parag we salute you thank you all very much
