it is my great pleasure to welcome chairman bernanke to the nber this afternoon to our conference on the federal reserve the first hundred years of the federal reserve uh chairman bernanke of course uh needs no introduction but to the nber crowd uh that is gathered here i thought i would just mention uh ben's historical role in the nber and the many connections that he has to the nber summer institute and to the monetary economics program which hosts this meeting today ben is of course a past director of the monetary economics program he's also a past member of the nber's business cycle dating committee uh he is a past editor of the nber's macroeconomics annual volume he's also the author or co-author of 32 nber working papers over the last 30 years which include many of the most cited working papers in that time period i was astonished when i looked at google scholar to discover that there are five of ben's co-authored or single authored working papers which have more than 2000 google scholar citations and those of you who follow google scholar will know that that is a truly remarkable tally uh for any for any individual uh so ben is here this afternoon to speak to us about the federal reserve at 100 goals uh goals framework and accountability and we're delighted that he can join us chairman bernanke thank you thank you thank you jim particularly that part about the bibliography you know i'm still working on it uh well i would like like the previous speakers i'd like to thank the national bureau of economic research for organizing this conference in recognition of the federal reserve's centennial which we don't know exactly whether it's 1913 1914 but we know it's happening around now and i'm glad to be here and have the opportunity to participate in this very interesting conference in keeping with the spirit of the conference my remarks today will be primarily historical in nature but i will leave discussion of current policy to today's question and answer period and of course next week i have the particular pleasure of testifying before congress and so that'll be another opportunity to uh to discuss these matters so today in my remarks i'd like to discuss the evolution over the past hundred years of three key aspects of federal reserve policy making the goals of policy the policy framework and accountability and communication the changes over time in these three areas provide a useful perspective i believe on how the role and functioning of the federal reserve has changed since its founding in 1913 as well as some lessons for the present and for the future i'll pay particular attention to several key episodes in the fed's history all of which have been referred to in various contexts with the modifier great the great experiment of the federal reserve's founding the great depression the great inflation and subsequent disinflation the great moderation and the great recession in the words of one of the authors of the federal reserve act robert latham owen the federal reserve was established to quote provide a means by which periodic panics would shake the american republic and do it enormous injury shall be stopped in short the original goal of the great experiment that was the founding of the fed was the preservation of financial stability at the time the standard view of panics was that they were triggered when the needs of business and agriculture for liquid funds outstrip the available supply as when seasonal plantings or shipments of crops had to be financed for example and that panics were further exacerbated by the incentives of banks and private individuals to hoard liquidity during those times as has been discussed many times today already the new institution was intended to relieve such strains by providing a quote elastic currency that is by providing liquidity as needed to individual member banks through the discount window and the commercial banks in turn would then be able to accommodate their customers interestingly although congressional advocates hoped that the creation of the fed would help prevent future panics they did not fully embrace the idea that the fed should help end ongoing panics by serving as lender of last resort as had been recommended by the british economist and writer walter badgett legislators imposed limits on the federal reserve's ability to lend in response to panics for example by denying non-member banks access to the discount window and by restricting the types of collateral that the fed could accept the framework that the federal reserve employed in its early years to promote financial stability reflected in large measure the influence of the so-called real bills doctrine as well as the fact that the united states was on the gold standard in the framework of the real bills doctrine the federal reserve saw its function as meeting the needs of business for liquidity consistent with the idea of providing inelastic currency with the ultimate goal of supporting economic and financial stability when business activity was increasing the federal reserve helped accommodate the need for credit by supplying liquidity to banks and when business was contracting and less credit was needed the fed reduced the amount of liquidity in the system as i mentioned the federal reserve pursued this policy approach in the context of the gold standard federal reserve notes were redeemable in gold on demand and the fed was required to maintain a gold reserve equal to 40 percent of its outstanding notes however contrary to the principles of an idealized gold standard the federal reserve often took actions to prevent inflows and outflows of gold from being fully translated into changes in the domestic money supply this practice together with the size of the us economy gave the federal reserve considerable autonomy in monetary policy and in particular allowed the fed can to conduct policy according to the real bills doctrine without much hindrance the policy framework of the fed's early years has been much criticized in retrospect although the gold standard did not appear to have greatly constrained u.s monetary policy in the years after the fed's founding subsequent research has highlighted the extent to which the international gold standard served to destabilize the global economy in the late 1920s and early 1930s likewise economic historians have pointed out that under the real bills doctrine the fed increased the money supply precisely at those times at which business activity and upward pressures on prices were the strongest that is monetary policy was pro-cyclical thus the fed's actions tended to increase rather than decrease the volatility in economic activity and prices during this early period the new central bank did make an important addition to its menu of policy tools initially the fed's main tools were the quantity of its lending through the discount window and the interest rate at which it lent known as the discount rate early on however to generate earnings to finance its operations the federal reserve began purchasing government securities in the open market but came to be known as open market operations in the early 1920s fed officials discovered that these operations affected the supply and cost of bank reserves and consequently the terms on which banks extended credit to their customers subsequently of course open market operations became a principal monetary policy tool and one that allowed the fed to interact with the broader financial markets and not only with banks i've discussed the original mandate and the policy framework of the early days of the fed what about its accountability to the public and its governance as this audience knows when the federal reserve was established the question of whether it should be a private or public institution was highly contentious the compromise solution created a hybrid the system was headed by a governmentally appointed board which initially included the secretary of the treasury in the controller of the currency but the 12 regional reserve banks were placed under a mixture of public and private oversight including board members drawn from the private sector and they were given considerable scope to make policy decisions that apply to their own districts for example reserve banks were permitted to set their own discount rates subject to a minimum set by the board while the founders of the federal reserve hope that this new institution would provide financial and hence economic stability the policy framework and the institutional structure would prove inadequate to the challenges that the fed would soon face the great depression was the federal reserve's most difficult test tragically the fed failed to meet its mandate to maintain financial stability in particular although the fed provided substantial liquidity to the financial system following the 1929 stock market crash its response to the subsequent banking panics was limited at best the widespread bank failures and the collapse and money and credit that ensued were major sources of the economic downturn badges dictum to lend freely at a penalty rate in the face of panic appeared to have few adherents at the federal reserve of that era economists have also identified a number of instances from the late 1920s to the early 1930s when federal reserve officials in the face of the sharp economic contraction and financial upheaval either tightened monetary policy or chose inaction some historians traced these policy mistakes to the early death of benjamin strong governor of the federal reserve bank of new york in 1928 which left the decentralized system without an effective leader whether valid or not this hypothesis raises the interesting question of what intellectual framework an effective leader would have used at the time to develop and justify a more activist monetary policy the degree to which the gold standard actually constrained u.s monetary policy during the early 1930s is debated but the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the sort of highly expansionary policies that were needed the same can be said for the real bills doctrine which apparently led policymakers to conclude on the basis of low nominal interest rates and low borrowings from the fed that monetary policy was appropriately supportive and that further actions would be fruitless historians have noted the prevalence at the time of yet another counterproductive doctrine the so-called liquidationist view that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function it may be that the federal reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the lack of an intellectual framework for understanding what was happening and what needed to be done the fed's inadequate policy frameworks ultimately collapsed under the weight of economic failures new ideas and political developments the international gold standard was abandoned during the 1930s the real bills doctrine likewise lost prestige after the disaster of the 1930s for example the banking act of 1935 instructed the federal reserve to use open market operations with consideration of quote the general credit situation of the country and not just to focus narrowly on short-term liquidity needs the congress also expanded the fed's ability to provide credit through the discount window allowing loans to a broader array of counterparties secured by a broader variety of collateral the experience of the great depression had major ramifications for all three aspects of the federal reserve that i'm discussing here its goals its policy framework and its accountability to the public with respect to goals the high unemployment of the depression and the fear that high unemployment would return after world war ii elevated the maintenance of full employment as a goal of macroeconomic policy the employment act of 1946 made the promotion of employment a general objective of the federal government although the fed did not have a formal employment goal until the federal reserve reform act of 1977 codified maximum employment along with stable prices as part of the fed's so-called dual mandate earlier legislation nudged the central bank in that direction for example legislators described the intent of the banking act of 1935 as follows quote to increase the ability of the banking system to promote stability of employment and business in so far as this is possible within the scope of monetary action and credit administration the policy framework to support this new approach reflected the developments of macroeconomic theories including the work of canoe excel irving fisher ralph hawtry dennis robertson and of course john maynard keynes that laid the foundations for understanding how monetary policy could affect real activity and employment and help reduce cyclical fluctuations at the same time the federal reserve became less focused on its original mandate of preserving financial stability perhaps in part because it felt superseded by the creation during the 1930s of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the securities and exchange commission along with other reforms intended to make the financial system more stable in the area of governance and accountability to the public policy makers also recognized the need for reforms to improve the federal reserve structure and its decision making the banking act of 1935 simultaneously bolstered the legal independence of the federal reserve and provided for stronger central consult control by the federal reserve board in particular the act created the modern configuration of the federal open market committee the fomc giving the board the majority of the votes on the committee while removing the secretary of the treasury and the controller of the currency from the board in practice however the treasury continued to have considerable sway over monetary policy after 1933 with one economic historian describing the fed as in the back seat during world war ii the federal reserve used its tools to support the war financing efforts however even after the war federal reserve policy remains subject to considerable treasury influence it was not until the 1951 accord with the treasury that the federal reserve began to recover genuine independence in setting monetary policy once the federal reserve regained its policy independence its goals centered on the price stability and employment objectives laid out in the employment act of 1946 in the early post-war decades the fed used open market operations and the discount rate to influence short-term market interest rates and the federal funds rate gradually emerged as the preferred operating target low and stable inflation was achieved for most of the 1950s and early 1960s however beginning in the mid 1960s inflation began a long climb upward partly because policymakers proved to be too optimistic about the economy's ability to sustain rapid growth without inflation two mechanisms might have mitigated the damage from that mistake in optimism first a stronger policy response to inflation more like that observed in the 1950s certainly would have helped second fed policymakers could have reacted to continued high readings on inflation by adopting a more realistic assessment of the country's economic potential instead policymakers chose to emphasize so-called cost push and structural factors as sources of inflation and saw wage and price setting as having become insensitive to economic slack this perspective which contrasted sharply with milton friedman's famous dictum that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon led the fed to support measures such as wage and price controls rather than monetary solutions to address inflation a further obstacle was the view among many economists that the gains from low inflation did not justify the costs of achieving it the consequences of the monetary framework of the nineteen seventies were as you know two bouts of double-digit inflation moreover by the end of the decade lack of commitment to controlling inflation had clearly resulted in inflation expectations becoming unanchored with high estimates of trend inflation embedded in longer-term interest rates as you know and as we discussed earlier today under the leadership of chairman paul volcker the federal reserve in 1979 fundamentally changed its approach to ensuring price stability this change involved an important rethinking on the part of policymakers by the end of the 1970s federal reserve officials increasingly accepted the view that inflation is a monetary phenomenon at least in the medium and longer term they became more alert to the risks of excessive optimism about the economy's potential output and they placed renewed emphasis on the distinction between real that is inflation-adjusted and nominal interest rates the change in policy framework was initially tied to a change in operating procedures that put greater focus on growth in bank reserves but the critical change the willingness to respond more vigorously to inflation endured even after the federal reserve resumed the traditional use of the federal funds rate as its policy instrument the new regime also reflected an improved understanding of the importance of providing a firm anchor secured by the credibility of the central bank for the private sector's inflation expectations finally it entailed a changed view about the dual mandate in which policy makers regarded achievement of price stability as helping to provide the conditions necessary for sustained maximum employment volcker's successful battle against inflation set the stage for the so-called great moderation of 1984 to 2007 during which the fed enjoyed considerable success in achieving both objectives of the dual mandate financial stability remained a goal of course the federal reserve monitored threats to financial stability and responded when the financial system was upset by events such as the 1987 stock market crash and the terrorist attacks of 2001. more routinely it shared supervisory duties with other banking agencies nevertheless for the most part financial stability did not figure prominently in monetary policy discussions during these years in retrospect it is clear that macroeconomists both inside and outside central banks rely too heavily during that period on variants of the so-called modigliani miller theorem an implication of which is that the details of the structure of the financial system can be ignored when analyzing the broader behavior of the economy an important development of the great moderation was the increasing emphasis in central banks around the world on communication and transparency as economists and policymakers reach consensus on the value of communication in attaining monetary policy objectives federal reserve officials like those at other central banks had traditionally been highly guarded in their public pronouncements they believe for example that the ability to take markets by surprise was important for influencing financial conditions thus although fed policy makers of the 1980s and early 1990s have become somewhat more explicit about policy objectives and strategy the same degree of transparency was not forthcoming on monetary policy decisions and operations the release of a post-meeting statement by the fomc a practice that began in 1994 was therefore an important watershed over time the statement was expanded to include more detailed information about the reason for the policy decision and an indication of the balance of risks in addition to improving the effectiveness of monetary policy these developments and communications also enhance the public accountability of the federal reserve accountability is of course essential for policy independence in a democracy during this period economists found considerable evidence that central banks that are afforded policy independence in pursuit of their mandated objectives deliver better economic outcomes one cannot look back today at the great moderation without asking whether the sustained economic stability of that period somehow promoted the excessive risk taking that followed the idea that this long period of calm lulled investors financial firms and financial regulators into paying insufficient attention to building risks must have some truth in it i don't think we should conclude though that we should therefore not strive to achieve economic stability rather the right conclusion is that even even in or perhaps especially in stable and prosperous times monetary policy makers and financial regulators should regard safeguarding financial stability to be of equal importance indeed a necessary prerequisite for maintaining macroeconomic stability macroeconomists and historians will continue to debate the sources of the remarkable economic performance during the great moderation my own view is that the improvements in monetary policy and in monetary policy communication including of course the better management of inflation and the anchoring of inflation expectations were important reasons for this strong performance however we have learned in recent years that while well-managed monetary policy may be necessary for economic stability it is not sufficient so it's been now some six years or so since the first signs of the financial crisis appeared in the united states and we are still working to achieve a full recovery from its effects what lessons should we take for the future from this experience particularly in the context of a century of federal reserve history the financial crisis and the ensuing great recession reminded us of a lesson that we learned both in the 19th century and during the depression but had forgotten to some extent which is that severe financial instability can do grave damage to the broader economy the implication is that a central bank must take into account risk to financial stability if it is to help achieve good macroeconomic performance today the federal reserve sees its responsibility for the maintenance of financial stability as co-equal with its management for the responsibility responsibility for the management of monetary policy and we have made substantial institutional changes in recognition of this change in goals in a sense we have come full circle back to the original goal of the federal reserve of preventing financial panics how should a central bank enhance financial stability one means is by assuming the lender of last resort function the badget understood and described 140 years ago under which the central bank uses its powers to provide liquidity to ease market conditions during periods of panic or incipient panic the fed's many liquidity programs played a central role in containing the crisis of 2008-2009 however putting out the fire is not enough it's also important to foster a financial system that is sufficiently resilient to withstand large financial shocks toward that end the federal reserve together with other regulatory agencies and the financial stability oversight council is actively engaged in monitoring financial developments and working to strengthen financial institutions and markets the reliance on stronger regulation is itself informed by the success of new deal regulatory reforms but current reform efforts go even further by working to identify and diffuse risks not only to individual firms but to defend to the financial system as a whole an approach known as macro prudential regulation financial stability is also linked to monetary policy though these links are not yet fully understood here the fed's evolving strategy is to make monitoring supervision and regulation the first line of defense against systemic risks to the extent that risks remain however the fomc strives to incorporate these risks in the cost-benefit analysis applied to all monetary policy actions what about the monetary policy framework in general the federal reserve's policy framework today inherits many of the elements put in place during the great moderation these features include the emphasis on preserving the fed's inflation credibility which is critical for anchoring inflation expectations and a balanced approach in pursuing both parts of the fed's dual mandate in the medium term we've also continued to increase the transparency of monetary policy for example the committee's communications framework now includes a statement of its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy in that statement the committee indicated that it judged that inflation at a rate of 2 as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the fomc's dual mandate fomc participants also regularly provide estimates of the longer run normal rate of unemployment those estimates currently have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent by helping to anchor longer term expectations this transparency gives the federal reserve greater flexibility to respond to short-run developments this framework which combines short-run policy flexibility with the discipline provided by the announced targets has been described as constrained discretion other communications innovations include early publications of the minutes of the fomc meetings and quarterly post-meeting press conferences by the chairman the framework for implementing monetary policy has evolved further in recent years reflecting both advances in economic thinking and a changing policy environment notably following the ideas of lars fenson and others the fomc has moved toward a framework that ties policy settings more directly to the economic outlook a so-called forecast based approach in particular the fomc has released more detailed statements following its meetings that have related the outlook for policy to prospective economic developments and has introduced regular summaries of the individual economic projections of fomc participants including for the target federal funds rate the provision of additional information about policy plans has helped fed policy makers deal with the constraint posed by the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates in particular by offering guidance about how policy will respond to economic developments the committee has been able to increase policy accommodation even when the short-term interest rate is near zero and cannot be meaningfully reduced further the committee has also sought to influence interest rates further out on the yield curve notably through its securities purchases other central banks and advanced economies also confronted with the effective lower bound and short-term interest rates have taken similar measures in short the recent crisis has underscored the need both to strengthen our monetary policy and financial stability frameworks and to better integrate the two we've made progress on both counts but more needs to be done in particular the complementarities among regulatory and supervisory policies including macro prudential policy lender of last resort policy and standard monetary policy are all increasingly evident both research and experience are needed to help the fed and other central banks develop comprehensive frameworks that incorporate all of these elements the broader conclusion is what might be described as the overriding lesson of the federal reserve's history that central banking doctrine and practice are never static we and other central banks around the world will have to continue to work hard to adapt to events new ideas and to changes in the economic and financial environment thank you [Applause] thank you very much uh let me just remind the audience that we will have index their index cards available we've already collected some from people uh we'll have folks walking through the the aisles if you would like to try to submit a question uh please write the question we'll then try to bring some of those up so we can try to ask uh what we can so uh chairman i uh you you you indicated your willingness to talk a bit about current uh situation as well as the 100 year history so i thought i'd like to start by just asking you a little bit about the last uh the last six weeks last month last month you laid out a contingent plan for reducing the pace of asset purchases uh a number of of pundits have criticized this step uh said it was premature for you to discuss the future contingencies at this point uh with the benefit of hindsight at this point would you do anything differently in that regard if you could if you had that step to take again well thank you for that question well as i said in my remarks i'm a very big believer federal reserve is a very big believer in transparency and communication i think transparency in central banking is kind of like truth telling in everyday life you got to be consistent about it you can't be opportunistic about it i think if you think about the recent developments and the information that we provided to the public about our thinking um i guess i would ask you to consider the counterfactual if we hadn't said anything the information we provided about for example our contingent data dependent plans for the asset purchase program were actually pretty close to our understanding of what uh markets expected for that program but i suppose we'd said nothing and that time had passed and that market perceptions had drifted away uh from our our own uh thinking and our own expectations for policy in addition during that time uh again in the counter factual where we don't uh provide any information it's very likely that more highly levered risk-taking positions might build up uh reflecting again some expectation of of an infinite infinite asset purchase program so i guess i would suggest that notwithstanding some volatility that we've seen in the last six weeks that speaking now and explaining what we're doing uh may have avoided you know a much more difficult situation at another time okay continuing on that theme uh the financial markets reacted you know sharply to some combination of your remarks and the release of the of the minutes uh last month uh the market seems to have interpreted uh the combination of those two pieces of information as as hawkish news uh would would that be the right interpretation to to put on those releases so let me start with basics here the federal reserve notwithstanding uh that not everybody likes it i think it's good has a dual mandate the dual mandate is to pursue maximum employment and price stability currently we have an unemployment rate of 7.6 percent which i think if anything overstates the health of our labor markets given participation rates and many other indicators of underemployment and long-term unemployment so we're not there obviously on the maximum employment part of the mandate on price stability inflation is now about one percent which is below our two percent objective so both sides of our mandate both the employment side and the inflation side are saying that we need to be more accommodative moreover the other portion of macroeconomic policy fiscal policy is now actually quite restrictive the cbo estimates that current federal fiscal policy is subtracting one and a half percentage points or so of growth from the u.s economy this year so you put that all together and i think you can only conclude that highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is what's needed in the u.s economy now how does that relate to recent communications i think the uh issue has to do with not so much with the overall accommodation but rather with the mix of instruments being used to provide that accommodation the fed has two instruments that we've been using in the context of interest rates close to the zero lower bound the first asset purchases we have thought about and i've frequently described as providing some near-term momentum to the economy in other words we have said that we are trying to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability we've made progress on that but we still have further to go but again that's the the objective of the asset purchases is to provide near-term momentum to try to get the economy moving forward uh more quickly the second tool that we have is our rate policy short-term interest rates and associated with that is the forward guidance that we provided to the public about our expectations for when rates might change and in particular we said that we will not raise interest rates until at least until unemployment hits 6.5 percent as long as inflation is well behaved again i think as i've said before that that 6.5 percent is a threshold not a trigger there will not be an automatic increase in interest rates when unemployment takes 6.5 instead that'll be a time to think about uh the situation anew and given as i said the the weakness of the labor market the fact that the unemployment rate probably understates the weakness of the labor market given where inflation is i would suspect that it may be well some time after we hit 6.5 percent before rates reach any significant level so again the overall message is is accommodation um there is some uh perspective gradual uh and possible a change in the mix of instruments but that shouldn't be confused with the overall thrust of policy which is uh highly accommodative you know in that in that vein could you comment a bit on the fed's outlook for the economy because there are many who would argue the fed is actually optimistic at this point relative to many in the private sector well i think we're somewhat optimistic um the some of the material we've published the projections and so on are a little bit more optimistic than some private sector forecasters but i think a fair a fair viewing of the economy would suggest that there are some positive features out there some positive developments but there are also some significant risks that we have to continue to pay close attention to on the positive side i think you would want to start with the housing sector which um has been of course a major drag on our economy now for quite a few years and only in the last year or so has it really begun to turn around and show some strength which has implications both for construction for related industries and also for house prices which affect household balance sheets automobiles are also strong so i take that as evidence as alan blinder said earlier that monetary policy is working because those are two of the main channels through which uh monetary policy affects the economy i think a second positive factor i would point to is the state of the american household uh while there's still many obviously many great difficulties households in the united states have deleveraged quite a bit debt and interest burdens are down their wealth is up with house prices and equity prices and other asset prices having increased employment gains mean more income and sentiment is accordingly much higher so i think we have a somewhat stronger household sector going forward and then and finally i would just note maybe not finally but i would note that um the fact that our economy has come you know continued to to grow and continue to produce jobs in the face of uh very strong fiscal headwinds is is somewhat encouraging i think and there are other factors as well including um reduced fiscal restriction at the state and local level a relatively strong banking system which is providing more credit and a variety of other factors so there are some things i think that to make the outlook look more positive but there are also some risks which i think are very important for us as policy makers to look at first [Applause] it's still early to say that we have weathered the fiscal restraint i think it's very difficult to know how long the lags are between congressional decisions and actual spending and production decisions so we're going to continue to watch and see whether growth uh is resilient going forward for the rest of the year again our projections are that there'll be some pickup in growth but that does depend on um overcoming the remaining remainder of the fiscal headwinds um a second point which is worth stressing and i see my good friend jim bullard is here is the very low inflation rate um we are all very much committed to defending our inflation target from below as well as from above low inflation i know i know everyone is hard to explain to your uncle i know but low inflation is not good for the economy because very low inflation increases the risks of deflation which can cause an economy to stagnate it raises the real cost of investing and the evidence is that falling in low inflation can be very bad for an economy so the federal reserve uh is trying to keep inflation close to two percent we think that uh there are some transitory factors at work which have brought inflation down a bit more than uh is fundamentally the case in some sense we expect inflation to come back up but if that's not the case i think uh we we have to say that that would be a good reason to remain accommodative and to try to achieve that objective and i guess the final thing i would say in terms of risks of course is that we have seen some tightening of financial conditions and that if as i've said and as i said in my press conference in other places that if financial conditions were to tighten to the extent that they jeopardized the achievement of our inflation and employment objectives then we would have to push back against that so i think there are some risks now that we have to pay attention to but i think it's also the case that there are some positive factors that with some luck will generate somewhat faster growth and continued improvement in labor market conditions for the remainder of this year and into next year i have a question that comes back to the issues around communication and messaging that you talked about the fed has introduced a number of new communication tools over the course of your tenure are these changes all permanent or are there some elements of these new tool and communication strategies which are extraordinary policy that reflect the extraordinary times we're in in particular dealing with the zero lower bound well i think most of the things that we've done will likely be permanent uh not of course a future committee might decide to make changes to our projections or changes to the way we structure our minutes or other things that that could certainly could happen um i think that um you know the the the definition of price stability and the longer run a policy strategy i'm hopeful that that will be a long lasting innovation the uh the communications that are specifically related to the zero lower bound are particularly the forward guidance where we've tried to provide not targets not objectives but rather guide posts to help the markets understand and the public understand you know when uh we expect policy to begin to change um it may be that when we leave the zero lower bound and when the economy is in a more normal configuration that that kind of guidance won't be necessary anymore because as was the case prior to the crisis uh the markets can just look at the behavior of the fed and and essentially extrapolate that behavior um to understand what the fed is likely to do as the economy evolves um that being said uh there may be circumstances where this kind of guidance is uh is helpful and um i just note that we're seeing the federal reserve by the way was not the first to use this kind of guidance i just want to be clear that you know bank of japan the bank of canada have have experimented with these types of ideas as well and i think it's becoming a um an international practice that to various degrees in various places but uh i suspect that we'll see its use in in some context at least going forward but i don't think it is necessarily a permanent part of federal reserve policy precisely because we will be moving away from the zero lower bound and i hope will you know in a reasonable period of time we'll be in a more normal monetary environment you know on that international theme uh you talked about the tri-part right apartheid roles of of macro prudential regulation lender of last resort and traditional monetary policy we look around the globe the regulatory policies are in some cases done by an organization which is not the central bank do you see there as being a strong case for bringing that role inside the central bank or can you see circumstances in which it works to have the macro credential part in a distinct organization well different different countries have different kinds of financial structures as jean-claude was saying europe and us are different in many ways etc but as you look around the world the trend now of course is is for financial regulatory activities financial oversight uh activities to move back into central banks i mean that's happening in in europe that's happening in in the uk it's happening in the united states um and i think there's good reason for that um one very simple reason is that central banks tend to have the kind of expertise in financial markets and so on that that gives them a comparative advantage in addressing some of these issues um there's the fact that the central bank is the lender of last resort which there's a complementarity between that lender of last resort function and uh supervision of um of individual uh firms um and then i think generally that there is a macro prudential uh innovation now that that there is much more attention being paid to the broader financial system as opposed to the stability of individual institutions alone we do both we pay attention of course to individual institutions but we also try to think about the um [Music] the stability of the financial system as a whole and i think the central bank is uniquely equipped to have that breadth of vision uh and to think about how that stability of the financial system relates to its other functions particularly as you mentioned lender last resort and monetary policy so i think there's a good case for it um there are different institutional arrangements that can be uh worked out in the united states of course the fed has got authority over bank holding companies and and systemically important firms which means we have a pretty good insight into the largest most systemic firms but we share supervisory authorities in both banking and in financial markets with a range of other agencies and of course we work collaboratively with those agencies with each agency developing its comparative advantage in a particular part of the system that it's uh assigned uh you know a number of years ago you referred to a savings glut uh and today there are many who think that there is a shortage of safe assets in the global economy is that a view that you would agree with and if you do is it something that the fed should or or can do anything about well on the saving glad i would like to mention that there were a number of speakers today who talked about um going back to carmen reinhardt who talked about the current account and its role in precipitating the crisis and i this is one of the things that i i was a theme of my uh commentary before the crisis which was the idea that the capital inflows that we were seeing um related of course to our large trade deficit but also to the international demand for dollar reserves uh was in fact a potentially destabilizing factor and certainly was in any case making financial conditions easier than than they otherwise would have been and done more recent work with co-authors at the federal reserve looking at the european u.s relationship even though there was a much more balanced trade between europe and u.s there were large growths in gross inflows of financial flows from europe the united states which again were a demand for safe assets if you will which at the time there being a um an insufficiency of of safe assets in the view of many people the wall street was in some sense trying to construct safe assets through securitization and tranching and we know that that didn't work out so well um i think that you know there are some issues with uh with safe assets um in that uh besides collateral you know we have uh potentially uh increased liquidity requirements increased margin requirements and that may uh create some uh pressure on the supply of safe assets at the same time that you know we're having sovereign debt issues in some parts of the world which reduces the supply of safe assets so i think that's an interesting important question and one that we have discussed at the federal reserve i would say however that i do not think that our asset purchase programs are having a significant effect on that supply demand balance and the reason is the very simple point that when we buy assets and our total purchases by the way are pretty small share of the global amount of safe assets but anyway when we buy safe assets we of course pay for them with bank reserves which is another safe asset and one that's even more liquid so i don't think that our asset purchases are significantly affecting the um the net supply of safe assets but it is but it is an issue and one that we've looked at as we've thought about for example margining and uh liquidity policy let me ask about the the design of creative policies uh over the the last few years you know in the last say five years the fed has navigated a minefield of taking actions that were at the the edge of traditional uh fed policy uh sometimes generating questions about fed independence and challenges to fed independence and of course central bank independence is a topic that many of the audience members uh you know study and work on uh can i ask where you think the the greatest threat to central bank independence comes from is it from the the innovative policies on the macro prudential side and the the dealing with individual financial institutions or or the aggregate financial sector or do you think it's from the innovative policies on what i'd call the traditional monetary policy side uh dealing with the the stimulus type role well that's kind of a political economy question i'm not sure i can do it justice i mean to say a preliminary thing which is i don't think that the central bank should be equally independent in all of its functions there are good reasons to have independence in monetary policy making subject to a mandate or subject to objectives set by the democratic parliament or legislature and we understand those those those reasons having to do with avoiding short-run political intervention in monetary policy and the like but in many of his other activities you know for example as a bank regulator while we believe that bank regulators should be independent to make um their own judgments about the quality of banks i don't think the fed can presume to be any more or less independent in that function than is the occ or some other bank regulator it's just another aspect of our activities in in our provision of payment services uh there probably is no real case for independence and it's entirely appropriate for the congress to ask questions about about you know what we're charging for those services and how we're providing them and so on so i think it depends very much on the um [Music] on the aspect of um the particular activity that the central bank is uh is involved in so independence is a subtle concept i think the what it means varies according to the particular uh activity or particular function there's always so again so if we're worried about independence the place where all central banks worry about independence is mostly in the monetary policy side and there i think the best we can do is to to um do our very best to meet the mandate that that congress has given us if if we don't meet that mandate then they would have or if we don't meet it and can't show why we didn't meet it at least they would have a reasonable basis to ask why so i think in the long run the best thing we can do to maintain monetary policy independence is to show that we will take all reasonable measures to to meet the objectives that uh the congress has has set for us and of course that's uh what we intend to do okay shifting from the domestic pressures to the international pressures uh some have argued that in the last few years the policies of the fed and those of some of the the european central bank uh have risk igniting a currency war of of sorts uh i'm curious as to whether you view that as a you know an inappropriate argument it's simply wrong or whether there's some validity to the worry but it simply was a cost that had to be born uh as a consequence of other objectives that the the fed was trying to achieve well i gave some um remarks on this at uh at a london event for mervin king's retirement um and i and appropriate appropriate of today's discussion i used historical example i made the distinction of during the 1930s during the great depression as countries left the gold standard their currencies temporarily depreciated relative to other countries um and they had a temporary trade advantage because of that but over time as all the countries left the gold standard um exchange rates kind of normalized kind of went back to where they started from but nevertheless the whole world was never was nevertheless much better off because there was a a global monetary expansion which was desperately needed um at that time in 1930s so that was a a positive sum game it was a situation which everybody gains because the benefits of in that particular context the benefits of um growth enhancing domestic policies uh spilled over into other economies i contrasted that with the smoot-hawley tariff which was more of a zero-sum game where the i or even negative sum because what was uh going on there was each country was trying to divert trade in its own favor at the expense of its trading partners and as that activity uh continued and reprisals and um uh payback continued actually it destroyed the global trade pattern and was very costly to everybody so what has this got to do with your question i'm sure you're wondering um what it has to do with with the today is that it's one thing to use trade or other kinds of interventions to divert to artificially weaken your currency or otherwise to divert exports to your own producers at the expense of other other other countries that's a very different thing from a situation where countries are using monetary policy appropriately to achieve domestic growth domestic reflation and that growth spills over and helps the uh the economies of uh of other countries as well so i think that's very much the difference that um the the exchange rate effects and the currency effects are are really secondary what's important is that each country provide the necessary um uh monetary accommodation or fiscal accommodation to achieve uh to achieve its potential output and this i should say this view is it's not my just my own i mean this is a view that's been adopted uh by the the g7 and the g20 as a reasonable way of thinking about policy in in different countries so in in doing um combinative monetary policy united states again we are very much consistent with that g20 perspective and i i guess i would close this answer by saying if you look at the dollar it's not exactly falling recently it seems to be doing okay so i don't think we are trying to divert exports away from anybody else what we're trying to do is achieve domestic growth using the tools that we have okay this next question is going to take you back to the in some sense the historical perspective of your of your talk i guess it really has two components to it uh the first is over the first hundred years of the federal reserve do you believe that on balance the fed has given too little weight to issues of regulation and financial stability relative to other objectives and the second part of the question is that in looking at the lessons over this period are there there tends to be a focus on issues associated with the great depression in looking at the early years of the fed do you think that there are other important periods in say the first 50 years of the fed that can pay can can convey important lessons for thinking about current policy sure there are many interesting episodes um on the financial stability the fed of course was founded as i mentioned the fed was founded for uh the purpose of preserving financial stability um it had some success early on uh then of course the um great depression came and for various reasons uh stigma was mentioned uh earlier but i think there were other reasons as well including a lack of sufficiently aggressive policy on the part of the federal reserve the fed didn't meet its financial stability uh mandate during the 30s and i think that obviously the most egregious example of failure on that particular front now a less attention to financial stability during the period from 1934 until 1980 or so would be sort of understandable because uh because of structural changes and regulatory changes that was of course a very calm period in u.s financial markets and as a result the the attention to financial stability um uh became less over time as chairman volcker reminded us earlier though it's not just recently that we've seen financial stability issues a mexican debt crisis latin american debt crisis the the crises of the 1990s the wall street stock market crash and other events [Music] should have reminded us and did remind us that financial instability remains a concern remains a problem what what we lack what didn't happen fortunately of course is that between 1934 and 2007 there was no financial collapse of the magnitude that had serious negative implications for the u.s economy now that we have seen that and as i mentioned in my remarks that i think is a very important lesson and the federal reserve and other central banks have accordingly elevated financial stability increased the resources we put into uh helping to preserve financial stability and greatly emphasis increased the emphasis we put on that particular objective so um i think there was a long period where the fed didn't pay much attention to it and but it was a kind of an accident related to the fact that we did have a very calm global financial environment for quite a long time we now know of course that financial stability is extremely important even in advanced industrial countries like the united states and i suspect we won't forget that lesson for quite a while okay this is another question which must come from one of our economic historians the passage of the federal reserve act in 1912 was a substantial political achievement given the political tone in washington today if the federal reserve act had to be enacted how do you think it would be how do you think it would differ from the existing legislation and could it be passed well i'll tell you one thing there'd be more than one federal reserve bank in the whole western part of the united states that's my answer [Applause] okay on that note my last question is a is a legacy question at some point and i'm not going to ask you when you think this might be your time as chair of the federal reserve will conclude now i happen to know and some people here probably do that you already have a legacy that i believe no other federal reserve chairman has which is that there is an interchange on i-95 in dillon south carolina which is named the bernanke interchange and i will challenge anyone even in the economic history group to find another interchange on the interstate highway system named after a federal reserve governor uh but but all seriously uh as you think about the the legacy that you will uh will have as a as a chairman of the fed uh what would you hope the the high points of that would be and where would you like to see people focusing on the contributions well um of course that's going to be for others to to just determine i guess what i would hope to be able to say is several things first i came into the federal reserve as a governor now some 11 years ago quite a long time with a lot of interest in communication and transparency and uh i think you know in the last uh 11 years or eight years everyone account the federal reserve has made significant strides in in that area um including for example as i mentioned um the press conference um the stating of a numerical objective for medium-term inflation and other uh communications innovations as well so i think that's something that uh i think is quite has has changed over the last uh decade uh for better or worse of course i was uh at the fed during the crisis in the aftermath um we have uh you know the future again will judge uh the response to that but what is certainly true is that the federal reserve as an institution has changed very sharply in terms of its structure and the resources being devoted to financial stability questions and i would say that this relates both to the actions we took at the height of the crisis which i viewed as bringing badgett's wisdom the lender of last resort wisdom back into the modern context but also the work we're doing now to try to reduce the risk that another financial crisis will will hit someday that includes our monitoring our oversight of systemically important firms our stress tests which i think is an important development in uh in financial regulation and more generally our macro prudential approach to financial stability which again means that we look not only at individual firms as important as that is but we also try to identify risks and vulnerabilities to the financial system more broadly in monetary policy uh you know we've confronted the zero lower bound again people will have to judge whether we confronted it successfully but we've used new policies to do that and i think we have in fact changed to some extent our approach to one that is more tied to to the forecast and tries to lay out in more detail how monetary policy will react over time to changing economic conditions so there are some changes in in monetary policy uh but finally i think um federal reserve is a remarkable institution um it has a superb staff a great deal of expertise and i hope that uh during the time that i've been there um that uh we have succeeded in preserving those strengths and adding to those strengths increasing the amount of uh expertise we have in critical areas like some of the financial stability areas increasing interdisciplinary cooperation and work and just making the institution stronger as an institution going forward because i think one of the lessons i mean we had a very fascinating day today talking about 100 years of the federal reserve it's a central institution in the united states it has a very very important role in the economy and in the lives of of ordinary americans and it's critical that it be a strong well-managed well-staffed institution and these internal management issues which are pretty invisible i think to outsiders are very important because they're the factors that determine how strong an institution this will be over the next 100 years all right chairman bernanke thank you very much for joining us today [Applause]
