what i'm going to do today is i'm actually going to follow up on what gordon hansen has been discussing in terms of united states and some other industrialized countries and try to give you a sense of what we have learned over the past 25 years about how trade policy changes affect income distribution in developing countries one thing that i want to emphasize from the start is that it's not just the economists who agreed that their aggregate gains from trade even when we ask individuals in developing and developed countries whether or not trade and business diets are good for their country what's striking is that the majority of people both in lower income countries as well as high-income countries agree that there are aggregate benefits from trade this is data from global attitude survey and basically it plots a share of individuals in a country that say that trade is good for their country against the gdp per capita and you see at all levels of income majority agrees that trade is good where we find more disagreement is when these same individuals are asked uh how trade impacts uh livelihood of workers so the the graph here asks shows the share of individuals in a particular country uh that say that trade lowers wages uh in the top left corner uh trade um destroys jobs in the bottle uh in the bottom corner as well as say trade raises wages or says that trade uh creates jobs and you see that individuals in lower income countries are much more likely to say that uh trade raises wages and creates jobs whereas individuals in higher income countries are more likely to say that trade uh lowers wages and destroys jobs uh in both of these graphs what's interesting to see is how much of an outlier united states uh is so what i'm going to do today is i'm going to give you a sense of what we have learned over the past 25 years uh in terms of winners and losers of international trade as gordon mentioned economies have long known that trade generates winners and losers and what's important to remember that this happens in developed countries as well as developing countries and the second thing that i want to mention is that we in economic models even those that do not have any frictions on the labor market mobility or any frictions in the credit market we get predictions that trade will uh generate winners and losers and the actual lean model is uh you know an example of such setting and what that model which has guided policy prescriptions on trade would predict for developing countries is that trade was predicted to benefit the less educated workers and hurt the more educated workers in developing countries so in a sense what trade was predicted to do is generate aggregate gains in low-income countries and simultaneously reduce poverty because the less educated tended to be poorer than more educated ones and also by decreasing the wage gap between more educated and less educated reduce inequality what we have learned since the 1990s uh through numerous studies is that cumulative evidence uh on the effects of trade on labor markets in developing countries is much more nuanced you know by now developing countries account for over 40 percent of world trade and this integration of developing countries into the global market was in part driven by many large-scale trade policy changes that these countries implemented or policy changes that were implemented by their trading partners as well as the integration of china so uh unlike work for developed countries where we really kind of had to wait for this large shock that china represented to uh to trade trading patterns patterns of countries like united states in developing countries we had many natural experiments that we could study with very detailed data on workers and and firms to understand how international trade either through import liberalizations or through providing increased access to export markets has shaped earnings and employment of opportunities of individuals in developing countries so one important thing to keep in mind as we go through this literature is that in most studies in developed countries really focus on importing shocks whereas in developing countries we really have many studies that look both at you know the impact of importing shock where importing shocks can be well identified as well as impacts where exporting shocks can be uh well identified in reality you know because of general equilibrium importing exporting shocks are happening simultaneously it's just that like in some of you know when i'm gonna be focusing on importing versus exporting all i'm doing is i'm focusing on a setting when one versus the other can be better identified but keep in mind in reality all these things are happening at the same time within a country uh so what have we learned so number one thing that comes from this literature is that increased international trade is not the main reason for the increased wage inequality in developing countries and this conclusion comes from can i reduce form studies that penny goldberg and i have surveyed as well as more quantitative work that that el hanan helpman has has surveyed however we should not ignore distributional consequences of trade because trade policy does matter for earnings it does matter for employment opportunities that workers have and through that it does shape poverty and equality however we should uh you know what what we have learned is that there are no simple questions answers to questions such as is trade group for the poor or does trade increase inequality those questions are actually very nuan those answers to those questions are very nuanced and context specific they will depend on the type of uh changes in trade policy that or trade patterns that a country is implementing and they will depend on the economic mechanisms that are most relevant in that particular circumstance the the other thing that we learned is that they matter they really depend a lot on how mobile workers and capitals are across firms across industries and as gordon uh focused on in developed countries across geographic uh locations and the third thing that will really matter is like you know where in the income distributions are these individuals that are being most affected by uh by trade reform uh so let me give you uh you know some uh snapshots of specific uh you know more specific details from this literature uh you know in the past you know we either focused on um uh how workers um skills or education affect uh their uh uh matters for how they're affected by trade or industry affiliation what we have learned over the past 20 years is that workers firm affiliation matters as well we know now that firms differ quite a bit in terms of their performance within narrowly defined industries and we also know that better performing firms tend to pay their workers more and the third thing that we learned is that better uh performing firms are better positioned to deal with uh the challenges of import competition as well as they are better positions to take advantage of new exporting opportunities so through that uh international trade basically exacerbates initial earning differences between workers uh that work in better performing work uh firms and uh worse performing firms let me just give you a couple examples there for example we have literature that shows that um you know in import computing industries which will be suffering from increased import competition declines in industry employment tend to be very concentrated in less productive uh farms and that we have evidence on that from uh developing countries there's you know the import competition increases uh exit and declines in unemployment as well as gordon mentioned in developed countries on the exporting side we also know that exporting increases wage inequality between uh workers that work in better and worse performing farms why because better performing firms already pay better and on top of that when firms companies have opportunity to engage in new exporting opportunities uh the better performing ones are the ones who take can take advantage of those more and uh these they basically share their revenue gains or profit games with the workers that are employed in them okay however uh it's not just that worker firm affiliation matters worker education does matter as well and uh we you know in the past we thought that less educated workers are going to be benefiting from transportation episodes but what we find is that the skills that more educated workers uh have are actually uh also in higher demand when firms want to export uh from developing countries and the reason why that's happening is that oftentimes when firms want to export to richer countries from developing countries uh consumers in high income countries demand quality and production of quality uh it requires skill okay so basically trade also uh uh increases the wage gap between more educated and less educated through that channel the main thing though that i want to mention here is that all these uh findings that i just mentioned applied to workers that uh work in formal registered manufacturing firms okay and the great thing about these findings is that they simultaneously show how firms are adjusting to uh globalization shocks and how this affects workers but what we don't see is what happens to workers that have lost jobs because you just can't see that in this sort of data set the other thing that uh we can see and that is important is that this sort of data that generated this findings suggests that it is basically representative of a really small share of labor force in developing countries so even when we just focus on manufacturing formal registered firms employ 70 percent of manufacturing workers in brazil only 20 percent of manufacturing workers in india and about 42 percent of manufacturing workers in vietnam and we know that in many of these countries agriculture and services is where most of the employment is okay so uh and on top of that we know that people who tend to select into these formal manufacturing jobs you know tend to be more uh tend to be more educated so what's key to understanding how trade affects um labor markets in developing countries we really need to look beyond uh formal employers in formal registered firms in manufacturing because we we do know that informal sector or like we can call it just self-employment accounts for vast share of employment in low-income countries and that's uh you know in part that happens from family farms and also informal uh firms in manufacturing and services and if we think about kind of the stories we have in the back of our mind how traits could reduce poverty the usual stories is that like you know trace allows people to move from informal establishments to more formal ones uh which tend to be more productive or enables people to move out of agriculture subsistence agriculture to more uh more productive uh uh activities so fortunately we have actually a couple of studies that have shown that you know that trait has contributed to this process the first one is a study by uh bill garten and jessica light that has shown how china's wto accession affects structural transformation movement of workers out of agriculture to manufacturing in in china you can see it you can see that after china's entry into wwto which is denoted uh by the line in 2001 employment in agriculture has dropped quite a bit whereas you know employment and services manufacturing has been grown what they do is they basically take advantage of the fact that different counties within china were more or less exposed to declines and uncertainty about u.s trade policy as a result of china's wto and entry and what they find is that counties in china they were more exposed to these reduction in u.s uncertainty experience so in a sense they had like a positive export shock increased exports and fdi uh they have relative expansion of employment in manufacturing and mining and actual absolute contraction of employment inves and investment in agricultural sector as well as increases in total and per capita gdp and we know that you know basically the best way to get people out of poverty is through uh through uh to economic growth so this you know this is something that we would miss if we would be just focusing on many fact formal manufacturing firms uh similar you know similarly uh some work that i've done with brian mckegg on vietnam that focuses on the consequences of u.s vietnam bilateral trade agreement which mainly reduced import taxes on vietnamese exports to the united states so really made it much cheaper for vietnamese firms to export to the united states that that agreement actually enabled enabled vietnamese workers to move out of the informal uh sector to more formal uh two more formal jobs what we found there is that you know basically exporting influenced labor market outcomes of workers way beyond formal manufacturing in particular these export opportunities promoted workers to move out of these micro enterprises to more formal uh sector and it's not in what's really important with uh about that is that when you as a worker you shift from to formal sector that really changes how attached you are to the labor force in particular you tend to work longer and more regular hours you are less likely to hold multiple jobs you have higher earnings in the case of vietnam uh you also receive higher benefits and what's interesting is that you know stable jobs tend to be kind of the main characteristic of being in a middle class in uh in these developing countries as a kind of survey of uh by uh ben energy and duflo uh hashon okay uh again these uh you know these um uh if kind of positive influences of international trade on labor markets would have been missed if we just focused on uh formal manufacturing uh alone the third thing that i want to emphasize is that like in developed countries uh also in developing countries trade has highly geographically concentrated effects what's diff what's a little bit different in developing countries relative to the work that uh that gordon has shown is that we actually have many instances where people were able to evaluate the consequences of exporting as well as importing on local labor markets in developing countries and what these studies have shown in many contexts you know ranging from india brazil mexico vietnam china and south africa is that if you're an individual in a region that has high concentration of industry that's benefiting from a lower exporting cost you will fare better than individuals in less exposed regions and on the other side if you're an individual that lives in a region that uh where industries are mainly concentrated in uh import competi uh import competing sectors you will fare worse than individuals in less exposed regions so as economists we would think well why don't people then just move from you know low-paying to high-paying uh regions uh we actually do have some evidence that people do move toward better opportunities especially like we have that evidence from in vietnam and in uh in china however we have a lot of evidence that suggests it's really hard for individuals to move out of areas that were adversely hit by uh by uh by uh import competing shocks and that imperfect inter-regional mobility uh you know lasts anywhere from five to nine years uh for example nine years in india and uh and like in in places where we actually have data that goes you know that go where we can follow workers for even longer uh periods of time even up to 20 years so this imperfect labor mobility is uh is precluding people from taking advantage of uh new jobs in places where exporting generates these new new jobs again a good example of uh area of places where we can identify benefits of exporting opportunities these concentrated benefits of export opportunities in vietnam uh worked by my co-author brian mckegg and our follow-up work has shown that in vietnam as a you know during the 2000s aggregate poverty was declining everywhere however if you lived if you were a family that lived in province that had a high concentration of exporting industries that benefited from for example u.s vietnam bilateral trade agreement these families and workers observed bigger increases in wages especially if you were less educated workers you know as i mentioned before people were moving from informal to formal sector and there actually were declines in household uh poverty and some people were moving into these provinces maybe part of the reason why in vietnam this transition happened is that vietnam when vietnam was hit by these globalization shocks it had relatively young population in vietnam relative for its level of development actually had much more educated population than countries at similar stages of development and we know from other literature that younger and more more educated workers uh you know basically can more easily adjust to uh various shock but let's now look at the concentrated losses which could be you know well identified in india's 1991 import liberalization so you know the main policy change here was reduction in import domestic import barriers um again we know that during this time period for various reasons aggregate poverty in india was declining however if you are a family living in a district that was harder hit by import competition you experienced relative declines in industry wages declines in agricultural wages and increases in poverty and impo part of the reason for that is there was very low inter-district mobility of employment even nine years after onset of reform and you know uh this has been shown in very power breaking work by petty atta in 2007 and 2000 uh papers she shows that basically less than one percent of rural individuals moved uh within 10 years of trade reform less than five percent in the urban area uh uh people didn't you know out migration was not correlated with the trade shock and mobility was particularly low for for the poor and what she showed in her uh work is that part of the reason why this mobility was low was were rigid labor markets uh combined with some evidence that uh worked by kaivan munshi and uh rosensweig has shown uh uh uh that that shows that part of the reason why people in india don't move so much is because they rely on informal social networks uh within castes uh for uh for social uh social uh protection which provides this incentive to move away so here you see that you know how trade is going to be affecting individuals depends in part on the demographics for example in vietnam as well as kind of social norms uh in in in the uh society uh the the third thing that i want to mention the next thing that i want to mention here is that these adverse uh trade shocks can actually spill over to uh intergenerational consequences and for that reason be uh more long lasting in in some work with eric edmonds as well as work with petyato palova we have shown that one of the main channels through which trade affects schooling and child labor choices of families in low-income countries is family income so in the case of indian families and 1991 liberalization families in heart hit readers experience relative negative income shocks okay and what that meant is that school-age children so these are children that attend primary school so you know ages 6 to 14 and especially girls uh experience relative declines in school attendance declines in school completion rates and literacy and also that which translates into declines in lifelong uh lifelong income so this shows that like you know uh you know a negative shock to parental income can have spillover effects for the next generation and perpetuate uh uh perpetuates inequalities from uh through that channel uh the final thing that i actually want to mention is that these adverse effects of import competition uh are actually very persistent and can actually get bigger with time so uh you know gordon's work uh with david otter and uh and david dorn for united states provides some evidence for that another the second study we have on this amplification effects uh come from brazil and work by uh rafael dix carnero and brian koat they actually can follow workers like up to 20 years following brazil's domestic import liberalization 91 and what they show is that basically the negative effects on workers earning and employment and opportunities right after trade reform actually become bigger with time and part of the reason why that's happening is because people are not moving enough out of the negatively affected areas part of it is happening because of negative agglomeration economies but part of it is happening is because capital is adjusting uh really uh really slowly so unfortunately they can't measure capital directly but they can actually measure a plant entry and exit uh directly and what they show here is that if you look at the the first graph there is that you know trade reform decreases establishment size over time but what you see is that trade reform actually reduces the number of former establishments but initially just a little bit because if you made investments into your plant you want the capital to depreciate firms only slowly exits the market and you see how number of former establishment already slowly decreases with time that in part reflects two things it reflects that basically there's less entry in this more negatively or forms uh into this negatively affected areas and then there's this slow response of firm exit and that uh translates into decline in job creation as well as increase in job destruction that kind of increases with time because capital is adjusting slowly that's related to kind of the planned uh uh planned exit results for developed countries okay so inc to conclude uh i want to emphasize that it's not just the economies that agree they are aggregates from trade even public does but we also need to you know much more uh uh we want to do better job acknowledges that these gains are very unevenly distributed uh both in developed and developing countries uh we you know we also now know that you know that employment law uh you know that we have pretty large employment losses from import competition however i'm always surprised how much uh how much attention we we folk uh we spent focusing on those in a sense those are not surprising they are concerning but they're not surprises we always knew that trade would create jobs and trade would destroy jobs and that's the same thing that changes in consumer taste do changes in technology do it's you know it's it's an um it's characteristic of a healthy dynamic economy what's more concerning that we have learned from this literature is that uh in the united states and in developing countries uh the geographic losses are uh you know are very highly concentrated and they are persistent over time uh there is very little uh adjustment of displaced workers to initial trade policy changes and that these labor market consequences have spillovers to other community incomes including education of next generation thank you
