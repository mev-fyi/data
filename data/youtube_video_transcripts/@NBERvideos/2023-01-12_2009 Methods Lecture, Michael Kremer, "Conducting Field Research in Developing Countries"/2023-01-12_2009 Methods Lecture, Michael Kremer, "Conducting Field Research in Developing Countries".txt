countries I just wanted to acknowledge uh a number of people from whom I've taken some slides a key among them uh uh poverty action Lab at MIT uh but also Nava Ashraf Rachel glenister um and La Kahala Scotland Sam Asher uh helped with these slides there's been a Resurgence of field research in developing countries in the past 15 years and I many of you will be familiar with some papers in this area uh you can think of Esther duflo's work on women as policy makers I can think of the progressive work on conditional cash transfers which started in in Mexico but through uh randomized evaluation we're able to quite definitively establish the impact of this program and as a result it was uh adopted why you know brought into Mexico and adopted in in uh you know 30 some other countries uh there's been work that has had a big influence on questions that were very difficult to get at on a lot of theoretical interests like uh uh Carlin and zinman's work on moral hazard versus adverse selection um there's the series of papers uh um on uh on Bank on credit or shareholder protection around the world also based on uh primary data and on you know regulation other things so um what you know this is this work has had a had a lot of impact this talk is really designed to provide some practical sort of how-to tips on how to do this um there's going to gonna in the morning I'm going to talk about field research in developing countries uh things like survey design a bunch of so very nuts and bolts issues like that in the afternoon I'm going to focus on randomized evaluations in developing countries so obviously when you're doing a randomized evaluation you also have to worry about about survey design so but so the the first set of issues will be uh you know applicable to randomized evaluations as well but also uh applicable to studies like uh like you know to things like Andre schleifer's work or Chris udry's work which is is not using that technique typically um let me start off with uh with the question so some of you are are already committed to this field but some of you haven't yet uh drunk the Kool-Aid so let me sort of talk about the pluses and minuses of a conducting field work and development and then go through some some practical issues on survey design a focus on you know there's obviously questions on for measurement for a whole bunch of different areas some issues come up when you're looking at consumption or profits of small businesses in developing countries which are very different types of record-keeping than businesses in in developed countries uh talk about attrition issues um there are a bunch of uh seven eight and nine are a bunch of practical issues I may move them up depending on how timing is going uh and then talk about some some uh some recent work suggesting that the active measurement May in fact affect Behavior Uh which uh this is the mere measurement effects which is is of concern uh for a lot of empirical work so you know whether to do field work in development well there's two questions first you know whether to work on development as a development Economist I guess I'm biased on this one but the uh the one reason to work on developments that's where most people in the world are roughly 80 percent of people there's also the the problems are particularly important uh you know if you think that the if you've got a log you know cons you tell that you know a lot of utility then you know the margin the value of a of a little bit more consumption in the developing world is going to be very high but at the same time there's much less research in the developing world and here's a quote um uh or a some statistics from a paper by dosto shaines and srinivasan so just you know huge uh hugely more papers on rich countries than poor countries turns out by the way it's the US may not be that much of an outlier this may just be largely explained by a straight GDP relationship but poor countries have a lot less research on them okay now you know another reason aside from the importance of the problems and the relative uh scarcity of research is that there's some opportunities to do things in developing countries that might be difficult or more expensive elsewhere so there's some types of data that you can get that you know might be difficult to get elsewhere you know for so for example you know that we basically this is a a natural randomized experiment but it turns out that there's randomization on who goes on the Hajj you know it's very difficult you know people have come up with a very interesting identification strategies for getting the effect of religion in in uh in our society but you don't have that many randomized you know natural randomized experiments or uh somebody who just recently graduated from the Kennedy schools from Vietnam you know he just asked it for a big firm in Vietnam for data on the bribes they paid and they happily handed it over you know um um you know they kept the kept very good records of this so there's sort of some data you can get that you wouldn't be able to get elsewhere okay um the um it's also just cheaper so if you're interested in experiments which I'll mostly talk about in the afternoon it's often just much cheaper to run these experiments in in a developing country uh surveyors are you know it's much cheaper to hire survey enumerators um and the cost of intervention you know to make a difference relative a substantial difference in the per pupil spending in the U.S is going to be for a significant number of pupils or schools you know fantastically expensive Beyond most of our research budgets um it's it's actually you know quite doable in uh in developing countries doesn't it it's also because uh ngos sorry that's development speak for non-profit organizations they play a huge role in a lot of developing countries um and so they can be spending amounts that are very significant relative to to uh government budgets and they can they're they're not serving the they're not expected to serve the entire country uh they're so they can you can get a lot of variation from that either non-experimental variation or as I'll talk about in in the second half of uh their scope for experimental variation and of course they don't have all of the constraints the governments can do they're more afraid to try new things okay okay so so suppose you want to work on development um should you do field research okay this I think there's in there's a certain sense in which uh the wave of field research has been so influential people sometimes assume that if you're going to work in development you have to do field experiments or field uh field work I I don't think that's the case there's a lot that can be done with the existing data sets um and there's more and more data sets that are available I'm not you know there's many of them I'm just putting up a couple here but there's a DHS and lsms surveys these are household surveys from many countries around the world that are set up in comparable ways and are are available electronically and there's increasingly firm studies as well if if those are so if if those are sufficient to answer your question then that's definitely the way to go um you know collecting your own data is just it's it's very time consuming uh both in the sense of it takes a lot of time for it to happen also takes a lot of your time as a researcher and it's also risky you can be doing this and it can turn out your data is no good or you can't collect your data after spending lots of time developing your questionnaires so you know if you can use existing data sets that's definitely the way to go okay one caveat to that is I think if you're if you're interested in working in development not so much as a one-off project but on a longer term basis it's useful to have experience in in developing country uh that just helps in figuring out what questions to ask and what you know thinking about what the hypothesis should be it also helps in sort of reality testing certain data um you know if if you see should you believe data on the number of kids who are who are enrolled in school or should you even think about does is the is the question of uh enrollment in school the right concept or is it just kids sometimes go in and out of school and so you needed you know data on whether kids are there on a particular day that's something you'll have a feel for if you've spent time in a developing country might not be otherwise but you don't have to get that experience by doing field research in developing countries you may be might be from a developing country you might have spent significant time there as a Peace Corps volunteer or you might have relatives there um so but if you are going to do field research uh where to do it uh so just to come back to this so if you don't have you know if you don't have uh if you do want to work in development and you um you know aside from the particular question you're answering if you don't have that you know sort of on the ground experience it's probably a good idea to pick it up at some point in your career or um but doesn't have to be immediately where to do field research well I think it's always easier to do it in a place you already know uh so if you're from a country uh it's it's easier you know it makes sense to strongly consider doing it there and um if you think about uh some of the you know there are lots of examples of very nice work uh done from people who are who are from a particular country um for example the work on property rights in in Argentina or the work on water privatization Argentina by Sir Grodsky and and uh uh uh dutella and uh Galeana um if you're doing multiple projects if you are there's a lot of advantages so a lot of my work is in Kenya I think there are a lot of advantages to you know some people Dean Carlin will be doing work in you know 15 different countries at the same time I think at least in my case I find it easier to to stick to try and concentrate it just to cut down on on uh on you know sort of uh fixed costs of travel and also of learning about a particular society um you can think about where collaborators and Survey infrastructure are available those are those are pretty important in in doing work uh rural versus urban areas um in rural areas transport costs can eat up a lot of your budget getting from one uh one household that you're surveying to another in urban areas you may be able to reduce those costs but there may be other issues of safety or crime uh numerator salaries might be higher okay what are reasons not to collect field data well I've mentioned some of these already just to go on into a bit more detail you know there's a real you know you're dependent on permission from the governments and from permission from the people who are giving you the data and you know there can be that takes just as in when you're collecting any data that requires a lot of Face Time and sometimes you can think everything's going well and then it it ends you also may be relying on a survey firm in a society where there may not be that many survey firms and they may you may get delays on that end um you know data quality can go wrong you can realize you made a mistake in your data collection and need to go back there's the risk of natural disasters or human disasters uh um the post-election violence in Kenya sort of required an interruption and field work for several months and there's lots of management so it's time consuming so it's not something to get into uh too lightly but um okay if you are collecting data um there are a lot of different potential methods of of collecting this um so it's you typically useful to start off with some sort of qualitative research to think about what the possible hypotheses might be um to the extent that you can find existing administrative records that can make your life a lot easier they typically have very high coverage so if you're you know that um but it's worth it's worth spending some time trying to understand that data sometimes there'll be official incentives we'll distort those so for example uh in India schools will get subsidies per per child enrolled so they want to report very high enrollment uh that doesn't that enrollment doesn't necessarily mean something or it could just be lack of incentives they may not bother to collect the data accurately attendance data you know maybe they're the teachers are just filling that out at the end of the month or the end of the semester um surveys are are cost more than getting administrative data um and they allow you to develop the questions you need but one problem is people may uh distort their true preferences so if you're asking about sensitive questions say sexual behavior you know you may have problems true preferences or behavior um some things that are worth considering that satellite data is you know increasingly available and can be used for um you know more and more things so there's a papers that you can use this to get it uh at Forest cover if you're interested in issue like deforestation turns out I've just been I'm interested uh Esther duflo and John Robinson and I are interested in fertilizer use so we were thinking well we go out and we survey Farmers about whether they're using fertilizer and when we were doing sort of small things this was uh this was doable but we're now thinking about trying to get at social interactions and learning so we might want to get at this at a large scale I just learned uh I'm not sure this is going to be right but uh two you know real scientists as opposed to us economists have told me that you can actually find out how much fertilizer has been used through Satellite photographs and they can figure out how much nitrogen is in is in crops so there's more and more that can be done with survey data obviously it's a way to get a lot of data at reasonable cost very big setup costs in using fertilizer data it takes sorry I'm using uh satellite data but it may be useful GPS to you know when you're doing surveys it makes sense to your GPS locations another way to get data is to generate your own administrative data so for example if you're handing out a coupons for if you want to understand take up of a product you can hand out coupons for that product and then you can have data on Redemption of those coupons and that can be that can be cheaper than actually going around and surveying people okay and obviously you're getting actual actual Behavior and finally you can do some things that are trying to combine sort of coming from the social experiment tradition uh where a lot of the development uh field experiments come out and the the lab experiment tradition you can ask people to play games and there's a now a fair amount of evidence that those are quite correlated with uh real world behavior in uh in in uh certainly in in Social experiments but more broadly uh they can be you know it's expensive to do those and you obviously need to know what you're doing on and think about what you're measuring in this particular context one one issue that you know may be more of an issue you know that applies I think in a developing country context applies to games so it probably applies to you know certainly applies to surveys as well you know people may be answering questions with hoping to get Aid so aided in many developing countries is quite significant and people may and because there's so many ngos out there they may be trying to answer strategically um and they may be trying possibly they might be trying to play games strategically although we don't know that for sure um you can also if you're interested in in uh sometimes you're interested in political or social processes these are often very difficult to uh to get you know random variation on in a in a developed country context but in a developing country context sometimes you can get you know lots of interesting variation with us um so there's a community a whole set of Community Driven development projects out there so this is a very popular among certain development donors right now which is ways of organizing the community having discussions to get them to decide on what development projects to do and there's a view that this is going to help lead to better uh to improve social capital and that will show up in more participatory decision making in in other contexts okay there's it's a whole Theory you can who knows whether it's right um if you're interested in those issues you could actually observe political processes um so you know that's obviously quite expensive to do um but you can if you're sitting in them on these meetings and and uh you can you can get a lot of a lot of data and it's a situation where people have incentives to I say costly for people to hide their true preferences maybe that's the wrong way of putting it uh people will you know people may be behaving strategically in a political situation for all the usual reasons uh but it's costly for them to to behave strategically to impress the enumerator um so you can observe an existing a village meeting and see for example are women speaking in the meeting so this is something that uh Esther duflo and rohini pande have have looked at and shown that in villages in India where uh there's been reservations of the Indian word for affirmative action for women um there's so a woman has been the leader of the village later uh they showed that women are more likely to speak speak up in meetings afterwards um to do this you're going to need the same type of event held both in the you know in the treatment and comparison areas and you need to know when the event is going to happen so you can show up to observe it um but it can be a useful way of collecting data so in addition to sort of the standard surveys uh uh you know just you know in addition to surveys and uh and games and you can observe actual political outcomes um let me talk about a few different types of uh let me talk about some general issues on survey design and then I'll go through a you know looking at some particular areas um okay so in thinking about thinking about surveys you first have to start out with what hypotheses you want to test and then think about what variables or combination of variables you need to test those hypotheses typically good rather than making up questions from scratch to sort of check existing surveys and there are a lot of them out there they're online you know everything from the world values survey to lots of you know sort of household consumption surveys that have been put together by the World Bank and others generally good if you're to think about not just the final variables but also some of the pathways and get the intermediate variables and if you're trying to collect data in in an area where others have expertise say a medical area you know it's very useful to get uh advice from them let me give you an example this example from the U.S but in moving in the moving to opportunity study they wanted to get just anthropometric data height and weight of people you would think that getting people's weight is a pretty straightforward thing to do do you really need to bring in the doctors to tell you how to measure somebody's weight turns out that actually getting weight is pretty tricky and in the U.S case the people had difficulty the numerators survey enumerators had difficulty with there were pounds and there were kilograms on the scale they got messed up and it was very hard to use this data uh I'm you know they may have eventually fixed that problem it was a significant problem for them at the time and certainly uh you know we've had you know my own work we've had problems getting that very basic height and weight data um yeah so one reason is experts can help you get it better but a second reason is if you're interested in communicating with Beyond economists to to a broader audience you know the doctors may just not listen to you if you're not using the right type of scale and you know I in many cases I think were we economists are right this is if there's noise on the on the uh you know if there's noise on the on the left hand side of the equation uh and you know with them we don't have to worry about it that much but that doesn't mean the doctors are going to say it that way and you know you may want to communicate  with them education is obviously that's another area where I've worked where there's a lot of expertise in the in uh in among you know experts in that area obviously there's cost of doing this of bringing this in and you know how much you want to spend uh how much effort you want to spend depends on the size of your survey and the important centrality of this variable uh there's very much I think one thing we that needs to be done more is to I'm going to be you know many uh guidebooks on sort of doing field work are sort of less of you know do everything under the sun without worrying about budget constraints and I'm going to be a little bit guilty of that myself but I think you know the step forward in thinking about these issues would be to sort of be very explicit about budget constraints and you know we started to hear some of that in the previous talk about um when you're thinking about sample size but doing that more more I think is is something we should you know we need to do okay so actually that's my next slide considering the constraints um so you have to think about how long do you want the survey to be um you know how how you have to trade off the number of observations you have against the length of each observation if with a fixed budget you also have to think about what's the what's the capacity of your of your enumeration team and what's the capacity of the respondents provide the information their willingness and their ability now in general uh people in develop people in developing countries are much more willing they have a lot more patience in answering questions than people in rich countries you know we just you know you get the phone call and you hang up um generally the poorer somebody is the more willing they are to to spend time with those survey firms so if you're doing you know farmers in developing countries they'll spend a lot more time than if you're doing shopkeepers so you know um and and so so there is more room there in the developing country Senate but there's still some important issues uh first people may not be willing to provide accurate information and the in that case you may want to try to find proxy variables so um the uh Ester de flow pascaline dupa Samuel sanay and I were involved in a project looking at HIV AIDS education and we thought that that might lead the that that treatment this is a this was a randomized evaluation we thought the treatment there might lead people to self-report safe sex or or no or no sex so we looked at pregnancy data instead thinking that you know risky sex can be uh can lead to AIDS it can also lead to to pregnancy and this was a primary school population so we thought uh um that might be an okay uh proxy there are problems with that as a proxy it's not that you know that's a separate a separate discussion but you know thinking about things that are observed that are sort of harder to fake might might make sense um okay um I think it's also worth noting that people's you know where possible if you can get objective outcomes uh that's that's desirable so Ben Elkins did work on corruption in Indonesia you know a lot of the corruption perception work uh finds that ethnically heterogeneous societies have more corruption and that is that had been you know that I mean that had even been used as an instrument for uh for uh it turns out that uh in Ben's work he finds he actually looks at corruption and road building they actually um takes a sample from the road to see how much how much of different types of material had been applied there to measure the amount of corruption uh relative to what was the amount of material that was supposed to be there that's one common form of corruption turns out that there's a systematic systematic measurement error ethnically more diverse Villages report more corruption uh holding constant the actual amount of corruption so to the extent that you can move you can get harder data that's a that's useful okay okay um I mentioned using publicly available instruments you may need to adapt those okay just uh for the local Society um let's move over this a little bit further it often makes sense to design a questionnaire by module so rather than sort of skip around from topic to topic I don't know whether I'm doing that in this lecture but uh um uh you know a well-designed lecture a well-designed questionnaire will um we'll tend to um we'll tend to cover one Topic at a time and that makes it easier both for the enumerator and for the um and for the for the respondent usually so you see something here called metadata that's things like when was the interviews conducted who was the enumerator it's very useful to keep that if you later find out one of your numerators is making up data you want to know who did which interview for example you also might want to test for enumerator effects or doesn't make a difference if there's a male or female enumerator asking the question um collecting the household roster early makes sense that's that's before people have lost patience with you when you're on you know cousin number 15. if later if you get a list of all the cousins or all the people living in the household and there's you know eight eight of them then later when you're asking how much time did each person spend collecting firewood you know you haven't left some some of the uh out okay um makes sense to start the questionnaire with some straightforward things if you're going to be asking about sexual behavior or you know which political party did you vote for probably put that towards the end so you get uh you can't get as much data from people as possible even though people in developing countries are often more patient in answering questionnaires um you know you should so you get surveys that are five to six hours in some cases that the World Bank does um you know you should still try to keep this under control if you can do it faster that's good um you should write out your questions these are just some common sense things but they're you know it's that's what I think it's worth spending some time on them so the interviewer can read them verbatim you don't want each interviewer sort of taking some question like main occupation and translating it his or her own way because then you may get very different questions asked to different people the whole idea of occupation you know for example isn't as simple in a developing country where lots of people are doing for four or five different jobs at the same time you know they're Farmers but they're also in the offices and uh doing some trading for example um if you can you know if you if you if you keep questions simple and singular sort of rather than asking sort of complicated and or uh questions that that makes sense so breaking them up okay um it's worth specifying who's the preferred respondent so when the survey enumerator shows up at the household who do they ask for and that depends on the question you're asking and then on the way the society is structured but typically if you want to if this is if you're interested in child health you probably want to find the the mother of the youngest child for example um um if you're asking about expenditure maybe the household head okay um it's good to write up a guidebook or a manual with precise definitions of what you mean by things you know what's a uh what's a what's a household that's complicated as Society for example where there might be polygamy and you know do you mean uh do you mean the mother and her children plus the husband or do you mean all of the co-wives um having um instructions within the questionnaire for the enumerator often sort of broken off typographically either all capitals or italics or something like that can be quite useful including skip codes you know if yes then skip to question 37. um and definitely pre-code the questions try and use as much uh consistency as possible you don't want one to mean yes some places and no other places and you know male and female should be coded similarly you clearly want don't know questions don't know codes um so if the questionnaire is going to be if the respondents are if the questionnaire is going to be administered in other languages probably write it in if you're I'm assuming that you'll be writing your questionnaire originally in English maybe that won't be the case but if you're writing it originally in English then translate it to the to have someone translate it to say Swahili or whatever the language will be and then have somebody back translate it and then look at the back translation and see if it corresponds to the original okay um you obviously have to field test the instrument as well okay um you often find that it's a few questions which are causing your enumerators most of the trouble in the interview and you're sort of talking to the numerators which questions are problematic and how can you improve them can be very valuable I mean talking you know the enumerators are a very good source of information okay um let me give some examples here this example from Sierra Leone um they asked people you know what groups are you a member of and you know somebody said I'm not a member of any group well then if you develop a list of groups what they switched to was they developed a list of all the groups you know the the uh the religious groups or credit association rotating credit associations if you have a list of the groups and you say are you a member of this group are you a member of that group et cetera that's a that's a much better way of collecting data and in this case you know they may not have wanted to say this for fear that uh you know this they may have been hoping to get um to get Aid okay here's a case where you know somebody said that they were community members said they were involved in a decision even though the enumerators had seen the person who made the decision make it without consulting them so you know there are a number of issues you have to think about okay measuring consumption so one diff so the standard question to ask is to get at socioeconomic status in in a rich country would be income if you income people it's typically people measure income rather than consumption and you know in a society like the United States where most people are getting a regular salary or wage you know that's uh it's very easy to it's well defined people will know it so it's much more expensive in the U.S context to measure consumption people are consuming all sorts of things in developing countries it's much more typical to measure consumption um obviously these are theoretically very different concepts because there's some theoretical advantages of consumption that's smoother um people may be more but there's also a bunch of practical things people may be less reluctant to share information on it if they're worried of asking somebody how much money they made they may be worried about taxes or are you going to try and take some from there are my Rel neighbor is going to find out and ask me for money um the um it's also you know quite conceptually difficult if people are running some sort of small-scale business because they're you know what's what's personal what's business um is is quite complicated obviously you get the same issue showing up when you're trying to measure business profits okay um consumption is generally easier because people aren't often aren't consuming that many different things let me um you clearly want to get at home consumption sometimes in-kind consumption from employers consumptions from stock from what you had at home okay um let me skip about price data but that can be an important issue okay I'm going to skip over this a little bit one one issue is uh is how to how long yes how what what recall period to ask for so you could have a people are more likely to remember consumption over a short period you know what did I yesterday as opposed to what did I eat over the last week on the other hand there's more variation random variation of what you ate yesterday you know maybe you had if you have meat once a week you know maybe it was a day you had meat maybe it wasn't um so it's nice to if you're just concerned about averages you can just ask have a short recall period and it'll average out across the respondents on the other hand if you're interested in getting at higher moments of the distribution then you might need to ask about uh about longer periods if you want to get it if you want to get what's the distribution of mediating and if everybody's eating meat once a week you'd falsely conclude that some people already meet every if you only asked about yesterday you'd fall you might falsely conclude some people meet every day and some people never eat me okay um clearly you want as much consistency across your different modules as possible these can make these aren't just theoretical concerns you know huge quite huge differences so you know the cheapest way to uh Angus Eden is shown sort of the cheapest way to reduce poverty and in India would just be to to reduce the recall period right um so um so you know moving on to perhaps even harder challenges if you're trying to get data on firms I'll Focus here on small firms but I I think there's a can be another set of issues for larger firms um a little bit of a digression there I think there's a lot of you know interesting a lot of the research is focused on micro Enterprises but obviously uh there's a lot of room for for additional research on on larger firms um so you know most firms I'm um so demell McKenzie and Woodruff are thinking about very small firms are not you know are not keeping records not paying taxes they're moving money back and forth all the time between household and business accounts um you know businesses in general will have lags between their expenses and their revenue and they you know I think in either small or large firms the owners may be very reluctant to share information the large firms you know probably have also are very worried about you know taxes and governments there's issues about how you value family time small firms family members are probably doing most or all of the work how do you value their time if they're sitting there watching somebody's watching the store and watching their kid how do you value you know should you attribute the when you're calculating profits for this firm what wage rate do you attribute to them so they did a bookkeeping experiment um where they asked firms to keep Ledger books and they had people come and observe the firms they found big gaps between if you take the reported revenues reported uh expenses sort of took the Gap you know you found that that did not do too well um in fact the correlation between profits and the difference between expenses and and revenues was you know under 0.5 so they argue that you should just ask I'm not I haven't done work on the Saturday myself so I'm not uh I'm not really you know competent to judge but they those people who've worked on this a bit think it's better to just simply ask you about profits straight out um let me I'm actually gonna let me just I'm going to skip ahead to some data collection issues here uh and then before coming back to to our attrition um so okay um so it's worth it's good to okay there's lots of opportunities for things to go wrong in data collection so you should you want data supervisors who's checked the work of the interviewers and you need a checklist for that of things they should check where all the we're all the the was everything filled out that should be for example they should also do some some revisits um if you're getting doing collection in multiple rounds get the GPS location get some data on questions that shouldn't change over time so you can check it okay um you should definitely do a pilot um okay and you know often in the pilot you'll find out additional things sorry there's a some problems with my slide so there's a little bit of repetition here um okay um you might want to randomize the order in which you some things about your data collection process the order in which you ask questions the characteristics of the enumerators how frequently you collect the data and if you find that the answers are varying a lot that's a red flag okay data entries another place where you have to put in a fair amount of attention it makes sense to enter data as quickly as possible ideally you've got this going in real time so you can if you're if they're problems you can catch them if you wait talk if your data gets entered you know six months after all the interviews are done then if there's a problem with the way your interviews were being done it's too late to change it now the real way to do that and what clearly I think people will be doing in the future is collecting the data and having skipping the data entry step altogether the data would go immediately into a laptop or a PDA or into a cell phone and there and straight to a database The Kinks and all those systems haven't necessarily been ironed out so you know a number of people I know are you most people I know are still using paper uh paper survey forms in in developing countries but I think I hope that will change soon um Chloe you want a good data entry base to reduce uh measure data entry are do the double entry of the data and then do some checks okay um and then you know do data cleaning after that to look for problems okay let me come back to these uh these budget issues let me come back to okay in um so attrition in if you're doing a panel survey so if you're doing a randomized evaluation you're almost most the time you're going to want a Baseline and an end line but whether if it even if it's not a randomized evaluation it's often people want longitudinal data in developed countries the main reason you get attrition is because people say I'm sick of you I don't want to be interviewed anymore that's much less likely in developing country but on the other hand it can be hard to find somebody because um you know households are splitting up um consolidating there's a lot of migration a lot of temporary migration people go to the city to work for a while and addresses may not exist in a codified form you might also get that the enumerators don't want to don't feel like they're not willing to talk to somebody of high status so many surveys don't keep a lot of records of attrition so clearly you should keep a track of that here's some data from uh Thomas frankenberg and Smith they showed that there's a systematic relationship this is in Indonesia between the likelihood of attrition and income okay it tends to be the higher income people who are going to go move in this case okay very low income and also the higher higher people so if they they would have if they were interested in what's what are the trends in income in their sample over time they would get that wrong if they're not accounting for attrition but the other thing that they showed so they just went uh took sort of a you know maniacal approach to we're going to minimize attrition and we're going to find people so what they did was they got information from Neighbors relatives Community leaders to try and find out where they are if they were in the local area they you know during the field work they tried to find them if they'd moved then they sort of collected a bunch of names and then they went to go find them so um I've been involved in similar things in in Kenya with you know Ted McGillis uh taking the lead on when you do that you can actually get with a with some effort and it is a lot of effort and expense but you can get you know quite High uh follow-up rates and you know some of the work that uh Thomas has done so Justice makes a real difference okay but it does it raise the total budget by 20 what you know whether that's going to be important uh it may depend on what you're doing okay cell phones I think are going to make this a lot easier over time now you can collect uh and but asking you know you can also ask for people have lots of relatives so in the initial uh survey you can say Okay who in your family would Who would know you know in your family or elsewhere would know where you might be if you're not here and do you have a cell phone number for them um you could also budget for tracking initially there's various things you can do to adjust for attrition obviously if it if uh it doesn't uh work out let me I'm going to come back to uh these mirror measurement effects let me discuss a couple more um a couple more administrative issues uh beforehand um sorry I'll go back in order okay so attrition is one thing that can be handled here's something that I think is quite worrisome and this is um this is you know new work that's being done um by a variety of authors that start I think some of this started with uh Dean Carlin and Jonathan Zinman this is work that suggests that surveying people can affect Behavior so generally what they're doing here is they have some data some random variation in who is surveyed or in the frequency with which they were surveyed and then they have some administrative data or other objective data on take-up of some product like a financial product an insurance product or a health product so the in four out of five of the cases they looked at and this is not um you know this is not yet complete work maybe it'll turn out you know maybe it'll change they found that the people who were surveyed were significantly more likely to take up the product so in other words if you get surveyed about health you're more likely to take up health insurance later okay this wasn't a survey that was pushing you to take up health insurance um they found this for in for health in the Philippines for micro credit and Morocco micro loans in India um so there's a large group of people who may wind up with a joint paper on this let me see if I've asked her to flow and abigene Banerjee are involved I've got this in the some other section of my slide which I can't find um and um you know I may be involved as well um I'd been doing uh I don't know whether it will be a single paper or not but um let me tell you about the work that we did so I've been doing work on water treatment and diarrhea so there's a huge um so basically we were studying the effect of cleaner water on on diarrhea diarrhea kills uh two million kids a year so it's a it's a very big health problem and so we collected data the way economists would normally do it we got a large sample of people and we'd interview them about diarrhea it turns out the public health people think that the way they typically do things is they have a smaller sample and they go back every two weeks short recall periods are are relevant so we so we went back and tried to do it the public health way having not adequately taken the advice here of you know sort of learning about the way uh people in the field do it it turned out well I'll argue we economists were right in this case but uh um so we had bi-weekly a uh prevalence measures and we had these sort of annual data from a comparable population it was random which type of data collection we had so if you looked at this uh sort of solid line these are the ones that had bi-weekly monitoring so you see the diarrhea prevalence sort of Falls a lot over time see that could be seasonal effects as they're flooding as of the rainy season or the dry season but what we noticed was these households that were getting less frequent monitoring which should have been totally comparable these were all comparisons there were treatments going on but these are all comparison households they had much higher levels of reporting so reporting went down from 20 to 5 percent okay and that's um and if you look at the the households that had less frequent monitoring it sort of at the 10 level so it looks like the very Act of asking people about diarrhea is changing their reported diarrhea now that could be for two reasons could be that could be that it's changing the reporting Behavior they know that if you say yes my kid had diarrhea then you get a whole bunch of extra questions you know was there blood in the stool et cetera maybe people aren't so excited about discussing all those things so they just say no my kid didn't have diarrhea but it turns out that we it's not just that it seems to have changed actual Behavior not just reporting error because we tested their water to see if there was chlorine in their water and people who had more frequent questions about diarrhea were more likely to have chlorine in their water so there were more so what so the very fact of of measuring seems to affect behavior um this is um you know this is an as I said earlier this is an issue not just it's a for randomized evaluations but it's an issue for data collection more generally one way to deal with this you know one lesson we took from this is you know this may be a problem even with infrequent data collection but the more frequent the data collection the more the more a problem it is okay um okay I talked about data collection management already talked a little bit about some very practical things about budgeting and finance for these so it's important to you know there's a real trap of not budgeting adequately for this so it's very easy to sort of say to sort of work out a Bare Bones budget but not include any overhead for the people who are doing this not allow for things to go wrong not you know sort of assume that the existing exchange rate is going to be there that your numerators are going to be if they could that they can do four surveys a day and they can do that every day when in fact there's going to be some days when the roads are you can't get out out because the roads are too muddy or because you there's a scheduling problem of some other sort um you'll need to resurvey some people because you know you'll find that you had a mistake in the questionnaire probably those are all things that can go wrong but they're also things that can go right you may have opportunities to do some new things that are very excited uh with a little bit of extra uh uh budget so it it's better to don't promise too much or you'll find yourself in a difficult situation okay what are some funding sources I've put the NSF up there I'm putting that up there not so much because it's a big funder for this sort of thing but because that's what probably most economists are are familiar with um the funders for this type of work are often very different in a lot of ways let me start with the NIH which might be you know which like the NSF is going to be thinking about this from a scientific point of view so the NIH relative I hope I'm not going to you know offend people here and uh end any future funding but um the NIH relative to the NSF is they're very um they're very detail-oriented so they're going to you know they they'll you know they'll want a lot of details on exactly how you're going to do everything um and you often have to go through multiple rounds with the NIH so it's not don't get too discouraged if you applied the NIH and you get turned down they you know it's that's standard and you typically have to come back there's some where that might be changing I don't know whether it actually has okay um the um the other two funders I have up here and obviously there are lots of other ones are are even more different so the World Bank the World Bank has a research Department which has some funding but there's a lot also a lot of potential operational funding in the World Bank there it's very different than and um then either of these research fund is you know their their ultimate job is development not research and they're bureaucratically quite different and they have lots of different parts of money each I mean this may be true for any funder they're special programs in the NIH or NSF where they have a particular topic but those are likely to be very tightly delimited at the World Bank they have a pot of money you know the the World Bank you think of as having some large you know billions of dollars but they actually have you know lots of money in different accounts for very particular purposes you know this is for vocational education in Tanzania so if you happen to be doing something on vocational education in Tanzania you might be able to access that money but the difficulty is how do you find out that they have a pot of money for vocational education in Tanzania and even if you read the the materials it may not be very clear because it may be described in terms that only makes sense to somebody who speaks the bureaucratic language of the of the World Bank and only somebody within the World Bank may know I'm not generalized about the World Bank as a whole there's all sorts of pots some of which are much more open but but there are certainly some things where only somebody who's working in on the education sector for the World Bank in Tanzania would be able to if you happen to know that person they may be able to explain to you that that money is potentially applicable to something you would want to do so um that makes it sort of potentially hard to access either very hard to access that that type of funding or very easy um if you know it's worth trying to established some relationships with if you're working in a country on a long run basis it may be worth establishing a relationship with the the World Bank people working in that country because there may be you know if they have an interest in research and you know many of them do a lot of them are PhD economists who are quite interested in research others have no interest in it but it's probably worth uh filling those people out and there may be um you know there may be opportunity to support some of your work um there's the Gates Foundation which you know particularly for health work but not just Health also you know microfinance and other things uh it's a big funder in development again they're they're really not you know they're they're they're into scientific research developing new vaccines but their social science research is not what they're about so it would be it would be incidental if you happen to to qualify but you know you might particularly if you're doing you know certain areas um but there so because these these latter two funders are very much about development rather than about research your proposal relative to say a proposal you'd write for the National Science Foundation um you have to spend a lot of time talking about how you disseminate the results within the country and they're going to Care also a lot about capacity building within the country I don't mean to claim that these things aren't at all important to the NSF you know they there's those there are analogous things that are important to the NSF but I think the weight the relative weights um you know my impression at least uh is the relative weights are very high for uh relative to what you might be used to for some of these other funders another thing is that These Guys these funders like um they like co-finance it okay so if you it's very I think it's very much like co-authorship right if there's two or three authors on something and you add up the credit they each get it sums to more than one uh similarly if the you know the World Bank is funding part of it and NIH is partying funding part of it and uh usaid is funding part of it they can all they can all claim credit to their bosses for helping get this done and uh there's another advantage of co-finance and I think bureaucratically which is you won't get in that much trouble if you can say well if the World Bank person can say well I think it must have been scientifically good because NIH approved it so there can be sort of hurting effects of that type um and that means that you can often have a sequence of funders so you may well you know particularly for projects that go on for a while and are expensive you may get some funding initially from one funder and then funding from other funders later on um one other thing about this is the people who read these don't speak um you know they don't necessarily who judge these don't necessarily speak economic jargon so you should think about um you know what language you use and of course they may use their own language which which you know we may have to learn um an example of this was somebody who was you know coming out of a behavioral economics literature taught and was interested in working on uh sex workers talked about the self-control problems of sex workers and the reviewers thought this was incredibly Politically Incorrect and that wasn't uh you know that in fact they were just using the standard uh behavioral economics terms so you know you should you know you you know choose your language carefully when you write okay um okay there's a lot of um I want to talk to some about the approval process obviously one thing that we're familiar with I'm not going to spend a lot of time on is our human subjects approvals um so those are those who think of uh primarily on the U.S side but there may also be um uh approvals to go through in the in the in the country where you're working they take a they can take a lot of time um so it's important to when you work out your timelines and your plan to to budget for that uh don't don't set yourself up in a situation where your survey has to start at a certain date if uh without that date being far enough away to to go through multiple iterations with the human subjects people there are some issues that are going to be different in a developing country and developed country context a variety of them but let me point to one which is oral versus written consent there may be many cases so written consent would obviously be the standard in a developed country context in a case where people are illiterate you may want to go to oral consent there's a second reason why oral consent might be appropriate which is if people are sort of partially literate they may be able to sign their name but they may be very afraid that if they're signing their name to something they're signing away their land or something like that and so the whole idea of consent is quite standard to us but it's quite alien in in these settings you have to do it as a human subjects requirement but it's uh it's something that uh because it's alien people may be scared to sign their name and not because they don't they're not happy to answer the questionnaire but because they're worried about what else it implies I've generally found that if you talk to the human subjects committee about this that they're they're flexible but I'm sure that varies from Human subjects committee to to commit there are other permissions permission from the national government there's also permissions from local authorities um so it's often the case that if you're working in a district there there's a there's often a matrix organization to a government in a developing country so there'll be somebody in charge of a district and then there'll be somebody in charge of Education you know then there'll be an education Ministry so typically you need to visit these people if you're you know you can't just go to the national government and get your study on education approved you probably also in each of the districts you're working you have to go visit the district commissioner as well and the district education officer um that's a time consuming process but it can actually first if you don't do it you're going to wind up with more problems later on because the Headmaster is going to say I can't do this without a letter from the district education officer even though the you've got a letter from the national government but second um you can actually make use of these as key informants so if when you're visiting them um in some cases they can help you find the people that you're looking for that might not be so relevant for schools but it might be relevant if you're if you've got a list of households and you're trying to find them the assistant chief in the area might be able to take you around to find them um they are they in fact they might even be able to get them to come to their office so you can interview them there um they may those guys may be quite upset if you skip them you know they don't want people messing around in their area without stopping their office first and what if you're going to talk to them you might as well collect some information from them so if you collect and they may be much better at answering certain questions so um yeah I've been found this a problem I know some people who are working in in uh poorer and less developed countries in Kenya people have you know uh rural people may have trouble um estimating distances uh and uh to you know to say the local hospital or the capital or things like that but the head of the local government presumably is going to be more able to do that so okay um let me um uh let me uh let me uh wind things up here so I've sort of gone through a lot of areas where you know a lot of things that can go wrong and a lot and sort of mentioned a lot of steps that you have to take to deal with them so these things as I said earlier are ten do tend to be a huge amount of work to to implement on the other hand if you think about the list of papers that I talked about earlier these are things that have clearly having a very big intellectual impact there are also things that are having a very much having a real world policy impact um and our in some cases uh uh so just to give an anecdote from my own experience one of the um you know one of the things that we worked on was um trying to understand why kids aren't in school who are in school and we looked at a whole variety of different things a whole variety of different programs working with a non-profit organization in Kenya uh everything from you know paying for school uniforms which households such a bicycle meals turned out the thing that made the most difference was treating kids for worms and this you know you could treat these kids for worms for the medicine costs two pennies a day huge proportion of kids are infected and you know this is something that first you probably if you're thinking about this abstractly not spending time in the field you probably probably wouldn't even have gotten onto your lust spending time in the field sort of gets it onto your list and then once it's on your list doing this sort of field work can establish it can establish the fact and the ways to deal with causality but also can establish them in ways that are are very convincing to policy makers and you know with that evidence obviously in some cases things will be politically you're not going to be able to you can have all the evidence in the world and it's not going to make a difference to policy but if you have something that like this that's you know very cheap that's not particularly politically controversial this is something that if you have the right policy makers in place uh they may listen to it and as a you know in particular in this case the government of Kenya decided to scale up a treatment for worms and just treated uh three million kids so this is an example of how this sort of field work can have a very big impact in the real world and uh you know I at least find find that uh despite all of the the work involved it's it's worth doing so let me um let me end there and maybe we can have some you know discussion and questions I'll talk more about experiments in the afternoon yes yeah I that's a great um you know that's a great uh uh Point um so first I think there can be a lot of complementarity between uh field work and use of administrative data um so again let me give an example for my own experience um Colombia did a um did a uh a school Voucher Program um and the school voucher program they ran they randomized the school Voucher Program not for um not for research reasons but for fairness reasons um we wanted to collect data on what the impact of this was so we did some field work we surveyed some people et cetera this was very expensive very time consuming High you know we had pretty high attrition rates if you we were able to get less of the people who'd originally applied to this voucher and compared the lottery winners and losers so we you know very nice identification but when we were trying to get test score impacts you know we got a sample of people we brought them into a testing center gave them tests but you know we had a lot of attrition in that and it was a relatively small sample size okay later um so we had some results but you can argue about how convincing they were later we were able to link this data to data from the National High School graduation exam that that Colombia uh provides and you know there we we weren't able there we were able to basically find out whether people got through high school or not so we had a much larger sample much lower attrition much lower cost uh to do the same thing so I think linking up with either administrative data or survey data you know can be very valuable um let me mention another thing in response to your your question which is one thing I think uh people who do certain this sort of field work should do and they're probably not as good at it as they should be is um is get the data out and publicly available so that a survey can initially be done for one purpose but you know other people may want to may be able to use that data for for other purposes people who who are not able in a position to do this uh do field work themselves and there can be you know lots of reasons you know personal reasons if you've got family and kids you may not be able to spend that much time in a in the field white people but there's you know it would be I think making that up data available to other people would be very socially beneficial one of the uh a little bit of digression but one other point I wanted to make is there are lots of areas in which the the institutions of the profession are not set up optimally to to incentivize things um you know that's one example the you know there's uh the the rewards for getting the data out and publicly available in a timely fashion are not as big as they should be it takes work to do um you know normally it's part of a grant proposal but people people take longer to do it than they than they should uh and I'm certainly guilty of that myself um um so was that answering your question or am I or is there more right they just said right so you're thinking maybe a survey is going on a a national sample survey and you could go in reinterview some of the same people in that survey um yeah I think that that could be potentially be very valuable uh you obviously need to get cooperation from the people who did the original big National sample survey yes interns or you know early stage graduates yeah another great question so on the section on data I think I managed I don't I I don't know if I might skip that slide accidentally but um there's survey firms that collect uh data those survey firms often don't do a very good job and we can think of all sorts of uh Contracting reasons why you know from from uh from uh you know from that branch of Economics why this would be a difficult relationship you're asking them to do a lot of things that are are not very directly observable it's often a One-Shot game they don't necessarily you know they don't necessarily do that that great work and many of their clients don't need work done to the same standard that academics do they're often often they work for firms that sort of trying to get some sense of you know how much demand for for fans or air conditioners that might be in rural India and they just want to get some rough sense of What proportion of people you know own those objects or thinking about them um so so in that time so I think some people use survey firms successfully but even in that case they have to have people on the ground monitoring them very closely where it's more of an employment relationship rather than a contractual relationship what most of the researchers in this in this area do or I don't say most many the other strategy that many researchers use is they have their own teams sort of who are more or less regular employees down to uh down to you know maybe not down to level the lowest level numerators but certainly supervisors who are working on one project after another certainly my own work have done a lot of work in Kenya many different projects and there's enumerators who've worked on many of these projects um in those settings it's pretty common to have um people who come after either grad students or post-docs or people often people straight out of undergrad who've done very taken undergrad classes and done very well who go spend time working on this and spend a couple of years in the country the other thing I think is is uh very important to to uh to do and is um is to work with collaborators in the country and they're likely to have you know the best uh you know much deeper understanding of the institutions than than uh than somebody who's going over for two years after you know finishing at Stanford I mean some of those people from Stanford are great I'm not I'm uh but it's also good to have collaborators who are based permanently in the country yes right um so one um one thing I would say so so uh certain part of the reason for these lectures of course is to try and you know get some of the some of the more obvious pitfalls uh sort of warn people about but there's always more of them um and so first it's possible if you're a PhD student at the LSA you know it may well be that there's a researcher at MIT who would love to have you working on on his or her project um so poverty action Lab at MIT does a lot of um it's obviously a center at MIT but it's also a center that provides services for a lot of people working not in field work in developing countries in general but randomized evaluations and it um so researchers who are affiliated with j-pal who whether or not they're based at MIT will often advertise for uh positions there and uh so if you're coming from the Alice if you're a grad student obviously there are people if you're a grad student they all say there are plenty of development economists to work with there but um your you can if for some reason you want to work on a particular project that somebody at MIT is doing uh you can or somebody at Harvard or Berkeley is doing you can uh you can advertise you can respond to One of Those ads um I would there are many cases you know so look a lot of people do this through this sort of mentorship system that you've talked about but not all of them by any means so you know there's there's a H let me you know thinking about my own experience you know I'm working in in Western Kenya um you know Ted Miguel was originally did some you know was a undergrad at MIT uh and you know now he's uh Professor birkeland is doing research there and had sort of had that apprenticeship system but you know Ben Oakton for example you know he had spent a year living in Indonesia before he started uh grad school and then he went back to Indonesia and did an extremely large-scale randomized evaluation there um and it wasn't as if he had spent time sort of working as an apprentice as an RA on a project in uh in Kenya or India beforehand and there are many examples uh like that as well so um uh so it's it's it's it can make things easier but it's not necessary yes right um and then the other one that I wanted was that you might want to address when I worked for the world bank until 18 later on Christmas one of the first day and so forth to reassure that the Institute of confidentiality of the data I could not reassure of individuals and so um that's um so thanks that's a very helpful comment so maybe there's a way that um I don't know what the procedures are here are at the bureau but maybe there's a way we can I can get uh some sites to those uh and put them on on the on the web so that people who who see this can uh can reference that um I'm showing people about confidentiality um that's too clearly there's consent statements in uh in in interviews and there can be um you know there's obviously there should be procedures for how you handle the data as well um most of my work has been with individual individuals and relative you know sort of farmers who tend not to be quite as concerned about this as you know larger as businesses clearly would be and you know the more larger the business probably the more concerned they'll be uh I would say that in in developing countries there's generally more willingness to um to work with researchers than in enrich in richer countries is my general uh experience but I'm sure there's uh I'm sure there's plenty of counter examples to that as well oh yes researchers that is some of it's going to be local you can't ask your answer yeah I work and some of the questions are already out there right if there was a centralized life of the questions with the concepts they're trying to get it and so then people can almost do like right yeah I I completely agree there's a lot of Reinventing that we all that goes on and and you know some some local adaptation is is uh sometimes local adaptation is not needed but uh but I think there's there's you know this is another area where we probably need um some institutions are slightly different incentives than we currently have they're at the same time it's worth noting that there are some data sets out there that are very nicely comparable across across societies so you know DHS data is available in a lot of countries and it's pretty easy to to you know run a regression with data from 40 countries uh uh using that data set first um let me start I'll start out by talking about you know why why do randomized evaluation as opposed to just field work in general uh then about the practicalities when to randomize how to randomize talking about issues of size and Power and then issues in the analysis of the data so you can think about doing randomized evaluations either to evaluate a particular policy question or a particular program or to explore theoretical questions and of course there's often in the same uh same paper you may be doing both I think one thing that we've often found in doing randomized evaluations is that you wind you can wind up in covering new questions that you hadn't thought about there's a sense in which working with this type of evaluation sort of forces you into a confrontation with reality Let me Give an example I've done a lot of work on on education uh so we looked at a variety of things I mentioned the deworming result before but we looked uh we looked at incentives for students to to do better we looked at spending you know spending on class size you know hiring more teachers to reduce class size spending on non-teacher inputs you know one of the things we found was if it's quite reminiscent of the previous paper is that kids are scoring way way below uh the the norms for which the curriculum was set and in that sort of setting we've looked at uh incentives for kids you know Financial incentives and financial incentives seem to have helped in our Kenyan context um but the effect that they had was you know moderate I it was good I mean I think there's a there's a role for uh for Merit Scholarships I'm not trying to knock that at all but one thing we realized in looking at the things that uh that various development economists have looked at in some quite similar results in Kenya and India on this is that there seem to be very because the typical class is pitched very differently than where the kid is there may be a large political economy reasons for that there can actually be very high payoffs from orienting the instruction more towards the level where the typical child is at now that's if you think about X post that's pretty obvious but that wasn't the sort of question that a lot of economists were focused on initially uh it's something that sort of looking at the data and dealing with the situation uh you know brings you to in our case we're looking at the impact of textbooks we saw that textbooks didn't seem to raise test scores looked at the evidence more carefully realized that they were raising test scores for the kids who are at the top of the distribution but not for the kids in the bottom three quarters of the distribution basically those kids were having trouble using the textbooks at all and then since then there's been more work to try and sort of do remedial education or or uh or or split classes up and that and find big gains for people throughout the just the distribution uh from from splitting classes up by initial achievement and allowing teachers to concentrate their teaching um so so uh what have been lessons from uh from from uh you know the sort of wave of randomized evaluations um I think the lessons from them suggest that it's worth doing more of them uh first is you know I think if you looked 20 sort of thought 20 years ago people thought that these sorts of and I'm not thinking of the the lab experiments I'm thinking carrying this very much from the opposite of the spectrum the social experiment uh side people thought that social experiments were things that you know they thought the negative income tax experimental brand health insurance experiment these experiments in in the 70s those were evaluations which were very large scale very expensive um I thought this was something that could you know sort of very rarely be done and sort of very much agree with John that look there are barriers to entry here but this is something that we found can be done just by doing them we found out this can be done much more broadly than we thought before um a second thing we found is that the results often differ from non-experimental studies so this is you know in the in the U.S context we think of La Land this has been repeated over and over again in uh in developing country context as well that I'm more familiar with um you know to take one example the there's a big policy debate on what's the impact of higher of charging fees for health and education and there's been there's been a big non-experimental literature arguing that people are not going to be necessarily that sensitive to price with you know identification strategies that weren't crazy were the you know the best the you know at the frontier of the technology available uh to people using using uh techniques like how far you know how far people were from school as a measure of cost of getting there you can argue with the identification but it seemed reasonable and now that we've got you know more experimental evidence it looks like there's a very big impact of price so sort of a pretty key uh parameter was was pretty widely off that's a lot of policy interests but it's also a lot of theoretical interests because it's not clear why why a very small price difference if you're thinking about should I go to school or should I not go to school why should a a few dollars you know be very weird mod yes theoretically you could have a whole bunch of people who are just in the just in the margin of indifference of whether to go to school or whether or not to but um probably behavioral model is more plausible and there's some you know recent work that sort of Narrows this down and and you know uh provides more definitive evidence that that you know you need to go to behavioral models uh to explain these price elasticity so uh but the general point I was trying to make is that uh the results of from experimental work often differ from non-experimental studies it's hard to go it's it's um you know that suggests you can have various explanations for that but in many cases the most plausible one is that the identification assumptions between the non-experiment and underline the non-experimental work is is leading you astray um so historically there are a number of ways uh of types of experiments these large of us uh typology that's uh probably you know overlap slot with John's but uh differs in some ways there are these large-scale evaluations in particular government programs uh negative income tax experiment there are lab experiments so sort of psychologists would do an economists uh Now do and then there are programs taking advantage of existing randomizations that were done for other reasons say the draft lottery um the I think the way of of of new experiments that's come in development economics I think comes in part from started with uh collaborations between ngos and academics so you know and in my particular case I'd um I taught Secondary School in Kenya after college and then I I went back to uh to visit some friends of mine after after as an assistant professor I A friend of mine was working for a non-profit and his job was to pick some new schools where they would start their program and I said you know have you thought about thinking that this was a crazy idea but might as well ask you know have you thought about choosing twice as many schools and starting in in uh in in you know randomly choosing have to start the program and you know they agreed and it turns out that that's not such a rare experience that you know certainly there's some some non-profits that aren't going to be able to do this but some that something that will and then once you've got a relationship established with an organization and it's been mostly ngos but I think in the future it could be for-profits um you can you can then conduct a number of uh of these evaluations and that really radically cuts down on the fixed costs so if you think about you know the barriers to entry the the fixed costs are barrier to entry but you know the flip side is once you get started you can continue once if you compare this to the sort of old uh 1970s experiments this allows a bunch of alternatives to be examined if you're trying to implement if you're if you care about a particular outcome whether that's getting more kids in school raising test scores you can compare a variety of Alternatives in a similar context and then you can Benchmark against them for against them against each other for cost effectiveness um you can also have an iterative process so you can develop hypotheses and then test them further so we find there's a lot of price sensitivity why is that well there's certain behavioral models that might give that and maybe we could we could test them um the sort of two developments that I think are are worth flagging in terms of sort of the technology for doing this one is working with firms um which uh John mentioned and the second and uh second is sort of researchers sort of building up their own NGO to some to some extent and that's um that's some extent that's what uh IPA uh Innovations for poverty action has done that uh Dean Carlin heads um but again like j-pal operates uh in large part it's a resource for researchers working in this area foreign Frontier is using lab experiments in randomized experiments together so there's a couple of different ways you can do that you can use results from the lab as covariates as interaction terms so for example um Ashraf it all look at a Content they have people pay play live games to see who's subject to a sun cost effect and then they see whether they do they do exhibit the same behavior in a real world case you can also use results from the lab as outcomes so um so to flow look at a case where there's political reservations for women and then say um and then find that after you've been exposed to a woman a woman as a political leader they then as an outcome they say they look at how do you react to a speech read by a man versus a woman how do you rate the quality of that speech and they show that after you've been exposed to a female political leader you're more like you write the female better relative to the male this is you know different some people randomly assign female some randomly assigned males um so how the I mentioned there's a couple of different purposes of uh of these of randomized evaluations and the way you design the randomized evaluation may depend in part and when you can uh do it may depend on part on what the primary purpose is so if you're mainly interested in policy you may not I think this is something where there's uh perhaps not as much clarity as there should be you don't I don't think there you should be you should be doing randomized evaluations uh everywhere if you have something that you already know works there's no point doing uh doing another randomized evaluation on it on the other hand if it's very early stages it's probably premature you first want to do some piloting and sort of you know get to the stage where you've got a some prototype um if the second issue is um you want to do a test if you're thinking about something that your training program and somebody has an idea of a training program for uh entrepreneurs and you think you want to roll this out as policy um then you'd want to test it in realistic circumstances you wouldn't want to spend if these are micro entrepreneurs you wouldn't want to spend two thousand dollars training each entrepreneur you wouldn't want to say we're going to find the best uh the best trainers and have them do this program because you're not really testing a realistic scalable policy on the other hand if your primary purpose is test in theory then there's a very then you really want a strong first stage and it may in fact make you may not be relevant it may not be a problem that you've got to uh you're spending a lot of money and you may not have uh uh a situation that could be scaled up so let me give you an example on uh the issue I tend to spend a lot of time thinking about right now which is water um and sanitation uh there's a paper and uh from where our researcher uh got a whole bunch of uh trade very good field workers trained them to visit households and encourage them to visit to wash their hands they went to these households multiple times a week and the the what they found was the huge improvements in health for these households but that's not a scalable policy I think it's still a very useful study because this was a doctor he was interested in in trying to understand what's the relationship between hand wash and health then the next stage of course is that research useful for policy well not directly you can never replicate that but it it may but what that research suggests is we now need to think about from a policy point of view are there ways to change Behavior to encourage hand washing more and maybe that that should be something very different that could be uh trying to maybe the implications we should try and get running water Connections in people's house or we should subsidize soap or uh or something like that but you know that's an example from from medicine but I think we can analogously in in uh more social science settings if you're interested in testing a theory maybe you don't worry about the the realism and the affordability of this okay so that's some some background on sort of different reasons why you might do randomized evaluation one is if you're looking for a um if you're looking if you want to get a uh believable or well identified uh evaluation of particular policy and you feel like you don't have you know there are going to be some cases where you feel like you've got strong identification from other methods but there are other cases in which people may not be totally convinced by that random randomization can provide a strong identification and the other is it may be that it's randomization is useful in shutting light on a theoretical question okay if you're going to do randomization how do you do it well there's a number of different designs you can use I'm going to go through uh uh several of them so the first and simplest is just a pure Lottery okay um that's going to be useful for example when a program is over subscribed so when programs are over subscribed these are and if if the program is naturally discrete these are often put in place for fairness reasons okay so the draft lottery uh some people are going to be drafted and you could argue the draft isn't fair at all and that we should allocate this by by cash but given that that uh there's going to be a draft and the certain number of soldiers are needed that's used or to take another example I mentioned the the the example of places on the Hajj uh uh that's naturally a discrete uh you can't go halfway to Mecca I guess um the um so the lottery is done for fairness there so this is can be you know very intuitive for people it's transparent so in many cases people like these that's something that I think researchers uh sometimes have trouble imagining we think oh how can you randomize things people in fact what we found in the field maybe this is developing country specific people often like a computer-based lottery or a lottery where they know researchers are involved because they otherwise assume everything's going to be allocated in a corrupt way so they feel like you know they like a lottery um you know the disadvantages while the control group might resent this in some cases um I think a lot does depend on the context and you might get differential attrition and that would be a big concern if you didn't have cooperation from the control group okay another there another approach is well called a partial letter there the program officer might have very strong views that some people are very well suited for a program other people are not suited so in that case you may not want to work may not want to randomize the people who most you know if you're thinking about the donors for example um you know they may not want to if you're randomizing do we contact the donor to try to to try to persuade them to give money to our University well the donors they think are really going to give a huge amount of money they're not they want to go after those no matter what if the donors who who are the graduates who've never given a penny and who've gotten 20 solicitation letters in the past maybe they don't want to waste postage on them but there's going to be some people in the middle and there may be willingness to randomize there okay uh so this was an example with the expansion of Consumer Credit in South Africa um so that can be a very useful technique if if uh if pure Lottery doesn't seem feasible this partial Lottery May work another approach is uh is randomized in Phase it so you could have a program that eventually is going to reach everybody but you've randomized the order in which it's phased in so in many cases uh particularly if you're working with non-profits they're going to they're not going to launch the program all over the country initially or all over the area where they worked initially anyway they're going to phase it in so it's just a matter of randomizing the order um and that can an advantages that could can encourage cooperation from the comparison group relative to a pure Lottery a disadvantage is that this can make it difficult to estimate long-run effects because everybody gets treated it's just difference in the dates in which they get treated so some people so you have a situation where some people have longer exposure than others but if you're trying to look at long run impact that's you're trying to tease out something pretty small um okay um you also have to worry about expectation effects perhaps the fact that people know they're going to be treated later changes their behavior in some contexts that'll be something to worry about in other contexts it's it's probably not um and economic theory can probably provide some guide as to when when we think that expectations of the future might matter okay um another approach is to randomize within a group so um let me give a concrete example um the Ester do flow apogee Banerjee uh Sean Connery Linden I looked at a program of remedial education in Indian schools I referred to this earlier um so they're providing remedial education they I mentioned earlier the very high intra cluster correlations across schools some schools have do much better than others on on test score measures so they want randomizing across schools is going to have you'll have limited statistical power one way to deal with that is to within some within the same school say all the schools are going to get treated but some will get treated in third grade some will get treated in fourth grade and we'll make that random okay um obviously concern with that is there might be more contamination maybe the third graders have so have uh have siblings in fourth grade maybe some people uh some third graders decide some people who are in third grade who would have gone on to the next year decide well I'm going to stay back a year because I know this program's coming up uh no particular reason to think that was a issue in this this case but just you know in general that's a that's a potential concern yes another concern is even if something like this works in theory these things have to be implemented in practice and there's maybe a greater chance that the messages got confused and one of the treatment schools wound up one of the schools was supposed to third graders were supposed to be treated you know fourth graders got treated instead um another approach is rotation so everybody gets treated some people get treated today and not treated tomorrow other people get treated tomorrow and not treated today um that's I think that's called a crossover uh study in in the medical literature um you obviously in some ways get more data um you have to worry about expectation effects again in medicine they don't worry about that very much but uh for for in in economics we would um and again that's going to make a difficult to estimate the long run effects Final Approach is encouragement so there are some cases in which it's not really feasible to exclude people there might be a social program that's written into law that everybody's eligible for the best case for this is a case where take up is low but can be influenced and again that's the case for a lot of social programs a lot of social programs there's a lot of people who who don't either they don't know they're eligible or they know but they can't quite get around to signing up uh happens helping people sign up um you know can can boost take up rates a lot so that allows you to randomize at the individual level even if the program isn't implemented at the individual level there are two concerns with that the first is that the active encouragement itself might affect the outcome variable you might imagine it's whether would let me I'll discuss that more in the next slide but in some cases that's something to worry about in other cases it's not another another issue is that what you're doing there's going to be partial compliance with that some of the people who are you encourage still aren't going to take up some of the people you and didn't encourage are going to sign up um so you're going to be estimating the you'll be estimating the local average treatment effect for the people who complied with the encouragement is that uh you know you depending on the on the setting that might be exactly what you're interested in if you're if that's a policy you're evaluating but in other cases you may be interested in a in in some some other parameter okay so let me give an example of of when you'd be worried about the exclusion restriction you know if there's a if there's a if you have a credit program you're trying to understand you know what's the impact of of getting credit well if you're training people in part to encourage them to take the training the credit then you'd have to worry about the direct effect of the training if you're just providing out more more information more marketing efforts that might might work okay I wanted to uh talk about um cross-cutting treatment which is uh or what uh people in medicine will call a factorial design so these are quite common in a lot of the economics field experiment literature and developing countries um and there's a number of advantages of them so you'll have to um the the key Advantage I know I said there I said there are a number of advantages there's one really key Advantage which is you economize a lot on data collection and on fixed costs so to give an example um work with uh estradu flow and and pascaline Dupont and Samuel cenae we were looking at this HIV AIDS uh project I mentioned earlier you know one of the treatments was was providing education uh about AIDS another uh another approach was just paying for school uniforms which allowed people to stay in school longer now you know these two treatments potentially they could interact with each other if you're looking at an outcome like HIV AIDS you need a huge sample because it's a very rare outcome even if you're look we were looking at pregnancy but even with pregnancy it's a rare enough uh it's a rare enough outcome and we weren't that optimistic about these treatments having a big effect that you still are going to need a very big sample this becomes very expensive to do if you take that sample and you divide it into four cells one of which gets hot so the half the sample so let's say a quarter of the sample gets both free uniforms and education a quarter of the sample gets uh but no no education education but no free uniforms and quarter of the group gets gets neither then you're going to be able to uh if you're you're going to be able to measure the impact of free uniforms conditional on half the sample having had the HIV aids AIDS education half the sample not having HIV AIDS education so you can measure the main effect but you're going to be measuring a different local average treatment effect than you would be had you not done both programs you know is that a problem or is that not a problem it depends whether the whether the the other elements of the of the program that you're looking at are are elements that are um that you think are going to have you know make this a an uninteresting sample to look at I'd argue in that case you know this is uh it was worth it to try and look at more treatments okay um another advantage of this is that you can explicitly look for interactions but you know I'm making the argument that the main reason for this is cost savings so I'm going to presume that we're not we're not doubling the sample when we're looking at two things um so your power on those interactions may not be that great I think in general the way that economists do this you typically don't have a lot of power on the interactions obviously you could choose a big enough sample so that you have uh and when and explicitly go after the interactions um by the way I I'm happy to is this a happy to have comments or discussion in between I don't know if this is uh this is something that in a medical audience would be very controversial they really don't like this I think part of the reason they don't like this is they're worried that um that in practice things are going to get confused and you're not going to get the the treatments being implemented the way they were supposed to um you know another advantage of of doing cross-cutting treatments is sometimes the design is such that it very naturally allows you to get it at uh at other at a variety of effects so we did another class size experiment where so in the Kenya move to free primary education when they move to free primary education there was a huge surgeon in uh in enrollment particularly in the lower grades so you've got a situation which class size in first grade was you know eight average you know 80 or 80 or more okay so in that setting we looked at a class size reduction uh program in which schools were given money to hire an extra teacher and that said in you can argue that it's quite useful so class size even in poor countries in first grade is typically not 80. okay so if you're interested in some other questions suppose you're interested in the question of what's the as we were uh what's the effect of grouping children by their initial achievement arguably had we done a study on what's the effect of grouping kids by their initial achievement in a setting where class size was 80. and we hadn't done this class size Reduction Program we would actually be estimating the treatment effect in a very strange population in a population where the class size was aided by reducing the class size to 40 then looking at the at the effect of grouping kids by initial achievement is actually arguably a more interesting question because that setting is is probably more uh more more similar more General a lot more similar to uh the context of of uh children in in normal times and in other countries there's also logistical gain from this uh because once you've added a second teacher it's very easy to think about how do you assign kids to classes one approach would be we assign them randomly so that each teacher has the whole mix of uh of initial achievement the other is you break the class in two by the initial test scores so in that particular setting we were able to look at multiple things in this in one setting and I I would argue without a a loss of external validity okay okay so these are these are I've sort of gone through a bunch of uh methods of of how how you can design the randomization okay uh let me um let me turn to another topic of how do you convince the partner to uh and others to uh to to try and experiment so one thing I think is quite important in the social experiment context which is it's really you really need to make sure your partner is committed before you invest a lot of resources in this right there's a lot of times that people will I've argued Partners you know there's a lot more willingness to do this than uh we thought 20 years ago but at the same time you know these are not easy these do put demands on the partner and the challenge let me mention is not necessarily randomization that may not be the problem for the partner the part problem for the partner may be something that's much more simpler and logistical you as a researcher may want to do a baseline first and you may need time to do that baseline or you may need time to get your human subjects to approvals the partner organizations say no we have to roll this out right away we've got our end the end of our fiscal years coming up and we have to spend the money by the end of the fiscal year those sorts of issues can be just as important now usually you can work out those issues I've found but it takes some creativity to to find uh a win-win solution to to slip into uh into that speak um and uh but you have to have a partner who's willing to put in the effort to both sometimes to give something up and more often just to put in some effort to think about how can we work the work this out so they can meet their their needs and the and the research can also be addressed hey um and they have to um they also have to be capable of implementing the intervention so there's some ngos that are just uh you know too weak in their capacity to actually implement the intervention as planned okay um how so so given how much effort these are what I stressed in the first uh in the talk this morning you probably don't want to put in a lot of effort unless and in a situation where you're going to be Hostage to a partner who isn't committed you also have to think about what is not just the individual you're so you know to come back to an anecdote for my uh personal experience if we worked with an NGO for many years in Kenya the head of their their head of their Africa programs was very committed to this and the um but it was a Dutch organization they eventually got a new head in the Netherlands who is not that you know who did was not committed to this and the relationship with that NGO fall apart uh it was pretty uh you know we were able to rest rescue things uh but it was uh it was a you know quite uh took a took a lot of time so it's worth thinking not just about the individual you're dealing with but about to the extent you can thinking about the organization more broadly um in talking to potential Partners you know so this question came up at the end of John's talk you know how do you find organizations that are willing to do this well you have to learn to speak their language hence my win-win statement uh so yeah I'm learning to do this um the um so so you have to learn to talk their language you also need to realize that while we're going to be most interested if this is a policy thing does their program work that may not be the question of most interest to them if you go to a microfinance organization if you think about there's been now been a lot of research on microfinance and suddenly now after many you know really after you know many attempts to do this that we're finally getting some results on you know is microfinance Raising incomes of the poor there's is much easier to do to get studies on let's vary the way we do microfinance because people in an organization they may be pretty committed they may already be pretty convinced of the basic mission of their organization but at the same time they may be very open-minded about some details should we have uh should we have group liability or should we have individual liabilities should we have our repayments once a week or once a month so the people those organ those issues may be very important to organizations so when when they're establishing a relationship with the organization they make sense to go on with those I wouldn't go in with those if you don't think those are academically interested uh but if you do think there's something academically interesting that may be an easier entree to the organization than you know what's the what are is your organization a success or a failure other organizations would love data home show whether they're a success or failure a lot depends on the individuals in the organization another thing that's useful is to feed data back through throughout the process so this is something that um you know as John mentioned what's the trade-off what's the deal the deal is free Consulting for the organization and there are there are things where we can add value and they're they're huge amounts of data that many organizations have and they don't even know the you know some basic statistics from them so and that may be more I have no idea maybe that's less of an issue in in some business organizations but certainly a lot of non-profit organizations are or governments uh are very much uh fit that moment but it's also a source of you know potential new uh new projects that may be of research interests you don't want to spend too much time doing that but I think there's some gains from trade there right so aside from the organization you have to think about the community and other stakeholders I wrote the comparison group will find out about the treatment I guess um that was before I started John's talk and was thinking as well about it thinking this mass mailing example the comparison group might never you know find out but if you're thinking about buildings you know about paying for extra teachers the schools that are not the treatment schools and don't get the extra teachers they're going to find out about this um the randomness as I mentioned earlier randomization is often seen as fair so I think that's the the best way to explain this is to say that I mean human subjects requirements will typically say that you you have to say this is a research study so I think that should be part of the explanation but you can also say which is typically true if you're working with non-profit organizations they have limited resources and they can't serve everybody at once um okay okay so this is um so this is sort of talked about yes you kind of have a choice you could either just not tell the comparison Compares controller and comparison group or you could tell everybody was going to hold this Lottery no I think so um I think you basically we've always I think you basically have to be up front because you want to start collecting data early on so you want to collect data I mean I'll you might not need to do a baseline but generally I think it's a good idea to do it basically I'll just one of the topics I'll talk about later is whether to do a baseline so I think you typically want to do a baseline if you're going to do a baseline then you need to collect data from people if you're collecting data from people then you then human subjects requirements say that you know you've got to tell them what's going on so I'm not I don't I don't know whether that's ideal but that's uh I'm I'm not going to answer the meta question of are the human subjects requirements optimal I'm just I'm working within that I'm taking that as a constraint but but taking that as a constraint uh you sort of have to tell everybody what's going on I think that's I think that's um again you know maybe this is not there may be settings where this is not an issue the the mailing out uh letters to people is sounds like a great one where you're going to rely on administrative data and contributions and presumably that sort of thing can get through irbs but in the sort of setting where you're providing something to an institution uh um uh you know providing something of value I think this approach I also think practically it probably works better so probably even unconstrained by human subjects it's probably the right way to go it's I don't think it's we haven't found it to be a huge problem I mean people are remarkably willing to accept this uh let me say one other thing that's slightly off topic but um so a lot of the work that I've done has been working with institutions like schools or uh so it's a unit above the individual so people often think of in that case of fairness in terms of the units um rather than in terms of the individuals so as long as the institution knows it's going to get something eventually that helps the other thing is that practically you often the hardest it's hardest to get cooperation from the higher socioeconomic status people so in the school case the teachers the kids are happy to be interviewed and parents are happy to you know you have to get hold of them if the parents to sign a consent that can be a hassle but you don't but the teachers are the ones who are going to be most reluctant are the Headmasters well you know you can try and design one of the things you have to think about when doing this work is do you make payments or gifts to the to the respondents um and there's a you may need to do that more for teachers and for Headmasters than for um you know give a pen or a t-shirt or whatever it is as a gift rather than uh you know more than with uh the the the lower level people who are within the institution uh which in some ways is not very fair because you're you know to those you're giving more to people who are already richer but uh in terms of what you need to do to get the to get cooperation uh they have a higher price um okay so uh any other questions or comments on that okay um so what is the stop in designing an intervention so it's worth uh you know this point about Reinventing the wheel applies not just to questionnaires but and surveys but to interventions so definitely you want to start out by you know doing a literature review not just the academic papers which we'd be familiar with but also sort of the with um in developments called the gray literature about about the project so there's often you know internal reports or Consulting reports uh on a particular project so for example I'm interested in a health insurance uh program in India right now while the World Bank has reports on this and various their internal reports on the Indian government in the Indian government et cetera you can also do some qualitative field work you can talk to individuals may also make sense to bring groups of people together in a focus group and talk to them in a group you can talk to sort of community leaders um Village leaders about this or to ngos and government officials donors you can try and develop an intervention and then you've got to Pilot that intervention and pilot in the intervention there's much more that can you know everything that can go wrong with the survey even more can go wrong with an intervention so pilot in the intervention I wrote is essential you know I guess I should take that back a little bit you know lots of um you know we're economists so nothing's essential there's going to be trade-offs and you know sometimes you forced by you know your partner has a has a some timing but if you it's if you don't pilot your if you have any choice you should pilot okay uh and thus of course you're looking at an existing program that's already been you know maybe that the Pilot's already been done because uh um it's a matter of taking an existing program and just expanding the coverage of it okay um it's very important to so getting the program implemented as it's supposed to be implemented is tricky it's very easy to mess that up so you really have to be very involved in that things that you would think would be quite easy turn out not to be so developing a training program for the people who are involved the enumerators the implementers is important thinking about what's the nature of contracts that you have um I think that's one of the advantages either of working in close cooperation with an NGO over a period of time so you have a sort of a long-term relationship or doing it yourself as in a lab experiment or as in uh you know some of the more recent uh um uh field experiments um it's important to assign different implementers I guess there's a word missing there different implementers to different treatments so if you have a training program so on this uh to come back to this uh hygiene and and uh and sanitation and water um if you've got imagine you have some people who you're trying to you're trying to look at the relative effectiveness of hand washing and latrine usage and water chlorination and fighting diarrhea well you're going to train Community workers to go talk to households and encourage them to do these things you don't want to tell what trains some community worker and say okay you go tell those households to wash hands to prevent diarrhea and tell those households to chlorinate their water right the person's gonna they're a human being they're seeing first of all they might just get confused but second if they want to help out the people who they're talking to they're going to tell them both things okay so it's much better to say in this community we're going to do one thing in that Community we're going to do another and then you hold separate training sessions for the different implementers on the other hand you want the data collection to be as similar as possible across treatments so the people who are doing the surveys to find out was there diarrhea you don't want to send sign one set of uh of hold separate you know have separate enumerators for separate uh uh our treatments okay one thing if you are so when Jim was here he mentioned there's a lot of you know recent graduates of uh who are from undergrads who are going out there in grad students so um if you have those people involved it's important to talk to them about what issues are going to be sensitive uh for example politics or you know uh drug use or uh for example so they you know they're things that it's maybe better not to talk about a lot certainly things that's better not to blog about about you know how corrupt this country is and et cetera um it sounds sort of obvious but uh it's it's um it's worth explaining to people uh and data confidentiality is another thing there are again this is a human subject issue uh you want to uh they they should in any blogging people they are going to blog because that's that's what 24 year olds do but um but um you have to you know you they probably should not be they certainly shouldn't certainly should not be bugging about uh data points in the in the study that can be individually identified and uh and uh and and should generally not be blogging about about you know corruption in the local government they've seen um I wrote physical danger so here the um this is something that I think you know that a lot of these issues are are things particularly for foreigners who are going to work there the physical danger is something that applies to to everybody because I think the main source of uh of physical danger is going to be Road accidents and uh whatever can be done you know there are a lot of things that are more um Salient but the the real danger I think is is traffic um and uh you know there's malaria and HIV and and all sorts of things but but traffic I think is the biggest risk um and motorcycles are really um dangerous so on the other hand some places I'm not you know maybe that some places that's the only practical alternative but there is a a real cost to um to use in this cars are really expensive to use to collect data okay to come back to um uh so so next issue is should you do a baseline okay so you know the standard approach in in economics papers is to have uh What uh people call table one which shows that your you know treatment group and comparison group are similar now that's something that we need to do when you're doing when you're doing natural experiments you know that's you have to establish that if you're doing a randomized experiment yeah it's at least worth considering whether you need to do a Baseline and to show that you know if I think this is something that's you know worth thinking about in the particular context are you confident of randomization without having a baseline that may depend if you have a list of all the donors to a particular organization and they tell you they're randomizing well then I think you better check it because I don't trust uh I don't trust a large liberal organization to you know use this data random number generator correctly our excel's random number generator if I probably do trust John to do it correctly however so um you know whether you do a baseline might depend on who's do you know who exactly is is you know in this particular circumstance do you trust the randomization um by the way there are many times I mean uh where people will tell you things are random where they're not here they'll describe the procedure incorrectly so it did us it was involved in a study on on College roommates you know what's the uh what's the effect of having a college roommate who drinks on your GPA uh it's pretty negative if you're male what's the effect of having an African-American roommate if you're white on your racial attitudes and um and it you know in doing this study we did random we did checks between characteristics that should have been predetermined it took us a long time they really were not they were not we were not passing those checks for a long time turns out that the university thought they had first of all there are many universities said it was random by which random they meant we match up the the roommates um that's not you know that's not random um um but then even among the ones that you know the university we worked with did use a computer but the algorithm they didn't understand their own algorithm very well and turned out that there are aspects of their algorithm that were causing these randomization checks not to pass until we conditioned on all the things that went into that algorithm and then conditional on that it was retina um but you know I think this is you know the general point is um you know rent the exact randomization procedures is quite important okay so come back to this issue of do you do a baseline um if you're non-confident of randomization that's one reason to do a baseline to check whether or if you think your readers might not be confident randomization but a baseline is pretty expensive if you don't do a base if each visit costs a certain amount if you don't do that Baseline you could double your sample size and a lot of doing this stuff comes down to uh to you know resource trade-offs so that might be an argument for not doing a a baseline why do I think it makes sense to have a baseline typically well it allows controls for the Baseline for the Baseline characteristics in particular the lagged value of the outcome of Interest putting that in will typically soak up a lot of variants so if this is a persistent outcome like test scores or GPA then it's almost certainly worth doing that Baseline unless you can get that information from administrative data in which case you don't need to do a full Baseline and then that can serve as a randomization check um the you can also look at interaction effects without with other characteristics and in some cases those may be important other covariates typically don't soak up that much variation you know the key thing is the is the uh is the Baseline value of the outcome variable um interactions you know some cases if your theory if your research question says that the interaction is important you better do that that uh that Baseline that you know that's going to depend on the setting wherever you can do this with administrative data you certainly should you know that the money is to you know if you can if the administrative data is Rich enough that you have the Baseline value of the outcome variable I would put your money into put your use your money elsewhere okay um okay what to measure when you're doing the randomized evaluation so if you want to go and I think increasingly I think there's something we should have been doing all along and you know increasingly will be demanded and should be um if you want to do welfare analysis well there are some questions where in some cases you're answering a theory question where welfare's beside the point so maybe not always but in many policy cases you want to do some welfare measurement you don't just want to say um height went up by one centimeter among the people who got this prenatal extra prenatal care you want to say is it worth it um so a randomized if you think of test scores for example let me give an education example test scores are a function of a whole bunch of characteristics uh what what the how much effort the child puts in how much effort the teacher puts in how the teacher teaches uh parental inputs of various types and let's say class size okay well if you have a program that changes class size and you looked at the outcome and you say okay we reduce class size by hiring another teacher test scores went up by 0.1 standard deviations well to evaluate the welfare impact of that you have to take into account that there the other inputs most most standard most models of uh of production would say if you adjust one input exogenously other inputs are going to adjust as well so if that's the case or at least they potentially could adjust so if that's the case then you have to think about what's the value of the other inputs that was were either crowded in or crowded out and maybe this is even more complicated maybe you're producing multiple things you're not just producing test scores you're producing other things so the standard welfare analysis would say there's two ways you two legitimate ways to look at welfare one is to say we're measuring the partial derivative of of uh of test scores with respect to uh class size but you're typically not going to be measuring you're typically not going to get that with a randomized evaluation yeah in a non-experimental setting you may or I'm not that I'm not sure you would get it in a non-experimental setting either but you know you're probably not uh probably not going to get a randomized evaluation so then what you have to do is you have to try and make some stab at Value in the other inputs and potentially the other outputs that are coming out of this okay um so there are a number of examples like this um so there's work in Colombia India Zambia suggesting that house uh when school inputs go up household inputs may go down if the schools provide textbooks the households the parents aren't going to buy text the same textbook for their kid um there's in the in John's presentation there was a it was a there was a discussion of could teacher could teachers respond to uh to a program that's creating incentives for kids so work we did in Kenya we looked at a program that had Merit Scholarships for kids a very in some ways quite similar rewards for kids based on their test scores and what we found interestingly was that that led to LED teachers to show up more and we're not sure what the mechanism was it might have been that the teachers might have been the teachers were concerned about their pupils and they wanted to help their pupils maybe the community the parents put more pressure on the teachers to show up uh but that you know it's an example that suggests that sometimes uh um changing one input exogenously will change others in Colombia we found that when you gave vouchers to kids for a private school they spent less time working you know um okay uh let's I'll skip the water example so the the general lesson is here when you think about what to measure think about think about other inputs if you're trying to do welfare analysis think about other inputs that could could change in other outputs um actually let me explain this travel time because that's a slightly different point um I'll discuss this paper more later but work we're doing uh we've done with uh Ted McGowan Jessica Lano and Alex swannai looks at what's the effect of improving water sources and we were initially interested in what's the health impact of this but we observed that people were when you improved a water source people who had used other water sources switched and started to come into these sources so you can see what the extra willingness of people is to walk to get the improved water source turns out that that can actually be a measure of how much people value this so it's actually conceptually quite different than the rest of the slide that probably should have been a separate bullet point another way to get at the welfare impact is forget about sort of valuing the output and value in the input say we're going to use a revealed preference approach and see how much more willing people are to pay for this uh or pay in in by walking okay okay so you've got some hypotheses you've got some you know things you want to measure um there may be cases in which you want to take multiple measurements on the same individual so you may want to do that just to increase Precision mentioned the difficulty of getting an anthropometric measurements may you know you may just want to say we're going to weigh people and take their height at the beginning of the interview and we're going to do that again at the end of the interview and we're going to take the average okay um another thing you can think about is you can you may be asking so in our our project on what's the impact of going on harsh we're interested in what's the impact on um religiosity and what's the impact on local religious belief as opposed to sort of worldwide uh consensus Islamic belief what's a what's the impact on sort of local Pakistani practices because this is an issue of Scholars of religion debate about um there's a view that sort of local Customs are being displaced in favor of uh some people argue in favor of sort of a Saudi version of Islam there's various various different versions of this so in that case a single question might not be a very good measure and we can ask uh you know do you visit a local Shrine but you know maybe that's not going to which is not something that you know Saudis would like very much but this might be part of a local Pakistani religious practice we wind up with a single question might not measure what you're after that well so you can ask a whole bunch of questions if you're thinking about something like the Hajj you know you're there's a lot of potential outcomes that you're interested in what's the impact on views of women what's the impact on you know views of non-muslims um so there we had an immense question there the diff What what you may because you're going to have a lot of different outcomes you know there's a lot of scope for data mining in there so what you would ideally do is you'd lay out a plan ahead of time for what what questions you're going to group together so there's a technique called average effect size I may talk more about it later depending on time which uh which is um which can be used to sort of extract a a to try and make things reduce going from hundreds of questions say we're going to group these 15 questions together as a measure of X and you can you can note that ahead of time by the way if you want to register you know data mining as a general you know I think the best thing about randomized evaluations so that in theory the best thing about randomized evaluations is that they make the treatment group in the comparison group comparable and expectation to help deal with limited variable bias that's great but I think practically the best thing about randomized evaluations is they reduce the scope for uh discretion for the researcher they don't eliminate it but they reduce the scope for discretion for the researcher to choose among you know 300 different specifications to choose the one that works best for the hypothesis you know that gives them a t statistic above too um so you know reduces it from 300 options down to to 10. if you want to be tough you can register your you can say ahead of time what specifications you're going to run and register that you can do that at poverty action lab perhaps at other places okay you know whether we're up to the standard that the this is what you would do in a medical trial there's all sorts of ways in which the people do medical trials are are tougher than we are um you know are we ready to sign up to to everything that they do uh you know maybe we should be um probably not quite there okay yeah right right so let me um let me draw a distinction between two different things um one is so once you've got your treatment group and your comparison group and you're you've you know you've you've decided which is which you've started your program and then you know then if if somebody from your treatment group uh you know you have some school where you've produced class size and then somebody from that school and then somebody from the comparison group moves over and goes into the into the uh into the treatment to treatment group school they think hey I want a small class size too I'm switching schools well so one thing I haven't talked about that's a topic I haven't addressed because I'm sort of presuming that uh we all know what to do in that case and it's you know unambiguous they're still part of the group they were originally assigned to um so when you you know you should analyze this uh you know using the the original assignment and either do intention to treat or do an IV where you uh you know you you do the initial randomization is an IV for your ultimate assignment so that's I think you know quite crystal clear and the profession general you know in economics we accept that um by the way that's probably an example where I would say we're we're closer we understand things better than the medical profession I think they would sort of get totally freaked out about that and not I maybe that's not fair but you know they might not know what to do about that case um the um the second issue is is that the issue that you were you were asking about or was it a different issue okay um so I so let me tell you what's so I don't I would say readjusting the samples if I'm so I'll come to something later on which might be what you're talking about which is a I think is a mistake but not a a terrible mistake but we adjusting the samples if I if I understand what you're saying that's like not a Temptation that's like a I would say that is sort of Beyond The Pale I The Temptations that I'm and obviously you know that could happen and you know nothing to you know the I don't know what we do about that but I think what's more common would be you know relatively honest mistakes of not uh mistakes with I'm not even sure they're mistakes you know you're you haven't specified whether you're going to control what covariates you're going to control for so you haven't specified in advance whether you have a program that's looking at at um at reduction in class size you haven't specified in advance whether you are going to group all the kids together or you're going to control for sex of the kid or you're going to separately report uh results for males and females so there you've got a choice of several different specifications now in a randomized evaluation typically it's not going to make much much difference which one of those you do if it's a large sample you get a pretty good balance of male and female all across between treatment and comparison group but there are other cases in which you can make a legitimate argument either way and you know the fact that you can make a legitimate argument either way opens up some scope for uh for the for researchers to affect the the answers so that I think is I think that problem is greatly greatly reduced in randomized evaluations relative to um relative to to non-experimental work but it's not completely eliminated I think there are things we could do to further reduce it and I'm going to talk about some of them here um in this talk um um when I go on for a bit and then I'm happy to revisit this um okay so another issue is so we talked about what to measure another question is when to measure it so in many cases the S the effect of a program is going to change over time that's very clear on educational interventions you know sometimes you get big effects and then they fade out over time there's other you know other Dynamics you can get here's a bunch of examples where that's happened it often will make sense to measure because effects can change over time if you have the budget it's nice to measure at multiple points what's the short run effect medium effect longer run effect now you know money as I've mentioned a number of times is really pretty you know it's a big ingredient in in this work um getting results at one stage can help in getting in uh funding for for more work in particular if you're showing that in fact this is a policy thing if you show an effect at one stage you're more likely to get funds for sort of a later on follow-up which might be and we should think about what's uh socially optimal but um but um so you know there's an argument for from a practical point of view it may make sense to collect some data early on and then then even if you don't have uh funds to do it later on and hope that you'll get additional funds uh to do that later okay when you're doing when you are collecting data at each stage collect information about you know phone numbers and names of people who you might who might know where you are two years from now to make it easier to find the respondents later so an important issue is what unit to randomize that and um as the if you can get individual randomization you're going to have a lot more power um particularly if there's High uh that should be intra cluster correlation um but it may be difficult to have unequal treatment within a community and there's some things where you just can't do it um you know if you're you know well for example um it might be hard to give out treats to some kids in a school but not others right um but and there's some things like extra teachers lower class size you can't really well maybe you could vary that at an individual level but um uh it's well you I think you actually could so it's worth thinking about it because I was originally thinking you couldn't um there are other cases where there's spillovers where the intervention you're interested in the general equilibrium effect at some level uh so in you know treatment of kids for worms you know there'll be a disease externality um in these cases you may want to do multiple levels of randomization so you can randomize across larger units like schools which are or which ones get treated or with high intensity which ones with low intensity and then within each unit you could randomize the intensive treatment and then you might be able to to separately identify sort of the individual effect and the spillover effect um okay and then you may be also be able to vary encouragement okay another question is what's the form of randomization so we talked about the Baseline already should you do the the randomization in public or in private so you could imagine a very public ceremony where you draw you draw balls out of a hat or um that might be useful for transparency in some cases um in general at lean towards using a random number generator one question is do you do this real time uh or do you do it accente okay so there's evidence to think that if you're doing this real time you may have real problems sticking to of people sticking to the protocol so this is work that Rebecca Thornton uh was involved in and so in the early stages of her work this involved nurses had to hand out vouchers to people and the vouchers could be for different amounts they could be for zero or up to 200. and she looked at the if you looked at the blue that's what the US that's what should have been the distribution of voucher amounts the actual distribution of voucher amounts was given by the red okay the nurses were supposed to randomize on the spot I think it was nurses and the enumerators in any case they didn't like giving nothing to people and they liked giving a lot to people I think that's quite general in general that's what you know there's a lot I'm sure there's a lot of corruption in the world but you know when you're talking to somebody face to face you want to help them out so I think that's the that's a general issue to to be concerned about um okay let me now what you can do if you need to do the if you need to start treating some people right away because of time pressures you can do waves so you can say well we can't wait to do our Baseline on everybody um we need to randomize and start treating some people but you could say well we're going to do first do a what you know we have a thousand people in the study we're first going to do a baseline on 100 and then we're going to randomize those and then we're going to do a baseline another 100 and then randomize those that's you know you won't probably get quite as good balance with that uh between treatment comparison but you'll be able to maybe meet your implementation constraints but you should always do the Baseline prior to the randomization okay if you otherwise the people doing the Baseline either you know the respondents May answer differently knowing which group they're in and the enumerators might ask questions differently knowing which group people are in okay so I don't know whether this was you know also a question that you were you were getting at but there's different forms of randomization so Bruno McKenzie have a have a nice article on how do you get ballots um and what are the you know what are different ways to do it so you could you could have a you could do your random I think this is what you were calling block randomization so you could um you could have a pure random drawer you could do stratification so if you have stratification you say well we're gonna we want to get equal numbers of males and females in the treatment and comparison group so I'm going to randomize separately among the males and separately among the females um so you could do that just for the outcomes strongly related to the outcome of interest you could for example if it's test scores you could stratify by initial test score uh you could do that because you were interested in subgroup analysis if you try and do it on too many different variables you'll wind up with some empty cells right if you say well I want to do it on sex an initial test score and height and eye color and everything else so in that case one thing you can do is you can have you could have a procedure where you sort of say how similar are people and you put everybody in a pair and then you assign one member of pair each pair to be treatment in one comparison and you can minimize this uh this distance function uh between people an advantage of putting things in pairs like that and I don't know whether this is a you can say if one of the member of that unit drops out then you drop the whole unit okay so if you you know if you have a um and then the resulting data set will stay balanced okay um now the final thing you can do is you can re-randomize so what you can do is you can say well we're going to do a random draw we'll we'll then check and see if our if any of the the covariates are differ between treatment and comparison group if they do we'll do another random draw and uh you know we'll continue until we get an acceptable sample so one of so what what one of the things this article shows um and keto imbens has done work on this that makes the correct standard error is difficult to compute so basically you shouldn't do this re-randomization based on balance if you've done it it's not the end of the world there are things you can do to fix it up but it's it's it's not the best way to do things yes so that's another point of this article this is a nice paper I recommend it for people who are working in this area um what they so what they should so you're right A lot of people so one of the things this paper does is it talks about what do people do in practice so so people often don't say exactly what they're doing but you're right people often don't uh adjust their standard errors to take into account the way they stratified usually that is going to be conservative they're going to report standard errors that are bigger than their true standard errors will be but not always okay uh foreign so they they then simulate this they take some actual data sets and they try different you know they look at what the impact would have been of these different procedures so you know the the first thing is that you know matching stratifying controlling for the variables used in uh and rewriting position all those things increase power okay um so so you should um I'm sorry let me move down to this next small Point pairwise matching is is performs best in general so um provided that the variables used for matching are good predictions of future outcomes if you're matching on Pure Noise variables if you're stratifying based on Pure Noise that's not that doesn't help but in general you know you you probably want to stratify you should stratify you should stratify a lot now this is you know with samples up to you know once your output sample is above 300 you know it doesn't really make that much difference I don't think because you're going to naturally get a lot of balance anyway okay so so you don't need to worry about it but in a lot of a lot of development examples if you're doing or a lot of examples where you where you have to cluster for some reason you're going to have pretty small samples and in that case you should stratify and you know why not take it to the Max and go all the way to these pairs okay um so this is the statement on on average it's overly conservative to not include the controls for stratum repairs to answer your question Ryan um but not always okay um so um you know I think this is a good point uh that you know you may be tempted to try the analysis with and without the stratum dummies I think that you know their um their recommendation so this comes back to the the question of research or discretion so to some extent this is a matter of you know we basically need to establish certain conventions as a profession and I think uh I think you know that what they recommend and what I personally would agree with is you should control for the for all your strata so you know we are I think are some people with an alternative would say no don't add in controls I would say if you're because it's you you have too much Freedom about what controls to include but if you control for the initial value of the Baseline of the outcome variable any control for all the strata you use to randomize the strategy used to randomize you had to set in advance so there's not a lot of discretion there so I would argue for that as a norm s um yeah so so I I would I would but I don't think it's fair to um you won't have you won't have correct standard errors if you haven't uh if you haven't uh uh you know taken into account that that's what you did when X ante when you're thinking about what to include if you're really in a situation where you have no idea what's going to affect the outcome other than your your treatment then then you shouldn't make up stuff and stratifying it but if you have reason to think things are important you should stratify on it you don't get hurt that much uh uh by that typically um okay um so so you know their recommendations you should definitely talk about how the details of how you randomized um um you should control for the method of randomization you should I wrote here rethink re-randomization but basically that's not that's not good if you did do it um there's various things you can do to to do it it's not that big a deal it's it doesn't um um but it's uh but it's clearly not optimal um okay and clearly you should stratify on the the Baseline outcome variable um that that gets a you know gets you a lot of extra power um they suggest also doing geographic regions okay um okay okay so what other things on on size and power um so one question is how much power do you need when you're doing your study so this is an area where I think the the official ideology of randomized Trials is just you know disconnected from the reality and disconnected probably from what should be the case so the you know the official ideology is you think about what size affects you are likely to pick you know what's the effect size is likely to be from your um from your new anti-cancer drug and then you need then you figure out what's what power you need you know how many observations you need and if you can and you write your program proposal for that much money and if they give it to you you do your study and if they come back to you and say no you have 20 percent we can only give you 20 less money than that then you know your studies underpowered and you don't do the study okay so um so first I think that's unrealistic because you know you don't always get as much money as you want um and you know you do you should you do the study if you're if you have 20 less budget then uh you needed for 80 power uh probably yes because by that time you've already written your you've already done you know a third of the work of doing the study in in um you know getting to the stage where you could submit your Grant proposal okay now the reason is different ways to look at this you can look at this from the you know individual researcher incentive standpoint and there's some logic to this advice from that's you know the standard advice from the individual researcher because the payoffs the individual researcher unfortunately are you know very high for getting a t statistic above two and much lower for two statistics below to if you look at this from the standpoint of the social planner this is totally backwards okay the if you're trying to the we get the most information as a society not from the you know we get more information from the first 500 observations than we do from the next 500 observations if we're thinking about we're trying to estimate a parameter what's the effect of this of class size on test scores well you know our first if our first 500 uh classes that we schools that we randomize are going to tell us this effect is you know with 95 confidence between you know 0.05 and 0.15 standard deviations that's you know maybe more important than narrowing it down precisely to whether it's uh uh so and there's nothing special about a tf2 for most uh for most uh for for the social planner and in fact the social planner says look this researcher is doing one study but there's some other researchers doing other studies plus I've got some priors and you know this is informing my posterior so this this is not at all what a social planner would do now it is possible this is what a constrained a social constrained social planner would do if his social planner is constrained that you know people are going to be idiots which I guess they generally are and uh and assume that you know any any um any coefficient which is not significantly different from zero is equal to zero so if the social planner is constrained to say that all people reading the study are going to have that reaction maybe it's worth it's not a good idea to do the underpowered study because people will make false inferences out of it but you know hopefully as time goes by we can uh we can learn to be more sophisticated than that you know I I feel like this is actually an area where you know a lot more research and thinking is needed um the about what what is the appropriate what's the social I mean individually optimal is that's you know first let's think about what's socially optimal and then maybe we could uh figure out what's individually optimal and sort of do strategic versions of this but uh um you know here's here are some things so you know the general question of what's what power and size you need I think that's you know very or yeah that that's an open question there's there's one sorry let me say one other one other reason why the advice manuals might be right um there's a huge ingredient in the cost of doing a study which is not typically budgeted which is the researcher time so if you think there's a huge fixed cost of research or time then that somewhat goes against my my argument earlier that there's a declining marginal cost value of additional observations rather than a rather than some magical threshold where where the study is worth doing and not so you know it's probably if you're only going to be able to have four data points you know don't do the study because your own time is is too valuable um okay so suppose you want to do a Power calculation okay you have to think about the significance level that's typically going to be five percent what's the variance of the of the outcome you know to do that um for some cases you just care about a standardized effect size you're doing everything in terms of standard deviations if that's the case then you know you don't care about the variance but if you're interested in what's the cost benefit ratio of the intervention um you know maybe you you do need to get that um you could get idea that you have some pre-data but if you don't have some pre-data you can look up some data from somebody else's study in a similar population what's the what's the um you know how much variation in in test scores as there are in wages or consumption um what's the effect size that you want to detect so here's another here's another place where I disagree with the advice manuals the advice manual sort of say well what does theory say the effect is going to be and then let's let's size this so we can pick this size the study so we could pick up an effect of that of that magnitude that's a little bit weird in that if we already knew if we knew what how big the effect was going to be how are we doing the study um my inclination would be to say um um what's the smallest effect that you want to detect and that could be determined by cost benefit calculations so you know an implication of that is say you're looking at a health intervention um you want to look at if you're looking at a cheap intervention it doesn't apply to just help if you're looking at cheap intervention a much you may want to much the the social planner is going to want a much larger sample than if it's an expensive intervention if it's an expensive intervention unless it has a huge effect on the outcome you don't want to do it it's not worth the money if it's a cheap intervention um you you may need a huge one I think this is an area where the literature really gets it there are existing institutions get this wildly wrong they you know what happens is people do a small small sample on an on an inter on a cheap intervention they don't get a statistically significant effect the literature decides it's an effective zero and it doesn't get get implemented and I think that's a problem in health research certainly okay um okay what I've said is uh you know is I think more right than uh than than uh what's before but it's actually much more complicated it may be that you you you from a Bayesian decision Theory point of view they're all you care about is should you should you implement this or should you not and you just want to get over that threshold and therefore you get all more complicated non-linearities in this okay for a test of theory maybe you just want to distinguish a parameter from zero um okay okay what are what are important determinants of sample size um you know clustering that's come up before I'm going to say a little bit more about that but I'll be brief I'm going to skip over these formulas let me just show the you know clustering really means you need a lot bigger in many cases you'll need a much much bigger sample okay you know five times uh you need to you can only detect effect five times bigger okay now this is showing the same thing plus intercluster correlation can be huge okay much higher than uh than some of the examples John gave which just means you're going to need you basically need to start thinking about your data point being the in this sort of situation your data points the number of schools you have not the number of kids getting more kids isn't going to help okay so then if your intervention costs vary with the number of kids maybe you want to work in small schools so you know obviously then there's questions of how much you can generalize from that um okay if you're going for hypotheses that are somewhat um somewhat exotic um it's going to be harder and harder okay so if you're just trying to get the difference between the treatment and the comparison that may be easy enough if you have two treatments you're trying to pick up the difference between the two treatments is is sanitation more important or or water treatment more important you know you're going to need a really big sample if you're trying to pick up non-linearities that's really tough to do you know you have a you put ten dollars more into school and twenty dollars more in school and is it a linear effect well you know you've got standard error bounds around each one around the 10 and the 20. rejection linearity is going to be tough okay if you've got partial compliance that's a real killer for power as well if only half the people take it up you're going to need four times the sample size okay um okay um I'm gonna speed up a little bit because it's uh it's late the if you've got families about if you're testing a lot of different hypotheses you know the odds are something's going to turn up right now the most conservative approach to that is to say well if I'm testing 10 hypotheses they don't have to be significant the five percent level but at the you know 0.5 percent level that's probably too tough you know we uh a uh there's there's a number of reasons why that's too tough there's some there's some other approaches that are going to be be less strict than that one reason why that's too tough is if you started out interested in a particular outcome the correct inference for that outcome is still the five percent significance level if you're if your question is did this treatment of any effect at all then you do want to be tougher but but that might be you don't have to be quite that tough okay um there are many cases imagine you have a very small sample okay and say you have six schools or you know 20 schools standard even 50 States you know clustering it doesn't work very well with small samples the a lot of the theory on that it's asymptotic how do you do things well you can use something called randomization inference which is basically you go through and you construct what are all the possible assignments that you could have had of treatment in comparison and that gives you exact standard errors okay so you can also do that if you re-randomized if you have some complicated randomization procedure for example you re-randomized until you got on each of 10 covariates you got a t statistic of of less than one that's not what you should have done but if you did that you can use randomization inference you just draw a thousand sample possible assignments of treatment and comparison you can do this you know X post those are Placebo assignments you see do any of the which you know what what distribution of coefficients would you've got out of that are your coefficients in the five percent tail if so then you can be confident you know confident that uh that your treatment had an effect a five percent significance at all okay rosenbaum's a good uh site for it was a good you know source of theory on that okay um okay another issue of analyzing the data uh exposed is you know you'll often get behavioral responses that you maybe didn't think about before how do you deal with that well one one way to deal with that is sorry let me is to um is to is to model that and to use some Theory to do that and you put some structure on and then that may allow you to understand what would have happened in it or to you know with with some assumptions what would have happened in other contexts and I think in some ways um you know one of the directions the literature can move is to sort of combine randomized evaluation and structural methods and that can take several forms so you may test a structural model I've cited some papers that do that and then you can make once you validated the model you can make some out of sample Productions another thing you can do is use a randomized evaluation to make inferences about a model parameter so I mentioned this uh project earlier in which there was improvements to water sources called Spring protection we looked at whether people traveled further to go to these water sources so then you can get uh if you're willing to make some assumptions that are required for travel cost analysis you can make some estimates of the valuation of different consumers for this and then you can simulate um the impact of different property rights schemes in water that would have led to you could say well if this is how much people value spring protection you know if you're able if you're able right in this particular environment you can't charge for water and therefore you don't invest in improving the Water Source suppose you could charge what would be the equilibrium of a of a of a game in which landowners were competing against each other and had to decide whether to make these Investments now in that type of setting the way we decided to lay out this paper and I think you know might be useful in other contexts as well is to think about to separate it by what are the what conclusions can we draw without a lot of additional assumptions for example this is what the effect of protecting the Water Source was on the the bacterial contamination and the how and at the spring at the household that's relatively assumption free still some assumptions let's move on to what what you need more assumptions to buy say the travel cost model with that we can get consumer valuations for spring protection if you assume people know about the impact of the spring protection on health you can get valuation of of Health if you're willing to make further assumptions and say that these guys are competing against each other and they're playing a nash game and they're moving simultaneously and we're willing to apply sort of blp assumptions then you can get well what would be the effect of different property rights assumptions so that that you know being whether or not you lay out the paper that way in combining randomized evaluations and structural approaches it's probably worth being clear about you know what assumptions you need for for what results okay um so what steps forward I think one is what I was just discussing using the results of randomized evaluations to test structural models or to to use create to estimate parameters and structural models that allow you to make out of sample predictions um think longer follow-ups so there's a tenancy in a lot of this work to follow up you know once relatively short run but I think you know we're starting to say that the results vary a lot over different time scales measuring intermediate outcomes to try and tell different effects apart trying to get a general equilibrium effects which in some cases you can do by randomizing larger units but in some cases you'll need to put some structure on and then finally meta-analysis of the data um you know from randomized evaluations um you know there's been you know some people have worried you know there's a lot huge um and quite vacuous debate about external validity of of uh of randomized Trials you know in some ways that's this is going to be an empirical question that we have to answer you know using the data and you know in many cases we're now starting to have data to see and you know I think there's some looks like a lot of things are generalizing quite well there are other things that don't generalize as well and there's some seem you know it's early stages to say but um yeah it looks like there's sensible reasons for what generalizes and what and what doesn't um that's and that's going to be important for informing trying to reach theoretical conclusions uh out of uh out of this wave of randomized evaluations so let me just end by putting up some sources for for more information the j-pal course materials that's really oriented towards practitioners so um you know it spends a lot of time explaining some Concepts that we would take for granted but it's still very useful um and these slides drawn them I mentioned this Bruno McKenzie article um Angus Eden has a has a has a book on household surveys which is very useful um this handbook chapter that Esther Rachel and I worked on which covers some of this material and there's another garage is another very useful reference on designing surveys and there's you know a vast uh a vast literature beyond that but since it's 5 15 I think
