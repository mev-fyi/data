okay uh let me get started so we're back for our second day of the 25th meeting of the Retirement Research Consortium annual meeting I want to welcome you back my name is John leightner I'm the director of one of the four research centers the Michigan retirement and disability Research Center that make up the rdrc and I'll be your host today uh I think while people join I'll take just a minute to recap yesterday's uh program I hope you enjoyed it I certainly did so we had three sessions of uh reports on research projects the first one was on disparities by race and ethnicity we had a paper on the distribution of wealth and today's keynote talk will uh pick that topic up again we had a excellent paper on the functioning of the U.S pension system and the tax expenditures and so on that are involved and we had a third paper on assessment of possible disparities uh in SSDI Awards by gender and race the second session again we had three papers so the SSDI application Trend had been upward but uh in recent years it's turned and gone down and we had a paper analyzing the change in the trends and we had a second paper uh where the author had a sub-sample of people who were self-identified as disabled but had not applied for SSDI and uh she had uh interviewed them about their reasons and then we had a third paper using the HRS data on life histories of jobs and the authors looked at the descriptions of the jobs and asked whether it was correlated with the people's health status late in life in their age of retirement and then we had a paper on communication with various subgroups of the population and Outreach by SSA and we had a paper on the comparison of uh consumer satisfaction with the social security retirement system and other alternatives we had an interesting paper on uh possible problems reaching out to specific uh subgroups in the population uh maybe people who weren't as eager to use the internet as others and we had a a third paper on an internet panel and uh the importance of question wording for reaching out to certain groups and so on so all in all we had a an excellent program and uh if you if you missed it or want to go back we have recordings of just about all the research presentations in a few cases uh the authors need to withhold them for publication purposes but um we're going to have most of the presentations up and recorded and you can go to any of the four centers so example you could go to the Michigan retirement and disability Research Center at umich b u m i c h and in a few days it'll be there and you can click on it go through the sessions if you want to hear uh the recordings so let me let me turn now to today's program uh we have another full day full afternoon for you here uh uh we're going to have a keynote address to start um and then we'll have three uh sessions as before in in each case remember if you want live captions you can you can go to the bottom of your screen and use the CC uh function and uh during the presentations if you want to make comments or ask questions you should go to the Q a and uh type it in and I can't guarantee that we'll get to all of these but we we're trying we'll try so our keynote address our keynote speaker today is William darrity William darrity is distinguished professor of public policy economics African and African-American studies at Duke University he has a PhD from MIT his research spans a wide range of topics including economic history development economics economic psychology and the history of economic thought his research focus is inequality by race class and ethnicity Professor derrity's topic today is understanding American economic inequality this this is a 35-minute slot I've taken up five minutes of time but we'll have the slot run five minutes longer to 12 40. I'm delighted to introduce today's speaker William darrity thank you thank you very much I would like to explore issues concerning wealth disparities in the United States particularly wealth disparities that are Intergroup in character and so my focus is going to be on uh emphasizing the distinction between wealth and income I'd like to begin by pointing out that uh when when many many studies are done where people refer to uh to to wealth inequality they're frequently actually talking about income inequality it's pretty much a common place that if you do a Google search on wealth inequality in multiple countries around the world you invariably will get a set of Articles or reports that are focused on income disparities so uh it's important to make that distinction at the outset so income is a flow of resources that for most people is largely dictated by their earnings although there are other categories of income we can refer to those as social income in the sense of transfer payments that are made by the public sector to individual citizens as well as for folks at the upper end of the income distribution uh resources that are drawn uh in the form of interest on the assets that they they possess but primarily income is associated with the flow of resources within a given period of time usually we think about annual income in contrast wealth is a stock of resources that an individual can carry with them over time it's the difference between what an individual owns and what an individual owes we also can think about the concept of wealth as being equivalent to the idea of net worth that is the difference between the value of an individual's assets and the value of their debts or correspondingly the net value of their personal property I'm going to argue that actually wealth matters in a way that might even be more significant than income because wealth provides an indicator of economic opportunities security and overall well-being it functions essentially as an insurance policy against economic shocks whether this might involve the loss of employment or a medical emergency in addition to buffering against economic uncertainties it can facilitate political participation in our society one in which monetary resources proved to be highly influential in the political process uh it is also something that is valuable from the standpoint of enabling families to purchase their way into high amenity neighborhoods it enables them to provide their their uh their sons and daughters with uh high quality schooling uh if they're not able to move into a neighborhood that has associated with it a high quality public school they can use their resources to purchase education privately so they have a lot of choices that are associated with their access to higher levels of wealth in addition if confronted with the criminal legal system they have the capacity to purchase quality legal counsel and furthermore uh wealthier families have the capacity to deliver gifts and bequests to Future generations to ensure their degrees of Economic Security and Economic Opportunity so wealth can replace lost income but lost income can rarely replace lost wealth so I'd like to talk about the extent of wealth inequality in the United States and I'd like to move from thinking about the general or overall degree of wealth inequality to thinking about racial inequality and wealth so I'd like to share with you at the beginning a diagram that I refer to as the double Fin fish diagram and the double Fin fish diagram displays the process of alteration in wealth inequality over the course of approximately 70 years that has resulted in a situation in which the United States now has the same degree of wealth inequality as the degree that existed during the course of the Great Depression right so if you look at the at the blue curve in the diagram that represents the share of the nation's wealth going to the bottom 90 percent of the population the red curve represents the share of the nation's wealth going to the top 0.1 percent so this is not the one percent this is not even 10 this is the 0.1 so the degree of concentration of wealth in the United States is actually quite staggering you can see that the bottom ninety percent of the population at this point in time has approximately the same share of wealth as the top 0.1 percent somewhere in the vicinity of 22 to 23 percent of the nation's wealth okay I'd like to give you a sense of the comparative difference in income and wealth inequality that is emphasized in the previous diagram you'll note that income inequality is quite substantial in the United States as well but wealth inequality is even more intense and concentrated so the bottom ninety percent of the income distribution has about 50 percent of the nation's income the top 0.1 percent has 11 percent but if you contrast that with the estimated shares of wealth going to the respective categories the bottom ninety percent and the top 0.1 percent we see as was demonstrated in the previous diagram a convergence in the vicinity of 23 or or 22 percent a striking statistic that's reported at the base of this diagram is the fact that the 400 richest people in the United States own more assets than the 150 million Americans in the bottom sixty percent combined so now I'd like to make a transition to thinking about the disparities in wealth at the intersections of race and gender so I'd like to propose two ways of thinking about the black white wealth Gap in the United States based upon two very standard measures of averages so let's start with the median differential in wealth between white and black households where uh the white households uh median level of wealth is represented by the gray rectangle and the black households median level of wealth is represented by the black rectangle correspondingly we also have information about the mean differential and wealth between black and white households where again the white level of wealth or the White household level of wealth is represented by the gray diagram or the gray rectangle and and and the black level of uh of mean wealth is represented by the black rectangle and it becomes very very apparent and even though the ratios are similar the ratio of white to black wealth the dollar disparity is substantially greater if one is focused on the mean differential if you were going to close the wealth Gap measured at the median which would be the middle household in each of the uh in each of the in each of the groups uh it would take somewhere in the vicinity of three to four years of consecutive zero expenditure by black households out of their income uh to to save a sufficient amount to uh to close the uh uh to close the racial wealth gap on the other hand if you're looking at the comparative differential at the mean uh it would take 14 consecutive years of uh of zero consumption out of the income that households receive to eliminate the uh the racial the racial wealth Gap um so uh the mean differential is obviously far more far far larger and a more challenging Target from this standpoint of any kind of policy initiative that's designed to try to close the gap now uh you know you you frequently find uh observers who are thinking about wealth inequality in the United States focusing on the median Gap and the rationale for doing that is that uh the median Gap is not contaminated by outlying values extreme values and the distribution but I'm going to argue that if we are thinking about wealth differentials by race in the United States we actually should focus on the mean gap which is more which is considerably larger and again is a more challenging Target from the standpoint of policy initiatives to eliminate the Gap and I'm going to argue that this is uh this is a consequence of the high degree of concentration of wealth in the United States that that's precisely why we should focus on the mean rather than the median so the first statistic that I would like to share with you which is relevant to this comparison of the mean versus the median is the fact that 97 of the wealth that is held by white households in the United States is held by those households that have a net worth above the white median 97 of the well so that means that um uh for for white households in the lower half of the wealth distribution they possess about three percent of the total amount of wealth that is uh is owned by by uh White households uh so if you were to focus on the median Gap you are essentially ignoring large large portions of the wealth differential that's relevant to our estimation um now let me also add that that Gap in wealth is not attributable merely to the fact that there's a handful of white billionaires um there there are a handful of extraordinarily rich white billionaires but that doesn't fully explain the differential uh in fact one of the most Salient numbers that I think is relevant to this conversation is the uh is the estimate that indicates that one quarter of white households have a net worth in excess of one million dollars while that is true for only four percent of black households uh here's a corresponding diagram that illustrates the the issue that I'm trying to raise here uh you can see that the sharp sharp separation and wealth shares by race it becomes evident when you move beyond the 50th percentile of the wealth distribution uh however to the left of the 50th percentile the overlap that is displayed in this diagram because of its scale is somewhat misleading in fact uh if you look at the bottom 20 percent of income recipients in the United States the lowest income recipients or the folks who we might say are are the poorest Americans we find that the median level of wealth for white households is somewhere in the vicinity of fifteen thousand dollars while it is zero for black households so uh even in the lowest uh income categories in the United States we still have sharp differences in wealth they're just not as pronounced as the dramatic differences that are Illustrated As you move above the 50th percentile of the of the wealth distribution um this is a diagram that I think is particularly Salient in the context of some of the presentations and conversations that were held yesterday which is a diagram that demonstrates that as people get older the wealth gap between white households and Black and Hispanic households widens dramatically this is true whether you're looking at the wealth Gap measured at the median or you're looking at the wealth Gap measured at the mean uh you know obviously there's a more pronounced Gap that occurs when the estimates are presented at the mean but the pattern of increased wealth inequality at older age at older ages is is present in either in either case now in this context I want to emphasize that the within group distribution of wealth among all ethnic racial groups in the United States is substantially unequal so it's it's not only the case that uh uh 97 of the wealth uh for white households is held by those who are above uh the median but it's also true for uh for other groups uh whether we're talking about blacks or or Latinos collectively in fact if you take blacks whites and Latinos and compare the wealth distributions within groups approximately 75 percent of all the wealth is held by the top 10 percent of each group uh similarly approximately 40 percent of all the wealth in each group is owned by the top one percent so if you were to take the wealth distributions for each of these groups and lay them on top of one another they would almost perfectly overlap but here's the problem the proportion of wealth that is held by black and Latino households is substantially less than the proportion of wealth that is held by White House households relative to their population presence so for example uh Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved in the United States excuse me constitute about 12 percent of the nation's population but possess about two percent of the nation's wealth so we have a maldistribution of wealth that occurs across all three of the social groups but the Mal distribution for black Americans and for Latinos is a Mal distribution over a disproportionately lower share of the total nation's wealth okay um so now let me make a brief transition to thinking about racial differences in wealth uh that uh that apply at the intersection with gender uh and it's it's particularly interesting to look at women who are elderly UH 60 years of age and older uh and compare those who have similar educational levels so here's a really stunning statistic white women who graduated from college have 35 times the wealth of black women who graduated from college in this elderly category so um the the raw numbers are are estimates of 384 thousand dollars in net worth in comparison with eleven thousand dollars in net worth moreover white women without college degrees have uh substantially greater wealth than black women without college degrees and actually an even greater level of wealth relative to black women with college degrees and so uh so at the intersection of race and gender there still are substantial glaring differences in the levels of wealth um tried to make a further adjustment in this analysis by looking at racial differences in wealth uh among women who have similar family or parental structures and again we find that there are substantial differences even among um unmarried women with children while uh white women have a relatively low level of net worth as you can see in the diagram uh black women with children who are unmarried have uh a net worth of approximately zero uh so the disparities are quite substantial once we even take into account differences in family or parental structure so what causes these disparities in wealth uh particularly disparities in wealth across racial and ethnic groups well I think we would have to tell somewhat different stories about the disparities that are associated with black white differences from the disparities that are associated with uh Latino and and and and not Latino white differences uh I've done substantially more research on trying to understand wealth disparities between blacks and whites in the United States and less work on the question of uh the determinants of the disparities uh between uh Latinos and non-latino whites in the United States uh so as a consequence I would like to focus on the former although I do have some Reflections that I could share in the Q a about uh about the the sources of the differences for the latter and and the work that I've done the the central argument that that I've been making for a while is that um the the key factor that dictates any individual household rules wealth position is the intergenerational transmission of resources that they may have received from previous generations so uh to put it in a nutshell the reduced form equation for the current generation's level of wealth is the level of wealth of their parents and their grandparents and perhaps if if we had access to it in in in in a data set we we could actually explore uh Generations further back than than their grandparents but in in a data set like the panel study of income Dynamics the best we could do is look at parental and Grand parental wealth and what its implications and effects are for uh for the uh the current adult generation uh so that said if we if we Center the intergenerational transmission mechanisms as being at the heart of uh the disparities that we observe then uh the reason why we have racial disparities must be because previous generations have not had previous generations of of black parents and grandparents have not had the same amount of resources that they could transmit to subsequent generations and when I'm talking about resource transmission across Generations I'm actually talking about three different things first I'm talking about inheritances that is the transmission of resources that occurs when the donor dies second I'm talking about something that is typically underestimated in our conversations about intergenerational transfers which is in Vivo transfers or gifts uh transfers that are made while the donor is still living these may not be of the same order of magnitude as inheritances on an individual case but in terms of their Collective impact as well as their timing they can have a great deal of significance in terms of enabling subsequent generations to accumulate more uh and then uh the third thing is the general absence of certain types of economic anxieties that arise as a consequence of growing up in a home that is well situated financially so um so those three considerations come into play and I think that they ultimately have a non-linear or non-additive effect on uh subsequent Generations access to uh to resources and wealth building opportunities so if we observe a racial Gap uh in the context of that kind of theoretical explanation for differences in wealth the racial Gap must be attributable to the fact that black and white uh uh parents and grandparents have very different capabilities for transmitting resources across Generations because they have very different resources and so what accounts for the Gap in resources between uh black and white households ultimately it's a history of social policies that have been conducted in the United States that have promoted white accumulation of wealth and promoted black decumulation of wealth what are those policies well I'd like to start with the immediate aftermath of the Civil War in which the formerly enslaved were promised 40-acre land grants as as restitution for the years of bondage now that was a promise that was not kept simultaneously the federal government introduces the Homestead Act of 1862 which eventually I think by 1930 provides a 160 acre land grants to one and a half million white families uh that one and a half million figure would constitute approximately 10 percent of the white population in the United States circa 1900 and 1910. uh and that's that's a substantial proportion of the white population that received this kind of what we might call free Equity from the uh from the federal government uh Trina Shanks uh Williams at the University of Michigan has estimated that 45 million living white Americans are beneficiaries of those of those Homestead Act land patents to the present day um in addition in the aftermath of the Civil War uh the the nation adopts a policy of legal segregation that is sustained for close to a century and during the course of the period of legal segregation which obviously had adverse effects on black wealth accumulation you also had a series of upwards of 100 white massacres that took place all across the country uh ranging from locations uh like Fort Bend County Texas to Chicago Illinois to Wilmington Delaware to Wilmington North Carolina to Bisbee Arizona and so on and so on uh and in the course of these 100 massacres and I think the one that's probably most familiar to people now is the Tulsa Massacre of 1921 but in the course of these uh 100 massacres not only were black lives taken but black owned property was seized and appropriated and made the property of the white terrorists themselves so this further accentuated the racial wealth Gap and then the policies in the 20th century that I think are most pertinent include the transition from the federal government engaging in asset building by land distribution to pursuing asset building by supporting home ownership but this this transition was conducted in a highly highly discriminatory fashion and so as a consequence you had the introduction of redlining as a public-private partnership between the federal housing Administration and local banks that denied black households the capacity to acquire credit and particularly to acquire credit that would permit them to become uh to become homeowners and then you had the GI bill that comes into operation in the immediate aftermath of World War II where the home buying provisions of that legislation were overwhelmingly applied to White returning veterans from the war and denied black returning veterans from the war the last set of 20th century policies that are relevant to the production of the racial wealth Gap are the policies that are associated with uh urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s in particular which included the running of freeway systems through the heart of black communities frequently uh destroying uh black business districts and I live in Durham North Carolina which is a case and point of that type of policy impact so so wealth inequality in the United States overall is Extreme the racial wealth Gap is Extreme and the origins of the racial wealth Gap are tied very very closely to Federal social policies that produced asset building opportunities for white Americans while denying them for black Americans
