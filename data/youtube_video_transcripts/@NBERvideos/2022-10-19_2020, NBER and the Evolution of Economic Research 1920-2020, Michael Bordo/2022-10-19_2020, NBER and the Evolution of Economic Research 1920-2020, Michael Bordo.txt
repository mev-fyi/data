okay well it's a great pleasure to be here and uh this paper that I'm discussing uh really did an excellent job of uh of covering the issues um and they they clearly discussed the impact of um Friedman Milton Friedman Anna Schwartz's monetary Trends in Cycles project at the nber and this 40-year project as they said was was built on the creation of a new monetary aggregate database and it had an ever increasing impact on monetary economics and monetary policy and it made that you know as as John mentioned at the end it made the case for the role of monetary forces in precipitating inflation and and the business cycle and again as they say a monetary History of the United States 1963 was and still is the star attraction of the project and in a sense what Paul volcker did in 1979 was uh even though he didn't directly do it but he followed the prescriptions that ended the great inflation okay so and and the key Legacies of a monetary history according to Emmy and John were The Narrative Approach as a method to identify a link between changes in in money the money supply and the economy and secondly that the the the the project laid the key foundations of modern monetary economics what comes out is in the long run there's the neutrality of money in the short run that changes in money over the business cycle affect real output and the effect real Outlet because of nominal rigidities but there are other important legacies that I would I would throw in uh once the importance of monetary policy in a sense as they said the view that money didn't matter well basically what Freeman and Schwartz did was say that money did matter uh again another issue is destabilizing effects of discretionary policies on the importance of rules this is a key theme that comes out of the out of their work um but what I want to do is I want to focus on two things one is that I'll say a little bit more about the data analysis and a little bit more about the the process by which Friedman and Schwartz in a sense can you know convince the public about it so uh so it really goes back to Anna Schwartz's work as they said I was really fortunate to work with her for for many decades and she began her data work in 1936 uh in in a book by by Arthur gayer and Walt rostow called the growth and fluctuations of the British economy 1790 to 1850. this was published in 1953 and the book was based on nber technique so it was a predecessor to what came out it was not an NBR book but it it was using the burns and Mitchell techniques remember Anna was a was a student of Arthur Burns and she began she switched her attention in 1940 to the United States and she began working on the U.S monetary data uh and she she wrote a paper with with with Emma Oliver who was another researcher at the bureau back then and it was published in 1947 and she did these estimates of currency uh held by the public Vault cash and treasury cash that was the basis for the collection of monetary statistics which was in monetary statistics in the United States in 1970 and that underlay the books and articles of the entire NBR process so this is a a very big very comprehensive and detailed data project that sort of underlie everything and this is the essence of what the NBR is all about my second comment is I call it the struggle so you know uh you know uh Emmy and John talk about you know how could we how can we believe today how how people thought back then and now today we think that money matters and back then they didn't well in a sense it took a long time for this View for the Friedman and Schwartz and uh and what's called The monetarist View to gain some traction um and it was tied up with this debate that people forgot about pretty well forgotten about but was really dominated the profession from the 1960s up into the 80s it was the debate between the monetarists and the keynesians and the monetary analysis in the NBR project was part of a larger body of work pioneered by Milton Friedman on the modern quantity theory of money and later this was called monetarism he didn't come up with the idea that I think it came from from Carl Bruner but there may be other Origins and so what he did in the modern in this in the in his book in in the modern quantity theory of money in 1956 okay he challenged the prevailing Keynesian Orthodoxy that money didn't did not matter and then there were a series of papers that were written by Friedman okay which were sort of behind everything and one was a monetary and fiscal framework for monetary stability in the AER where he kind of laid out the the origins of his of his monetary rule and then this the second paper was called price and monetary changes in three wartime so here he Compares what happened in in the Civil War World War one and World War II but the methodology that he set up was The Narrative Approach that's later in a monetary history okay and then a program for monetary stability where he lays out his his famous monetary rule so these were the foundations and then Friedman Schwartz Phil Kagan wise woman and other people who were mostly NBR Scholars they then took on the Keynesian Orthodoxy in direct combat and that raged through the 1960s and the key Keynesian antagonists were James Tobin of the Yale School Franco medulliani and Paul Samuelson at MIT and Lawrence Klein of Penn and they they had a strong influence on the staff at the Federal Reserve okay so in a sense free free mention we're taking on we're taking on the establishment now as as Emmy and John mentioned a key part of the debate and a key sort of takeaway we always have of a monetary history is chapter seven on on on the great contraction of 1929 to 33 where they argued that the FED in a sense caused the downturn by tight monetary policy in 1928 and then they allowed the recession to turn into depression by not following lender of Last Resort that they had been at the FED had been established to do to offset the banking panics so as as Emmy and John said uh 10 Peter temen in a sense challenged this View and he argued that the collapse in money was really an endogenous response to the collapse of autonomous concern it was considerable debate on this in a sense it it was resolved in the 80s on the side of Friedman and Schwartz but now it's come back again there's new papers by a new generation that's bringing up fiscal and other other other issues so it's not totally gone but in a sense it's the great inflation itself which the monetarist attributed to the FED accommodation of growing fiscal deficits by success of administrations in the 60s and 70s that led to the ascendancy of the Friedman Schwartz approach and it LED and we I talk about this in my comment is the Fed track beginning to track monetary Aggregates in the 50s into the 60s and then they adopt monetary targeting after 1907. this of course came through with Congress through the Congress mandating that they do this okay so why the profession increasingly accepted the Friedman Schwartz interpretation of the great inflation the FED didn't follow through with the requisite type monetary policies and they did this for a largely political reasons as is well known fear of output losses and Rising unemployment associated with the disinflation that would really be needed to get rid of the inflation that prompted both Linda Johnson and Richard Nixon in their own time to pressure the Fed chairs not to tighten this is something very similar to what we're experiencing today so as Emmy and John explain it took volcker who was not a monetrist to follow the tight monetary policies that came from the Friedman and Schwartz A playbook so if the debate continued into the 70s and the key issues there were one was the black box that Friedman and Schwartz they never wrote down a model of the economy of the monetary and the second was the role of monetary Aggregates and Friedman insurance lost both battles they okay the islm model was heavily criticized and since Friedman gave up on that and the FED abandoned monetary Targets in the late in the late 1970s but in the end Freeman and Schwartz did win the war their work was key in cementing the notion that inflation is the responsibility of monetary policy and the influence of monetary policy is powerful at the cyclical frequency and the the research in this big project created the key pillars of modern monetary economics and Central Bank practice thank you great thank you very much
