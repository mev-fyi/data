so so this paper is about low frequency movement in the u.s labor market about an employment rate and the participation rate so this is the unemployment rate and the red is the low frequency movement in the primary so the secular training employment and so the interesting thing is that we have this inverse u shape so increasing in the 70s and then this marked decline 80s especially in the 90s and well i won't be talking about that part there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going on here uh what i'll be interested in is really this marked decline here particularly here in the 90s um now here's the participation rate again there's an inverse u uh trend but not at the same time so after this massive increase in participation this is women joining the labor force we know that which much well what we are a lot more certain about is this apparently secular decline since the early 2000s in participation and you know five years into the recovery or more and participation has kept going down and down and down and there's a lot of debate today and policies are quality circles why are we so low is it structural is it cyclical we don't know um so in this paper what we're going to argue is that there's actually a common factor behind both trends and this is a secular movement and desire to work among non-participants so that sentence sounds weird just bear with me for a minute um but what we're going to show we're going to argue is that the number rate went down especially strongly in the mid 90s because of a strong declining desire to work and the participation rate that we observed today that is very low is because also it's also because of this uh declining desire to work so first let me be clear on definitions of what i mean by an unemployed what i mean by non participants this is the bls definition so an unemployed is someone who does not have a job that has been looking for the past months past month a non-participant is someone who doesn't have a job and doesn't have hasn't been looking but there are other questions that the cps is asking to the non-employed people in particular since 1967 the cps has been asking consistently the same question which is about wanting a job or not so do you currently want a job either full-time or part-time and this paper is going to be about exploiting that question and digging into it um so to better understand what's going on with the non-participants so the first thing we do is that we pick the we split the non-participants into two group the groups in red they're always going to be red i want a job in the green i don't want the job and the first thing i'm going to show you is really the share of uh non-participant who wants a job so this is the the time series we get to back to 68 1968 and the striking thing the first try striking thing to us was well there's again a kind of an inverse u shape that's kind of reminiscent of what i just showed you for the unemployment rate another thing that's very striking is a strong decline in the second half of the 90s i just mentioned and we're going to study in this thing and what it means for the unemployment rate there are also some cyclical fractions this is interesting but this is not the focus of the paper i'm not going to dwelve on it so of course this question want a job and an important thing is well what does it capture does it convey any useful information about behavior that's crucial uh so to to to see that we exploit the panel dimension of the cps where we can track workers across successive months and measure their transition rates and so this is our view of the labor market here so we have employed and employed then the non-participants are made of true group the nln which is not won a job in the red which is want a joke for w and the first thing we measure is the entry rate into unemployment these are monthly transition rates uh average so you can see that i want a job is much more likely to join unemployment than a not wanted job by orders of magnitude larger and a similar picture holds for the joining employment someone wants a job is much more likely to join employment than not want a job now something i should say at this point because some people might be what the hell is going on is those people who don't want a job and they flow directly into finding a job so i'm not gonna this is i'm gonna stay very agnostic about these things this is gonna be an accounting exercise trying to quantify what this change in the share what the job mean for the participation and i'm going to resist making an interpretation until the very end and so it's a known fact in the literature there's those people that don't want to oversee and they flow into employment anyway so just going to take that as given so okay so this is the question we're trying to to quantify so there's been this large decline in the one on the job share what does it mean for unemployment and participation the way we gonna quantify this is with uh in the tradition of the ins and outs literature so going back to dar adobe alti wang and plant and more recently shiner where you describe the living market with a mark of chain uh so that you have the number of employed and employed and basically workers in each state that evolves according to this differential equation which is change in the stock is driven by the flows and lambda is this made transition matrix and from the structural accounting framework we can build any stock of interest uh as a function of the flow so for example the employment rate participation rate and the share of on the job there's one more assumption we make which is again uh pretty usual in this in that literature that the empire rate is in steady state so the flows are so large in the united states that the system converges to a steady state within a quarter so when we're going to use quarterly data we can assume that the unemployment rate depends only on this current flows and not in the past of the flow so that's going to give us an expression that we're going to linearize and from that expression we can decompose movements and employment to different uh components and in particular the contribution of movements in the share of on the job so i'm going to spare you and we'll do the same thing for participation so i'm going to spare you the technical details of how we do that exactly just to give you an intuition so you can see it's very simple how does the share water job affect unemployment so it's going to affect the average entry rate okay the unemployment rate is basically the ratio of the these guys over that those guys so what matters the the change in the combination of this group is going to matter to what extent they influence the entry whether people enter mostly through you or mostly through e and remember this is the the transition rate i just showed you earlier and the red guys were very likely to flow into you in fact much more than flowing into e but if you look at the green guys the ones who don't want a job it's actually the opposite they're more likely to flow into e than to throw into you so what does it mean for the unemployment rate well imagine you have a very high share of people who want a job so that that pool is dominated by red guys on the floors out of that pool the average flows are going to look like right meaning you're going to have large flows into the labor force meaning a high participation rate and you have higher flows into you than need to eat therefore a high unemployment rate now same story but let's shift the weight towards people who don't want to jump then the flows are going to look like the green ones meaning low entry rate into the labor force therefore low participation rate and lower flows into you i'm also going to therefore higher employment rate uh that means a lower unemployment rate and this is kind of the story we're going to be telling this decline the share of people who want a job is going to lower the unemployment rate and the participation rate so that's the intuition now we're going to show you i'm going to show you quantitative results now for complete i should say one thing uh because some of you might want okay that's great and all those want a job they join the labor force we i understand they have a high entry rate but once they're inside the labor force maybe they do behave differently maybe they are very likely actually to leave the labor force uh next month and do it basically back and forth so in this model this is not going to happen because it's markov chain as soon as you don't employ you become like everyone else but in the paper we we have also a more general framework where we allow those wanted job and no one's job to continue behaving differently once they're inside the labor force and then the for some time and the interesting thing at the end we get very similar results it doesn't really change much the result and the reason is because the biggest difference between want a job and not want a job is through the entry rate remember here we have orders of magnitude differences between red and green once they're inside the labor force the the the the one job and no one to drop they are different but not that much so at the end of the day when you split when you change the the weight on the red and the green what they do inside the air force is not going to matter that much that's why we get very similar results and this really the entry rate that matters okay and now for completeness one more thing we're going to do is that we know demographic groups have different hazard rates for example the young a very high turnover so we're going to allow for a turjan 80 across demographics and as a side bonus we'll get the contribution of demographics which is a known important factor behind the unemployment rate movement okay so here's the composition of unemployment right i'm going to show you in a second so this is my estimate of the low frequency i mean my the cbo estimate of the natural rate of unemployment this is the contribution of demographics so what did i plot here don't worry too much about the average level what we care about is this through this linear decomposition is the movements and employment that are explained by demographics so we split the population into 10 age groups and sex and this huge inverse you shape here is the aging of the baby boom this is a point that shaman made actually almost 20 years ago also in the nbr micro annual and that the problem went up and went down because of the share of young workers young workers have a high turnover high unemployment rate and now there's less of them and therefore we have a lower enemy rate that's about point seven percentage point the total decline okay so now what about the share wanted job so you can look green blue the magnitude is about as large so that that those one job they seem to matter a lot for to understand those low frequency movement and notice the strong uh decline here in the mid 90s that you see again that's about half a percentage point of unemployment okay so from a fed perspective that's a large number and what's interesting is that when you put the red and the green together this is what you get and i didn't cook that up in fact i didn't have that the natural right picture before it was the suggestion of the jonathan to have some sort of flow frequency and i was very struck by you know when you put the two together it seems like you're explaining the bulk of those low frequency movement in the plumbing in fact this this large decline here in the mid 90s you can see contribution of combination of demographics and a share want a job okay so now let me move to uh the participation rate so i'm going there are many ways to present the results so the participation rate it's a bit easier to do a slightly different exercise what i'm going to do here is going to put the partition rate along with counter factual participation rate where i'll hold the composition constant what composition first let me hold the composition the demographic composition constant so age and sex and i i hold it at its 69 value so here the two lines should be the same and then you can see that for most of the history of the participation rate demographics hasn't had much effect on the participation rate except basically since the end of the recession there's a huge effect here and a huge gap opening up and it's driven by all workers whereas the effect on demographic on employment is driven by young workers for participation is driven by all workers why because all workers is a very a very high a very low participation rate and what happened there is that the 65 and over age group has really increased a lot uh lately and and that opened up this gap okay so that's the contribution of demographics how about the contribution of one a job so again i'm going to hold the composition of one of your constant added 69 value so here the two lines are the same and the blue is what would have happened to participation if there hadn't been all these movements in the the share of only job and first when you compare red green and blue you can see that well one of your actually matters even more and what happened well so you have the 70s and then remember in the 70s you had a desire to work that actually the show wanted a job that went up and so this gap opened up meaning that participation was higher than it would have been under a constant share of one a job and then this gap was there then there and you can see this big crossing the big crossing is the decline in the share of on the job in the mid 90s the second half of the 90s and what's interesting is that in the second half of the 90s no one was talking about you know lower desire to work or things like this because participation rate was going up this is the red line the thing is that given the really strong labor market that we had the strong job finding rate that we had actually if there hadn't been a desire to work we should have had an explosion in participation some extent it should have gone up to that level so the gap should have opened up just didn't see it because it didn't have this counterfactual okay and now the the gap open up meaning that now because we have this low desire to work well we have a lower participation rate and this is you can see here this gap that opened up and then when you put the two together so want a job in demographic this is very striking uh as of what's happening this day because you have a very large gap uh from those two composition effects so it seems that aging and lord desire to work a big part of the law participation rate today okay now a natural question is all right so you just tell me you just told me that the share want a job went down why where this does want a job go what happened to them well the nice thing about this stock flow exercise is that we can do the same exercise for the shelf on the job okay we can decompose the flows responsible from for the stock for the movements in this stock okay and so there are all these possible flows that that could matter but what we find is that the decline in the share one job is driven only by two flows those two so i want a job i don't want the job so people switching this thing so how do i show that well this is the exercise we do so in blue is the shell on the job since 94 the one we observe and in green is the counterfactual where only two floors are allowed to move this is the flows between i want a job at a dorner jump did you stop the cat the clock when he okay that's okay um and so this is so we can see that the green line is pretty close to the to the two bra in the sense that this lower this decline in the show on the job is really driven by those two flows and it's interesting because it means that those want a job is not that they were absorbed by the labor market let's say during the the strong you know high-tech the i-tech boom of the the second half of the 90s it's not like they joined the labor force instead it seems like they moved away from the labor force so they wanted job became less interested they moved to not want a job so okay here comes the the big question is that okay why do we have this decline desire to work in the second half of the 90s and for the first time i'm going to stop being completely accounting so agnostic of things i need to take a stand about what i think about this one a job question those menu this is the simplest uh way we could think about it so there are search fictions in the labor market and we need to search to find a job uh and the one job question just helps you measure search intensity and all these non-employment states that the household survey measures not want a job want the job unemployed i just arbitrary distinction introduced by the household survey and this perfect measurement of search intensity so we put people in blocks but in fact such intensity is on the real line and so once you have this this framework in mind then search intensity all this propensity to report i want a job depends on returns to employment the returns to non-participation is not going to be important for our story so welfare disability uh or the added worker effect for instance so you know we know that we know there were really large wage gains in the second half of the 90s because of the labor market boom and for the ad worker effect meaning if you're a secondary earner and you see your spouse making more money you're less likely to search for a job okay so let me before doing a quantitative exercise to see what explanation may work or may not work let me look a bit into subgroups of what happened so first the the decline is in one job is primarily a primary female phenomenon this is number of not want a job that disappeared okay there's about one million for women but about only a quarter of that for primate male so primarily a female in some extent young people second thing this is a non-single household phenomenon so if you leave alone no decline in desire to work it's only if you live in a family okay now if you live in a family how about the income of the family well it's only low income this is first quartile second quintile big decline desire to work if you look at the top quantile much less so so it's a low income problem how about low income families with children without children when you have children lower decline okay so there's a bunch of facts i recap them here but it seems like a made an explanation for this decline in desire to work has to be looked that to an explanation that works to these groups low-income families so typically single mothers for instance and what major change happened in the 90s that could have affected these groups well there's the welfare reforms so there was this big welfare reform in the 90s uh let me show you a bit with one picture what they did this is the clinton welfare to work well there was two steps one was clinton one was before that um the first one is the afdc-10 reform so if this is the traditional welfare to be eligible you have to be low in common you need to have children the c is for children the n is needy no income so what you saw is that the reform was in 96 big decline in welfare caseloads and therefore big decline in spending this is government spending for this thing so really really strong decline in welfare while at the same time there was a massive expansion of the eitc which is the earned income tax credit so the idea of this welfare to work was to shift the people from welfare that could to push them into the labor force and by giving them incentive to work you put them tax credit another interesting thing that happened around that time is the ssi this is supplemental secured income for this group i'm going to look at this is disability income for low people follow income people so just remember that this thing actually went up and so what we want to do now is to quantify okay what may have happened what is the most plausible explanation so what we're going to do to do that or we're going to estimate a very simple linear probability models is the probability report wanting a job on some characteristics what kind of characteristic or if you have children if you're married um anything we could think of we throw in and then income categories so income categories are welfare benefits disability insurance the family income this is to capture an added worker effect uh the wealth income taxes and so on um and then importantly we put a time dummy uh so year dummy because we want to estimate this relationship in the cross section so using cross-sectional version and users estimate to see how much of the decline in the shale wonder job we can predict in the time series well and then the interesting thing we find is that actually this this regression so i can show you the estimates if you're interested after that but we explained about 50 to 60 percent of the decline in the share of on the job through two things the first thing is the decline is welfare caseloads so when you're on welfare you have to do a you know you have to show that you want to go back to work you have to do job training you have to take part in programs go back to work pretty rapidly and so people want welfare they're actually more likely to find a job and there's declining welfare case laws as brought down the people want a job disability has the opposite effect disability one up when you're in disability by definition you cannot work so you are very unlikely to do that and this is the two main effect we find we don't find much for the added worker effect so okay let me discuss in this result because it's a bit surprising at first glance this welfare to work if you're familiar with it um first it was meant to increase desire to work it was meant to push people into the labor force and generally believed to have succeeded i mean participation rate for example single mothers increased a lot during that time we think this this is necessarily inconsistent with what we find uh here's our conjecture so what the welfare reform mainly did is two things um it made welfare stricter in terms of work requirements instead you had to find the jobs within two years you had to do a lot of job training preparation basically if you think about my conceptual framework you had to have a minimum level of search intensity that went up all right and then it's kind of a single zoom experiment if you have a low disutility of search or if you have a you know a high marginal effect of higher search on job finding probability that push you to the labor force okay uh and this is perhaps what would have happened to some groups however if you the weaker welfare participant so if you had this utility search load labor market prospect and so on well maybe this pushed you out of welfare this for example there are time limits on the welfare uh system introduced by the reform that could have pushed you out what could have pushed you in disability there's a literature actually documenting the substitutability between uh fdc so welfare and ssi which um it's just disability and so this is one hypothesis an interesting thing is that then this has an interesting implication that this reform referred to work reform could have shifted the weaker known participants from a program that had some connection to the labor force welfare to program that absolutely no connection to labor force which is disability meaning that this had the opposite opposite effect that is intended and through that effect it lowered unemployment rate because it kicked out those guys okay so let me conclude uh so we have a new factor behind both trains and employment and participation rate in particular a strong decline in the share of wanted job in the second half of the 90s and one question we're asking our cross-sectional estimates suggest that we also have different if estimates that suggest that um that the waffle reform might be beyond this decline and just as the last word uh how about the unemployment rate going forward well what remember those two composition effect aging and want a job well they're still very low all right so if you go back to 2000 we have an unemployment rate of 3.8 percent we still have the exact same lower flow unemployment from this composition effect which means if you go back to the peak of 2000 you can imagine an employment rate of 3.8 even perhaps more realistically back to 2006 you still get an employment rate of 4.4 percent so we still have a lot of room to go what's going on right now is the job fair is very low but if you catch up with that there's no reason we can get them thank you
