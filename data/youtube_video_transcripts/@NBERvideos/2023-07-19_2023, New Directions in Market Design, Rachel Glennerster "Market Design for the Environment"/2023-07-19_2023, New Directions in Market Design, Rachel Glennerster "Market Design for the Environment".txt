asked to talk a bit about how my experience in taking Market design type issues or Market shaping ideas and applying them in policy but mainly I'm going to talk about Innovation because what we've heard so far is mainly about getting process rate getting markets right when you already have uh products and you're trying to allocate them um and you know as a panel we agreed that kind of um there's a missing piece here of talking about Innovation and how we design markets to stimulate innovation so was this important well anything that we uh anything that we do at the moment involves carbon and we need innovation in pretty much every area of our life to decarbonize our society so you know how we heat our buildings how we get transported what we eat um all of it involves production of carbon and so we need a massive amount of innovation to decarbonize all of these different sectors um and even if you got carbon markets working um everywhere in the world and the right price is that would provide some stimulation for in it for the Innovation that we need but it wouldn't provide enough why not because we know from other areas that there is massive market failures in uh in Innovation right there's very people have documented very high returns uh to Innovation why is that because there's not enough because of things like spillovers you know somebody figures out a better way to do a solar panel very quickly all the other producers of sonar panels are copying them and therefore there's not enough incentive to be the person who does the r d to do that um the other big market failure and innovation of course is that we reward Innovation typically through patents and patterns produce their own market failures um in particular what they lead to is an innovation having a high price at least in the short run and low quantity what do we need for climate we need these Innovations to get out as rapidly as possible right so we really need to solve that access problem I mean it's terrible that we don't get drugs out fast enough with um and if I've worked on in the past but we really need rapid adoption of Technologies um in the in the climate space how do we typically spur Innovation what what are the typical things that we normally do well a lot of it is push which is uh where we pay for inputs we give grants to um you know exciting ideas we give grants to scientists to work on on new print new uh new ways of doing Renewables or hydrogen which is an area that I've been working on um but yeah the alternative is Paul an economists have been quite excited about Paul for a long time what do I mean by Paul it means paying for outcomes rather than inputs and there are a number of different ways of doing that you could pay for results so you can work with a specific firm and say if you get more outcomes or you know achieve these objectives um uh you we will pay you um you can do prizes which are lump sum um prizes for coming up with an innovation um both of those have big problems with them prizes in particular don't do anything about getting the product out there and often most of the prizes that have been done are actually just way too small which is a different problem people think you know you can give a million dollar prize to solve a market that is billions of dollars like it's just we're just completely wrong orders of magnitude but if you're going to give a big prize you want to I arguably tie it to getting the product out there and the product being something that people want to buy and you can see where I'm going which is a prize with those kind of characteristics is more like an advanced Market commitment where and what is an advanced Market commitment for people who don't know it's where you commit in advance to pay a certain subsidy which is tied to the quantity of that product that actually gets used or bought by other people so you've got a market test in there and you're tying it to quantity in return for that initial subsidy people commit to to charge a lower price um uh once the subsidy is over and that helps solve the Monopoly problem of a patent um now we have some experience of having Advanced Market commitments and that's um you know uh I was involved in the pneumococcal Advanced Market commitment which um was a commitment to buy a new form of pneumococcal that included the strains of the disease common in developing countries there's a 1.5 billion dollar commitment but we haven't seen new AMC since and I think that climate is a really important place where we ought to be using uh this technique more um I went off and worked on development economics after the after the pneumococcal um but I and a number of people including uh people in this room like Eric and and Susan got brought back into this problem during covid and I think uh because you know oh you've helped stimulate uh vaccines in the past can you help us figure out how to stimulate covert vaccines uh and a lot of people came in to help solve these problems and what's interesting though is the solution was completely different it was not an advanced Market commitment that is not what we suggested the reason is that for covert vaccines we need to to stimulate Innovation um we wanted a very large number of people to be working on Covert vaccines because it was extremely urgent and you wanted to pull in the you know some really marginal candidates to keep working on it and if you want to pull in the marginal candidate and you do an advanced Market commitment you have to set a very high price right a price that is high enough that will pull in the candidate that's got a very low probability of of achieving success and then you're going to pay that to even the one who's got quite a high probability and that is going to waste quite a lot of money so instead what we what we suggested to I was in the UK government at the time um others were lobbying the US government and basically anybody who would listen but those were the two who did the sensible policies I don't want to say it was because of us but um was to build capacity build more capacity to produce vaccines um now this is a digression into Health but the point is that the market design problem is really different for the different problem that you're facing right it depends on the market structure it depends on the urgency it depends on the probabilities of the different uh you know potential Solutions um but we now there's a third example which um I've worked on which is in the climate space which is on permanent carbon removal and we you know heard a lot of the problems in the voluntary Market a lot of this is not additional um permanent and and also goes up in smoke like literally a lot of the reforestation of those offsets had you know burnt in the forest fires in California recently so you know actually probably made things worse um so you know one answer is permanent carbon removal extremely expensive at the moment pretend many different potential social Solutions so this is an interesting example of where you really want to be technology agnostic or you want to be at least flexible so we worked with Frontier you've got a one billion dollar commitment to uh purchase permanent common removal like you know problems in markets like talk about this there's like no there's nothing you can sell with permanent carbon removal it's not renewable energy um there's you know unless people want to buy it for their for their offsets um so they put out a commitment for you know they're going to spend a billion dollars on permanent carbon removal that's help sort of get more people out of the woodwork knowing that there is somebody they could potentially sell to but the problem there is you've got all these different Technologies with very different prices and potentially very different cost curves over time and they were really worried about the financial market failures um because you know are you going to really put a billion dollars into a plant um uh you know how do you raise that on if if you simply said you were going to buy permanent carbon removal in the future um so in the end they did something that is they have different prices for different firms um I think there's room to do something a bit more from agnostic to to complement that those are some of the things that we've worked on we realized there was a massive demand out there and a massive need for this kind of Market shaping uh work in in climate so last week we launched uh the market shaping accelerator which is a group at the University of Chicago which is trying to be a clearing house for ideas on Market shaping um we can't possibly respond to the demand that we're getting um I mean I've spent the last week in in DC talking to a large number of agencies who have ideas that they want to do poll commitments on every one of these markets is completely different so you probably have to design a different system so my main you know my main goal today is to get you excited and come see me afterwards because I have real live things where there is money normally for advanced Market commitments is about trying to raise them money there's potentially money on the table for some of these things to do them to stimulate innovation so uh come see me if you're interested so what are some of the things that we're working on or thinking about um one is green concrete um which concrete is particularly problematic because not only do you need a lot of Heat and the source of you know the heat is then gonna require you know Carbon and the normal energy uh uh problem but the actual chemical reaction needed to make concrete creates carbon so um there's um a lot of you know a lot of potential opportunities a lot of different potential Technologies concrete of course is you know well known to IO economists as being not competitive you've got all these local you know monopolies or duopolies at the local level you've got you know problems of of um uh you know lack of competition even at the national level um and so you know you have to think very carefully about how you put substances into that system because you might end up with quite um uh you know surprising results the second problem um with with green concrete is that you've got these incumbents have a lot of embedded Capital so you know how to put incentives in the system to that would be enough to move uh these uh you know these big incumbents who have a lot of embedded Capital you've got to persuade them so one of the technologies that you could use that would reduce the carbon is instead of using Limestone you would use a different um rock and silicon carbonate I think don't quote me on that uh but you would need your your factories producing cement to be next to a different kind of rock right so you've got billion dollar factories and they need to be somewhere else you're not going to do that unless you have a really long-term commitment before for this so again how do we design that the um you know one thing we've been talking about given that there's a big range of different possibilities of Technologies and you want people to use whatever is the most sensible technology locally is just to have the government who purchases by the way 50 of concrete in the US right so it's a very nice opportunity to work with the government to just fix how they purchase concrete so can you put can you embed as it were the social cost of carbon in their procurement decisions and then you have a very flexible mechanism and you basically introduce a carbon Market without introducing a carbon market right just through procurement rules so that's something that we're looking into um no the another issue is hydrogen um hydrogen is potentially a very important uh future fuel um you would need a lot of green energy going into it to make it a a good uh alternative but it's nice and but you can store it um you know and people have said it might be a better solution to you know batteries to store between seasons um or you know and it's potentially a way to decarbonize things that are very difficult to decarbonize otherwise the problem in the carbon Market is you've got complementarities in um in Innovation so you've got to innovate on producing hydrogen you've got to innovate on using hydrogen and so the people who could potentially innovate to produce it don't want to do it because they don't know whether anybody's going to use it nobody's going to put in a long a lot of money into um into designing ways to use hydrogen if they don't know whether there's going to be hydrogen the moment there's a big tax credit um you know potential to do more um you know I'm not an IO Economist um so we really need to be working with Iowa economists who know this sort of thing better I mean I'm working with Chris Schneider um he's one of the co-directors of the market shaping accelerator uh but to figure out things about the lessons from this you know this isn't the first time we've had problems of complementary Innovations heat resistant crops is another area that we're working on we need massive Innovation on our crops because there are tipping points uh where they you suddenly the productivity of a crop crashes we are starting to get that kind of innovation for crops in the US the places that will be hit hardest by climate change are seeing very little Innovation on that and so you could see big parts of the world lose their ability to produce uh the food that they survive on um as they say some of the issues are embedded Capital limited competition um and and this in Need for very long-term certainty in a situation where governments aren't very good at providing long-time certainty right I mean you put something in the rules or you put tax credits it could easily be overturned are there ways to solve that um as they say this is mainly a plug to get involved we have lots of live ideas that people would like uh solutions for um you know contracts the difference uh that's how they're doing hydrogen in the UK and Germany is that what the US should think about um so please come and see me if you have time to take on one of these challenges
