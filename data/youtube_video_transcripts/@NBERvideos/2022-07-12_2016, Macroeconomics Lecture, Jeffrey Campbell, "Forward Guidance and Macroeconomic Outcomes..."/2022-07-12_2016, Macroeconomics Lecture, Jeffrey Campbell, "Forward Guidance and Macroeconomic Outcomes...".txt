this paper characterizes the effects of fomc forward guidance on macroeconomic expectations and outcomes particularly over the long period after 2008 when the fed funds rate was at its effective lower bound we examine evidence from event studies and conduct policy analysis using an empirical dsge model although the theoretical potential for forward guidance to improve outcomes in such situations is clear an activity puzzle from the from the event study evidence casts doubt on its effects and practice surprise increases in expected future rates lead private sector forecasters to raise their forecasts of gdp growth and lower their forecasts of the unemployment rate this counterintuitive result creates ample room for empirically grounded skepticism toward the hypothesized effects to forward guidance for our first task we made skepticism a little more difficult by demonstrating that the puzzle reflects the revelation of fomc private information regarding future economic outcomes the fomc signals that it sees higher economic growth in the future than do private forecasters and in turn market expectations of future rates rise simultaneously with private forecasts of output growth so to better understand the event study activity puzzle and our resolution of it consider first regressing a revision of private sector expectations of activity on surprise innovations to expected future policy rates here delta b bar h equals the blue chip expectations revision for an activity variable in h quarters we measure it with the forecast change over the month containing a particular fomc meeting the surprise innovation to the future policy rates expectation in j quarters is delta i bar j we measure this with the change in the futures contract rate over a much tighter time window so its movements reflect revealed policy choices and statements our prior work found that estimates of beta usually had the wrong sign we hypothesized that this arose from the influence of so-called delphic forward guidance which forecasts both future fundamentals and the corresponding appropriate policy actions while promising nothing we speculated that these regressions would yield estimates with the right signs if the interest rate surprises reflected only the policy commitments that characterized odyssean forward guidance adding delphic forward guidance introduces a simultaneity bias so our accounting for delphic forward guidance and such event study regressions begins with a comparison of blue chip forecasts with those from the green book in light of the green book's well-documented relative success at macroeconomic forecasting we call the differences between them fomc private information to measure its transmission to market participants we regress surprise we regret surprise changes to the expected policy rate in four quarters on a vector of these private information measures here z-bar we build this from forecasts of activity and inflation for the current and next four quarters fomc participants might require time between meetings to digest forecast innovations before acting upon them so zbar includes private information measures from the current and previous meetings the sample begins with the introduction of the fomc statements in february 1994 and ends in december 2010 the statistical significance of gamma's estimate here indicates if the fomc transmits its private information to market participants and the regressions r squared measures the relative importance of such information for policy driven changes to interest rate expectations here we summarize the estimation results with walled tests of exclusion hypotheses to aid an interpretation we also report the analogous results for a regression in which the dependent variable equals the current policy rate there are three results to note first fomc private information indeed explains some of the surprise change in the expected future policy rate so it appears that the green book forecasts influence private expectations through the statement's this reflects the previous meetings private information so fomc communications display latency excuse me second fomc private information does not impact the current policy rate this result deflects a possible critique of our approach that the staff adjusts its forecast to support a preset policy conclusion third the regression r squared equals 23 percent thus the short run delphi forward guidance we measure can be detected but does not dominate policy driven changes in expected interest rates going forward we're going to measure the short run delphic forward guidance from a given statement with this regression's fitted values the residuals from this regression contain odyssey and forward guidance but they mix it with longer run delphic forecasts so we give those residuals no structural label okay let's go to the next slide okay with this decomposition in hand oh yeah with this decomposition in hand we run the regressions underlying the event study activity puzzle after replacing the right hand side variable with its short run delphic and residual components this table shows the results for the unemployment rate its first two columns report estimates from the baseline regressions discussed earlier the dependent variables are the forecast innovations for the next four quarters the estimated coefficients are all negative and about equal to each other and one of them is statistically significant at the five percent level however the r squared measures are very low the table's remaining columns report estimates from the expanded regressions the short run delphic forward guidance coefficients are negative large and statistically significant at the one percent level the residuals coefficients are generally positive but they are small astonishingly to us the r squared measures jump to about 20 percent that is one-fifth of the variance in unemployment forecast revisions arises from the fomc's transmission of short run delphic forward guidance so what are the lessons that we can possibly learn from this thank you well our paper contains a more detailed analysis of event studies of the event study results including a discussion of whether forward guidance substantially impacts treasury term premia the results presented today frame our policy analysis well enough first the fomc does transmit delphi forward guidance in its statements while this fact accounts well for the event study activity puzzle considerable surprise variance in the four quarter ahead expected policy rate remains so the data leave plenty of room for for the operation of odyssey and forward guidance however our event study analysis finds no statistically significant effects of the residual variance that contains odyssey and guidance while we believe further improvements to our analysis are possible we must also acknowledge the intrinsic limitations of such an unstructured analysis when applied to a small sample indeed gertler and karate found substantial and intuitive effects of forward guidance when using interest rate surprises from event studies as instruments for a standard var which of course imposes more structure d'amico and king find similar results after imposing sign restrictions suitable for odyssey and forward guidance so the this i'd like to outline the basic plan of what we're going to do now with our model based policy evaluation the set the standard rbc framework sits at our model's foundations so the long so long run growth this is sorry this is the wrong slide pal that's all right no problem okay got it right here okay okay so the basic plan is going to be we're going to add forward guidance to a relatively standard dsge model we're going to add a couple of other important features as well we're going to estimate that model with both calibration and bayesian methods and then we're going to compare outcomes from data with counter factual outcomes without forward guidance now this presents a technical challenge for us because we use shocks to the interest rate rule um for two purposes one is anticipated shocks provide forward guidance themselves the second is that the um they keep interest rate expectations from violating the zero lower bound so how do we get rid of the forward guidance while keeping the expectations the way we do that is we replace the shocks that we identify in the data with shocks chosen by a policy maker who cares only about minimizing deviations from the taylor rule subject to the zlb okay marty calls this the thelma and louise path you've got the hands on the steering wheel and you're going over the cliff the um we call these taylor maximum fidelity pads okay so now let me walk through the specification of the model okay that's okay it's okay we're good we're all good so for the model specification let's just talk about it's got lots of familiar uh features that you know from cristiano weickenbaum and evans as well as smets and wilders i'm going to highlight the new features on the preferences side we add two things one is a preference for government bonds now those government bonds are going to be in zero net supply but that preference is going to drive a spread between the policy rate and the rate of return on capital and that spread is necessary if our model is to match both nippa aggregates in the long run and a reasonable long-run fed funds rate those two are very different from one another obviously so we want to get that right it also gives us a basis a more micro founded basis for the risk premium shock that smith and wilder's introduced okay um we're also going to introduce hymovic and rebelo preferences now these preferences dampen the income effect in the short run and so they um on labor supply and so they enhance co-movement in response to a given um uh a tech a news shock about technology here we're gonna give them the same opportunity to do the same thing following a new shock on monetary policy okay on monetary policy itself we're going to add two other new features one is going to be a stochastic intercept to the taylor rule when we hear it's labeled as pi star which is going to be the long run inflation rate this thing's going to follow a very persistent auto regression with um a very very persistent auto regression um with very small innovation variants and a uh a uh two percent long run mean okay this is so that we can model the the substantial decline in average inflation at the beginning of our sample which begins in the other feature we're going to add is um monetary policy shocks that are announced in advance of their implementation here the sum of those zeitgeist terms are the those past values of those policy shocks influencing the current rate okay okay this is not quite right this is the that's okay okay okay yep okay got it so this goes through the model's data its estimation uses nipah price and quantity series a measure of hours worked multiple indicators of wage and price inflation a survey-based measure of long-run inflation expectations the current policy rate and market-based measures of its expected future values from euro dollar and ois markets the nipa data is chain aggregated into three model consistent components of gdp consumption investment and a residual that includes net exports and government consumption our measure of hours worked employs an adjustment for demographic trends in labor supply from ferbis while the inflation's expectations data comes from the spf because our estimation forces basic nipa data and interest rate futures data to coexist we expect the estimation to minimize any forward guidance puzzle which of course would be counterfactual our estimation procedure follows a not somewhat non-standard approach we first calibrate the parameters that the model has in common with the standard rbc framework to match long-run averages from the us economy this first moment's first approach ensures that any any success we have in replicating second moments does not come at the cost of counter factual long run predictions the remaining parameters govern pricing frictions and standard dsge features we estimate these using relatively standard bayesian methods within this procedure the inflation expectation series disciplines the evolution of pi star and the interest rate futures data ensures that our model accounts for market expectations of future monetary policy after estimation in the paper we demonstrate that the model produces a credible business cycle history driven primarily by shocks to permanent neutral technology and the demand for government bonds furthermore we verify that the model does not display a forward guidance puzzle like that examined by del negro giannoni and patterson hence it appears to be a credible laboratory within which to conduct the analysis of monetary policy so this slide presents some of the results of that analysis the actual policy rate and its market-based expectations are in red along with those from our counterfactual taylor maximum fidelity paths from 2009 to 2014. each panel plots the rates at a given horizon and because their movements are intrinsically different sizes they have different scales the differences between the actual and tmfp current policy rates are actually very small however at longer horizons substantial differences arise throughout 2009 and into mid 2010 actual futures rates were well above those from the tmfp our model assumes an error-free transmission mechanism from policy intentions into market prices so the tmfp policymaker has an advantage over the real world fomc with this qualification in mind we nevertheless conclude that this rule-based monetary policy would have provided more accommodation in the great recession then did the fomc from mid 2010 to mid 2011 the two futures rates paths are quite close a dramatic difference between them opens up in the third quarter of 2011. this coincides with the replacement of extended period with mid-2013 in the august 2011 fomc statement this accommodation remains in place through 2014. the imp now unfortunately the colors got switched here um blue is now truth and red is counterfactual the implications of these policy differences for the actual and tmfp output gaps are substantial our model estimates that the output gap achieved a trough of minus six percent in the first quarter of 2011. thereafter it recovered sharply for two years before slowing down its convergence in 2011 and 24 to 2013 and 2014. at the end of 2014 it stood just below one minus one percent the tmfp output gap also achieved its trough in 2011 q1 but that was only about minus four percent the extra accommodation provided by the rule-based path substantially blunt blunts the great recessions contraction however the tmfp output gap essentially never recovers at the end of 2014 it equals minus 3 percent therefore the accommodation from the quantitative forward guidance begun in august 2011 substantially improved macroeconomic outcomes in the paper we show that the output gap exemplifies the behavior of other relevant series such as consumption investment hours worked and inflation okay so what lessons can we learn from this obviously singular experience one possible lesson from this evaluation is that attempts at implementing discretionary monetary policy even just constrained discretion can result in worse outcomes than those from following a simple and very credible rule however it would be incomplete to stop there the fomc's forward guidance from august 2011 onwards certainly deviated sharply from the rule and it substantially improved economic performance along both dimensions of the dual mandate we believe that the more useful lessons from this study acknowledge the fomc's real world difficulties with communication such as those i've had here the situation was unprecedented communications were by and for a committee rather than an individual and market participants often misread signals while trying to profit off of each other's confusion with those challenges in mind it should be unsurprising that switching from phrases with room for interpretation like extended period to phrases with ambiguity like mid 2013 helped offset those obstacles
