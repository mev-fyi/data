business cycle dating and the analysis of business cycles was really a key focus of the mbr from its inception and as jim mentioned wesley claire mitchell the founding research director of the bureau was really a pioneer in this area now before i get into substance i do want to mention that david and i are both members of the mbr business cycle dating committee and very importantly we do not speak for the committee so what you're going to hear today are some of our own musings uh thoughts about this issue but uh certainly they are not official mbr uh positions okay so what am i talking about well if you go to the mbr website you will see the quintessential nbr business cycle dates those ubiquitous lists that of peaks and troughs of economic activity and they show when economic activity hit a high and entered a falling state and then reached a low and started rising and interestingly the mbr has somehow managed to be the quasi official arbiter of recessions um really for for when they started and stopped for most of the previous century and that role continues uh still today now in terms of what we're going to do we're going to both in our paper we both look backward uh and forward so in terms of of retrospect i'm going to tell you a little bit about the history of the mbr uh business cycle dating process and give you a sense of why we think that this was actually a really important development and actually still is and then in terms of of looking forward we're going to suggest that revision is very much in the spirit of the mbr early nbr researchers talked about being willing to revise the mbr business cycle dates and the whole idea of the bureau as in data and evidence-driven uh organization i think sort of suggests that if if evidence suggests they should be revised we should certainly do it we're going to suggest that in particular maybe for a modern economy moving more towards the definition of a recession in terms of the output gap or slap would be a sensible idea and then we're even going to take a stab at how changing that definition might actually affect the mbr business cycle chronology all right so let me just tell you a little bit about the mbr business cycle dates and i'll have to tell you this was a challenge just there's such a voluminous literature from the early mbr on how they set these dates that tracking it all down uh has been uh uh quite a busy december uh one thing i do want to call out though and just highlight the mbr has done an amazing uh service to the profession of putting all the old out of print nbr books uh online we could not have done this project uh had they not done that all right so just some of the history so the first thing is the dates were set you know the sort of the early dates up through 1929 were set by wesley mitchell in 1929 if you want to know he had a really good research assistant or at least the person he says was doing the empirical work was simon kuznets now how the dates were set is actually quite different than uh today so importantly they were based mainly on narrative accounts so the idea was to read newspapers when did people uh in the economy contemporaneous observers think the economy was in a downturn they supplemented them with some business indexes which were typically kind of a mishmash of a whole bunch of series your description of one of the original uh designers coming from at t i think one of the series they used was the at t business cycle index so it all comes together an interesting thing is those measures were typically detrended so the early dates were were typically com taken off detrended series but one thing you should realize is that what we think of as the the mbr dates or what the early researchers would have called the reference dates and what they the idea was you set those first and then you looked at all the other series in relation to them so you should think of the business cycle date certainly the early ones as not the outcome of everything that the bureau did but rather the the sort of the initial uh input all right so those are the early dates burns and mitchell so their classic book measuring business cycles from 1946 we often think of as the the bible of business cycle dating and indeed what burns and mitchell talk about is how one would set the peaks and troughs in a particular series they talk a lot about how you would perhaps date overall in the economy was their recession and when it started and stopped interestingly they actually set no business cycle dates the dates that you see in measuring business cycles all go back to mitchell and some work that was done in the 1930s just to get you thinking about the burns and mitchell approach so they had various ways that they thought of identifying cycles uh they want you to work with data that's been seasonally adjusted but not detrended for setting reference date to that overall you know what's going on in the economy they're very happy to use aggregates they say if we had really good gdp data which was just starting to to come into existence they'd be very happy to use that for setting their their reference dates importantly and this is going to come up a lot in our discussion what they would we're thinking of their concept of a recession was a literal decline in economic activity uh rather than just a slowing of growth and then finally how do you date the peaks and troughs well mainly you just look at them and see when the peaks and troughs were but there are some conventions like if there's a flat bit you debate uh before a decline you date the peak at the very end of that right so that's sort of the burns of mitchell approach in terms of where we went from that actually the early post-war period is really researchers at the mbr following the the burns and mitchell guidelines and a lot of the early postwar dating is figuring out what's the right series to look at and this is when the nbr was putting out just volume after volume of what's a coincident indicator and a lagging indicator and a leading indicator and what they were really saying is what were the series that we should look at and what's really interesting is that the evolution of what series the early the the people were using to date cycles it moved from you know in the burns and mitchell era and through the early postwar period they'd often look at financial variables or prices and by about the late 1960s when inflation was becoming a a very persistent phenomenon uh they said maybe we should only look at at real series and then finally sort of as jim alluded to there's a last stage in this which is marty feldstein in 1978 set up the mbr business cycle dating committee which is a group of nvr researchers for a long time we had some of the old mbr researchers like victor zarnowitz or jeffrey moore the committee has been chaired by bob hall since 1978 and today the main series that it looks at and you can find this is no inside information it's personal in real personal income real wholesale and retail trade employment industrial production uh and real gdp all right so that's just uh uh believe me that's the the abbreviated version of the of the history of the mbr dates but that gives you a sense of sort of how they've been set all right so what do we think the contributions of these have been and i want to say there are two things that we think are particularly important one is just the the sense of focusing research attention on short run fluctuations i think to us today it just seems natural to be thinking about when are there recessions what happens in recessions what causes recessions and indeed exactly why i think mitchell was so obsessed with dating business cycles and talking about them was that he felt they weren't given uh adequate do and so his view was that he wanted to make everyone realize that these periodic severe uh downturns in economic activity were not just a side light but a fundamental uh area of research and indeed through the history of the early mbr exactly what people were doing is looking at how did productivity and manufacturing and employment and even you know things like labor unionization how did that all vary uh with the cycle the second contribution and what we ended up thinking was actually much more fundamental was the concept of a recession right a a period when output red that had been growing normally falls uh rapidly now of course people had understood that there was this thing called recessions there are downturns before mitchell or burns and mitchell but i think the the process of identifying them systematically defining them and analyzing really drove home that there was something very special about these periods of widespread rapid decline in i activity one way that we found very useful for thinking about just how fundamental a concept this was took us back to an old paper by jim hamilton so this is hamilton's uh 1989 paper using a markov switching model right and what hamilton's basic idea is take some series he happens to use the growth rate of real gdp and hypothesize that there are two regimes one where real gdp is growing uh where the only difference is in their their mean growth rate and then assume that the switches between uh the regimes follow a markov process and then make no other assumptions and just estimate that find out the parameters and importantly find out the probability that the computer thinks that uh in each quarter whether the economy was in the low growth regime i and we've ended up redoing uh hamilton's analysis and it's really important to realize that you know it didn't have to work right so the the the hamilton kind of markov switching framework could just have found mush basically you could have found that half the time you were in a regime with slightly higher growth and half the time you were in a regime with slightly grow lower growth but when you run it what really comes out is things that look very much like normal times and recessions right so there are two regimes the low growth regime is not just low it's negative and the high growth regime uh has quite substantial of positive economic growth another thing you find is that the transition probabilities between the two states only about 14 percent of the time is the economy in that low growth regime and and when you enter a low growth regime the economy tended to stay there for about uh three quarters all right so here's just a picture of the results so to understand this the gray bars those are the nbr i did it in the way every data program does it of showing the mbr recessions in gray but these are the quarters when the mbr chronology says we're in a recession and that blue line is the estimated probability from the markov switching model that you are in the low growth state what you're supposed to notice is the two things really are remarkably close and you can get even closer if you put in some other variables so rather than just using gdp growth at unemployment growth the unemployment rate and you'll do remarkably remarkably well now the way we want to interpret this is not that hamilton just found a clever way to replicate what mbr researchers were doing rather to flip it around and to say those early mbr researchers were really onto something important that what the data about the us economy over a long period of time shows is we have normal growth and then periods when things are uh highly abnormal right and so i think they were really on to something uh fundamental and important and as i said you can use more variables and and match it uh even more closely now in terms of you know so the contributions they focus research they really created if you want in some sense the study of the macro economy from a business cycle perspective or the short run fluctuations this crucial idea of a recession and then if you want to know even today these ideas are still there and still fundamentally important and if you want just a sign of this you know we just went through the aer for 2019. if you take all the papers that have a macro jl code roughly half of them either mention a recession are about recessions actually use the nber recessions as a as a way of conceptualizing things or talking about uh particular episodes and then if you go into the public sphere uh you're not surprised that the new york times and the wall street journal talk about recessions all the time all right so that's some sense the the the why they've been important over time now having said that they're important were a fundamental contribution doesn't mean that they're perfect and so part of what came out of us thinking about this and and being asked to write this paper is to think about maybe we should uh be thinking about changing things and in particular um when burns and mitchell or the early researchers at the bureau were setting the business cycle dates one of the things that they did and this is summarized beautifully by the the brilliant review of measuring business cycles uh by koopmans that they were measurement without theory right and if you want to know mitchell's idea was he thought if he measured this thing it would suggest what's the right theory and i think in some sense that's what's happened over time our modern models of macro fluctuations very much kind of divide the world into normal times and abnormal times or cyclical uh downturns right now and and anyway so that that yes right that's actually turns out to to be um most of our theories right but the mbr approach that just looks at declines in output i really in some sense may miss that in particular if you've got something like a natural disaster that causes output normal output to go down or slower population growth that also affects uh normal output in the standard mbr strategy you may well end up identifying that uh as a recession now at some level over the last hundred years whether you're focusing on literal declines in activity or some measure of slack or the output gap really hasn't mattered very much precisely because growth has been strongly positive for most of the last 100 years and pretty stable but one of the things that we know is that a lot of countries japan a lot of the countries of europe are seeing very low growth which makes literal declines in economic activity much more likely things like climate change and and population decline could mean that changes in normal growth could be more important in the future so all of this kind of leads us to think that maybe we need to tweak the the traditional mbr definition to focus more explicitly on slap right and so uh that's one of the things that that we think we should we should do uh and the and then this idea of revising the dates we have some thoughts i i mentioned we think that the nbr early mbr researchers would be very uh sympathetic to this we do want to say that as i described it those dates before 1929 are really very different from the more modern dates and so our suggestion would be either those need to be completely redone or they should be at a separate page on the mbr website but then for the rest of the mbr dates we think there'd be a real gain to rethinking them ideally in our mind focusing more on the output gap and also being more open to using quantitative metrics like the the markov switching kind of framework now it will never replace judgment but i think we can be perhaps slightly less judgmental all right we take at least a stab at that so we're going to take that hamilton markov switching model and try estimating it using uh measures of slack both the change in the deviation of output from from potential and the deviation of the unemployment rate from the natural rate uh both those series are going to come from cbo and here's what comes out of it so again the gray bars of the conventional mbr recessions what you're going to notice is that for the period that we've had in the past moving to a measure of slack doesn't fundamentally change the chronology there are no recessions that disappear no new ones that were added it does change dates so for example i just had i'll just highlight one of them currently the mbr dates the peak of the great recession at the end of 2007 the markov switching model much prefers uh sometime uh in the middle of 2008 and we think some other measures certainly would argue to pushing it somewhat forward so thinking about revising along the slacks wouldn't be a fundamental change but would certainly move uh some dates around we even do a little bit of thinking about the interwar period we definitely want we'd love to keep the great depression in the sort of modern nbr chronology we ran a markov switching model david told me oh for heaven's heads no model could possibly fit the great depression in world war ii like the bureau comes out smelling like a rose those those dates really uh jump out at you uh but i'm gonna in the uh because of time let me just just skip that um let me just tell you where where i think we would end up i when when we started um this project i will confess to being a little skeptical i think i would have put myself in the camp of thinking that the mbr business cycle dates were interesting from a history of economic thought perspective but maybe not particularly important today but writing this paper has actually made me much more positive i think that modern empirical macro research focuses almost entirely on on time series analysis but i think those early nbr researchers were really on to something uh the idea that recessions were very special events but i think with this more positive view comes the desire to make the dates even better and especially more appropriate for a modern economy so i think moving the definition uh to of a recession to be more based on slack or the output gap and just more generally revising and rethinking the dates would make them more useful for the mbr's next 100 years thanks [Applause]
