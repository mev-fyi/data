good afternoon everyone i am so pleased to kick off the 24th annual meeting of the rdrc nicole mastis and the staff at the national bureau for economic research have organized a great agenda i also want to thank the other center directors michael collins at the university of wisconsin-madison john leitner at the university of michigan and mannell at the center for retirement research at boston college we appreciate your help in making the rdrc successful we value this partnership and look forward to more high quality research communication and training today i'll highlight some recent rdrc research and i'll discuss the important role i expect the rdrc to play on advancing equity but first let me explain the challenges that ssa is facing in my vision for the agency when i became acting commissioner i shared my goals and objectives first everyone who is eligible for benefits should receive them which involves identifying and resolving any root causes of inequity in accessing our programs and second all ssa employees must be treated fairly and equitably this means supporting employees in their chosen career paths and recognizing that their success is critical to the success of the agency including improving our customer service when i addressed the rdrc last year it had been less than a month after president biden asked me to serve as acting commissioner after initially being appointed as the deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy over the past year i have learned a great deal more about the agency's challenges and opportunities one critical challenge has been the multi-year underfunding of the ssa budget for administrative expenses needed to run the agency ssa needs adequate and sustained funding to carry out the essential work we do for the public in his budget for fiscal year 2023 president biden requested 14.8 billion dollars for ssa the house and senate appropriations bills are coming in lower at 14.4 and 14.2 billion respectively so far i've been meeting with members of congress to state the need for fully funding the president's budget request consistent with previous years we expect to operate under a continuing resolution after september 30th as we await our final fy23 budget our funding level has been relatively flat since 2018 and even though we received um 411 million dollars in an increase last year our fixed cost increased by 550 million dollars due to a rise in items such as employee health benefits and contributions to retirement our current budget is about 850 million dollars less than the president's budget request for fy 2022 and substantially less than what both the house and the senate initially proposed consequently i've had to make some tough choices over the past year after providing hiring authority in the last quarter of fy 2021 for much needed staff we had to resume temporary hiring freezes in fy 2022 even for frontline services we've had to freeze hiring even though we are the lowest level of staffing in 25 years to to prior years of underfunding we also um had to delay work on modernizing our legacy i.t systems including cutting 100 million dollars from our plans for new technologies through the commitment of our staff as well as input from a number of stakeholders and advocates we have had a successful re-entry over the past four months we reopened our 1230 field offices across the country to in-person service and this has gone smoothly overall offices that have had um long lines even before the office uh officially opens at nine o'clock have used creative solutions to fit more people in their lobbies while maintaining social distancing given that some of our customers have fragile health and disabilities um they have also created solutions to serve people expeditiously and to provide cover from the sun and the rain for people who are waiting outside as a result these offices have just about eliminated lines outside after opening their doors in the morning i visited several of these offices and seeing the creativity and commitment to provide high quality service to our customers however we estimate that our re-entry costs are about 190 million dollars and this was not covered by the fy 2022 budget the lack of resources has taken a significant toll our staff are overworked and exhausted from carrying unreasonable workloads due to our staffing shortage as a result morale is lower than what it should be and this is showing up in our fed scores and in unprecedented unprecedented levels of attrition our front lines are experiencing an 11 um attrition rate for fy 2022 compared to about 6.5 on average over the past years instead of hiring freezes we need to hire staff throughout the year because it takes 18 months to two years to train new hires for our complex jobs another challenge is that the pandemic has resulted in a backlog in disability cases that are at record high levels and we do not have sufficient staff to eliminate them ssa has done an exceptional job of completing more with less but we cannot continue in this way and still provide the best possible service to over 70 million beneficiaries and customers each month if ssa received president biden's full request of 14.8 billion for fy 2023 we could expedite our i.t modernization work and increase our online services for the many beneficiaries and customers who prefer these methods most importantly it would allow us to provide the staffing and overtime needed to ensure our services are timing whether delivered in person or digitally in the meantime we have continued to pursue new ways to improve our customer service especially for people facing barriers our work in this area responds to president biden's executive order on advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government we all are also very engaged in other executive orders that address disparities in policies programs and institutional practices that will result in inequities in social and economic security and mobility if you have not yet done so i encourage you to review ssa's equity action plan which is available on our website our equity action plan along with our people-facing barriers initiative seek to remove barriers that limit access to our programs and services especially for the aged children people with mental illness people experiencing housing instability individuals with low income and those with limited english proficiency our work on the equity action plan intersects with rdrc's role in support of ssa's research priorities ssa is initiating a systems approach to research our goal is to move away from a deficit model approach that looks primarily for limitations in individuals families and communities as the factors contributing to disparities in economic and social well-being by contrast a systems approach examines the effects of structural barriers on economic and social well-being as mentioned these barriers include policies programs and institutional back practices that facilitate the security and mobility of some groups while impeding that of others this fall we will be launching a series of forums for ssa researchers rdrc researchers and other partners to provide more information on why it is critical to examine structural barriers and how this has been done by a wide range of scholars research plays an important role in our efforts to identify and address the historical and systemic nature of various people are facing we can develop and test solutions to dismantle these barriers and work towards economic health and social equity for people of color people with disability and other people who are facing barriers each year ssa develops a list of priority research areas that are meant to guide the rdrc's work this list pulls together recommendations from internal stakeholders at ssa as well as from retirement and disability policy at um other federal agencies in congress in academia and elsewhere for fy 2023 which begins october 1st we have seven priority research areas that are posted on our website one key priority area is disparities by race and ethnicity in line with the president's executive order and with the agency's equity action plan we will expand our understanding of racial and ethnic disparities so that we can make informed equitable policy decisions this work includes improving ssa's collection of race and ethnicity data which expands our ability to conduct distributional analyses to evaluate how applicants and beneficiaries are faring under current policies or under potential changes most importantly improved data will help us determine whether different groups are underrepresented in our programs provide insight into which programs are particularly important to different communities and examine whether there are differences in benefit levels based on race and ethnicity we recently completed one of our equity action plan goals which is to examine and publish 12 tables in the annual statistical supplement the new tables available on ssa's website provide data by race and ethnicity for beneficiaries for whom we have more complete data on august 25th we are hosting a public meeting on racial equity research statistics and data resources and at this webinar ssa's office of research evaluation and statistics will walk through the newly published race and ethnicity tables this year more than 20 rdrc projects focus on disparities by race and ethnicity these projects are addressing various topics including how racial disparities and lifetime earnings affect social security benefits the implications of widening racial mortality gaps resulting from the covid19 pandemic on racial wealth gaps and how the scarring effect of unemployment varies by race as i mentioned ssa is organizing a new structural barriers research forum to strengthen our research on disparities by race and ethnicity and um this first virtual forum is scheduled for september 12th these forums will address what to consider in designing the research and how to include the proper context in writing about and presenting research for example one approach to consider is community engaged research this involves actively engaging members of the community of concern in some or all of the phases of designing the study collecting the data and interpreting and disseminating the findings this method provides more opportunities to gain wisdom from the people who know their communities the best this method can also improve rigor and relevance of research of the research in addition if we are effectively um if we are to effectively address structural barriers that contribute to inequitable outcomes by race and ethnicity it is essential to gain the perspective insight and expertise from scholars of color this has been largely lacking in our body of research in the past and we are all the poor for it we have encouraged our drc centers to increase their efforts to collaborate with historically black colleges and universities minority serving institutions um by um and by ensuring that proposals from these institutions and scholars reach us and over the past year [Music] ssa has enthusiastically supported rdrc researchers from hbcus and msis such as bowie state university morgan state university the university of maryland eastern shore florida agricultural and medical university and spelman college in addition rdrc centers have worked proactively with msis to encourage young scholars of color to seek out research training opportunities for instance the junior scholars intensive training program um runs which is run jointly by howard university and the university of wisconsin center has developed scholars who have gone on to produce high quality rdrc funded research research projects of their own this is commendable but i must note that while the rdrc annual meeting is open to the public and has attracted several hundred participants from a wide range of organizations the number of participants from hbcus and msis remains disproportionately low so let's continue to expand both rdrc projects that investigate structural barriers by race and ethnicity as well as representation of hbcus and msis among the rdrc network of researchers and practitioners that said i do want to lift up some of rdrc's um achievements the consortium has significantly expanded the knowledge base um on social security social security retirement and disability issues we currently support more than 60 research projects i'll quickly highlight a few studies informing major priorities of the agency as ssa looks to improve and expand our dis our digital service a mixed method study to understand the use of my social security accounts is very important this study highlights the favorable perception of my social security among users as well as barriers to registration and use of the platform's features including low levels of internet and computer literacy another study tested an experiential learning program designed to reduce vulnerability to social security scams by teaching individuals how to identify these scams through a randomized control trial the authors found that the learning program they developed significantly increased an individual's ability to distinguish social security scams from legitimate agency communication an ongoing study using data from the health and retirement study um documents how experi experiences of the covid 19 pandemic have varied by race and ethnicity by considering a number of structural factors such as health care access public health responses and language barriers the study aims to understand the negative financial and health care outcomes among populations facing barriers specifically among people of color with disabilities the analysis will explore opportunities for targeting supports to underserved communities most impacted by the kobut 19 pandemic we look forward to receiving results from other rdrc projects later this year please also stay tuned in the coming months for more information about actions we're taking to advance equity programs um equity across our programs finally i'm excited to welcome dr marcela alson as the of the year's keynote speaker dr alassan will will be speaking tomorrow on the topic of health equity dr alston's research provides critical insights for ssa as we aim to ensure equity in all of our programs in closing many thanks to the staff of the four rdrc centers and the program team at ssa consisting of matt matt messel nancy earley brad trencamp and john murphy which keeps the rdrc running on a day-to-day basis and with that i'll turn the meeting back to nicole mastis
