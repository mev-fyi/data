the tax bill that we've enacted is a very complicated piece of legislation with very large cross-cutting gross flows in terms of the effects on revenue and potentially the effects on on prices that consumers and firms are going to face right a lot of relative prices get get touched by this bill the the most important direction of Reform is on the corporate side and of course the the headline component there is the decline in the corporate rate from 35 to 21 percent that of course features immediately in you know you all take your whole Jorgensen cost to Capital formula and begin to change Tau and that of course is is one of the natural mechanisms by which this bill is likely to have important consequences but there are other significant pieces even on the business side right on the there's this element around pass-through businesses uh these are are sort of you know Partnerships and other businesses which are not set up as C corporations for those businesses there's a 20 deduction for business income which means they are top rate potentially Falls by 20 by 0.2 of what 0.2 times what it would have been previously not all the way to the 21 typically for the the business C Corp rate but it's it's a reduction uh there are changes in expensing uh there's bonus depreciation which is enacted it goes from 50 to 100 percent of capital uh for a five-year period uh so that's an you know expansion basically on the investment allowances front but then as with many Provisions in this bill that begins to phase out so 2023 is the last year when that provision is fully in effect and at 20 percent a year over five years the bonus depreciation is is revoked essentially so that by 2028 we're in a very different regime and I think the speakers will probably address some of the the Dynamics associated with these uh with these temporary Provisions uh there's also a limit on interest deductions for corporations uh 30 of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization uh for the next few years and then it becomes more stringent and becomes 30 percent of of ebit uh in the out years so that's another important provision and again if you go back to your cost of capital formula something which changes the deductibility of Interest has a consequence for uh for the cost of funds and then what the cost of capital is going to look look like uh there are provisions and and these are even more complicated than the ones I've just described that change the international tax avoidance incentives for corporations put in place a global minimum tax and those are Provisions which potentially could have quite significant impact on the way firms allocate their income and maybe even their activities across across the globe on the individual side the changes are frankly more modest in terms of at least the ability to describe them there's reductions in in top rate in the top rate from 39 6 to 37 there's some scaling back of marginal rates throughout the the distribution and then there's a a number of limitations on various kinds of deductions uh and that those come in two forms one is actually limits like the elimination of the state and local tax deduction which has been a lightning rod uh for discussion and that of course raises the cost of living in a high tax uh State like New York or California or Massachusetts it also changes the cost of of Revenue raising for the the states in those places uh there are also substantial increases in the standard deduction and that in some sense for a different Channel it takes a lot of people who are previously itemizers off the roles of itemizers and it changes the marginal prices for a lot of things that they do like mortgage interest deduction or charitable giving even things that remain deductible going forward and then there are some large transfers that are more or less uh you know they're they're not marginal changes like the child tax credit uh where there's a very big expansion of the child tax credit for individuals that transfers a lot of resources to households with children but it doesn't have at least a lot of you know traditional marginal effects there may be some fertility effects down the road uh but uh but but those are those are things certainly will take a while to to develop so um the the the key is that there's lots going on in this bill uh there are long run effects there are short-term macro effects and I'm hoping that our three panelists today will try to give us a sense of what we have learned so far and what they expect to see as the macro effect of this bill play out so Ken we're going to start with you uh thanks a lot and I was asked to just focus on on a couple facts that we can you know bring eventually bring to to data and then one of the takeaways will be that does as Jim just pointed out there's a lot going on as Bill some pros some cons in terms of economic growth so I'll try to show you that if um uh those effects in particular some Pro growth stuff or reductions in effective tax rates but at the same time those are those are temporary so whenever we do uh macro analysis so this is a very high level sketch of the Penn Wharton budget model and um our macro analysis really because we ultimately are going to feed this into a non-recordian overlap and generations model it really starts with the micro getting the micro foundations if you want to have a good macro analysis that is actually very consistent with the bill itself the the actual structure not something that's stylized you kind of have to get the micro side right and so we start with a micro simulation that does all sorts of uh uh uh different different kind of rules of education and so forth and some of these uh rules are estimated simply a basic markov's a transition matrices from the data and uh but some of them like big decisions like marriage divorce and so forth we actually have a structural estimation from a dynamic program problem of people getting married they have kids and so forth as part of a dynamic primary problem and then we go back in date and time and try to estimate how how well does the model fit and so this shows the historic fit and then we project forward so this is like education I'll just show you a couple of these things disability both historic uh in terms of attesting the functional forms family composition that again the historic and then the right hand side then goes out into the future race composition lots of other things that are in the model and so then that feeds into a tax model and the tax model is uh a model it's fully integrated in the payroll tax individual corporate international and we do uh there's a lot of modules associated with this are based on the elasticities from the literature things like how much income shifting is going to happen this is a bill because of the sunset Provisions due to the bird rule there's going to be a lot of Shifting incentives of income between years there's also lots of reclassification that will happen lots of incentive for people to reclassify their income in theory we should all not be W-2 workers of our in our universities anymore we should become independent contractors of our universities and then on top of that figure out how to split that company into a software provided company and a service company and things like that and so there's lots of those and then how you really realize your gains and then the international shifts as well and so this part then produces tax functions that then feed into our Dynamic model so our Dynamic model but before getting there let's understand what the current law is actually doing and that is the first line is showing effective tax rates across all Industries if you're interested I have appendix to this DAC that shows that broken down by industry in fact the tax rates are we're starting to realize that are not always the best way to kind of look at things it's sometimes better to be more explicit but if we were to boil down with the current law under current law the effective tax rates across all C Corps it's about 21 why is it less than 35 percent the statutory rate because if there's already uh depreciation uh uh faster than economic depreciation the current law there's some interest deductibility and so forth and that and you can see what the current law by current law we mean before the tax act um how that was going to change over time notice what the tax act does it reduces the uh the effective tax rate from 21 to nine percent but notice over the for the next 10 years the effective tax rate returns most of the way to current law what's happened there is that one way that you the the biggest way that you get a reduction in effective tax rates is not just through reducing rates uh it's actually through uh moving to full expensing for a temporary about the period in fact if once you move to high expense and the rate really doesn't matter uh very much unless you have a monopolistic rents and things like that and so what happens is that in this tax law they had to make expensing cheap it's normally two trillion dollars over 10 years they got it down to less than 100 billion dollars and how you do it is you just make it really cheap by only having it for the first five years and then you turn it off the problem is under current law lots of that was Oregon to be be depreciated over the 10-year window so all you're really doing is Shifting that depreciation allowances from most of the capital would have been depression over 10 years not all of it but a lot of it would have you're just shifting that to today and then because in Washington they don't do present value they just add up cash flow lows on the 10-year cost is actually pretty small and so you're essentially just borrowing against a later in the budget window and so it's not a big impact and over time again the effective tax rate still is going to be lower than their current law and so we our static estimates that we feed into the um Dynamic model and this is kind of important is that we actually are more expensive than what the officials could score that came out of the joint uh the JCT The Joint Committee on taxation about 500 billion dollars more than what they estimated in terms of the conventional nine Dynamics uh uh revenue losses and that is a lot of because of our modeling of reclassification and shifting and so forth we just had essentially a different view on that CBO just released this week their estimates and they're about 400 billion and change above above JCT so we're very much more in agreement with cbo's uh uh View and because the model that we're going to feed this into is now recording this actually matters a lot in terms of the debt feedback effects so we feed this into a dynamic OLG model we'll go into a lot of detail because you've seen these models before but it has a representative firm there's no aggregate risk because of the curse of dimensionality associated with aggregate risk for sake of argument convex adjustment costs are turned off then the reason we made a fair amount of pro-growth assumptions that households are heterogeneous they face either Socratic wages and mortality risk the taxes are paid at the household level but with a single speeding C Corp and pass-throughs the model itself captures the income distribution pretty well becomes a big issue for the top uh tail the wealth distribution okay it could always be better and it has Keynesian effects and Dodge was laid through the fact that you're borrowed you know there's a borrowing constraint in these models that's quite naturally because of the natural borrowing limit allow poorer households cannot actually uh borrow against the future so Security benefits and so forth uh the Keynesian effects really didn't matter or that much in this case and we actually turned off labor frictions like Market search and so forth and so uh some of the big assumptions here is that is what's called a closer role there's always a secret you know big assumptions in these models one of them is the closer rule um that is exploding are there even current law even before this tax change and so it transfers Outlet condition that doesn't exist in DC so the question is what do you do and so we assume and you're 20 40 whatever that output ratio is at that point we're going to stabilize it by cutting wasteful government spending that doesn't that and if there's anybody's utility function very much pro-growth optimistic there because nobody values it it's not we're not increasing taxes and um also 40 percent of all new debts paid by foreigners um why is that why do we make these programs and some sense if you remember the debate this the whole debate was this whole thing was going to pay for itself and so uh what we find is our growth rate rates on the annual basis that are not that big in particular you can look at things like GDP labor services and so forth but for the most part not huge growth effects and there is one of the key assumptions because there's no aggregate risk in this model prices are perfectly forecastable how do you pick the interest rate in this model is it the risk-free rate because there's no risk in the uh prices in the model or to the marginal product of the capital there's we can talk about that to the side but that's an ongoing kind of debate of how you match a model has lower dimensionality with with actual data that's much higher Dimension the true model has aggregate risk but there's some differences there but still not so big lots of the jump is in GDP is in fact in this short run foreign Capital flows come in and so forth um you say well this seems pretty unrealistic again Pro growth even pro-growth model shows not huge growth effects and why do uh so much foreign Capital come in because we turned off lots of the adjustment costs and so forth forth and so even with a big flow of foreign Capital we can show other slides you're still not going to get massive increase this thing is going to be very far from paying from itself and there's other background stuff going on I mean the discussions about you know trade war and so forth the irony about this is that trade Wars go in the exact opposite direction of tax reform the whole selling point of tax reform this thing would pay for itself because all this foreign Capital come in a trade war of course shuts down uh foreign capital and so let's look at hypothetically that suppose it was an all-out trade War even without the tax reform act at all um the current Baseline is exploding debt and so in our Dynamic model foreign Capital flows are really important because that helps mitigate some of the crowding out the facts that debt has on on private Capital formation if you start having a big trade War then lots of that foreign an all-out trade War it would more than wipe out all the gains in the for the next 10 years from tax reform and it'll actually more by almost four times to wipe out all the gains in the long run um as well from uh the tax cuts and so even on a dynamic basis are are are our losses are between 1.7 and 2 trillion dollars not so far different than cbo's so another way of saying if you cared about this debate at all we don't believe that the law was consistent with What's called the bird Rule and in particular it's going to cost a lot more than the official estimates uh he had suggested and if anything I actually think uh we're probably um even optimistic we're the pessimistic guys out there if anything we're probably optimistic in terms of the revenue losses and the dead effects because there's other things even though we we modeled all this reclassification and shifting internationally and so forth after the Tax Act was passed we talked to more tax lawyers they told us all all the ways they're going to game this thing on top of the things that we we thought about and even you can see this right now the state and local tax deduction is kept at ten thousand dollars states are going to figure out how do we will around that whether it's a charitable contribution we'll see how that satisfies a court tests but simply shifting over time the taxes paid from households to the employer um if you do that slowly over time you can you can get away with that that's not going to be under the ten thousand dollar cap anymore so there's all these ways that if anything we're probably even though we're supposed to pessimistic guys if anything we're probably optimistic um and so by the way if you extend the tax cuts and jobs act on the individual side we just released these yesterday lots of the provisions on the individual side sunset at the end of year 2025 it actually now produces a negative Dynamic score you get no positive Dynamic effects because on the individual side you're given so much of the gains are infra marginal like the child tax credit and things like that outside of indulgence fertility those are those those are mainly infra marginal but they have debt effects and so we actually get Negative Dynamic scores where the static score is now cheaper um than the dynamic score so the bottom line of all this is that I think you know depending on your view of trade Wars and things like that it's it's going to be hard to tease out exact economic effects of this for a while from from the tax act um and then that but on the other hand uh if we are in fact wrong that the revenue losses are even bigger than what we suggest and even the the economic effects are going to even be more muted than what I showed you here thank you for uh inviting me to Marnie and Jonathan and thanks Jim and I'm delighted to be up here with uh Ken and Mark whose work we've learned a lot from at CBO all right so um I am not going to talk very much or at all about what the tax act did uh Jim covered that very well instead I'm going to focus on how we estimated that the changes uh from the tax act would affect the economy so first we thought about how it would affect potential output um we actually as you can see from this figure this is plotting the percentage effect on the level of potential uh the effects were not constant over time it they Peak at almost one percent uh in about 2023 2024 but the average effect is 0.7 percent over the whole 11 years so our our projections go out to 2028 this time around those come from effects mostly on investment and labor Supply so effects on investment we put the the different channels into three different buckets effects on incentives economic activity and crowding out the effects on incentives those are the usual effects the user cost of capital uh we also thought about how changes from the tax act would change incentives to invest in the United States instead of investing abroad changes in economic activity have two things it's the change in demand for goods and services there's a big stimulus effect here putting money in the hands of households and and to some degree um well that's that's that's largely the effect here and so when those households show up and want additional goods and services from firms they in response increase their investment we also put into this bucket changes in the supply of labor so more workers show up and want jobs some fraction of them become employed and so firms in turn increase investment to outfit them with capital looking at it more I think we possibly could have put that in incentives but nonetheless we called it economic activity and then crowding out this is increases in federal borrowing that reduces resources available for private investment so so roughly thinking roughly speaking what you should think of when you look at something like these effects on potential output that I showed what we have in mind here is basically a Cobb Douglas production function we're thinking about how investment changes how labor Supply changes and we're going to put those together um we thought so so here I'm plotting how uh incentives economic activity and crowding out have all mattered in isolation and you can see that the biggest positive effects come from changes in incentives those Wane over time as Jim talked about their various Provisions that are that are sunsetting in the bill uh changes in economic activity are also positive throughout crowding out as negative throughout but for the same reason that a bunch of those Provisions are sun setting the negative effects of crowding out are getting smaller over time and then if you look at like where we are for the changes of incentives out in 2027 2028 what's really showing through there is just the change in the user cost of capital from the lower statutory rates on Capital Income that's really the the most important thing that's left at the end of the day we had to think hard about how all of these different Provisions would affect investment in different kinds of capital so we here I'm showing equipment non-residential structures and intellectual property products each tick going up and down um has all sorts of interesting things behind it I won't have time to get in to get into much of it but for example notice that we actually estimate that the tax act has negative effects on incentives to invest in intellectual property after 2021. and the effects on investment in residential structures are negative throughout okay so the effects on the potential labor Supply um this is through largely the effects in uh the reductions in the in the marginal tax rates on labor income we have a boost an estimated boost to the potential labor force participation rate as well as average hours work to get a total effect on potential hours of 0.6 percent we had to think about how these intensive and extensive margins would be affected differently although in our part are parsing you know there's a lot of uncertainty around that but of course it doesn't matter so much how we separated it out for the total effects on potential labor Supply we also estimated a small effect on measured tfp mostly from some of the complicated profit shifting effects it's small I really only mention it here because it was really hard okay so uh we also so as I mentioned we put a lot of money in the hands of households um and to some degree some of the increases in investment don't flow one for one through increase to increases in potential right away so we estimate that real GDP is boosted more than potential in the early years in the later years that actually that that relationship's a bit reversed this is because uh the increase in marginal tax rates on labor income that are under current law in 2026 we estimate that that change in law will come as a surprise to most households and in fact will come as a surprise to monetary policy makers and so you'll get a small decrease in aggregate demand and a small negative output negative effect on the output Gap in those years so if you can imagine what the difference between these two lines looks like in terms of its effect on the output Gap we put it here on top of all of the other things that we think we're creating an output Gap over the projection and I partly do this to show you that particularly in 2019 and in 2020 for a lot of other reasons in part because of the spending legislation that was recently passed we estimate that there will be a pretty sizable positive output Gap over the near term and what we think the tax act is doing is increasing the the positiveness of that output Gap in those years all right so now you have you have an increase in aggregate demand that's having some short-term uh stimulus effects on the labor market we think that that's going to lower the unemployment rate by 0.1 percentage Point increase the participation rate increase the number of hours worked so those effects are mainly uh focused on 2018 to 2022 but if I take those together and I add them to the effects on potential labor Supply that come into play through the entire 11-year period if I put those together we estimate that that the tax act boosts non-farm payroll employment by an average of 1.1 million workers on average over the 11-year period the increase in aggregate demand that that that bigger output Gap we think will create some inflationary pressures they're they're not terribly large and so in fact here we've in fact plotted the the effect on the price level um it's it's they're not terribly large first because we estimate that the Phillips curve is pretty flat but also because there are some effects from the tax act that we think are going to dampen import prices but nonetheless with uh greater inflationary pressures and a tighter labor market we think that uh short-term interest rates will respond monetary policy makers will try to lean against this this this greater aggregate demand that will have a sizable effect on particularly the three-month treasury bill the 10-year treasury note rate is its response is a little more muted because it's more forward-looking these are these interest rates are also higher because of the crowding out effects so as the federal borrowing increases and that and that um competes for funds that's going to boost interest rates particularly long-term rates are also getting buffeted around from some other complicated factors for example The Tax Act is going to do what's called deemed repatriation um there's a there was a whole bunch of money being kept in foreign bank accounts that will now be deemed repatriated and we estimate that a big chunk of that what firms will do is they will sell treasuries that were that they were holding with that money and at the same time they will reduce their corporate borrowing that will shrink the spread between risk-free rates and risky rates and so it's going to boost the 10-year treasury note rate a little bit we also think that um long-term treasuries will become slightly less valuable as a hedge against unexpectedly low inflation so that also boosts long-term treasury rates a little bit okay so as you can imagine it's really important to us to think about what the feedback on the budget is to do that we really need to think about what happens to taxable income taxable income moves uh not not too differently from the way we think GDP is affected real GDP actually coincidentally like potential we estimate is up 0.7 percent on average over the 11 years real GNP is up uh less by 0.4 percent so the gap between those two is because of what we estimate is happening to net International income so net International income is estimated to be dampened by the tax act this this won't surprise you but but just to walk through it really fast we have a big increase in borrowing from abroad we also similarly have a big increase in foreign investment uh in the U.S and that alongside higher rates of return in the U.S lead to reductions in net International income so we have notably smaller effects on GNP than GDP all right so turning to the effects on the budget I'm going to focus on that middle bank which is the feedback effects from these macroeconomic effects I've just talked about on net we think that the macroeconomic effects reduce the cost of the tax act the effect the negative effects on the deficit by 461 billion dollars um there's some Direct effects mostly on Revenue that reduce the deficit by 571. debt service costs are higher they'd be lower if it were just because of the of the reduction in federal borrowing from these positive effects on the economy but interest rates are higher in that swamps okay so all in we estimate that the tax act increased our projection of the deficit through 2028 by about 1.9 trillion dollars all right uncertainty I'm betting I'm out of time but the sources of uncertainty in this analysis were immense and uh and I was also going to use this in the next slide to back in a little bit to a very quick discussion of how we approached this analysis so there are many parameters underlying all of this analysis on how we think that investment responds to incentives how we think labor Supply responds to incentives Etc all of those parameters have enormous uncertainty around them we had to think about what people expected for about with regards to changes in fiscal policy under current law this was explicitly an estimation of what we thought the tax act would do to the economy under current law so current law as it's written as it comes to pass that didn't mean that we had to assume that everybody expects current law so that meant that we had to Grapple with what do people expect and what how does that matter all of the all of the um analysis of how profit shifting will be affected by the tax act is subject to enormous uncertainty but has less of an effect on economic activity that was mostly about about measurement finally how it will be implemented by the treasury in the IRS subject to enormous uncertainty foreign countries response States Dynamic responses and then and then how all of these estimates and changes in economic activity how big the effects on activity will be over the next few years and then how investors respond to those also of course Very uncertain my view is that the tax legislation is a very expensive tax cut for a high income households and does very little to support economic growth in the long run so I think it's pretty consistent with Ken's results and and Wendy's results uh just give you a sense of the numbers this shows the impact uh using on GDP growth using uh our model of the global economy 64 countries um very similar in spirit to uh it's a structural model in my view I defined as a structural model very similar in spirit to the Federal Reserves model the Furbish model I think probably similar to what Wendy uses at CBO a very kind of a traditional structural model uh Keynesian in the short run uh more classical in the long run and here I've decomposed the GDP growth impacts from 2018 through 2027 into the this demand side effects and uh the supply side effects of potential growth the line is the sum of the two uh to kind of give you the sense of things so near term this year next year uh we get juice a lot of fiscal stimulus if you actually do the arithmetic uh the tax cuts this year are about 140 billion dollars uh next year an additional 140 billion that's roughly seven tenths of a percent of GDP you can see that the actual impact on GDP in our model is lower uh that goes out to the crowding out effects that uh that Wendy and Kent talked about uh the uh you know there's a lot of moving Parts here so the demand side effects quickly go from positive to negative uh and ultimately our big negative because this is under the assumption that everything in law happens that these tax cuts expire which is a big point point of contention if you talk to the proponents of the tax legislation they have a political economy argument that uh once we get out there and a decade from now and uh policy makers are tasked with trying to figure out what to do with expiring tax cuts they will extend them uh and that is part of the narrative around the support for the benefits of this you do see supply side benefits I do think potential growth is lifted we uh the model that uh that we're using that I have accounts for both the effects cost of capital effects on investment but I uh it also accounts for location effects so one of the other are arguments proponents of the tax legislation give is that this makes the U.S just look more attractive as a location compared to other parts of the world and I you know I think there's some validity to that I mean I I think it's true and that we picked that up in our direct investment equations that are in the model I don't think these are large effects I think they play out over long periods of time and a lot depends on what you assume about what the rest of the world is going to do in response I mean you I was in Dublin not too long after the tax law and of course you know they're all just trying to figure out ways to mitigate the effects by changing their tax law to offset all this so you know this is this is not a you know a static thing it's a lot of moving Parts but nonetheless I do think there's some benefits there um so short run juice uh not as much juice as you might think because of you know fiscal stimulus on top of a full employment economy you're just not going to get as much juice the fed's going to respond and offset some of this uh but in the long run um you know really no benefit significant benefit this is just to illustrate the long run effects this is uh the impact on a number of different uh economic variables in 2018 and then in the long run and you can see long-run growth is lifted by five basis points you know something like that in the long run which is I think pretty similar to other estimate sounds a little higher than Kent's uh estimate I think it's very similar to what Furman and Ken Barrow came up with uh in their analysis so it's you know very very consistent with that no employment effects in the long run I mean that's you know I don't see this having any impacts on labor Supply Long Run and so no real impacts on the labor market interest rates are higher because the higher debt load A good rule of thumb it works pretty well an increase in the debt to GDP ratio of one percentage Point translates into about three four basis points on the 10-year treasury yield that's very consistent with our experience with quantitative easing if you go take a look at the FED research on QE effects on interest rates very consistent with that and that's built into the model so that underlies the interest rate effects but you know in my view this is uh just a very costly tax cut to go nowhere um let me now walk through some of the reasons why I think the effects are small both near-term and long-term in the near term I think there's already pretty strong evidence that uh you know uh that there are crowding out effects this is the 10-year treasury yield uh daily data last data point was a week ago today last Friday you can see when the tax law was signed into law that was uh I believe December 22nd of last year and a pretty substantive increase in 10-year yields after that if you kind of decompose that increase about half the increases changes in expectations for uh the real funds rate target so the The View that the Federal Reserve is going to respond and raise rates more quickly normalized policy more quickly uh another uh so of the 40 basis points 20 is that 10 basis points is inflation expectations and 10 basis points is the term premium so some of these crying out effects are already getting embedded I'll have to say you know it's still early days and and you know a lot of script to be written here but I haven't observed any significant other than what's happening in uh the bond market and the other big effect in the bond market is Libor because we are seeing the one thing we are seeing in result of of uh of the tax law is repatriation you know Moody's for example big multinational we have a lot of cash overseas uh you know repatriating so that is affecting short-term funding markets you that's showing up in Libor so Library spreads have gapped out now that's temporary it's technical but it is somewhat disruptive I mean there's three and a half trillion in contracts outstanding based on Libor so that's having an impact or you know some some impact but other than that I I just don't see it I don't see it in at least not yet it's early again you don't see it in orders for durable goods you don't see it in consumer spending and retail sales so I'm you know know I'm expecting it there's a lot of moving Parts here hard to distinguish things but it's so far not much of an impact but I think again we'll have to say uh and I think the multipliers here are pretty small these are our estimates of the range of multipliers across different types of of fiscal policy discretionary fiscal policy around tax cuts and various types of government spending and you can see you know this this was really a tax cut for uh on the corporate side so the the multipliers are really very very small and for high income households so you know this also mitigates the the the short-term impact from from this uh really not much of uh if you're designing this to stimulate the economy this is near term this isn't what you would do that would be the 19 the 2009 Recovery Act that would be you know more consistent with what you do uh in terms of the other a key effect that the tax law will have that has economic implications macroeconomic implications uh is on uh on wealth on stock wealth and on housing wealth and there they work to offset each other on the tax on the on the Corp on the uh uh with regard to stocks uh you know uh just a simple arithmetic would suggest that it should lift stock prices and initially it did so if you go back you know through January into February we saw the S P 500 Rise by exactly the amount that would be anticipated by this simple calculation so we went from a 35 tax rate to a 21 that should add 12 13 to after tax earnings so if you apply the same price earnings multiple that's what we got at the peak of the of the equity Market back sometime in January February of course A lot has happened since then the rising rates are starting to catch up and also trade Wars and Trump and you know we're you know we're right back down the equity Market is no higher but I do think we did see some benefit from uh the tax law in uh corporate profits one other thing I will say about that though real life is uh because I'm on the board of mgic which is a the nation's largest mortgage insurer we just cut premiums on our Mi right and what we did is we just completely gave away all of the tax benefit uh so uh that's already happening and if you if you're in a competitive market uh this gets competed away pretty rapidly in the Mi business it's gone it's already gone uh just as an example but this benefit to the equity Market is offset by what it means for house prices and this is our guesstimate of the house price effects across County so you know we have this big Global model we take that down to States metropolitan areas counties and we do this uh globally so we do sub-national globally you know I can tell you what's going on in provinces in Canada and states in Mexico that kind of thing and I'm sure you're all looking at your home right now um just to clarify I'm not saying that house prices are going to decline this is the difference uh between house prices in a world with no tax legislation and one with and this is the peak impact uh and it accounts for there's lots of different channels here but I'll mention three quickly one higher interest rates right we have higher mortgage rates two there's economic effects because you've now made you know this part of the world less competitive vis-a-vis Texas and Florida and that has location decision effects in the regional models that we have just like we have in the global model and three just the simple accounting here the New York fed Arena had a really good blog yesterday that kind of went through the accounting and you know the idea is the value of the deductions for housing are now lower and it's very you know people say well how does that work the intuition is very simple I mean I I can attest to this personally so when I wanted when I wanted to go buy my first home I went to a realtor a realtor sat down calculated exactly how much house I could afford after tax say it was 250k then took me to see with my kids and wife a 350k home and uh you know there's no way you're gonna buy anything less than 250k after your kid you know picked out their bedroom in the 350k home so you know all of that tax benefit and I learned my lesson because when I wanted to buy a car I didn't take my kids yeah uh you know when you're when you start your own company and you're living on your credit card this is all very important uh so I ended up with a Honda Pilot for my first car not not uh not not the Volvo uh but it but uh that gets so it gets immediately capitalized in the price so you know you take it away and I'm not arguing I don't I don't think these tax deductions for housing or silliness I mean it doesn't lift home ownership at all it's just you know very expensive way to you know help high income households well the households but there is a cost from getting from here to there and this is the cost so anyone I guess which County uh suffers the most that's a good guess but wrong yeah yeah everyone says Westchester and you know you're probably pretty close to right I just do it to tease uh pardon me no no no no no fairfield's a good guess Essex County New Jersey Essex County New Jersey yeah it's all very close though um here's the other point the the wealth effects uh on stock in our model on stocks it's um uh it's uh it's actually uh uh a little bit lower uh than than on housing uh the housing wealth effects are a little bit larger uh but if you kind of do the arithmetic uh it all kind of washes out so there's very little net impact on wealth and therefore on on the wealth effects so short run you know uh it's kind of silly policy you know you're throwing raw fiscal stimulus on a full unemployment economy you know okay um you get three percent growth hit it get a headline for a year or two but that's all you're going to get you're going to get higher interest rates and by the way on the other side of that in 2020 there is a void uh and uh you know that's where the next inflection by the way I can tell you when the next recession is going to be uh if you want to know uh Bob hold yeah yeah uh-huh finally on the uh just during the long run then I'll stop uh I also think the effects on the long run are pretty small and I'm just going to talk about something that I'm not really picking up in the model but um I think it's important to recognize I don't think the cost of capital or the availability of credit and cash is a binding constraint on investment it really has not been uh there's lots of ways to calculate cost of capital this is my estimate that you know is in the model this is all before the tax legislation and you can see um you know uh it was already pretty low it's pretty easy to raise equity and low-cost debt and you know go out and do whatever you wanted to do and I don't think lowering it is going to make a bit of you know very much of a difference again that's you know in the model I don't make that distinction you know it's not that non-linear in the model so we get that effect but my intuition is that this is really not going to provide you know as much juice as the models say they're going to produce and then on a cash side there is no problem with cash uh and you know you can see that here this is this is from the federal uh these are from the financial account data the flow funds data cash is uh cash is everywhere and it you know you could argue it's very concentrated and it is but if you kind of look you know we do look at Moody's we look pretty much across a non-financial corporate sector there's a lot of cash that's not a binding constraint so I'm pretty skeptical you're going to get a you know real significant pick up here and it may happen over the longer run but I don't think in the near at least in the near future we're going to get a you know significant pickup investment so bottom line I think this is um I'll end where I started I think this is a pretty expensive tax cut for how high income households that doesn't really buy as much growth
