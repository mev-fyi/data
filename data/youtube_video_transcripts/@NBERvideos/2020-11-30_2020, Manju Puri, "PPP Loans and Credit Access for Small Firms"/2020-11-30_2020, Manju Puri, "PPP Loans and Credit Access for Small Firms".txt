i'm going to talk today about covet 19 small businesses and the paycheck protection program this year work is joined with tethyana balyok at emery and praballa at johns hopkins so kobet 19 has been a black swan event it's affected the economy enormously but it's had a particularly large impact on small businesses so small businesses often called defined as businesses with less than 500 employees as the census data account for 99 of all u.s businesses they were particularly hard hit so given their importance there was a big policy response in the form of a 669 billion paycheck protection program or ppp so ppp essentially gave loans up to 10 million for businesses with less than 500 employees and there was forgiveness so long as you used it for eligible purposes such as payroll and rent and for other things it was priced at one percent which is still very cheap so it would appear that ppp loans are a great deal for businesses but are they so we investigate ppp piped to 678 small public firms and we ask which kind of companies take ppp and what is the treatment effect and what we find is firms taking ppp see positive valuations increasing in the order of 1.6 billion which is large yet despite this large valuation increase we find many firms actually return the ppp funding without using it and when they do they see large valuation increases actually in the order of 1.8 billion which is again very large and so why do we see this we will actually speak to some of the reasons behind this and then we look at is the way that you get ppp the way it's funneled through banks or intermediaries does that affect the distribution in any way and what we find is that large firms get ppp earlier and this is particularly true if you're a large firm in a big bank and and so again we will speak more to that in terms of why do you see this sort of sort of distribution so ppp is clearly massive and it's important to understand in its own right but another reason to study ppp is in the broader context it gives us other lessons that we can learn we can think of ppp as a shock in financing supply simultaneously it's also a shock in learned demand so understanding it helps us understand how to deal with small businesses in times of crisis so we can collect data on 678 public firms who are borrowers of ppp and the research questions we ask is what is the uptake of ppp what is the stock market valuation and we find we have very positive stock market valuation and despite that there is a reluctance to take ppp more than 100 firms 100 high quality firms return ppp funding without actually using it and when they do we see again increases in the share price and then finally we ask how does the channel or the banks who deliver ppp funding shape the supply of financing and and and why and so for small businesses ppp is a shock in financing supply right and so when these businesses take ppp we see positive abnormal returns so we see big shareholder gains now these are partially anticipated because you have the announcement that there's going to be a ppp program and then later on individual firms announced that they're going to take it so once you correct the treatment effects for partial anticipation we find the gains for the sample are in the order of 1.6 billion which is clearly large now despite these large gains we find firms seem to be wary of taking ppp more than 100 firms return it and when they do the gains to this sample is in the order of 1.8 billion clearly very large and again these tend to be better quality firms that return ppp and so the natural question is why tpp is cheap it's either free money or it's founded at one percent why would you not take ppp and it would appear that firms particularly the stronger ones they actually think ppp is costly not because of direct costs but they are high indirect costs so what are these high indirect costs most likely it it it is the possibility that you'll be investigated x post right no you'll be audited and so public firms were often singled out that if you're public you have access to capital perhaps you shouldn't be taking ppp funding you should let others take it and so there could be fear of penalties there could be fear of reputational damage etc that made ppp recipients wary of should we keep the funds or or should we return them so to investigate this further we look at the following experiment there were pronouncements from the sba as well as the treasury that if you took ppp funding for less than two million then it was assumed that this was in good faith but so the probability of audit increased after the two million threshold so we can look at you know 2 million as sort of being a cutoff and look at loans just below that and just about that and when you do that you find the probability that the loans are returned if you're just above the threshold is about is 21 as opposed to 7 if you're just below the threshold right and so this is very consistent with firms worrying about this exposed investigation or regulatory scrutiny that that they might have to bear now if you think of the demand show right so for intermediaries or for banks delivering ppp it's it's a shock in demand and in fact banks were flooded with ppp applicants 525 billion were disbursed to more than 5.2 million firms and in fact the first round of ppp funding was exhausted a second round had to be approved and so we look at do certain kinds of firms get ppp early and the answer is yes large firms tend to get pp early so if you look at the distribution in round one and round two you can see in round two there are many more small firms going for ppp as opposed to round one now why is this the case to understand this we look at the way ppp is is given and that is through banks and we ask you know do we see differences by certain kinds of banks so in particular we look at the largest banks or the big ten banks and we look at the other smaller banks and we see a big difference within them so here the red line is early ppp borrowers the blue line is late ppp borrowers and you can see that large ones go early but this trend is more pronounced in the large banks as opposed to in the smaller banks and this is true not just perform asset size but also for ppp non-size again you see very similar results so again the question is why right and so you're seeing large films go early especially with big bangs so this is pointing to some frictions so so what could the possible frictions be so one might be the pppfeen sentence so in general you got larger fees for larger norms but that doesn't explain why you would see this differential between large banks and small banks right and so one reason you might see big banks prioritizing larger customers is you have capacity constraints you want to prioritize those customers that are most profitable for you and large firms have multiple needs they need more funding it's one way that's one-stop shopping multiple services and and so in in the face of capacity constraints big banks might choose to prioritize large customers now small banks on the other hand they tend to treat small borrowers well they're their bread and butter and they deal with them on it on a daily basis and so our findings suggest that pairing small borrowers with small bags uh you know might make sense now traditionally this is thought to be good because small banks are better at processing soft information at scrutinizing and doing the screening or monitoring for small firms what our results suggest is that over and beyond soft information there are other frictions that when capacity constraints mind that there are perhaps negative externalities of being a small firm with a large bank it's like being a small fish in a big pond you just don't get the same priority or importance so understanding these frictions of big bank lending to small firms is certainly worthy for the research now a sample again is of listed firms who actually file periodic disclosure requirements and so demand side explanations really seem less plausible this looks like supply-side frictions that are taking place so what do we find in summary we find when firms take ppp funding there are positive valuation gates yet despite that many firms actually return these ppp funds and when they do they again experience large gains right and this points to some concern of large indirect costs of government aid from whether it's from regulatory scrutiny or exposed sort of investigation we also find that the channel matters right that large firms tend to get ppp funding early and this is especially true if you're a large firm with a big bank right and so banks were the channel through which ppp was done and what we seem to be finding is that the banks have their own incentives which results in large firms benefiting and this is particularly true again when they're with big banks and so to conclude we've looked at ppp as a large sales shop in financing supply and loan demand so what have we learned so first if we're trying to design physical subsidy programs for corporations clearly it's important to have very clear exantia eligibility criteria but it is equally important to have very clear exposed audit processes after on take after the uptake so if there's uncertainty if there's ambiguity then this tends to discourage forms from from taking on the subsidies so delineating safe harbors may be useful in encouraging uptake we also find the channels matter there are frictions and intermediaries that can change or heavily influence the delivery of financing they can shape who gets funding and how soon and as we see it's large firms who get funding soon and particularly if you're a large firm with a large bank thank you
