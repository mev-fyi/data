lessons from the internet thank you very much thank you shane thanks hi well thank you rebecca and richard for organizing a wonderful wonderful conference and book i'm here to talk a bit about lessons from the internet and the game plan here just give you a little motivation then break up the talk into two different eras uh you know we start when you ask the question what lessons do you learn from the internet so let's at least start with a shared assumption that it's a success story okay so we i think we could all start from the same place that the internet has touched a wide breadth of the economy it's a transformation for the better we see lower prices new services extraordinary efficiencies that could not have imagined several decades ago and it's changed life as we know it both in day-to-day life and as well as in efficiencies of enterprises and so there's just this big question that sits on the table what lessons can we learn from this successful example uh for other large innovative efforts such as uh energy now now we're learning from one example so you know that's an inherently limited exercise but on the other hand you might be able to see details that are very very informative and one of the first details you have to begin with is this common myth that there's such a thing as a single internet uh or that there's something you can define as the internet that's constant over time and and there isn't there is it's a constantly evolving technology and what and actually the meaning of what the internet is does evolve over time as well and for purposes of the talk i'm going to just some sense blindly overlook a lot of that and just divide the world into two eras a pre-commercial era and a commercial era and that's roughly speaking the pre-commercial era will be the era of darpa nsf management of the backbone and many of the applications and then the commercial area will be the era of private management and then there's lots of detail underneath that that i'll try to acknowledge as we go along but this is an outline at best um so just once you begin with that you have to refine the question what policy lessons can we learn from each of these eras and in particular i'm going to focus on trying to understand how uh different processes contributed to accumulating innovation in each era in the pre-commercial era in particular we're going to look for lessons at managing a very dispersed community who are exploring frontier engineering science and in the commercial area we'll look at actually a very different setting where a new industry evolves within a competitive market and again there's widely dispersed technical leadership and the innovation accumulates so let's start with the first era so first of all again once again we think we know what the internet is and i'm going to have to start immediately by making certain we have the same shared assumption this is not the manhattan project nor is it a the apollo project it's not a single the internet does not begin as a single urgent project in a single lab developed by a small team building a single engineering object and you have to you have to lose that assumption as as you start and i think a much better place to begin is think of it as collective invention there are multiple overlapping groups of funders who shape the attributes both at any point in time in overtime at first it's the department of defense as the major agency behind funding and then it's the national science foundation as the major agency behind funding but you should also think about other players and other participants who are important over time including universities research labs and and groups of inventors programmers and administrators and users and so once you begin to recognize that the question is uh how does this widely dispersed community come together over one project well there's a shared and shared objective and as and it begins under darpa funding and that is under dod funding there was a desire for a radical technical departure that no existing military service could produce there was also a demand for a workable model of a hardware and software combination that supported data communication capabilities that would eventually though not immediately necessarily be portable to military application when this begins there's also a general concept in the air of of what was desired but no um certainty about the optimal or engineering the uh from an engineering viewpoint best path to implement so there was a desire for communication along multiple pathways there was a desire over to do this over long geographic distances and there was a clear demand to be able to do it between computer systems without human intervention that was clearly articulated from the outset the the implementation early on takes place inside uh darpa darpa is an organization inside the department of defense that's modeled on what what one might call a skunk works well-known skunk works are uh in in industry are known to be organizational homes for projects that are value of long-term value to the mission of the organization but not necessarily connected to uh operations uh they're not beholden to any short-term mission and in this case they're not beholden to any particular military branch's mission and and in darpa in particular in the early era when this begins the program officers uh had very strong technical skills and some of them even did the innovation themselves they picked research stars they funded their labs and students with and i can only say this the best way possible with uncommonly large amounts of money uh and the primary goal is to build a research community again you understand they had general demand they knew what they were looking for in a general sense but in the specifics it was unclear what what what what it was going to look like and so building the community and letting them explore the question was the best they could hope to do and then bring them together now i often say why was this such a good environment and i use a term from industry uh the term free ministry is the term wild ducks which is the a type of inventor who is willing to sacrifice monetary compensation some monetary compensation in order to have a uh more uh satisfying uh research environment and and darpa served as the home early on administrative home for funding for our wild ducks if you will many of the wild ducks here actually lived in universities and research labs and contract labs and were funded this way now having said that what skunk works are not enough a skunk work typically is oriented towards building a working prototype that is an unrefined implementation of a design that's designed specifically to teach the researcher some lessons or some engineering lessons uh and then stops at the working prototype that's generally what skunk works do uh in in this case we should recognize this skunk works goes further it actually implements and and makes operational a number of the innovations uh this is both true of the darpanet and the nanocephenet and so want to acknowledge that that that's true over a 20-year period uh and in that in i'm going to sort of wave my hand here because there's a lot of a lot of examples of this uh over this long period you observe uh something very interesting that the inventors use what they build um that is their ideas grow out of their own experience this is something begins quite early and continues all the way into the 90s it has to work they recognize it has to work for themselves but the inventors recognize it also still work for someone else so they develop a set of institutions for communicating with others about how it should work in another context the users and the administrators recognize what's valuable early on some of the value in the applications are not things anyone had ever planned for for example email that's not part of the plan um you know file transfers uh which we take for granted today also is is generically part of the plan exactly how it gets implemented was not at the beginning and then it becomes an important application and everyone recognizes it uh in addition there's an interesting selection mechanism at work in this period and and again i'm waving some sense waving hands here a little bit um there's a technical meritocracy uh uh behind the scenes and everyone involved recognizes this it's quite you you can talk to anyone involved in this period they they talk about uh recognize they talk about a social understanding among virtually all participants that you would drop quickly something that wasn't recognized as efficient that there would be a technical consensus among many of the researchers early on about whether something was useful and they would they would look to build uh upon things that were useful the other thing to recognize again is that achieving scale was quite a challenging uh issue here uh in an operation uh of something that was quite complex and and that has goes through multiple multiple stages of learning and i'm just just going to brush by that for the time being so what do we learn about when government can accelerate new technology from an example like this well to ask that question you inherently have to ask compared to what alternative had the government not been there what would have happened and we can answer that question yeah you actually can talk to the private firms who are involved in something similar to this at the same time in the 1960s and 70s when this project first begins it's quite clear the government investment in this case did accelerate the fundamental science and engineering in the internet and that's largely because private firms were uninterested in this particular application with these particular attributes there were related things they were doing so it's not you know you have to be careful about what you say and in addition one of the interesting lessons here is the dod is so worried about this that they allow early on in the 70s for spin-offs to let private firms develop packet switching as a commercial market and yet nonetheless that will not later on lead to the internet we we we get the internet again through nsf funding and so and the nsf net so you have to be again very careful about what the alternative was in the later era again you might ask well did the nsf funding and operation have some consequence that the private firms would not have otherwise themselves come to and the answer again there has to be yes it's more subtle in this case and even in the late 80s private industry recognized electronic commerce was on the way that was a commonly understood assumption there were multiple implementations for that vision and there were competing visions among the firms themselves about how it would work the nsaf net was a particular implementation and it fostered a a different pathway than the one the firms were going to take okay so another another fun myth in this uh world is wasn't didn't we get this on the cheap uh my goodness you know and there's a commonly uh uh quoted number uh that there was 200 million dollars of nsf funding for the nsf net largely between 1985 and 1995. um and and boy we got the commercial internet out of that boy that just sure looks like a high rate of return and and you know well let's be let's be a little careful i feel it's necessary to be a bit careful about that it's that number comes only from the nsf era it doesn't count darpa uh to my knowledge nobody knows exactly how much starbucks spent on the uh on the darbanet um i mean we can get the entire budget so i can you know tell you the max but the the actual darpa the darpanet and the the projects that led to the internet in within darpa were a small fraction of the whole the whole total budget in addition if we were going to be in on do an honest economic calculation we'd want to consider the benefits of everything that was being funded out of darpa and many of the failures that were also funded out of there in that era in addition if you wanted to think through the cost benefit from innovation in the internet it benefits from innovation that doesn't come from the government let's be honest it also benefits from a lot of the things day mario was just talking about uh and you know many innovations are coming out of the computer industry simultaneously along with the things happening in the internet and the internet just takes advantage of it goes for a ride on the same wave uh in in addition it takes advantage of at the time you know the most developed telephone system in the world i mean it builds on top of existing capital it does not have to recreate the entire uh network now at the same time it takes advantage of something unique about this technology the prototype is software software's cheap to replicate so once invented it's easy to spread well comparatively easy to spread and that is a feature of this technology finally there's one feature also that has an analog to energy that's very interesting in this example which is there was distributed investment so the costly part the backbone is the part that's largely targeted by the uh the department of defense and the nsf and investment on the edges uh take place a lot of a lot of participants are involved in the applications and the installations it's often the domain of the the universities or the research labs at this in this era those budgets come from many sources there's one other lesson to learn from this era about something to avoid and i might call it truncated experimentation this becomes much more apparent after the fact but even during the time that this is taking place the participants recognize parts of the these issues there are restrictions on participation in the 1970s on the darpa net that they're it's an unending tension it arises over and over again um it in fact motivates the transfer of the the network to the nsf to allow a larger range of participation the nsf then has a different mission than darpa and so as a consequence permits a different type of exploration to take place that's again not a surprise and yet the nsf also has a particular mission that truncates the set of things that can be explored you're not allowed to explore commerce for example and that will show up later on as a there's a set of lessons we understand uh from this experience and then not later okay so we get to the commercial i'm now i'm going to skip this is one of those you know then the magic occurs uh i'm going to skip the transition i'm doing it deliberately because of time just to be frank you know so we have to begin with uh commercialization you might reasonably ask was privatization a good idea and and the answer again has to be undoubtedly yes why because the nsf uh management did expand the range of uh you know their their mission was to expand the range of the capabilities of the the technology but that mission is also limited it isn't allowed they weren't allowed to explore commerce and uses of the internet for con purposes of commerce and privatization permitted that to occur privatization also allows a new range of participation expands the range of participation and so you get new uses new users a whole net new set of processes that you might not otherwise have explored and by the time commercialization occurs the proof of concept is on the table it's it's recognized by every participant whereas one participant put it they're beyond the nuts and bolts stage and everyone knew that at least all the insiders knew it uh again as a side note the transition is quite challenging for the government managers at the time it's primarily because there's no experience with uh applications outside of research and there's no experience with contracting in a commercial environment with multiple carriers and so that just presents multiple challenges for them uh what do we get well we get really rapid and fast adoption and here the cliche is it's it's you know it's wonderful to be good but it's better to be lucky and in this case you're both good and lucky um you know the commercial internet doesn't just uh demand for it doesn't just merely appear it appears in part because the technology had been developing for over two decades and been refined to develop a set of applications that a whole set of participants after all students are 20 years old a whole set of participants 20 year olds could find very useful arguably that means it's going to be useful for more than just students in addition we got lucky that browser shows up at essentially the same time the browser itself starts as an invention inside the traditional format it is tim berners-lee is is working in a government laboratory this in this case a european laboratory in switzerland he's doing it for his for his constituency uh he then deploys it uh in an uh you know in shareware starting in 1991 and then after some dissatisfaction with how it's diffusing starts the world wide web consortium in the mid-1994 and it on top of that is built what we were we now recognize as a commercial industry so uh that is the commercial browser and then a number of other uses for that i'm wonderfully coincident with that the nsf transition for towards privatization ends roughly speaking in 1995. so it's you know quite uh coincident with the emergence of the technology that uh on which a technological platform on which most of the commercial firms are going to build is the ending of the whole privatization effort so it's a you know it's good and lucky then we get a wave of entry and what do you what do you see from that well uh there are a couple things happening there first you're making up for truncated exploration um second year affiliate your the firms are exploring many of the new opportunities affiliated with the web and to be fair it's more than just a technical exploration at this point because it's an exploration in the context of trying to generate revenue in excess of cost and so there's multiple models explored for how to conduct business though there are lots of popular views about what happened during this period there there are there are essentially two at the 30 000 foot level two two gross impulses on the one it's to create something new that is to generate revenue and uh that didn't previously exist for services that didn't previously exist and the second impulse is to find more efficient ways to do things that are already being done and just to give you a sense of how large that becomes just in 2006 just the access industry alone so just just one piece of the entire value chain affiliated with the internet it's just a 39 billion dollar industry just and you know it comes out of nowhere that's that doesn't even exist that industry doesn't exist 20 years earlier and that's just one piece of the value chain that gives you a sense of how big it is so what lesson might you learn from this again i'm going to do looking over a 10-year experience one is that markets nurture exploratory behavior in the face of a large innovative opportunities echoing something many of the other speakers have said as well and and here why do they do that in this in the context of this example you you observe three things coincident with it one a lot of economic experiments that is the the learning is cheaper in the marketplace than it is inside of a laboratory so you observe you just you can watch it firms are trying to figure out where demand is they're trying to figure out what cost structure works and they do it uh through the the services that they're offering second you observe vigorous what i like to call vigorous standards competition and part of the reason you observe that particularly here is because standards serve as the uh leading edge the leading indicator if you want to use that metaphor of services that are going to build on top of standards not all the standards are going to work of course but some of them do and become the platforms on which other firms build large services third you observe a lot of entrepreneurial initiatives that is risky undertakings in pursuit of business opportunities a large number of participants are pursuing them and you observe a healthy amount of innovation due to the presence of the entrepreneurs to be fair it's not the entrepreneurs alone it's also existing incumbent firms but it's that it's the multiple participants in competition with one another for innovative services and products that brings up that heightens incentives just as others have said and uh brings about a whole new set of options it's quite healthy and and this is quite a healthy way to do things when you don't know in advance what the right outcome should be finally um the other lesson i would add here this particular example has within it uh an illustration of why a variety beats a single supplier it's one of those examples that so clearly shows it and and in part it's because at the time that the commercial internet deploys that there are numerous incumbent uh and established firms who are not interested and uh then are forced to become interested as a consequence of what happens in the commercial markets and you might ask why well part of it is that the markets overcome misunderstandings that it's the firms who've over committed to one technological forecast it also overcomes some inadequacies firms who lack internal champions um and and for a number of reasons perhaps they're being short-sighted perhaps there's cannibalization concerns uh it it also variety is helps in an environment where the outcome is unknown because it it permits a heterogeneity heterogeneity in the incentives to invest it's the best way to say it different actors face different incentives they they inherit different capital structures they have different milestones in their organizations they see different short run benefits because they are presently serving different customer bases and so they use the internet in different ways that's the broad point and then there's a really interesting policy lever in the con in the face of this variety and that's interoperability among all this variety and uh and in this industry in particular regulatory the regulatory lever is the the lever that gets used most often that is interoperability among uh the carriers and the content providers um the last lesson i would draw from this uh it has to do with the low comparatively low barriers to entry that you found in the commercial markets it's quite a remarkable feature of the u.s market particularly in comparison to other countries um that you have so many entrepreneurs in in the internet markets quite early and way out there you know when there are lots and lots of skeptics as early as 1989 uh for exa i always point to psi and new united as two examples uh that they're they're founding their commercial uh firms in 89 they are descendants of the nsf net they don't none of their brethren and cousins from nsf actually follow them uh not long after them or dial up isps because you remember them you know right the us has the most vibrant dial dial up isp market in the world why partially because there's nobody stopping them that's such a strong contrast to the rest of the world there's another thing much more subtle it's comparatively easy to set up a consortia in the u.s and so tim berners-lee deliberately finds it easier deliberately moves to boston because he finds it easier here and recognize the world wide web consortia is based in boston partially for that reason um and finally uh the the the worldwide this is not unique to the united states the the the standard setting bodies um are quite vibrant uh in the in the electronics industry so uh summary uh there really are these two distinct ways of accumulating in innovation and they arise in the same example at different periods in time it's quite remarkable for the same example to put that forward one of those has to do with skunk works that's a say a skunk works aimed at clearly stated demand the the inventors in this case were able to assess value from their own experience that's kind of an interesting observation about this example the working prototypes were put into operation that's an interesting departure also from a typical skunk works a technical meritocracy really did bite here that's also an interesting departure and to be fair it comes at a cost i mean there's a truncated exploration early on the market the market period looks quite different it explores explores a range of applications as one would have expected from a competitive market with a lot of low barriers to entry there's no monopoly to stand in the way there's strong interdependence among the various participants yet despite that uh you you see a lot of entrepreneurial initiatives in part because the interconnection interoperability uh regulations permit it uh and there's numerous policies that permit this to occur that's where i'll end thank you very much we have time for a couple of questions yeah i actually have a question about um an area where internet innovation has actually been released can you introduce yourself again i'm sorry sorry jeff alexander with sri lanka um an area where internet innovation has been relatively slow to diffuse which is in actually the telephone infrastructure and one thing i've noticed is you know there was all these predictions back in the 90s about we would now have no more class 5 switches and circuit switches would be dead and yet because there was this massive installed base of the existing circuit switched infrastructure you know that's been very slow to change and is that maybe also a helpful lesson for energy in that you do have this now coexistence of the ip world and the circuit switched world and they will probably have to coexist for some time until all the investment in the existing infrastructure is kind of uh it goes away uh yeah i mean yes there are lessons i i would have to say you know they exist at the 10 000 to 15 000 foot level not at the details and the details are quite different um but at the at the broad level yes you know where do you start the existing infrastructure is very valuable so it's a compliment early on so you want you want to recognize that um second there's a myth that the government doesn't play a role in the the commercial internet that's just wrong uh my gosh the government can't get it can't avoid playing a role because it regulates the telephone industry so it's a regulated industry the regulated industry is going to behave the way it's going to behave because it's regulated particularly local telephone industry is regulated and so the interplay necessary interplay with that regulated industry will play a role now governments can choose a variety of different policies governments around the world have chosen a variety of different policies so that that makes me hesitant to say there's one right way to do things but it is clear from this example at least in the u.s government policy played a particular role it wasn't there to foster the internet let's acknowledge that it was there to foster interconnection with competitive uh communication firms and so there were a set of federal regulations to foster the customer premise equipment industry if you remember that and the competitive long distance industry if you were if you remember that what that was that you know it doesn't largely exist any longer um and uh and then the government also plays a role in through any trust i don't i didn't bring it up but as others have brought it up the government plays a role in stopping the worldcom sprint merger which uh by the way was an attempt partially in attempt to uh you know have one firm control the u.s backbone market and you know so it plays a role in a couple different important places one last question dick van outer with stippy and you mentioned earlier on the issue of scaling up of the the internet and i want to look at this in the context of the dod a doe issue in terms of demonstration demonstration programs could is there any lessons from the way in which darpa engaged in the scaling up of these demonstration facilities uh and this and the efforts to build larger scale connectivities and then how nsf then pursued that in terms of demonstrations of effect and building they could call it the customer base and experience space that might be looked upon as ways of monitoring or managing doe experiments and demonstrations boy is that a good question uh uh once again rich with experience so the the the first thing i want to do is i have to question one of the premises of the questions just to make sure we're all unclear so that um you know darpa runs its own darpanet then it transfers part of that to the military and there's a military net that then darpanet gets transferred the nsf net the nsf net uh becomes the origin for what we recognize today as the internet however to be fair because of the issues about participation back in the late 70s and early 80s there are multiple other networks being done at the same time and they have different architectures than the than the darpanet and that partly tells us you know as an observer that there was disagreement in the computer science community about the right way to implement a network and so importance of variety that when it's not known which is the right way to do things um it's actually quite important to have variety and those various experiments css csnet um unet and and so on they learned from one another to be fair right they were they were sharing lessons from one another and then that informs the nsf nets architecture going forward so that's that's the sort of part of the lesson a second lesson is you know demonstration is very good at overcoming skepticism so one of the reasons i brought up uh that list that uh established firms resisted some exist resisted we know from historical fact resisted some of the commercial opportunities in the internet until they observed others making money we know demonstration can be useful for that purpose um but i i wouldn't want to overstate it i mean the variety i think the variety is really the key issue here there's such a wide variety it's large lots of different demonstrations it's not just one single demonstration and so be very careful about saying nsf demonstrated that's the that's what i'm picking up on there's actually this enormous variety worldwide by the way right not just in the us shane thank you very much so thank you i'd like to remind us that we've just heard about 50 years of industry experience compressed into two hours now that asking the chat to authors to compress what is at least 10 or 15 years experience in each of these industry into 20 minutes is is very brutal but i hope you get a sense of the richness and depth of the the the work that's here and also this dual play between sustained investment to appropriately managed uh research and the vibrant demand in the competitive marketplace comes back back very very very strongly let's take a five minute stretch break and while we set up the panel and could i ask the panel makers the panel members to come up please thank you very much okay so that means you
