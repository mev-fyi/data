let me start by telling you why we're interested in nursing homes here's a picture from my home state of connecticut this is since march deaths by day for people not living in congregate settings so people out in the community and you can see my state connecticut is one of the harder hit states but this is the picture of the number of deaths in congregate settings which is largely driven by nursing homes long-term care facilities which include nursing homes in the u.s account for about 40 percent of u.s coveted deaths now i think many people might recognize that and say well this is a fragile population and of course conditional on infection the death rates in nursing homes are going to be high i think what's been discussed less is how shockingly high the infection rates in nursing homes have been here's a picture of resident cases per thousand residents by state from the center for medicare and medicaid services which is the primary regulator of nursing homes you can see from this picture that in connecticut massachusetts and new jersey more than 30 percent of the nursing home population has become infected that is a shockingly high number and the infections are not limited just to residents the regulator in new york has estimated that 25 of nursing home staff in that state have become infected we're talking about the us here and our data is from the u.s but the problem of covid in nursing homes is a problem which has been identified worldwide now given that we know this is a fragile population of course efforts were made to protect this population early on in the nursing in the covid crisis uh the centers for medicare and medicaid services way back in march recognized that nursing homes were vulnerable and issued guidance restricting visitation in nursing homes so with visitors not able to enter nursing homes from march that would should help protect visitors but of course it should help protect residents but of course we know that infections took place in nursing homes nonetheless so what is the break in this bubble uh of the nursing homes how could sars kobe 2 get into nursing homes well one likely answer is unwittingly staff and contractors who come and go from the nursing home brought coronavirus in we know that nursing homes have suffered from limited ppe and limited testing of staff and contractors in this paper what we identify as particularly dangerous is the potential for cross-movement of staff across nursing homes so if you have a nursing home that has no infections and you have workers who are working in a nursing home with infections that is very likely to be a dangerous situation and we know that cross-deployment of staff is very common so approximately 60 percent of nursing homes uses staffing agency and staffing agencies are designed to help nursing homes cross-deploy staff and we also know that nursing assistance is a very low paid profession and an earlier study shows that approximately nineteen percent of nursing assistants hold a second job early in the crisis the cross movement of staff was identified as a potential source of problem in particular for example the cdc in evaluating the kirkland washington outbreak uh in march 2020 wrote a report in which they identified that staff members working in more than one facility led to the spread of sars kovi 2 from the kirkland facility to other nursing homes in the state despite the early identification of this as a potential problem as far as we know there is no data set that measures cross deployment of staff measures cross traffic across nursing homes and know in fact regulate regulation that speaks directly to this problem so this is what we set out to measure in this paper how do we do this so to measure cross traffic we first hand assemble data on cases from state departments of public health we're going to use that as well as data from the federal regulator cms we'll use the cms data for robustness but unfortunately the cms did not require reporting until may and reporting of may first cases by nursing homes to cms was optional so the state data is for a subset of states but is more complete we're going to take our state data and match it to the cms database of nursing homes in order to obtain a robust set of nursing home characteristics we're going to be looking at cms quality ratings home demographics records of inspection violations and importantly from cms we'll get the official address of the nursing home this is what we're going to use to measure cross traffic so exactly how do we do this here's a picture satellite picture of a nursing home near my house we first take the address and use the google api to find a longitude and longitude point for each nursing home then we're going to use a commercially available satellite image shape file in order to to measure exactly the perimeter of each nursing home and from that perimeter of each nursing home we'll be measuring cell phone pings in that nursing home we're going to use anonymized smartphone data from varistet on 30 million smartphones and we identify 509 000 smartphones that that that ping in at least one us nursing home in that six week period of march 13th to april 23rd after the shutdown of nursing homes to visitors so these are likely not visitors that we're seeing but these these are these are smartphones that we're seeing visiting uh in nursing homes what do we find well we find that seven percent of the smartphones that enter one nursing home enter more than one nursing home so even a priori we know this is a dangerous potential situation in that nursing homes are so vulnerable we also look at how much cross traffic there is among nursing homes so this is a picture of the degree of contact among nursing homes so this is the number of other nursing homes to which a nursing home is connected on the x-axis and the frequency that we see that number of connections on the y-axis so you can see that there's a large number of nursing homes high frequency of nursing homes with a very small number of connections but having a lot of connections does occur in yellow we have the nursing homes with no covet cases as of mid-may from the cscms data and in blue we have the nursing homes with covid cases you can see that on average the nursing homes with no coveted cases tend to have fewer connections than their nursing homes with coveted cases and of course that's what we want to look at systematically in order to look at that systematically we want some measures of the connectedness of nursing homes we we'd use degree in the last figure but there are other measures that have been identified by the network literature this is a picture of a complex nursing home network in connecticut the dot size here is proportional to the number of cases so these little dots are nursing homes that actually have no cases the strength of the connection is color-coded so if it's light not many smartphones are shared between the nursing homes but some and if it's dark there are more smartphones being observed in a pair of nursing homes we look at this focal nursing home here in blue this nursing home is interesting because it doesn't relative to the average in the state have a lot of strong connections to other nursing homes but the nursing homes it's connected to are themselves very highly connected nursing homes and using the language of networks this nursing home actually has high eigenvector centrality in the state so i'm not going into details but this is one of the measures of network connectedness that we use in the paper so what do we do we look at the covariates of covid19 cases within nursing homes specifically we calculate the inverse hyperbolic sign of the number of cases in each nursing home which is a log-like transform which is useful to use when you have a number of uh a lot of observations with zeros um this specification that we use is very similar to a specification that some previous researchers have used to look at the the covariates of covid19 cases in nursing homes so specifically we include measures of the cms quality rating we include home demographics and we include state fixed effects so we're really looking at within state because states differ so much in their overall level of infection within state what are the predictors of nursing homes with more cases we also have an urban indicator these are measures that have been used in the previous literature but we add to that are various measures of network connectedness so we talk about degree which is the number of connections as i talked about before strength which is number of connectors within each connection and then this measure of eigenvalue centrality that i tried to describe in the picture from kinetic kit we find that all of these measures of connectedness when used together with these other measures of nursing home potential covariates of nursing home cases are highly predictive of nursing home cases overall we find that if we shut down all connections that predicts an astonishing 44 reduction in cases from our point estimates now of course this is a cross-sectional observational regression um but which has limitations but we point out that this is an environment in which a randomized controlled trial is unlikely to be either ethical or feasible and this kind of evidence we think is important in forming policy our basic results qualitatively are robust to substituting the state data for cms data for replacing the state fixed effects with county fixed effects and with using a specification in which we don't count the number of cases but rather use a zero one for whether the nursing home has cases or not we find our network variables to be important predictors of cases in all of these specifications importantly and consistent with some previous researchers we find that the cms regulatory measures do not actually predict cases that these connectedness measures and home demographics are much more important in predicting cases finally we conclude that this is an urgent problem particularly in states where cases are continuing to grow nursing homes are still vulnerable and there's a variety of ways in which regulators could think about attempting to protect this population we don't make specific recommendations in the paper but some considerations are ppe more aggressive testing and of course compensation of nursing home workers to compensate them to work only one job in only one home
