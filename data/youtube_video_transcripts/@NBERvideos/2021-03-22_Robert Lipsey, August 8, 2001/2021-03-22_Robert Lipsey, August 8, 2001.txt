it is august 8th at a quarter to 4 in the afternoon i'm at the national bureau with 1010 mass air and i'm interviewing robert lipsy and if you'd be so kind robert to tell us a bit about yourself and and when you came to the bureau and any other details you'd like to share so i started at the bureau of june 1945 and the way it came about was that i received a letter in the mail from jeff moore asking me if i would like to work with the bureau and saying that he was writing a arthur burns suggestion i had been a student of burns although i doubt that he knew me very well but i think that other assistants mentioned his my name to him and suggested me and so so you were a student this is when you were an undergraduate this is a graduate okay the year before i came to the bureau and i was interviewed by jeff moore and jeff was involved in the business cycle program and i started out working in what was called the business cycle unit which is the dominant unit of the bureau it was one that was a continuing project but never had to ask for money and that was sort of thought of at the core of the bureau and i spent three months there partly doing small jobs for jeff moore and partly actually working in the unit and the unit consisted of as far as the assistance concerned consisted of i would guess maybe six or seven assistants research assistants and their job was to do the business cycle analysis but also seasonal corrections a large part of the man-hours went into seasonal corrections and they were not done as now without pressing a button but they were done first in a mechanical way they were charted more and burns would look at them often reject them say try a different method and sometimes could go on for a week before a single series of correction was accepted and then the business cycle analysis was done on the seasonally corrected data let me just ask you one question at that moment the government was not doing seasonal corrections to the same series well no the seize the co series i think were largely published not corrected but if some were published corrected the bureau would not have accepted the results and would have nevertheless re-redone the corrections i don't know how much was published seasonally adjusted at that time but i know that this was a major part of the work and it was not it was fairly people doing it a pretty routine job it was done with a supervisor in the room watching other people and they were expected to keep to their work not water around so what was your type your title was called research assistants i think and the person in charge of that room was sophie sakowitz people who worked there and i used to meet ray bavern vernon he would ask me about her because he had worked there in the 30s and he remembered her very well supervisor any case the there were other projects that involved individual research people and typically one assistant and that was considered a much more desirable job so that when the opportunity came to move out of this unit i was interviewed by fabricant and self-fabricant and he hired me to work for him so i had a very short experience in that business cycle unit but fairly vivid if you remember in when you were in the business cycle unit there were other research assistants there did you become close friends with was this uh also a social context of yes there was certain social contact although much more in the other room where people were not so closely supervised and we did become quite quite friendly we go out to lunch together and that was quite a different a different atmosphere and so that was a where i was actually called in by arthur burns after i when i was considering moving and to my surprise he urged me very strongly not to make that move and he stressed highly he thought of jeff moore and how important the business cycle work was i made the move nevertheless well maybe he wanted to keep another really good research assistant working on the business cycle project of course well i think jeff jeff liked me a little more contact i had more contact with him than the others did but still i was i was quite taken aback of the directive research would call me in for something like that well it was it impressed you enough so that you remember that moment very well um so three months went by so now we're still in 1945 maybe 1946 45 still 45 and now you're working with fabrication working for a fabricant not continue quite a while we did this was a project on the growth of government in the united states which eventually ended in a book but were preceded by an income and wealth paper on government wealth which i had a fairly large part in and then papers on government employment and other aspects so remind me that this was all levels of government this was federal plus state government local and the economy right so this would have begun with for the local it could only go back to 1902 right well looking back to what government said earlier right and because uh well for state governments there was information and uh they've been histories of local government one had some idea right about the role of local government earlier but not a really good series it's just because the statistical data begins in 1902 and basically that the statistical aspects of the study began mainly with 1900 and 1902 so that i worked on various aspects of that project for the next few years and the book finally came out in 1952 but i had begun by that time i had been given my own project and so then i began the the project that well now first fabricant was involved in a part of the kuznets study which he was looking which well could talk about that but there's a large study with many people on the fabricated one aspect of it and that's where i first began working on foreign investment i wrote with that the equivalent in those days of working papers on various aspects of foreign investment so these were part of the occasional imports no no these were just inputs to the final volume none of them published it called working uh i'm sure they have they just internally circulated they didn't have to go to the board for reviewers this was for the project itself and then at some point i was given my own project which was the price and quantity trends project tell me a bit about what you mean by i was given well i actually should talk about how the viewer ran okay and that it was a very the decisions about what to do came down from above and the bureau decided you know that was going to work on a certain area presumably that was the director of research and the board took part in that decision the and people moved from one project to another they may have had some choice but they may not had a lot of choice as to what what they would do it was the yeah the project that that was given that it was i was told that i could have this as my own project i would have financing i would have research assistance wow your own research assistant and uh because it was a very large data collection effort i had a number of right quite a number of assistants to work with the idea behind it was that it was going to be of help in the business cycle program but ilsa mintz was going to do a study of cyclical behavior of trade exports and imports there were no quarterly indexes going back far into the past and so i was going to put together these indexes which would feed into her work but i had a lot of freedom and i converted the project to something i was more interested in which became my dissertation eventually and i was given a great deal of freedom in hiring people i never if i wanted more assistance i would ask mostly yeah i got them so but the year that this began so you're working on business cycles you worked for fabricant and then you were given your own project and we date that in probably 1954. i was taught to date it because the projects blended into one was finishing off one project right let me deviate for a second on a personal note here you were you were an undergraduate columbia now you're a graduate student and you're working at the bureau you're you're also sort of registered as a as a graduate student um how how did it work you you took some courses and then then you're sort of doing your own thing and columbia doesn't really care well i took had one year full time right but before i started the bureau and then once i had started i had to finish my 60 credits which i did accept i guess one course at a time or two courses and columbia was quite relaxed of those days about some time limits and then i finished i guess i did a masters so i did i did get a master's degree writing a paper under burns in 1946 and on the time entirely different topic which was an interesting experience by itself but the bureau was was in part livelihood and it turned out that it was also the fount of this dissertation so it had many different virtues well for me because i liked the work i enjoyed having my project the there was not much connection with colombia but as i did this project i had originally spoken to rachmaninon dirksec colombia but he never took any real pardons when i finished i brought it to back to columbia and albert hirschmann very kindly took it on and i sat in on the seminar for a year or a term and he had a lot of helpful ideas particularly about how to present he was interested in the results and he had very good ideas about how to present it and uh but so i had a project although i had no particular status i'm not sure what my title was but the organization of the bureau in that time bureau had the director of research who really was the highest ranking person i guess moore may have been the associate director but i'm not sure whether he actually had that title and then there was a uh what was called then the research staff which consisted of about 20 people at its largest as i far as i can remember maybe half were teaching at universities and half were full-time bureau of employees and the bureau for quite some time maintained a full-time research staff and thought i think that that was desirable to have some mixture the research assistants were always told they should not look on this as the road to promotion they were supposed to finish their work at the university and go off somewhere they were in those days permanent research assistance women several women who had worked for many years at the bureau two of them worked for simon kuznets elizabeth jenks and lillian epstein and they were clearly played some important role in his work another one worked for fred mills later for kendrick but most of the people were young and stayed were expected to stay only a short time fabricant had come as an assistant and stayed yeah milton was simon's research assistant and and then and simon had brought back all the surveys that were the basis of income from independent practice in the 30s and he was told about this mathy student to colombia and and he brought milton into the project as a research assistant and then of course uh milton state with that with that project so but many many it's considered unusual and it was not people the staff members were not encouraged to include their research assistants as co-authors in fact there was a couple of episodes in which at least one i knew of where stagnant was prevented from doing that and the if you thought very highly of the contribution of the research assistant then publication would come out with the assistance of somebody who was a good research assistant so so i was given a project i was given the project i think because this was desired for the business cycle program and fabricate thought of me as someone to do it all that time though you you did have a sense that you would eventually get your degree that somehow you would think much about that i didn't think much about it and the bureau always emphasized that that they didn't care whether i got a degree or not once once it was clear that i was a long-term employee they emphasized that i shouldn't worry about that they didn't didn't particularly want me to get it so i didn't think too much of it at some point i decided it would be a good idea and i had to retake some of my exams and spent a year doing all these things how much you may not know the answer to this question but arthur burns for example he's he's full-time faculty he's probably half-time in terms of the number of courses he has to teach at columbia because of his position at the bureau he comes in probably every day to the bureau no i wouldn't i wouldn't be i'd i doubt it now his his era at the bureau then came to an end with eisenhower's right election so right that was a period i guess when he was most active at the beer most largest presence for all of us you could go in and talk to him if he wanted to and then when he left fabrikam became director of research and that led to a real a change in emphasis in bureaucracy fabricates interests were not primarily business cycles he was more interested in long-term issues productivity and economic growth so look at the annual reports of those years right major change in the subjects i think he wrote one about business cycles but the others were all different topics and fabricate stays as the director of research until when um well i'm not sure but when burns returned in 57 i believe then he became the president of the bureau and he now the positions changed in importance because now he became once again became the dominant figure and he was very dominant i began to have some administrative role at that point so i would sit in our meetings and he clearly everyone deferred very much to him so that the director of research was no longer the final word he came back as president and ruled the bureau until he left again and that was when well i guess he left the time of nixon's campaign well he left in six well he left in 59 so that was like two years he had this period as chairman of the council and i guess until when he turned 50 he came back in uh 57 i believe and i think he was then the president till 66. that's right um there are so many many questions uh that i want to get to let me just say say one thing um which is i've been reading um milton friedman's uh autobiography and some notes of milton's and milton uh it has a a a lovely statement about what it was like when you know he moved from the government to the bureau and and of course it's milton so we we have to be very careful here but milton said of what burns i think it was i think it was burns not mitchell had said to him and he said this this is a difficult project that you're going to do it's going to take a long time sit down do the research in a couple of years you'll have the answer and he was overjoyed this this was research this wasn't okay turn it over in in a couple of months that this was sit back think think hard because we want it done right is is that the sense that is milton telling us exactly what was going on or is this just military yes i think that was very much so because that's what i was told uh also in fact i mean when i was just working as an assistant that was emphasized this was a calling you know and this was a an exciting thing to do a fabricant loved the work and he was he thought it was the best thing in the world to be doing and [Music] the well the bureau was so different in organization at that time i think they thought of themselves as a as pioneers and as people who were doing something very different from the academic profession and that this was the only place that we could do it was the home of empirical research and very few professors were doing empirical research that there wasn't support for it there wasn't real encouragement or great interest in it but this was what these people thought was the key to to really learning about the economy this i think this goes back to mitchell's ideas to some want to institutionalist economics there were a number of strands that entered into this but that meant partly that the bureau was going to do authoritative work they were going to take whatever time was necessary for it they were going to do new things that people hadn't done and they were going to do them right and so that was behind the idea that you had this very elaborate procedure before anything got published you everyone was an employee of the bureau you didn't publish outside you expected to have your work come out as bureau publications and it would have to go through when you finish the manuscript first of all you would give seminars to talk about then when you finished a manuscript the reading committee of your colleagues who go through it and that was a very serious going over that it got people took took each other's work seriously and really so when you gave seminars they were in-house seminars or you would take it on the road in-house and when you gave an in-house seminar was it uh were people um asked to come who were not at the bureau but who burns may have thought had an interest could add something i can't remember but they were basically in-house seminars maybe some others came but the you the place where you got most of your comment criticism was from your colleagues and so who for you the the best criticism was from well i guess frequently from fabricant right since he had interested the project when i presented the my book elsa mintz was one of them and uh jacob minser was on the committee i'm not sure how the third one was i remember but it was the category their review and that also determined had a lot to do with what you would what the what the reviewers said had something to do with the future of the at the beer and then after that it went to a committee of directors and they were also often very thorough they were viewers [Music] but the reviewers were chosen by the director by the research director of the bureau just as as is the case today although it's a little more of a rubber stamp today yes i don't think people take the time that was taking them because they're not full-time this is not a that was considered part of your duties uh and these are full-time people so the reviewer would be an in-house person not not someone who would be chosen sometimes they would send it out to someone but basically right the real review chronologically we're we're going from 45 up to the 60s some that's the period that you've just been talking about um and and of course you finished this project the project that becomes a dissertation in about 61. is that right or just before well i finished probably the manuscript in 1960 in fact but you know it starts through this process which took several years before publication and i think around that time or maybe 59 i began working also with raymond goldsmith who had a big bureau project that i also became the co-author of studies in the national balance sheet so 59 60 61 i was also working so you're working on various things now the price and quantity trends in the foreign trade of the u.s was a princeton studies and international economic relations piece that was not a bureau yeah oh it okay in is days yeah it's interesting that that it it doesn't come up as a bureau of publication in knowledge everything else does and then but this one doesn't it comes up as as um part of the studies in international economic relations number two and they were all about him for the bureau right here i thought that i discovered something today but in fact i haven't discovered anything at all who is doris preston she started as my research assistant on the project on the trade project and then the bureau got a grant i think that even been an nsf grant which was to start bureau had a lot of construction data that is received and analyzed over the years and the idea was to put this out for general use but that to look them all over annotate them in great detail and this was supposedly going to be the beginnings of doing this for all the bureau series all those series that are now only but became obvious that it took so long just to do the construction right the statistics that that was never never continued so uh during the long period that uh you've been just been discussing lots of people came and went in the bureau anna for example was around all that tom although physically she was not always at the bureau because she had uh these four kids she was associated with the bureau right but you would see her uh every now and then or yes we didn't know her well she was quite apart from the rest of this would you see milton well he wasn't in a short period there was a short period when he would be around that we'd see him but i'm not sure when he left for and what about simon simon was around but he simon was somewhat aloof he was on a different floor with his staff and i i saw him later because i became involved in the post-war capital market study and which he was director of but if it had not been for that one he did come to some time sort of presented at seminars but again he wasn't part of the business cycle group and he was a different it was a different group and then he went to penn and then he went to hopkins where do i have that reversed no that's right that's right and then he went to harvard so when he went to penn i guess he no longer came to the bureau i'm not sure whether he was already at penn when we did the postal capital markets it's a little hard for me to remember all the dates that came out in a series of volumes of which his was the last i think over quite a long period of time and he became less and less present as it went along i think a lot of it was done while he was not any longer very much at the bureau although i think both lillian and william epstein elizabeth remained during that period right i would have loved to have met them of course i've met simon but not what were they like william and elizabeth two very different women uh elizabeth james is an unmarried um lady not just unmarried but it's been seemed to be a spencer type rather sharp tongued uh lived by herself in a big house in queens which i think had been her parents house very devoted to simon what she was doing but leah seems a more easier person and i think perhaps was a little bit maybe somewhat more capable but they were both did they have training in statistics or economics or not neither they must have had undergraduate degrees but that's all i don't think either one did gradually work if if anyone did lillian might have but they would not i think basically most of these people they and my pack and selfie soccer was under undergraduate degrees so these may have been in statistics um two things about about the bureau politics and the two parts of economics applied versus empirical so let me group these questions did you ever have a sense of the bureau that there was this other world of politics that there were people who were republicans and people who were democrats and there were people who uh would think of the era of the new deal one way and people who might think of it another way and there were people who uh were going into the 50s who were uh once again uh republicans and people who were democrats so what was there was there and of course uh burns at the helm just as marty here uh it reflects one political view but sometimes you can have a an academic atmosphere which is completely apolitical uh so that's that's one question the second one somewhat unrelated but has to do with the environment is um was there ever a sense that you got that economics was moving more into economic into theory and that these foundations of economics were coming into the bureau or being in some sense held they at the bureau or that it didn't really matter well otherwise those are different completely different politics they were some you know people had very strong opinions and leo roman was the labor economist had very strong very conservative views and i wasn't even conscious of burns views and was rather surprised that he was well placed among republicans when he went to we thought of him my my wife once came to a talk that he gave and he had a way of mumbling under his breath he was not an old inspiring speaker or teacher to me and she was sure that he would not go far in the world so for him to take on this very public role was i think for me a great surprise which may reflect my poor judgment or the way he appeared to us at the bureau it certainly was very i don't think there was much discussion of political issues as it applied to to the research at all uh the at some point probably a little bit later an issue came up about people making political statements and bob shea who was at columbia was in one of the doing one of the finance consumer finance studies wished to write a letter to make some kind of public uh statement and i think the bureau was a little unhappy at first but they finally issued guidelines for people who wish to make these statements he was a very active democrat and he wanted to present his views in some public form and so it was decided that how people should identify themselves and make it clear this was not a bureau not a bureau position in any way um and in some way this goes back to the origins of the bureau which you've probably read about and the this consciousness of sort of being above political disagreement that is that you bring together people of very different political views but nevertheless that they what would come out would be of such high quality that people of the different political views would accept these authorities very positivistic view of economics that you can be completely non-partisan non-political non-ideological well the people themselves were not were known to be ideological but that right you could produce work that would would not be subject to that right criticism right and so the whole board approval system was in part designed for that because you'd have the labor union representative in the business or the representative who would be often on the same reading the same manuscript and you really had to get it by both of them and what about the possible division between theory and applied and i sort of brought these questions together because um they they they are part of uh sort of the philosophical notion that you can have sort of something uh pure and positivistic about economics so we could leave the political aside and at the same time it really doesn't matter if it's theoretically grounded or empirically grounded or econometrically grounded that there is a single truth that we will aim for the of course the accusation of measurement without theory yes was very painful i think and there was some effort to answer that that kind of comment i think mill's book on prices got some of the same kind of criticism the in a way the existence of the bureau was partly a reaction to the academic the way the academic profession had its interests mainly theoretical and while i think everyone would have denied any dislike of theory or certain types of theory i think that runs through wesley mitchell's lecture notes but there was he was very interested in unorthodox theories of all sorts that's i think built into his philosophy so he wouldn't have thought of himself as in opposition to theory but not positioned to a single theory orthodox yes economics theory i think then that was uh i think there now what people said about i think that was under way certain uh certainly his viewpoint it's interesting in milton's memoirs he has only the highest highest compliments concerning mitchell he never says anything about measurement without theory and the eclecticism of mitchell's theoretical underpinnings um there's a great story about uh i i don't know if i if i told you this the last time about how uh kuznets and mit and friedman wrote a first draft of of a paper on on income from independent practice did i tell you this and they gave it to mitchell and mitchell came in and he he as milton said he raised holy hell he said and he said milton writing yes and and so he he certainly um holds mitchell up as the great teacher in many many different uh and different ways well we're we're almost out of time um uh there we we have uh hit on just about all the the questions that uh that i put down here uh some concerning the the role of the government in the bureau do you have any well my understanding in the early period was that the bureau wanted to stay aloof from the government it was made a point that it would only do something on a special request from the government such as something like the price statistics review committee or the national accounts review committee and they had been earlier studies done at the request of some government agency and then that that changed tremendously with john meyer's comment because one of his innovations and what he thought was that the world had changed and the place to go for economic research money was the government and he began much more active search for government funds it's hard to say the environment changed also because funds became available but had not i'm not sure when nsf began supporting economics so the whole the world changed and that meant the academic community changed because people could get government funding which made the bureau change if you think of the changes that took place in the organization of the bureau that's it wasn't that people got different ideas but the world changed and the bureau really had to adapt and it took quite a while to adapt to a very different relationship with the academic community so did burns have uh he obviously had very good relations with rockefeller foundation so there was must have been someone at rockefeller who uh looked to the bureau and looked to burns realizing that this was a uh a great place inherited this relationship i think there are things in in minutes but i don't remember now who are the people they dealt with but that was just an extremely important it was a gigantic grant of money that the bureau received and then that it drew on for a long time after yes but the main thing was the rockefeller foundation supported the euro current it supported its current budget for many years and then in the 1950s change to getting grant rockefeller and ford both and that also changed the bureau's financial situation because it was now for the first time an endowment right which one could could rule and that gave a certain stability right which had not been there before i mean it was a very hand to mouth right operation especially yes did you have a sense in in the hand hand-to-mouth operation there there was as you said the business cycle project which you know we could look at the financial statements and see what fraction of the funds it took and then there were all these other projects and we we know exactly which ones they were and did you ever have a sense that some of them were being done because there was you know the american council on life insurance or whatever that they were that their focus came from the funding itself oh there was no question i think that there was a certain mutual interest i mean the american council of life insurance was the biggest by far but the association of reserve city bankers it was the hillside program which i haven't said anything about which right not sure whom you could find someone to talk about which until 1954 was totally separate and what was it that that was a financial research program and it was in in a an estate up in hudson and riverdale and we didn't know those people who were the people well sonya was there and david durand a whole group of others who put out these financial research volumes but it was also the technological leader the beer because they were the first to have computers but were called computers in those days and when they moved down to manhattan that's when most of us first began to have experience what year are you thinking about 54. right and so we're thinking about a little mainframe of some sort it wasn't a mainframe it was a collection of ibm this was all a sort of partnership with ibm i think right they were provided maybe free to the bureau but and they were but they were punch card machines and one machine did multiplications right my father ran in an ibm data outfit for a textile manufacturing firm and so you know my understanding of how computers evolved is going to see him and seeing what his office looked like and how it evolved from punch cards to to then uh the 360. right and i imagine this is somewhat the same yes but that changed the operation of the bureau tremendously right in terms of research assistance right what they did right i mean there we forget that when you had a research design and correct me if you think this is wrong when you had a research design you also had to think about how much it was going to cost you per data point that you were producing and when you're doing this all with martian calculators uh it's going to cost you a lot oh yes and you just didn't do many things that you did very easily later i think brad hickman was one of the people at this side put out the three volume study on bonds it was very that was supposed to be what started michael milken next to thinking about the fact that you could do better with low quality you could average out risks on low-quality bonds and that i think was a computer for the bureau in that time computer-intensive study and but all this i've described to the seasonal calculations and also the business cycle analyses eventually it's computerized and so in your sense the the bureau uh you see a real switch in the mid 50s to computers at the bureau no just began rather slowly and it was a small for my dissertation i worked with those ibm computers and i used to come in on the weekends and remove sixty thousand car and said you know whatever right and so you you were uh programming in uh cobalt fortran snowball wow these were these machines were plugged yes or programmed by plugging unplugged my father used to have he used to come home with these great big boards so this is the era of the boards that's right and you had your little flow chart and then you would yeah well we had someone who would do that and give him instructions but it would take so long to run that i said i would come in the kids and run these things but there were also the the group of research assistants who would work with simon's research assistants for example who would work with great big pieces of paper and multiply things this way and multiply them this way and the work with goldsmith that project never even though the balance sheets were quite complex never was computerized at all right it would have been later clearly right well you know even in my own memory i could remember when you you didn't go to the computing center to do things and you sat around your house and looked at log tables and things so so it's been a long process i'm being told here that i think we have five minutes are there any last things that you we we talked about so many things uh we can we can of course have another appointment to do another hour of this if you want well it's up to you i mean many things changed of course after over these years john meyer came in 67 because the bureau was losing support from foundations and there was a move to force burns to step down or to really change the focus of the bureau and that was mainly the pure was slow on the econometrics and that was a dispute about whether it was antagonistic to econometric work but i mean most of us felt it was and though meyer was going to that was going to be the one of the big changes with his entry like i don't know if you know that about a year after he came burns tried to have him removed and that there was a major effort uh burns was very angry with him and uh all of us were interviewed by the board as to what that must be in the board minutes if you have a very interesting ann meyer of course one that really was the end of moore's very strong influence that's byrd's successor in a way right and moore of course went to washington and came back later so that was a whole new year very different to different people a different way of organizing and then i guess during this period the idea of the bureau as the employer and the ruler began to weaken people began to demand to publish outside to some degree so this was in a way the transition to marty's era to so such a different way of running the organization right and almost just all the full-time people left starting absolutely 50 but and certainly by the 60s the beer no longer was going to be the full support of anybody all right well i have one minute left and i want to end on an upbeat note which is uh robert lipsy has been here at the bureau in the new incarnation of the bureau at the iti conference and you didn't begin with who you are now so can you just say that you are a professor so i'm professor emeritus now yeah city university of new york and the director of the new york office and researchers associate of the bureau and enjoying the new incarnation of the bureau perhaps having a wonderful time okay i i think i think i have to turn this off okay
