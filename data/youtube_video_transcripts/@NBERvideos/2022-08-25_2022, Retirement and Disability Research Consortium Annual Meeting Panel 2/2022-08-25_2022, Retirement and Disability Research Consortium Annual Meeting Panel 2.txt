welcome everybody so um we are jumping right on to the second session and we have a great lineup for you on improving Social Security program knowledge we will start with a paper by um Katie Carmen uh and colleagues on disparities and Social Security program knowledge and the role of social capital and uh let's go right ahead great uh thank you so much I'm very happy to be here I'm going to share my screen there we go uh so I'm really excited to have this opportunity to talk about um this work that I'm doing with my colleague jacova Williams who was uh previously at random will be starting at American University uh in the fall um I think that uh Dr kajikaze's remarks at the beginning of the day today really fit very nicely with what we're going to talk about she started by saying everyone who is eligible for benefits should receive them and that's exactly what motivated our our work here because disparities in Social Security knowledge can really impact whether or not people who are eligible for benefits are likely to receive or or know about the benefits that they are they're eligible for um in particular Social Capital might help to help people to understand and know about the benefits that they're eligible for uh in times of need there are many places that people can turn for information and support one of them is social security when you can't work because of a disability disability insurance isn't an option if you have minor children and a spouse or partner dies survivor benefits are there spousal benefits are there in retirement even retirement benefits these are all designed uh to protect us in times of need but they can only do this if people know about the programs that are available for them and knowledge of these programs other than retirement benefits are not as strong as knowledge of retirement benefits and this is where Social Capital can come in uh social capital is defined as the network of relationships among people it's an asset that we rely on and it can take many forms it's our family our friends it's the organizations and businesses that we work with um churches groups in our communities doctors our employers it's how we're embedded in society in this work we wanted to know how Social Capital could contribute to knowledge of Social Security and how differences in social capital might lead to differences in knowledge so we're really thinking about a number of different programs retirement benefits are most well known but disability benefits and spousal benefits and survivor benefits are less well known and work that I presented at this conference a few years ago in particular we found that there are really limited information about disability and sorry not disability spousal and survivor benefits work that others have done has found a limit less knowledge about disability benefits we also know that there are disparities in knowledge in ongoing work currently funded um by another rdrc project by Dave Knapp and Francisco Paris Arcee they are finding significant differences in knowledge by race and ethnicity so targeting information to people in need um provides a potential to really help um uh people get the information that they need um but it requires that we know where people are turning for information when they need it and when they're looking for information so This research is really designed to try to get at where are people looking for information um disparities in knowledge could be linked to disparities in Social differences in social capital so in this picture here I have the individual at the center and a number of different places that they could turn for information in times of need friends and family Social Services uh the internet Social Security Administration financial advisors Sometimes some ties may be stronger than others and some ties may not exist at all not every person has a job not every person has a financial advisor most people have uh strong ties to their friends and family that's not surprising and they might have stronger ties to different types of groups um and some places may have better information than others so I've indicated those places that may have better information about Social Security Programs in green and those places that might have less good information um in in blue I included funeral homes as a place with better information because I remember when my father-in-law died they actually handed my mother-in-law a package of information about social security benefits at the time and I thought isn't this wonderful place here is a person who is in need receiving information at the moment uh that they are in need in the place where they are benefits targeted information targeted to people where they are in their time of need different people may have different strengths of ties and different quality of information held by those ties so this person indicated here has strong ties to friends and family strong ties to a financial advisor and strong ties to Social Security and information Social Security Administration so they have strong ties to good information but there might be another person who has very strong ties in their Community to religious organizations and schools and Community organizations but no strong ties to organizations that are providing good information about social security benefits and this can lead to disparities in access to information so as we want to study these disparities there are two ways we could go about this one is to think about what do you know about a particular program and where would you go to learn more about that program the other is to say imagine you have a problem what are you going to do and if we were to take the first approach we would be presuming that people are aware of a program we'd be saying where would you go to learn about social security disability insurance if someone doesn't even know about that program they wouldn't know where to begin instead we are asking imagine that you're having trouble working where are you going to go to find out information this allows us to identify the channels for information provision that people are likely to turn to um even when they aren't knowledgeable about the particular programs that exist and so we're focusing on three key research questions where do people turn for information in times of need does this differ by race and ethnicity and is this associated with perceived knowledge of Social Security Programs we're doing this in a survey that um is being conducted right now in the understanding America study our sample is restricted to individuals under the age of 70 and we over sampled people who are black Hispanic or Asian the survey is also being conducted in Spanish because um understanding disparities is really important and if we were not to conduct this in Spanish we wouldn't have as good of information the survey is actually still in the field so what I'm presenting today really is preliminary work um and it's not currently weighted because we are still collecting data so we asked people about six scenarios we asked them about planning for retirement decisions about claiming Social Security situation where their health has declined and they can't work anymore a situation where they have uh minor children and the spouse has died uh what they would do if they were not yet at retirement age but a spouse or partner instead in a situation where an elderly parent has died and where they would turn in these situations for information um so we can take the answers that they gave in each of these situation scenarios we ask them here's a list of this is 15 organizations that are listed across the bottom of this graph where they might turn for information um and ask which of those would you choose and they could choose yes no or don't know for all of those organizations um so we can um average across all six scenarios and see um what kinds of responses people give so uh some sources of information are likely to be used more than others unsurprisingly friends and family are the places that people turn to most um and I think that that's not unimportant for what the rest of what I'm going to say because friends and family are an important source of information um but as we think about all of these other sources of information strengthening information to any of these other organizations will have indirect impacts through friends and family so if we can improve information that is provided to individuals through local community organizations that will have a direct impact on the small number of people who are going to local community organizations for information but then it will have a follow-on impact uh to the friends and family of those people so in fact one of the reasons that we started this research project was because my co-author jacova told me a story about a friend of hers whose spouse died and didn't know what to do how she was going to care for her young children and she called her church and someone at the church said did you know Social Security provides benefits for surviving children and that's how she found out about this but this all happened through friends and family saying call your church um and so these indirect sources of information can really matter so friends and family come first um I do want to point out that the percentage of people in in the uas who know to talk to the Social Security Administration may be higher than in other sources of data many surveys conducted in the uas are about social security so these people may have greater knowledge of Social Security than than other uh or others in the general population um about a third of people say that they'll turn to religious organizations or medical providers um uh for information and I think this is potentially a opportunity both for individuals these are potentially great places to get information and for for people who are trying to get information out to individuals who need it uh because uh there are a large proportion of people who are turning to these organizations in times of need um there is variation by scenario uh schools are more likely to be used in situations where there's the death of a spouse and minor children present less likely to reach out to a senior center in that situation um Healthcare Providers and employers are more likely to be approached in cases of disability than in other scenarios um and religious organizations are more likely to be a source of information when a family member dies um so next we'll turn to the question of do sources of information differ by race and ethnicity all groups all Races and ethnicities report turning to friends and family as their most common source of information and we find consistent patterns by Race Across the different scenarios um compared to other racial and ethnic groups I'm going to go very slowly here because this is really the like heart of the results the most exciting slide here um non-hispanic white respondents are more likely to turn to the most formal sources of information their employers co-workers and non-financial advisors um oh sorry and financial advisors so these are formal sources of information places where we might expect them to get uh really good information about Social Security Programs uh non-hispanic black respondents are more likely to turn to Social Services religious organizations Community organizations senior centers Medical Care Providers and libraries and I think that this is a potential for real opportunity for targeting information to people in the places where they are uh three minutes yeah that's okay I'm doing great uh these are places where there's mixed information that is likely to be available for people but this is where we are seeing disparities in knowledge and where where I think we could really um go make a difference in providing information to people in need of information in the places where they they actually are uh non-hispanic Asian respondents are more likely to turn to uh employers co-workers Medical Care Providers and the internet and social media um uh that I think is a little worrisome because of course the internet and social media could get you to great information but also to terrible information um so something to be aware of uh Hispanic respondents really fell towards the middle across all of all racial and ethnic groups across all of the different scenarios that we looked at um we use these uh heat maps to look at all of the different groups um and all the different scenarios where darker colors represent um uh more people choosing that source of information um and I have that an exam some examples of this in the paper so you can see that those date in more detail we also did some preliminary analysis looking at the correlation between where people are getting information and knowledge and there does seem to be and it's a correlation between self-assess knowledge and sources of information those with less knowledge are more likely to turn to informal channels of information and sources of information tend to come from pre-existing Social Capital you're not turning to new sources of information you're going to the people you already have relationships with uh so different groups have different needs for information uh to address disparities in knowledge uh and they have different Social Capital to draw on in times of need to best address disparities information campaigns should consider differentiating channels of information uh to better engage disadvantaged groups and think about where people are going in times of need for information uh I'll just very briefly say that we have a really cool thing that we're doing as a Next Step we've also asked some open-ended questions and we're using natural language processing to code those questions to see if there are things that people are doing that we hadn't thought of so stay tuned thank you thank you very much um Katie that was fascinating and I'm sure we're gonna have a lot of conversation on that so next uh let's move right on to our second paper um it's from the role of stock flow reasoning and understanding the Social Security trust fund and that will be presented um by our colleague Stephen Spiller from UCLA Stephen thank you very much um I hope that you can see my screen okay uh so this is work that's led by Megan Weber with Hal hirschfield and Suzanne Shu um and we're grateful for funding from the SSA for this as always this reflects our views and not those of the the SSA um we're looking at the the role of stock flow reasoning and how it relates to perceptions of the trust fund I'm going to start with just a little bit of of a high level overview of the trust fund than stock flow reasoning and then two experiments that we've conducted to help understand how the two relate so benefits are paid from the oasi and Di trust funds these funds are funded through payroll taxes and interest and the balance in a given year is the accumulation of all the previous annual surpluses and and deficits each year the trustees report provides both historical and future projections over the the financial situation of both the trust funds individually as well as a combined oesdi trust fund now typically as part of this report there is a projected depletion date when is the trust fund expected to run out currently that's 2035 and that's widely recorded um in the media our question is what do people think is the effect of trust fund depletion on subsequent Social Security benefits now I want to emphasize we are focused on public perception not the policy impact or the projections themselves so these are two key charts uh from the summary of the trustees report on the left you can see the uh the trust fund ratio which is the asset reserves divided by the program costs over time um and you can see that it peaked around 2010 has been declining and is expected to hit zero around 2034 or 2035. on the right you can see an alternative display of that same basic information here it's displayed in terms of inflows and outflows to the fund as a function of uh I'm sorry as percentage of taxable payroll now both of these charts are telling effectively the same story about the long-term Financial short fund a shortfall of the trust fund however they may tell that story in very different ways leading people to have very different perceptions of what's likely to happen once the trust fund is depleted that's what we're hoping to better understand now under current policy if the trust fund runs out then the projection is that uh the income coming in would be sufficient to pay approximately 80 percent of scheduled benefits however uh many Americans believe that they may get no benefits once the trust fund runs out so these are data from a peer research center survey finding that 42 percent of adults uh uh assess that Social Security will not be able to provide any benefits when it is time for them to retire this suggests that they may be miscalibrated now headlines that we encounter in the news often reinforce these misperceptions so these are a few select examples but you can see terms like running out of money ability to pay social security will be depleted and these May reinforce this notion um or reinforce this misperception that once the trust fund is depleted that benefits will stop and so people may misinterpret and conflate these two ideas this is consistent with a general finding of what are known as stock flow reasoning errors that's been explored in human judgments about Dynamic systems now overall people have a great deal of difficulty understanding accumulation over time uh so here we can see a different presentation of the inflows and outflows into the combined trust fund here the Blue Line represents uh total income coming into the fund the red line total costs and you can see that historically or from mid 90s through 2020 income exceeds cost the projections for the future costs will exceed income if you take that net flow and integrate it over time you get the trust fund reserves you get the balance of the fund so you can see as long as income is greater than cost this Rises once cost is greater than income this Falls the top plot is what we're refer to as a flow chart the bottom as a stock chart you can get to the bottom chart from the top chart but it's difficult calculus is hard and people have difficulty making this conversion and so even in very highly educated samples it's difficult for people to assess when will the stock be at its maximum for example because of this difficulty uh the format of presentation can affect the judgments that people make so from an example from looking at other economic data in this case month over month jobs numbers you can see two different alternative presentations of economic job role numbers on the left you can see the monthly gains or losses and on the right the number of employed people these are both from uh the beginning of the Obama Administration now in both cases these show the same data the Shaded region is 2009 where during which the number of jobs lost was decreasing over time so in the chart on the left we see an increasing Trend let me try on the right a decreasing Trend because one is representing the flow and one of the stock if you give people this chart on the left the flowchart people say the economy improved in 2009. if you give them the chart on the right they say the economy worsened in 2009. and so the difference in the presentation can lead to very different judgments that people Come Away with now these sorts of reasoning areas reasoning errors are widespread so in the literature we see it this uh applies to economic growth covid case counts uh CO2 in the atmosphere and most relevantly for today personal and corporate cash flows and so we hypothesize that these reasoning errors are likely to apply to the Social Security trust fund as well now to test this we conducted two experiments in which we varied the stock versus flow presentation of data about the trust fund and measured expectations about future benefits you can see a few of the sample characteristics below all of our participants saw the same information about these trust funds what we varied was whether the chart displayed the pass and projected balanced or the inflows and outflows and so in one case they're getting that stock chart in one case that flow chart five minutes great thank you in experiment one uh we had approximately a thousand participants and they saw one of these two charts along with a description of the trust fund and how to read the graphs now this description included key dates like when the trust fund was expected to be depleted and when costs exceeded income now in this study we're looking at total income including interest income and looking at the combined trust fund after seeing these charts along with that information we asked uh participants a set of three key questions the first two had to do with those dates that they were given directly that is when do they expect that the trust funds total costs exceed or exceeded or in the future will exceed total income and when the trust fund will run out of money our key question was we also asked what is most likely to happen to Social Security benefits if the trust fund is depleted and so we asked we gave our participants four options uh we'll no longer be able to pay out benefits where they will be able to pay out benefits but a smaller amount the same amount or a larger amount for current purposes I'm going to collapse these latter three points into a general notion of benefits will be paid versus benefits will not be paid but we can break this down further in the paper so what do we find as a reminder we have a thousand participants and they're split between seeing one of these two presentations but otherwise the information that they received was the same they're equally accurate in assessing when costs would exceed income not very accurate but equally accurate across groups they're more accurate in assessing when the trust fund would run out of money however this was particularly so in the stock condition so although they saw this information in both uh in both conditions seeing the balance hit zero in the chart on the left reinforced this date and led to Greater accuracy regarding when the trust fund would expire perhaps uh most importantly when we asked about what would happen to benefits we found uh two main results here the first is that there's a big difference between conditions and so those in the right were presented with the flow uh graph were more likely to report that yes benefits will still continue to be paid even after the trust fund is depleted however it's certainly important to note both of these numbers are quite low and so although we do see a difference between conditions both of these numbers remain low in our second experiment we sought to replicate and extend these results uh so we used a slightly different format of presentation these numbers more closely align with those that we often see reported in the trustees report and reported in the media here rather than using dollar amounts we'll use uh trust fund ratios and percentage of taxable payroll two minutes great we also added uh one additional condition that we refer to as the enhanced flow condition that was inspired by one of the charts presented in the annual report you can see that in the enhanced flow condition in addition to presenting the income and cost over time it also depicts in a bolded line the payable benefits the expenditures showing the shift downward or the projected shift downward when the trust fund is expected to be depleted we anticipate that this might increase uh understanding across these three conditions we actually found no differences in study 2 regarding the years at which these events would happen however we again observe that the flow charts led to a greater expectation that benefits would continue post-trust fund depletion than in the stock condition counter to our expectations we did not see any difference between the enhanced flow condition and the standard float condition however showing flows led to this greater expectation so across both of these experiments presenting that flow information increased the inferences that at least some benefits will be paid post-depletion just to quickly wrap up it seems as though people systematically conflate trust fund balance with ability to pay benefits displaying this as a flow increases the belief that benefits will continue to be paid but we observe a high rate of misunderstanding in both conditions what we're hoping to do next is uh looking to classify media headlines around the time of each Year's trustees report to understand how this is being communicated and consider alternative techniques to further reduce these misperceptions and we think that this really reinforces the notion uh uh as as other research has done about considering the importance of content salience not just the content itself in trust fund Communications so that's it uh thank you very much thank you so much Stephen that was very very insightful and I look forward to discussing that with you um shortly after the next uh talk so our third paper for this afternoon will be um presented by uh Steve Wendell and Martin dilemma and it will be on enhancing trust in Social Security Administration and e-government among people targeted by fraud um so let's get to it great everyone I'm Steve Wendell I'm presenting joint work with emergency Lima and Cliff Rob from the University's of Michigan and Wisconsin respectively as I was just mentioned today we're going to be uh well first of all let me say uh we appreciate the funding from Social Security Administration opinions and ideas here of course our own uh but we respect and very greatly appreciate the support now the problem we're looking at today in particular is imposter scams and what they do to public trust now I'm reasonably sure every one of you has come across a social security imposter scam there's a survey for example done that showed that in three months alone of 2020 nearly half of the American public of adults received at least one social security scam call now these calls were highly Salient many people came across and they're rare but they were remarkably ineffective instead what we see is a much larger larger dollar loss and concern over the digital imposter scams those are things like emails um social social media websites that trick people to provide personal information or directly to provide uh funding now we've seen quite a lot of that in security and government space most recently we're actually seeing a rapid rise in business imposter scams where people create fake websites fake Appeals for Apple Amazon Etc and in fact that is currently the most prevalent uh now again these these come in waves the first wave of government scams you see there is IRS second one is a security now we're seeing um I believe it's about one in three are actually Amazon scams but these will these will come and go uh depending on on the on the evolving techniques of the scammers so we wanted to see first what do we know about effective techniques to counter these types of imposter fraud in particular from the individual perspective not from an Institutional perspective and we find remarkably little uh from a from rigorous research out there there's practical thoughtful tips from the SSA from the AARP Etc when it comes to experimental weapons or for that matter statistical causal evidence we find only a handful of studies out there usually in the broader influence literature a little bit very little on imposter and scans themselves when we look at the relationship of what what these scams do to the public trust we find well they're separated literature we fund of course quite a lot on the erosion of public trust and government uh over the last 25 decades six decades and we have some suspicions and some anecdotes about the uh the role of of such scans and decreasing uh consumer and individual trust but no great and clear empirical evidence and so in our study we wanted to address both of these in particular this is the simplified form of the research question uh research questions you can find in detailed pre-registered hypotheses all public on our GitHub site but I will save you the uh the the full full version I'll just give you the quick version first question does prior fall does prior experience with fraud cause people to distrust government Communications a vital question for Social Security and of course other agencies as they have real Communications with people and their their ability to uh to have those are undercut by a lack of trust and then second can we train people to to discriminate between these and especially can we train them to give proper trust to real Communications now this I should say this is a study that builds on work uh that we did last year that looked in particular at can we help people identify fraudulent email campaigns because of the time I was a particular interest um and we found yes so this is a much broader study and it's including looking at trust the study design is straightforward and it's experimental so after Gathering a set of participants which I'll detail shortly we do background survey we use a number of existing instruments in the field to understand um prior experience with fraud existing trust in the Government testing trust and Social Security in particular et cetera then people are randomly assigned into one of four arms there's an interactive training based on original inoculation theory that I'll show in some detail that gives practical experience with fraud and with real Communications we then extracted the core lessons from that and said maybe it's actually the information and not the the way we're delivering it so the second arm is providing those written tips without any addition National interactivity just to see if the content alone is enough then we understand of course that there may be an attention effect here and effect for that matter we're just focusing people's attention on scams and Trust may affect their behavior so we have a control arm for that and then we have a final null control which is a completely unrelated information but a similar cognitive load and similar time frame and then from this information we look at um after this training we then test them on Communications to see if they can discriminate between them and build a predictive model of susceptibility and the role of of a prior fraud in people's behavior so I mentioned we did a we did a much simpler Study last year this one is much more nuanced and articulated in this case we are looking at um both fraudulent and real Communications and this predictive model we talked about we're doing this for both government and business imposters and we're doing this for both websites and emails we're training people for both and we'll see you'll see we have an analysis in each of these cases so the um the study itself actually I should have said in this beginning is still ongoing um we've run the two largest national representative samples already but we have some remaining research questions that we are answering so in particular um we've done two uh of the national studies uh which I'll be presenting the results on today uh We've launched another study with the Better Business Bureau today uh we had some delays in the timing uh but we are um uh we're on track to complete it in the next few weeks and in that study that is a sample of a thousand people who have themselves reported fraud to the BBB so this is a very unique and special population we want to understand how does their prior experience affect their behavior and then finally we have um uh one one one wrap-up study that's uh that's a two-week delay that we're finishing shortly as well so I mentioned the main um the main intervention is this interactive training let me show you what that looks like um and it is a mocktail email website where people can actually interact with it it can click on the links they can click on the headers to see what the email is about for a website uh oh okay I'll show that a second for a website they can see the URLs they can hover over links they can do all of the things that one can normally do when responding to an email or uh for for checking out an email or a website but in a controlled research environment where none of the links go to any actual scans so uh we yes please go ahead five minutes no problem yeah we're fine so what we do is we first show the communication and we ask them to critically think about it and respond do you think this is real or do you think this is a scam then after they do so then we give the tips in context of their own behavior of what they've done in interacting with it and in the context of where you would actually take action to learn more in that communication so for example here is one for Apple showing that the corporate domain is easily uh verified and it's it's something that scammers have a difficult time getting around now the test itself is quite similar in context um interactive environment where people indicate whether it's real or scam except we don't tell them of course uh in the end we're not we take out the training component this is um this is one on the Social Security Site uh you might notice that is not actually the real Social Security Site uh we actually bought a number of domains for this study to uh replicate some scams so results I'll I'll deal with the first one which is on the training and then we'll go to the um to the analysis of the impact of Prior fraud can we train people Topline answer is yes yes we can uh it's a very nice effect um we see it as as we dig in a bit there's some there's some detail here that's quite interesting so we see an eight percent increase on a 67 Baseline this is the percent of communications correct the Baseline itself I would warn you is um is is an artifact of the study of design it's just a mix of messages that we have but a very nice uh statistically and practically significant impact on top of that now what we find is the training is far more effective at helping people recognize scams than it is at increasing trust it's unfortunate we'd very much hope to increase trust but that's what we're seeing now luckily we are not causing distrust so there is a there is a there is a boost in Trust of real Communications but it's not nearly as powerful as helping people recognize scams we also see that the the written materials do help they are simply not as they are not as effective in their particularly have have no effect for um for recognizing scams such as a slight boost for real messages we look at the communication communication medium we see it's just at least in our studies it's it's a lot easier to um to help people recognize fraudulent emails and trustworthy emails than it is for websites we also very intentionally included letters things that we had not trained people on to see if the training ported over it did not not surprisingly just the type of training that we're giving is very focused on the technical details of what a scammer can do and what they can't um we did a wide variety of sensitivity tests I'll see the details the results hold under under under many different conditions so let's look at the the second set of results on what predicts distrust we look at this in two ways the first one is as I mentioned uh some existing measures existing instruments that invalidate on the field uh it's an 11 question uh instrument on Social Security Administration another one on internet Etc and then we also look at what people actually do in the control group because that is an expressed version revealed version of um of their behavior and Trust we have the results for that first measure we don't yet for the for the second unfortunately as I said it's a work in progress descriptively quite interesting fraud is widespread most people do not report it and most people are not actually reporting that they're losing money so what do we learn from this well most importantly for our study prior experience with fraud does not seem to have a strong relationship we do see some um but it's not across the board and it's not uh robust so and we believe that's because fraud is simply so widespread in the paper you'll see we have many more other detailed findings on um what does seem to drive trust sadly women seem to be less trusting over all this security retirees seem to be less trusting you'll find a lot of that more in the paper the one final comment I wanted to make is that all of this is public every data file the research platform itself how we'd run the study everything is public on our GitHub site and we welcome any comments or questions you might have thank you so much thank you so much Steve uh that was as well very fascinating and now we will go um over some questions and discussion from everybody um to get us started I know there's a few questions in the Q a uh to give you all a chance to look at I know Katie answered many of them if not all so I have a question to start us all um uh about the second paper so uh it's a question for Stephen um so given that the level of misunderstanding um remained High even in the flow condition um what like are there any other sort of uh ideas or insights that you think that might reinforce the more accurate idea that some benefits will still be payable um in spite of the depletion of the trust fund and you know what do you think about that sure so I think that there are sort of two thoughts on this the first is that the um the simple reinforcement of that message directly could be could be quite valuable so um there's a nice uh project by Quinn B and wetstein where they look at um how the same text of the article but with different headlines with that headline either emphasizes that the trust fund will be depleted or that uh benefits will continue that's one sort of simple way of reinforcing it so at one level just reinforcing that message directly would probably be the most um uh one of the most efficient ways we can also think about ways of reinforcing the getting the mental model right in some ways and so you can imagine that if people understand that flows are still flowing into the system even if the balance is at zero then flows can also flow out of the system and so we some of the plans for what to look at next well how can we encourage people to remember that flows are flowing into this system it seems unlikely that people think that their payroll taxes will suddenly disappear once the trust fund is depleted and so we are interested in looking at if we reinforce the message about what might happen to the taxes that they're paying into the system that may help to click the mental model of what will happen with those benefits flowing out of the system as well that's that's a conjecture at this point but it's some of the next steps that we're hoping to take a look at great thank you so much and right now I'm looking at the Q a as well um so I have a question for um KTU already answered this but I just like to give you another chance to um discuss it more elaboration live um Katie so the question from Denise Hoffman says to what extent might your results be affected by SSA field offices being closed during the pandemic for about two years and could there still be a lasting effect from those closures and maybe to elaborate on that that what do you think you know about online services versus in-person um for for uh beneficiaries sure I think that that's a really important question and and one of the things that we really wanted to do in the way that we designed our survey was to step away from what people know about social security benefits specifically and that's why we asked our questions um about what would you do in these scenarios because we didn't want it to be so tied to what people to Social Security and so the fact that Social Security offices were closed um I don't think it really affects our results so much because we asked these questions in a very hypothetical way um so you know we talked to we it surveyed almost 3 000 people those people did not have health problems that limited their ability to work we just asked them what they would do if that happened um and so that that the fact that they couldn't go to a social security field office during the last two years probably didn't impact their their thoughts about what they would do in that situation um but I do think that these could have lasting impacts on people's knowledge um and and I think that for some of the other work that's going on right now about people's knowledge of Social Security I think that that that is potentially important but less important for this specific survey results that we were we were talking about even our knowledge questions are very general have you heard of this program how knowledgeable are you um and that doesn't necessarily rely on people being able to access the field office most people won't go unless they actually have the problem I think yeah thank you so much Katie I mean as you said this is all novel uh stuff happening and thanks to research like the one you guys are doing we're finding out I mean I suppose it's possible that people that can't go to office will turn online and um hopefully find good information possibly not so hopefully they can identify when they're at the correct website and not enough not a fraudulent website exactly but we'll have to keep uh studying that now uh finally we've got a bunch of questions now in the Q a um so I'd like to give our panelists a chance to sort of pick uh any of the questions that you'd like to address um so I'll give you a minute I'll hop in quickly and please one aspect that came up in in two separate questions was about the role um uh differences among uh ages of different respondents regarding understanding the benefits and the role of these two different forms of reasoning about it and what we find with with age is that our older respondents were more likely to believe that benefits would continue and so there does seem to be a notion where if it's more um uh one conjecture would be if it's more self-relevant more likely to be engaged in the information environment and better calibrated on what's likely to happen however the difference between conditions whether it's seen as a balance or seen as a flow was very consistent both among younger and older respondents so that didn't seem to differ but there was just a level shift in terms of uh beliefs about benefits for different ages okay great thank you and uh we just got another question for um Steve Wendell um have you run across any estimates and the question disappeared sorry that's because I was just answering that you're answering it okay yes I can answer it verbally no problem uh so the question was on um on the magnitude of losses and there's another question I can answer as well uh yes so the Better Business Bureau gathers this as part of their scam tracker I mean we are linking that in as I said we just launched that that arm of the study and we are also Gathering that as part of our study as part of our national representative sample we see some initial uh very promising results on the relationship between the magnitude of loss and um and people's trust and other and for that matter other demographics of the person but that that's that part is still ongoing so I didn't go into detail today thank you Steve thank you um and uh any of the other panelists would like to answer any of the questions that are in the Q a please I think live will give you a little more chance to elaborate this is this is Marty I wasn't sure if that question was in response to our study or in general so uh the best estimates that are out there um for reported fraud it's usually a thousand dollars is the median loss of course this varies many I've spoken to victims who've lost over a million dollars over time in in various scams um but then there are many people probably the majority of people who lose under 100 but they don't go through the effort of reporting it so our lost figures are really skewed but it can range from as little as 20 bucks to multi-millions of dollars right and one of the things that we can analyze is looking at the difference between those who report in BBB as versus those who were generally um don't report but do still have losses so we can look at the skew of that um there was one quick question about Marty on crypto I don't think you have anything on crypto fraud loss in particular dude um no but that's probably gonna be the new kind of Minefield of fraud it's moving from gift card into crypto great so also uh we have a question from Kathleen Mullen for Steve uh and Marty um so it seems like low trust isn't necessarily a problem uh the question asks uh right if there is lots of scams that we don't want people to be delivered scams don't we want people to be diligent and be able to discern the right Source sort of regardless of their trusts right I'll take that one Marty so yeah the challenge is it's relatively easy to make people distrustful but that would destroy the relationship between citizens and the government and so the challenge is how to make people discriminate between to properly trust true Communications and so thankfully we are seeing a small boost in true trust as well as seeing a significant boost in um identifying scams so uh no actually distrust is is highly relevant um for this for the study and and for the functioning of our democracy right and to elaborate on that I just want to also add um so SSA has been very proactive in um and sort of outing those uh you know those fraudulent activities if you look at ssa.gov and um you know other communication channels by letting the American public aware that SSA is you know not doing these calls and asking them these questions have you found any evidence sort of of that being helpful for people that were the actual agency whether it's SSA or otherwise is more more proactive in speaking out about those other fraudulent entities is a wonderful question and one that we unfortunately haven't covered in this study but Marty is really the expert here would you know of other yeah we've done some research that does show that having Advanced knowledge of fraud of specific types of scams does seem to protect people we call it the forewarned is forearmed um uh phenomenon and so yeah I do think that it's helpful but there's been no kind of rigorous test in consumer education and awareness okay thank you well hopefully there will be um can I answer one of the other questions so there's a question from chi chong Fang about um um distinguishing between different um groups based on where they were born uh looking at non-hispanic Asians in our population and I think that this is a really important question um it's something that we've been working on and some of the other work that I'm doing uh on other topics trying to distinguish between knowledge and information and beliefs um in different uh immigrant populations based on the country of origin um and unfortunately most of the surveys that are available to be used for this kind of research don't have enough Asian people in them for us to be able to do any analysis that distinguishes based on the country of origin um and and I I just wanted to highlight that as an important question I think the same could be said for trying to look at um Hispanic populations although there are that that group is much larger um but if you really want to try to distinguish between where people are from whether they're first generation or not first generation um it becomes much harder and the sample sizes that we can get just just aren't sufficient to really do that kind of analysis um so I guess that's slightly a plug for more money um and and slightly a plug for just um you know thinking thinking about these issues more um in the future foreign thank you so much Katie um so I I will ask another question um but in the meantime I'd like to invite everybody all our attendees to please submit any questions you have in the Q a we still have a few more minutes so we've got plenty of time to discuss in the meantime I'd like to ask um uh Steven Spiller so not to underestimate the importance of uh of uh misunderstanding but um notice that you're the in your study the proportion of people who believe benefits will stop entirely is um is is quite high and perhaps quite like for example higher than the results that you showed from Pew do you have any sort of uh Insight of why that might be sure so I think there are a few factors there um the first is that we were looking at uh we did have a convenient sample and so uh the I put more faith in the condition differences than the absolute level uh in in part because of that however a few important differences in the Pew they're looking at when retirees what they expected would be the case when they themselves would retire whereas we're looking at when the trust fund was depleted so for the older individuals in their samples there would still be a balance in the trust fund and so uh the nature of that question may contribute to what appears to be our elevated levels as well um we also made you know the the discussion and the focus on the trust fund likely made it a little bit more top of mind um and and accessible to our respondents uh in a way that may have focused them more on uh the potential financial situation than those in the in the Pew survey that's conjecture but um I think that those are the pieces that may be contributing to those apparently elevated levels great um thank you Stephen and also in the meantime I just wanted to relay a comment from my colleague David rogowsky So in terms of at least the uis we know that USC is currently increasing the sample sizes in the US for minorities such as African-Americans Hispanics and Asians so that um that should really help our um our future studies on that panel and hopefully other data sources will do the same thanks David um so please again please shoot down your questions uh on the Q a so that we can discuss them let me go through what is there so far and in the meantime please any of the panels if you see any question that you'd like to address even if it was asked to somebody else please go ahead I see Marty go ahead yeah this question is for uh Dr Carmen so you looked at differences in sources of information by race and ethnicity but I was wondering if maybe some of those race differences are actually driven by income differences just given that some you know lower income individuals might be more knowledgeable of these means tested programs and so might go more directly to the source to to apply um in some of our analysis in our preliminary analysis that where I just said in preliminary analysis we did something we did control for for income but um that didn't really seem to change the the differences in in terms of race and ethnicity I think it's a good point but I think that these cultural differences in terms of of where people's Social Capital lies are are much bigger than just just income thank you it's a great question thank you both thank you very much um I think I think we're running out of questions which is actually a good thing and uh that gives us a chance if we end early to give back some of the time we took from the previous break and I'm sure you folks have uh need some more time to eat to eat lunch so with that I'd like to thank our panelists this has been a very insightful um uh set of papers on a very important subject of Social Security program knowledge and fraud and ways of improving communication and improving that knowledge thank you again and we'll take a break
