I'm not exactly sure how to start off I'm I'm not even sure what I'm doing here um the way this worked is nber called me up and said we have this conference on Market design we want you to come and I said Mark Miller is a very common name pretty sure he got the wrong person well no that was the first part and the second part was well no it's you and I said but I don't understand anything you people do and they said we still want you to come and I said I don't want to come I know so you know I'm going to do what I think I'm supposed to do here which I think is to give you a policy kind of angle on things but it will be very different I understood about 30 of what Ben said you know things like Medicare Part B or C and D that kind of thing I understood that then he would say all these other things I didn't understand any of that but let me try and tell you who I am where I sit in the environment and then some observations on this kind of work I think and how it's played out in the policy environment so I'll try and do that hopefully you get something constructive out of this if you don't I want you to be clear to blame the nber people in the end I really didn't want to be here so just oh cool no I am not going to do that I want it okay all right so in terms of a career like why you might want to listen to me I'm not a p I'm not a PhD Economist um I have managed some PhD Economist operations I ran the cbo's research uh uh operation on their social science research which is all uh PhD economists I worked at the urban Institute for years and did kind of you know quantitative policy oriented research um uh but you know very much policy uh kind of uh oriented found myself more and more kind of talking to the hill about ideas and then eventually kind of left the urban Institute and I went to places like the uh Office of Management and budget the Congressional budget office something that's called the medicare payment advisory commission the way to think about that is this kind of congress's think tank on Medicare kind of data analysis policy ideas and then uh recommendations um to the Congress um I have been involved in like major pieces of legislation the balanced budget act years ago just in case anybody in the room has forgotten there was actually Surplus momentarily after that uh not So Much Anymore also at the uh you know the birth of the part D benefit the recent most recent reform 2010 to the Managed Care part C uh you know Medicare managed care plans uh surprise billing more recently those kinds of things and the thread that I want to get in your mind the kind of person I'm in has been about trying to identify unnecessary spending and and particularly in in the Medicare program so my people are like the OMB people the CBO the committee for responsible budget you know those kinds of people that would be my try I don't know you're a try okay Paul with all respect um so the the next thing I guess I would show you is what I'm doing now and I think the value of putting this across to you is also give you a sense of how I think about health care and the issue that I'm uh the way I'm pursuing uh these issues but also when I get down to the bottom trash here of these boxes this is where my portfolios are and if there are ideas that you think apply here you know you might want to talk to me um or you might not after this talk I I would completely understand so uh Arnold Ventures I I was at uh medpack for 15 years about five years ago I went to Arnold Ventures Arnold Ventures is a philanthropy notwithstanding the name which doesn't sound like that it is a philanthropy what we do is hammerage money that's all all we do I funny I I find research I develop policy I I work with some people out outside of the organization to develop policy but I do a lot of that you know with my own crew and then we engage in a lot of technical assistance to the hill but we also work at both the federal and the state level and so you know kind of develop evidence develop a policy try and influence the policy process so we're looking for policy impacts for the most part but also there's a couple of Market disruption plays that we've been involved in if anybody wants to talk about that we can do that on a question so that's most of that slide and then down at the bottom I just want you to understand the way I've kind of organized uh and I will say one other thing I don't think philanthropies think about the notion of saving money much a lot of philanthropies are about coverage quality puppies happy stuff and of course we're kind of like they're we're spending too much there are areas in which we are clearly spending too much if you you want to do these other things pay for expensive drugs maybe you don't want to do a lot of this nonsense that that kind of thing okay so the way I've organized my portfolio and on the left two boxes I think of this is kind of price oriented in the right two boxes is utilization oriented to be clear if there's overlaps that don't get too hung up on that division but you know I am of the firm belief that the biggest problem in the commercial sector right now is not utilization where we look a lot like other countries it's price it's what we pay per unit whether it's drugs hospitals Physicians you name it we pay a lot for it I think well I'll get into that the second box is drugs and we think of the entire perspective the patenting process the FDA approval process the Middle Market the pbms coverage payment you know everything from beginning to end third uh provider payment incentives this is things like accountable care organizations Global budgets putting Primary Care in more of a capitative situation a PM PM basis instead of a service by service type thing and then Medicare sustainability spent a lot of years on Medicare so I have a portfolio where I'm just trying to help the Congress think through a whole range of issues on Medicare everyone you mentioned a whole range of issues on Medicare and the whole notion is just to try and have it survive for the younger people and uh both the audience here today and then finally the last block is there's 12 million people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid these two programs work in conflict with one another these are often the sickest poorest least educated uh you know people in our population so we're trying to think about bringing a greater degree of integration to that setting and I really wish I had some great econometric and Economist type terms to describe all of that but I don't have any but that's my uh agenda and if you you guys have any interest or things that you can bring to this I'd be happy to listen to them but really sort of how can I contribute to this particular conference and let me say um a couple things uh here one thing that I think goes on as a matter of almost religion is is that a lot of people in in uh Ben I got close to to making this point is this assumption that when you go to a market-based uh result or a market-based system like you don't need the government The Government Can like just kind of walk away from the situation that's a pretty naive point of view and I hope that it doesn't kind of land in this room as as a surprise but I have to tell you out there you know when you're dealing with people in the commercial sector government is stupid you know they mess everything up you do this then they can they can be gone and I just want to be clear there is still tremendous amounts of work to make these types of things uh operate I mean there's just notice and comment the government can't do things in an arbitrary and a capricious way you have to educate beneficiaries you have to educate providers you have to run the auction say in a durable medical equipment circumstance and we're talking about multiple markets multiple products fraud is always present there's always this sense of like these kinds of things can remove fraud and I genuinely believe that uh if done consciously and carefully but think about the Managed Care situation about 50 percent of the Medicare population is now in private plans and of course one of the uh you know arguments throughout the development of that and the growth in that was oh well they'll manage care plans will you know Stamp Out provider fraud and that may be what happened but these insurers are engaged in fraud now and are abusing the system through upcoding and some of their gaming on the uh quality scores that they get so there is to my mind still a high level of government effort to kind of manage the process I don't I don't think it disappears but I do think there are benefits I do think like for example you can have a dampening effect on fraud and you could reach a better market clearing price for a lack of a better word but it's not magic it has to be built and kind of built consciously we catch up with my notes here um okay the other thing I want people to know and again I don't think people in this room would be this naive but um the industries in question they are not interested in competition just to be clear so yeah so you will be imposing your ideas on them they will not be welcome and it's I I think it is still a very useful I cannot tell you how many rooms I've been in with the Managed Care industry with the lab industry with durable medical equipment you name it in behind closed doors which is do not do this we have no interest in this and what I think is really important about it and you may not like this particular point is this can often be used as a leverage point so many years ago I had through medpack I had a drive going on a hill on lab uh you know uh bidding bidding for Lab Services basically and inexplicably it caught and it had momentum enough momentum that the industry was genuinely threatened that this was going to go through and the industry offered and I've forgotten another the number it's either Seven Points or nine points off of their payment rate not to do the competition and that's the deal the Congress ended up taking now to my point of view I'm not entirely stupid I understand if somebody gives you seven points there was 15 that were really there I did it but I got seven points and you know I would uh kind of chalk that up to a win for the taxpayer but of course there was probably more I'm I'm sure there was more to get so the other thing I I would say is it's like be aware there will be fierce um you know opposition to these types of things but what's really great about trying to pursue these kinds of not uh models is it is very hard to argue against competition and particularly when you claim you're an entrepreneur in your private and government is stupid that when somebody like me comes along goes well what about let's go to competitive bidding you have to be pretty fancy about how you oppose it and generally you attack the details and you attack the process and that has happened in uh other circumstances okay um industry will oppose okay the next thing how am I doing yeah we're good uh God this will be over shortly so if you're having a bad time we're getting close okay it's almost over because I'm having a bad time I don't know about arguments um okay here's the next thing I think that you I I would you know respectfully ask of you be careful how your voice is used and you know the industry sometimes can co-op people and this is the example I'm thinking of so during the durable medical equipment debate there's there's actually yeah the two points I want to make here uh and let me reverse it I'm sorry so the first one is think about and Ben touched on this and I appreciate it when you design your perfect model to think of and I don't know how to express this to you a more relaxed version or what you could step back from and get a lot of what you're trying to do but maybe not all of it because of and I I'm picking up on this term and I'm going to use it now because of the political economy picked up today and I'm going to talk about myself that way in the in the future I'm all about the political economy the um I for example I was brokering some conversations when that was going on between the administration the industry and the scores because scores were kind of thinking about how did the model work from a truly economic point of view and if you relaxed it how much would you lose that kind of thing and I wasn't driving things I was mostly sort of viewed as a neutral person where people could come together and talk and I could kind of ask questions to get them to talk and one of the points of conflict was that you know the economists were kind of arguing you had to do this pure market clearing thing and I'm going to say a thing that is about your work so I apologize for what's about to happen you know bid one you get a third of the market bid two you get two thirds of the market bid three you get all of the market that's your clearing point and you're done but of course CMS by law has to deliver wheelchairs in Cleveland and if one of those people walks away like they by law have to fill that Gap and so CMS the agency that was administering was saying I need some ability to go to a higher price to bring the next person in because I can't have no service in that area and of course other people were saying it's a binding bid you know you you could have a bond and even that was a huge political fight because if you put a bond on then little people get kicked out of the situation which I'm going to come to in just a second and so there was this real tension of like perfect versus but what do I do if suddenly my third you know provider walks up on me that that kind of thing of course you can chase them through the courts but meanwhile somebody doesn't have their uh wheelchair so you have that and then what happened is the industry got a bunch of economists to sign a letter that says there's only one way to do this and you have to do it this way and it almost killed the proposal and I thought it was very interesting because I was pretty sure everybody on the letter wanted it to happen and it was just I I felt and maybe there's something else behind the scenes that I didn't understand but I felt like in some ways they were being used by the industry to kill it as it turned out it didn't work it did uh go through I think the last thing I'm going to say and uh coming in we're in the last five minutes so uh I won't take all the time I'll get off but the other thing I want to really track too is something that Ben said at the end as you think about this and again you the way you think about I don't fully understand so this comment may not land exactly right so so for example when Ben was talking about how you think about cost sharing in the part C or the part D you know area is it you know really about Innovation or is it about selection those kinds of things we deal with those issues all the time but the larger issue in the background when I think about the work that you're trying to do is this there is Extreme levels of concentration in the healthcare Market maybe throughout the economy but I don't know anything about that but ensure consolidation provider consolidation private equities buying up Physician Services how in a situation like that do you enter and have like robust competition and the second question is does that competition drive you to higher degrees of concentration and again I'm kind back to the DME as an example although you could pick other examples if you're worried about fraud or somebody dropping out you run an intense front end what your experience what your financial status can you put up a bond that type of thing you're already disqualifying people from uh from the process and like do you end up with big concentrated actors and it's like in managed care I think the top three you know plans are something like 60 70 percent of enrollment headed to more of it and so I I would worry a lot about that if I were your kinds of Market design uh people and with that I want to apologize for anything that I said and in fact everything I said and uh turn it over
