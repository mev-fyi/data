well thank you so much for the invitation um really appreciate it um so this um paper is titled credit Market equivalence in relation of private firms and it's joint work with Luca Schmidt and Roberto steri who are also in the audience in the back and um well our setting here are leveraged buyouts so as we all know in The Leverage buyout a company is taken private with substantial uh with substantial amount of forward capital most notably from The Leverage loan market with the objective of a later resale of the lengthy period of restructuring we also know that leverage buyouts have become increasingly popular for long-term investors such as endowments and Pension funds so to kind of like give a number here when we look at the commercial data provider frequent they basically reported that private Equity as under management are currently um accountably up of roughly 5 trillion and expected to double by the end of 2025. so plausibly the growth of private Equity has been fueled by favorable credit conditions uh in low interest rate environments and um this is kind of like also what's been talked about lately a lot in the news and you kind of see this here in these two graphs so on the left in blue you see the number of lbos and on the right and blue you see the volume of lbos and you can sell like see that that recently increased with a decline in the average loan spread to maturity which is depicted here in Orange so this is a measure of the average credit spread in loan markets so given the the popularity of um of these Investments among investors the um the variation of performance of lbos is an important question in Asset Management the problem uh from an essay pricing perspective of private firms is that they are private so we can't really observe a lot of real-time Market valuations between the time they're bought and the time they're exited we have cash flows we have some valuations but most of them are self-reported so again this is a problem from a performance measurement um and and benchmarking perspective since we can't really learn from prices about these companies our starting point here is to look at or basically that a lot of these companies actually have a lot of Leverage as I pointed out earlier we we focus here on language buyout funds and our idea is to make use of the simple observation that we surprisingly often have Market valuations on the debt side of these companies so when a large company is taken private by a private Equity Firm and it had corporate bonds traded once it was um uh public if we're still corporate bonds traded once it's private and then for a lot of other of these companies we actually have um Loan Data some transaction data on loans but also quotes of dealers in the secondary market so this gives us some sort of Market signal about how the market evaluates some of some of the claims to these companies so in this um and and in this sense we can ask the question can we learn about the valuation of private Equity from prices that we observe in debt markets so we basically um make this assumption all the time we apply the merth model so mud tells us that that prices and and Equity prices are options written on the on the same asset so especially in a practical formulation Leland shows that that prices depend on the distance of the asset value to the default boundary so if you think about um um if in other words if the debt price is low that means the asset value is closer to the default boundary asset values are low well if asset values are low that also means that that price is out that the equity values are low so in other words um what this Insight tells us here from Leyland is that debt prices can be informative about Equity values and well what are we looking at we are looking at leverage buyout funds or leverage buyouts so we are looking at companies that have leverage ratios of let's say 70 to 80 percent so obviously here credit risk matters so given Leland's Insight um we now going to take that and we're going to use standard tools of modern empirical asset pricing to um to learn about the valuation of equity from that market crisis so what we do is we we estimate uh an empirical lady affect them all from that market data so if you think about the Euler equation one equals EMR we try to come up with an M A stochastic discount factor for Equity from that well and um we observe cash flows so we can basically do valuations and that's where you by by using the discount factor and that's what we call the credit Market equivalent valuation to private firms or something that we label the CME and you'll soon see why we're going to call this the the CME so to briefly give you a snapshot of the data that we're using we are using data from from two private Equity um sources one is a proprietary data set from a large Institutional Investor where we have deal level information as well as fund level of information so we actually observed the underlying Holdings of these funds and then we have data from frequent where we have font level information where we see the cash flows coming in and out of funds so given that we have a proprietary data set where we see the underlying Holdings we can match those deals to loans that are traded in the secondary Market from the database LPC and after merging that data we actually find that 80 of our sample funds have traded loans in the secondary Market ultimately we complement that data with various other databases such as Trace always Capital IQ we look at a pitch book and and several others so it turns out that we were not the first to figure out that or to notice that coming up with an SDF to evaluate private Equity is not in Easy undergoing there's been others before us that looked at this problem so we have Kaplan choir who came up um with something they call the public market equivalent or the pme which is based on an SDF of an investor who is entirely invested in the stock market and then after relaxing a little bit the syringe assumptions here quarter Wick and Nagel um proposed the generalized Public Market equivalent or the GP mean which is based on an SDF of an investor who's entirely invested in the stock market and a risk-free asset and then after relaxing a little bit the three um so like which is kind of like in line with an SDF post by gupt and finium book also add additional risk factors to that ultimately the the the general wisdom that we have from these measures that I used in the literature is that buyout funds outperform um uh on average so and and so far we can certainly say that that these measures are widely used and it's it's definitely a good strategy nevertheless we propose to do something slightly different we propose a language based down so we propose to extract information on on um prices of credit instruments to come up with such a statistic stochastic discount factors such uh such as SDS so and to do that we as I said we have data on loans from LPC which which we match to roughly 500 companies that are held by roughly 100 private Equity Funds as said 80 of our sample and what we'd ultimately do is we use that data to replace stock uh Returns on stock market on the stock market portfolio that you will find in the SDF of Kaplan chuar and um quarterback and Nagel with a return of um of a number J of credit Market instruments so ultimately I'm going to show you in a couple of slides that this number is going to be five so JX is going to be five in our setting and well how does that SCF look like well it takes this form here and uh what it helps to answer is the it helps to answer the question are private firm's Equity consistently priced with their debt or would investing in private Equity improve the risk return relation of investor already invested in these in these private firms but through their debt side and of course this approach makes sense if that and Equity markets are entirely segmented and if the SDF is basically relevance performance Benchmark if private Equity investors also have credit exposure so now the natural question would be who invests in credit so what's the credit exposure of a critical lbo investor well luckily for our proprietary data set um which is basically an investor that runs a large fund of fund we also observe the overall allocation so besides them investing primarily in buyout they also invest heavily in Venture Capital as you can see by these pie shots um and also in private debt funds so on the left you see the the Investments sorted by the uh or sorry split up by the number of Investments on the right you see their Investments split up by the size of Investments you can see that even when we do the split by the size we see even a larger allocation um to private debt funds so I also want to mention that for all these fragrant funds that we have we're able to match that data to a pitch book where we see the allocation of the investors in these buyout funds that we're looking at and we actually find that these investors that invest in our prequent funds are also invested um in property equities in that instrument as well as in private equity to give a more like General view of the market we look at a recent report by the IMF where we know that roughly we are looking at 4 trillion dollars invested in the overall um on the global average loan market so important here is the takeaway that investors that invest in private Equity also all investors that directly invest in the leveraged loan markets such as financial institution Pension funds insurance companies but also indirectly through Clos and as you can see on the right um through private debt funds so as you see here these are public pensions foundations uh endowments insurers all invested um heavily in in private debt funds so the takeaway here would be that benchmarking against credit uh factors make sense since the underlying portfolios are achievable by a private Equity investor well sort of like after after having established that fact there might also be comparative advantage of using private debt as opposed to public Equity here so why is that what are the differences between public and private um uh um equity oh sorry private private debt here it would be um liquidity under diversification we have differences in clientele we have differences in how informed investors are and we have differences how active and passive Investments are in private markets compared to public markets okay so these might all be factors why we might not want to Benchmark private Equity performance against that of public equity well to use um information or to to use information this information to come up with the valuation of private Equity um by by extracting information from from that markets we first of all need to understand what drives that prices so we do the same exercise that we do uh with stock returns Resort returns into portfolio based on some characteristics and then we like to see that these characteristics reflect some the cross-sectional variation with respect or that there is some cross-section variation basically with respect to these characteristics in loan markets so we do quintile portfolios well and if there's cross-sectional variation in in loan returns we'd like to state that this cross-section variation reflects um some differential exposures to risk factors and their pricing so the question is what factors if any can explain these return differentials so we basically enter the the the factor Zoo here and then we use high minus low quintile portfolio stored its own characteristics here as candidate factors and follow with our standard two-stage regression approach where we run time series regressions of portfolio Returns on factors to get our exposures um and then we check whether the average portfolio returns line up with these exposures in the cross-sectional regression to get our risk prices so and this is where our little machine learning exercise also comes into play that helps us to identify um the relevant factors so what do we find we find um that five factors rise the cross-section of loan returns well what are these factors it's um momentum positive risk price is volatility positive risk price it's price this is the high minus low price portfolio which is the current price minus the power value so you can think of this as the market to book portfolio which is the opposite to book two of book to market the book to Market comes in with the Positive first Price Market to book comes in with a negative risk price MV market capitalization is priced negatively and the bid ask spread so uh we have the bit aspect so liquidity is priced positively so ultimately the takeaway here is that results from the second stage regression suggests the five Factor model for debt returns which is somewhat uh which is based on portfolios of characteristics that are somewhat similar to what we see in stock markets so ultimately what we do is we line up our average cross-sectional returns with our predicted average returns and we're hoping for a 45 degree line I would say somewhat 45 degrees and the cross-sectional Alpha is small so the takeaway would be that the five Factor model seems to do a good job in pricing our quintile portfolios so what about the M I started talking about DM so DM is exactly what I argued earlier depends on these um factors with a significant risk price and we use that STM to price our private Equity cash flow given that I was making that argument that private and um and uh and that markets product in that markets are not entirely segmented and that those private Equity investors have exposures and credit so one hour results so these are our results we do valuations based on our data set in frequent and our proprietary data set and what we find is we basically we do variations using the standard measures that are proposed by the literature which are the gpme and the pme we find that the gpme and the pme comes in with uh High over performance so buyout funds over perform if you if you use sdfs based on an investor that's entirely invested in the stock market and a risk-free asset now we look at what happens um with the valuation by using um our evaluation approach to CME and we actually find a slight negative Performance Based on the frequent data and pretty much a price of zero based on on our data so the takeaway would be that the CME seems to absorb the gpme and the PM is over performance in in buyout so now why is that we kind of do a couple sample splits to get a better idea of what's going on here so we split down the sample in the middle for funds below median and leverage and funds above median leverage and we see based on our CME that funds below median average have a slight over performance whereas fonts um above median average have a slight underperformance so this kind of like suggests that buyout managers do not appear to successfully Arbitrage that market against Equity markets when that is cheap and this is kind of like the takeaway also when we split the sample based on boom and bust periods we can see that basically on the CME we have a strong negative performance both in our sample and in frequent in the pre-financial times 2004 to 2007 which are labeled the heydays of buyout uh and again the idea is these guys lever up when interest rates are in good credit conditions um most of the stuff is our loans are floating rate instruments interest rates increase um in a recession obviously it's also going to be more difficult to to repay um due to lack of resources and we actually pick up that effect um by showing negative uh or underperformance based on the CME so we also did add additional factors to our SDF we include um on the the the the public market as an additional factor and we estimate something that we label the CME the credit Equity Market equivalent we still see under uh we still see we see we see slight over performance here um nevertheless much lesser than what we would see based on the gpme so which is kind of expected I mean we add the market but we didn't we and and obviously control for our credit factors so we don't find over performance um as high as we would find based on the gpme measure um so last but not least since I'm getting close to running out of time um we also test our approach um on a sample of public companies where we actually observe returns okay so we look at a sample of companies that have similar characteristics to our private companies and that have traded loans in the secondary Market as well so we run the State of the State of the five Factor model along the line of former French and hooks you I'm saying and ultimately add our credit um uh our loan factors to that model and what we see is that the adjusted R square jumps from 0.6 to 0.7 after including uh our credit factors so this kind of suggests that it might be a good idea to um to include credit um factors or control for credit risk also in public companies that have somewhat similar characteristics what we see in private markets meaning that have high leverage and also loans trade in the secondary market and also gives us this also gives us some sort of like external uh validity here I'm out of time so let me conclude um we asked two questions the first question is can we learn about the valuation of private Equity from prices and debt markets and the answer was um our answer is yes private equity and leverage loan investors actually may have more in common than private equity and public Equity investors the second question was can we use the credit Market equivalent valuation to Value private firms and the answer here again would be yes because accounting for credit Mark exposure actually helps understanding private equity valuations I think I'm out of time so thank you that's it
