we're basically trying to answer the key question how much of this economic collapse that we have seen was actually driven from policy that is the states and counties and cities saying you cannot leave your house you cannot go to these businesses as opposed to how much was coming from just people being afraid and choosing to do it on their own and the basic problem in the economic sense is that if the disease spreading everywhere is both causing them to institute these policies and scaring people then if you don't take into account how afraid people are it's gonna make it seem like the policy is doing a lot more than it's actually doing and so our basic approach is to try to compare consumer visits into two businesses in neighborhoods that are right next to each other they're in the same metro areas during the same week but they're across a state border where the policy differs so try to just isolate what was the impact of the policy separate from how afraid people were in that week and the basic finding that that i'm going to show you is it doesn't look like the policy was that important of a driver mostly it seems like the thing that's been driving the economy into the ground is that people are afraid um now there has been a real explosion of work about the economics of covid and there are many papers in the nbr working papers and and other places that that we've read and you should look at our setting is we got weekly consumer visit data from a company called safe graph that that has the phone locations of millions of people so we've got over two million different businesses spanning a hundred and ten different industries we drop non-profits we drop any industries where consumer visits are not really a measure of economic activity like a manufacturing plant you know that sort of thing and from january through late may we can observe how many consumers show up at that business and you see that it collapses and i'm going to show you a graph of that in a second and we're going to match these individual businesses and how many consumers visited them to county level policy information about did they have shelter in place orders did they have essential business restrictions shutdowns of bars and restaurants and things like that side note we collected all of this at the county level where a lot of people are just using state level information and we do show in the paper it does matter to get the county level information because in a lot of the biggest counties of the country and in the places where they were the hardest hit the counties changed the policy even sometimes even weeks before the state did um but basically we're gonna have policy variation in five more than 500 counties that span in the same metro area some difference in policy and there's two kinds of of experiments if you want to think of them that way some of them are across time like here in illinois if you're in waukegan illinois we have a shelter in place order in illinois the week before the shelter in place order goes into effect in wisconsin so across the border in kenosha there's one week where there's a difference then there are others where the state never has a mandatory shelter in place order so if you go to the quad cities region uh in in illinois davenport and the iowa towns never have a shelter in place order where on the other side of that metro area in illinois they do and so we're going to take the 508 counties where that's true and we're just basically going to compare what happens now this graph is to show you there is a collapse this is in log terms so it's not exactly in percent but there is a collapse in consumer visits to stores in exactly the period that others have shown there's a giant increase in unemployment there's a huge decrease in credit card data and when people spending the consumer visits track that very closely and so from the from january from the outset of march uh to the trough week which is the week of of april the 12th total visits dropped by something like 60 so it's it's an astronomical decrease like nothing we've ever seen if you break it out by industries almost all industries these are the these are the worst 15 and the best 15 in our data theaters skiing facilities botanic gardens motion picture theaters these these things are dropping from peak to trough 90 in terms of visits per day the best performing industries they don't perform that well you know here if you look at the at the fifth best performing industry going to the vet it's still down 40 percent in terms of visits uh but the the right thing to do like we say is to have a comparison to something okay so if you kind of uh if you kind of cover up the bottom line and you look at this map of quad cities illinois and iowa you see the mississippi river is right there you got davenport and bettendorf iowa on one side you got rock island moline east moline illinois on the other side and they put a shelter in place order in illinois and they don't have one in iowa and so if you just go and do the conventional thing of say well how much were visits to beauty salons down in illinois the answer is visits to beauty salons were down 76 from january to the worst week in the sample and so you might be you might be tempted to say oh look what the policy did to visits to beauty salons but our our argument insight from the data is but wait a second don't you need to compare to a place in the same week in the same area that had the same level of fear but didn't have the policy like on the iowa side and it turns out visits to beauty salons went down almost 70 percent in a place where there was no policy so the impact of just the policy our argument is the difference between those two it's not the objective 76 percent that you see there that's the idea of what our statistics do and essentially if you just go through our results we show that if you don't account for the fear it looks like policy aggregated across all the industries cuts activity by seventy percent but once you do this comparison policy's impact is only seven percent so it's one tenth the size of what you would get if if you if you did it wrong and if you one thing that makes us feel a little more comfortable about that as an estimate of policy is there's three different types of variation that we can look at one are let's compare output and consumer visits in places that are on the border with a state like quad cities that never had an order in places like that it's a 6.8 percent difference because of the policy but we can also compare the places like the kenosha wisconsin where they do have a policy there's just a difference in timing if you look at the difference in timing places it's it's an eight percent difference from policy and third at the tail end of our sample you got a few places that repeal or let expire their shelter in place policies and if you thought that the policy really matters you would think you would get a very robust rebound of of economic activity when they get rid of the rule but actually the increase coming out of them is of the same very modest size as the decrease was going in so it only increases by about five percent the consumer activity it doesn't the policy doesn't do things like because it's phone record data we can keep track of how far people went to get to the store so if all that was happening as people were driving from moline illinois over to the iowa side to get their hair cut that would show up as as an increase in travel distance there's no increase in travel distance there's no evidence that that in the week before they put the shelter in place orders in there that that people rush uh to do more shopping so the uh the the biggest thing is it's not policy that's the evidence that it is not policy the evidence that it is fear is a little more suggestive but it is the following first the deaths the number of coveted reported deaths in your neighborhood within the same metro area have a very significant impact on how much people go visit stores okay and i say my number one rule of virus economics is that the best thing that you can do for the economy is anything that slows the rate of spread of the virus this thing is suggests that spreading of the virus is a very powerful determinant of people's willingness to go out and visit stores second because we have individual store information we're able to see a clear shift in consumer behavior in the same industry from larger busier stores to smaller less busy stores as this disease progresses in a way that's not normal it wasn't and it didn't happen in 2019 it didn't happen in january as you get more deaths from the disease you see this happen e at to an even greater extent that rather than going to them to the mega mall you go to a smaller store in the same industry and this is a graph of that phenomenon it's not to say that the small stores do better everybody goes down it's just that the the blue line here are stores in the same industry that had the bottom 20 percent level of traffic per week in january the green ones are the busiest and largest stores measured by traffic in january and what you see is that the plunge is much bigger for those heavy traffic stores than for the smaller businesses and the more mom and pop kind of stores and as i say the the greater is the prevalence of the disease in your county the more pronounced this uh this thing becomes there is one thing so that so that's our evidence that it's mostly fear not policy policy doesn't affect overall impact very much but there is one thing that the policy does quite a lot of and that is it diverts business from one type of store to a different type of store okay so we track down in every place what counts as an essential business so there are the states put in uh essential business restrictions and when they do that you see that holding everything else equal relative to this overall trend downward consumer visits to non-essential businesses plunge and consumer visits to essential businesses go way up for a net of very small um and and in this graph i kind of illustrate this for you everybody goes down it's just essential business goes down less than than non-essential business and so there is that diversion and we track down the restaurant and bar restrictions on on live attending uh going to those places and lo and behold consumer visits to restaurants and bars plunge almost 30 percent while simultaneously visits to non-restaurant food and beverage stores go up 28 and that's because we're not we're not losing weight we're still eating the same amount of food we're just not getting it from a restaurant we're getting it from the grocery store so in conclusion our paper basically uses this detailed store level data that comes from phone records and this across county policy change information to suggest the data suggest that the policy shelter in place orders themselves did not have a very big impact of the 60 percent decline in economic activity we estimate about 7 percent came from these uh from these policy orders and the rest uh is very closely tied we think to to fear that having lots of uh local deaths having lots of store traffic those correlate with reduced visits uh very strongly and if repealing these orders leads to an increase in the infection rate of the disease we don't have any information about that we don't know anything about the health side but if it did our results say you could easily have a reverse impact you could if you increased the number of deaths that could depress economic activity by a fair bit more than you increased economic activity by repealing the order so so it is worth thinking that through when making those decisions but the policy as i say did have a clear impact in that it changed where we went and where we shopped and that's basically our paper
