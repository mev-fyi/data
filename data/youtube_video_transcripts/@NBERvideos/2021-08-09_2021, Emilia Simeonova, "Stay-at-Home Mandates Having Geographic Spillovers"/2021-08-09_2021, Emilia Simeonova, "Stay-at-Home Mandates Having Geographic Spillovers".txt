my name is emilia simeonova and i will be presenting joint work with vadim elenif alessandro rebuchi and with quintero on the direct and spiel over effects from stay-at-home orders related to covent 19. when we had um stay-at-home orders from colbert 19 until recently uh one of the differences that happened in the united states as opposed to other places was that these orders were implemented at the local level every jurisdiction made their own decisions on when to implement these orders and what kind of orders to implement different restrictions on mobility were implemented at different times in different locations now when policies are well designed they have effects on the intended population but sometimes these effects may extend beyond the immediate target population or area and spill into neighboring entities when we're talking about public health policies intended to prevent the spread of an infectious disease it is particularly likely that these policies may have effects that spill over into areas that are not the direct target areas of those policies what were local governments trying to do let's remind ourselves the idea was that when mobility is restricted and people have less contact between each other the germs are less likely to replicate we're slowing the transition vector of cohort 19 and therefore the pandemic is going to die down different types of policies were implemented and in this study we studied the most restrictive of these policies stay at home orders or lockdowns now when we're talking about local policies and about restricting mobility in the united states in particular it's important to remember that the united states is very connected very connected on the traffic level and an economic level what we show here in this map is the share of traffic in the county originating outside of the county now as you can see the median county in the u.s has about 15 percent of its traffic originating in counties that are other than that and there are some counties that are particularly well connected to other counties having up to about 80 percent of their traffic originating in other counties when we're talking about local policies and in particular stay-at-home orders that is important because a lot of the the transition and a lot of the connectedness in the county between people is probably happening across people who are not residents of that country they're residents of other counties and are passing through that at the same time we have the staggered policy implementation and here we're showing the implementation dates for different areas of stay-at-home orders in the u.s they vary from mid-march in the san francisco bay area to never somewhere in in some states in the middle of the county and there is substantial variation at the time in the timing of this policy implementation now when you couple this variation in the timing of policy implementation of stay-at-home orders or lockdowns with the connectedness between counties um does it matter for the lack of policy coordination what does lack of policy coordination imply well it depends and what it depends on is how people react to these state home orders in the counties that are not directly affected by the stay at home order if people compensate for restricted mobility in their local county by increasing mobility and contacts in neighboring areas then the uncoordinated policy implementation is of optimal why because if i'm prevented from going to restaurants and shops in my area and i go and shop and go to restaurants in the neighboring area that does not have a stay-at-home order then i'm taking my germs to the neighboring area and so my local policy is in fact making the conditions in the neighboring area worse if everybody is going in the neighboring areas on the other hand if neighboring areas respond to local stay at home orders in the same direction meaning people in neighboring areas restrict their mobility in response to the index areas stay at home order implementation then the lack of coordination may not be as problematic so in this case again people who are not directly affected by the same at home order are acting in a way consistent with that order even though they're not under that order themselves so that is what we study we are we're studying how the implementation of the stay at home orders in the united states affected mobility in the counties in which these orders were implemented and in neighboring counties that are likely to have been affected by these orders because they are connected to the original counties where the orders first happened we use safegraf's weekly weekly traffic data which is been used in many similar studies we also use county level data on state home order implementation from keystone strategy which is a consulting firm and importantly what we do in order to estimate spillovers is we focus on triplets of counties where one county implements the sea at home order at least four days before the neighboring county so we have enough variation in the timing of implementation and then we have a third county that is geographically close to the neighboring county but not well connected through traffic to either town and that third county which we call the hinterland county is our control county in this case i want to show you where these counties are located these triplets of counties are located as you can see they're all over the united states they cover about one-third of the area total area of the united states and also about one-third of the total population of the united states many of them are located across state borders because once again we have the restriction that we need to have at least four calendar days difference in the implementation of state home orders between counties but some of them are located inside the same state again because counties decided want to implement state home orders um by themselves uh um the the graph that i'm showing you here pretty much summarizes our main results it's an event study that shows the evolution of retail visits in the county that directly implemented the stay at home order which is the dark black dots with the confidence intervals around them the the the bar lines and in the neighboring county which did not have a state home order but is close to his neighboring the county that did have a state homeowner those are the squares the the light ray squares um in the graph as you can see before the implementation hardly anything happens once we have an implementation of a stay at home order that's it from zero we have a precipitous drops drop in the retail visits in the direct country that implements the order that's the black dots but we also see an effect in the country that hasn't implemented the order but is neighboring the county that implements the order which we call the spillover effect in the light gray squares we see both of these effects in retail visits we also see effects in the fraction of household state completely at home as you can see again the direct effect is very strong we have much more households staying at home in the county that implements the state home order but we also have an effect in the neighboring county a spillover and we see the same effect in hours spent completely at home as measured by where the device is located so overall we find strong direct effects of the state home orders in the counties that implement those donors but we also find substantial effects in neighboring counties which we call the spillover effects which are about half to a third of the size of the direct effects um now the question is well why is this happening right what are the mechanisms how does this work well first the people in the neighboring locations may reduce mobility as a response to the stay at home order what we call this information channel they see a neighboring county implementing the state home order and they realize oh this is bad we're just gonna stay at home as well but it's also possible that this is more of a mechanical effect whereby traffic from the county that implements the state home order drops and therefore we have less traffic in the neighboring county just mechanically because people are staying at home and they're not going to the neighboring county either we try to unpack this in in in two ways first of all we look at counties that share the same media markets versus counties that don't share the same media modules and here in this slide we show the effects um in three different subsets these are the spillover effects in the neighboring county from stay at home order implementation the gray bars are the effects in the subset of counties that share the same media markets and the yellow bars are the effects in the subset of counties that do not share the same media markets and the green are the average effects that are across the entire sample what we see here is that pretty much across all outcomes considered the average effect is driven by um counties that share the same media market so counties that share the same information and the same media markets has much stronger spillover effects in neighboring counties from the implementation of state homeowners that counties which do not share the same media markets this is very strong suggestive evidence for the presence of an information channel whereby people restrict mobility in response to information they receive from the other county when we decompose the total spillover effect in the county that include that that hasn't implemented an essay the state home order we find about 11 percent of total traffic decline so even if you haven't implemented the state homeowner you have 11 declining traffic three percent of that decline is due to this external traffic channel which is a mobility mechanical effects more or less and about eight percent of the total decline is due to the information channel so people react to the information they restrict their own mobility in response to your neighboring county implementing with a state homeowner what does that mean um in in in relation to this um discussion about coordination versus staggered adoption and there's been a lot of discretion about this in the media and here we have to emphasize that it's important to consider and keep in mind when we're talking about um coordinating so if we are going to if we were to coordinate state homeowners in the very beginning of of the state homeowner implementation that would be the 16th of march that would be the green bar everybody implements that time of course that would be a dominating policy because you would have a lot of um much more restrictions everywhere and probably it would be uh you know it would be superior to the staggered implementation but that confounds the early implementation with the coordinated implementation what is more likely and a more fair comparison is if we consider the purple bar which is if we implemented stay-at-home um coordinated state home orders in the middle meaning at the mean data implementation of state home orders in the united states and when we compete from compare that implementation to the gray bars which is the standard implementation in the presence of spillover channels in the spillover effects which go in the same direction as the main effects um it is less clear of a comparison and less clearly in this policy the coordinated policy is is not clear that it dominates the staggered adoption in terms of total effects so um the takeaway from our study is that we have substantial spillover effects which go in the same direction as the main effects of state home orders and these need to be taken account into account when we consider the total effects of state home orders and the staggered adoption of those older orders in the united states
