I'm going to talk about one of the few positive things that came out of the financial crisis and that is the amazing positive productivity shock to fiscal research in fact that led me to change the title slightly to the Renaissance in fiscal research and here's a an example of where necessity is the mother of invention so just to give you an idea of where fiscal research was even early in 2008 there were a few of us who were sort of the poor relations of the monetary people doing our research the people in the U.S didn't talk very much to the people in Europe who were doing say expansionary austerity much of our work was using fiscal shocks to try to determine which model of the economy was a better explanation the need a classical model or the old Keynesian model and in fact a lot of the papers never mentioned the word multiplier so in Matthew Shapiro's in my 98 paper we did not mention multiplier Burnside eichenbach and Fisher no mention of multiplier all right things changed very very quickly in Fall 2008 and we realized how unprepared we were and I think that the academic community and policy makers were surprised to find that there really was no consensus and people hadn't been estimating fiscal multipliers so let me just start by giving you an overview of a lot of the progress we made and then I will talk about where I think the range of most multipliers is I'm going to talk about some in the weeds really important detail about calculating multipliers and then I'll talk about the fiscal consolidations in Europe and what we might know about the multipliers that applied to the arra and then the tax rebate if I have time Okay so we've made progress on all three methodological fronts lots of progress okay and I just put this up here just to give you an idea so on the theory and theory is really important because one of the things that theory tells us is that multipliers are going to be really different depending on the financing whether you have sticky wages and prices whether you have hand-to-mouth consumers whether you're at the zero lower bound you're in a currency Union uh and whether fiscal policy is anticipated also on empirical methods we imported a lot of the applied micro methods and so there have been a lot of cross-sectional studies but also natural experiments narrative methods bartic instruments proxy as far as local projections all kinds of great new techniques that we use to study fiscal multipliers and then data that's also been a really important uh progress newly constructed historical and cross-sectional data sets within countries narrative instruments for panels of countries explore exploitation the rich new data created by the variety of policy maker responses to the crisis so in fact the crisis in a way created new data for us as well all right so I'm going to give you what I see is the current range of the majority of multiplier estimates based on particular circumstances and let me just overview the scope of the summary that I'm going to give you first of all I'm just going to talk about multipliers within the first two to five years okay there's long run multipliers are also really important but there are a lot of other issues that come in there some of the estimation methods aren't so good for the long run so I'm just going to look at first first two to five years I'm going to look just at industrialized countries there's all kinds of interesting stuff being done in emerging economies but you know I just thought of it as beyond the scope of what I was doing here uh the estimates are based on a variety of methodologies so this is very big ten I think that all of the methodologies as I talk about in the paper everyone has a weakness but they also have some strengths and so if we use time series methods cross-sectional methods estimated dsge methods if we're getting similar results I think that that makes us feel a little bit more confident in them so so these include all of these kinds of methods I am going to exclude some estimates that I think don't use the best practices I've had several people email me in the last week why wasn't my paper included and and I'll say you know me I'm blunt and I said you know the way you calculated your multiplier I couldn't figure out how to calculate it the right way and you didn't calculate it the right way and so and I'll explain why that's important but you know I'm always open to somebody telling me no this really was the best practice but for this point here I'm excluding some estimates now the ranges I'm going to show you are just sort of for the majority of estimates but that doesn't include some notable outliers I'll try to mention them as I go just because as you'll see the diagram I had I just I initially had a whole bunch of extra arrows and it turned into a mess so um there are some notable outliers produced with good methodology all right okay multipliers on government purchases G okay so this is a little line with zero multiplier one two and again this is two to three years surprisingly all right this is a much more narrow range than I had given in my jel paper in 2011. all right 0.6 to 0.8 it's amazing how many estimates for garden variety on average over historical samples uh multipliers you get so this is dsge methods where you don't have monetary accommodation time series methods and a variety of others although not cross-sectional methods and I'll show you those in a minute aggregate data many countries so a lot of this is fiscal consolidations that are mostly spending based for example this is General government purchases these are sample averages okay now there are a few so there's one outlier there's a very nice paper by uh Ben ziv and papa that look at uh defense news using a really nice uh restriction medium Horizon restriction they get as high as 1.5 okay so there are a few outliers here also if you start conditioning on things so with the ilziki at Owl paper fixed exchange rates you tend to get higher multiplier there but I put that in lighter type because we don't have as many estimates there so so the darkness of the type indicates there are lots of estimates piling up there the lightness of the type that I'm going to show you suggests we'd want to look at this some more recession versus slack okay so the initial estimates that people like to uh quote say over to all right this is you know uh our Bach and garajni chenko were the Pioneers on this if you allow for feedback that falls to 1.5 and if you allow for more complete feedback it falls even below and if you have the standard MBR definition of a recession it actually turns into a negative multiplier during a recession okay so those what Sarah zubair and I recently published a paper on this uh we don't say it there but in a way some of the recession multipliers are more fragile than our financial system okay so those need a little bit more looking we keep getting 0.6 to 0.8 but there is room for debate on the other hand zlb or monetary accommodation we're getting ranges that typically are one or above they can go to three so we know about the dsge models that say when you're at the zero lower bound and you don't have monitor when you have monetary accommodation that you can get much higher multipliers there is some fragility there so some recent papers have found that when uh the researchers were doing their experiments they weren't just extending the period of the zero lower bound they were also extending the Persistence of the government spending shock so so there's some uncertainty there but in some samples so Sarah zuberry when we took out World War II and I when we took out World War II rationing we could actually get multipliers around 1.5 during the zero lower bound periods or monetary accommodation periods uh in Japan Miyamoto at Al uh have found multipliers on impact or 1.5 if you read closer in the paper they actually go up to 2.6 so they're finding quite High ones so there is some evidence of higher multipliers during monetary accommodation both from the estimated theoretical models calibrated theoretical models and time series models okay there's very little work on infrastructure there was a lot of work in the past uh that suggested High multipliers and uh what I'm I see from the few more recent ones is that those multipliers can be quite high in fact I have a student working on this in his preliminary multipliers for the U.S highway system the original one are you know as high as eight so I think a lot more needs to be done there but there's potentially uh significant multipliers there now in contrast to the time series aggregate data that I showed you in the blue there the cross-section panel sub-national General government purchases and transfers there'll be some outliers using good methodology but it's surprising how many of these multipliers end up between 1.5 and 2 okay so people have done it for Italian provinces across the U.S for Prime contracts and they're getting 1.5 to 2. all right multipliers on taxes and transfers well David and Christy got amazingly almost implausibly high in magnitude multipliers of -2 to -3 and what's really and that was using narrative identification and what's amazing is people started taking that methodology to other countries and what do people get minus 2.4 minus 2.5 minus three and in the fiscal consolidation literature they find that the consolidations that are mostly tax based have much higher multipliers than the ones that are mostly spending based okay so there's quite a narrow relatively narrow range there for tax multiplies and of course with tax multipliers they should be negative transfers these should be positive multipliers tax rebates okay if you look at the aggregate data uh I can I'm going to touch on a little bit of this here but uh in my talk but there's more in the paper uh these tend to be really low so David and Christy looked at uh romer's looked at uh Social Security transfers and for the for the temporary ones you just didn't get much effect uh other sorts of cases it's very hard to find in the aggregate data however if you look at temporary tax rebates and you look at household level data estimated NPCs such as Jonathan Parker's works and you sort of take them in a partial equilibrium way up to the aggregate or if you calibrate a dsge model that suggests bigger multipliers okay so here's where I'm going to take you into some really important weeds in the multiplier literature and this is going to explain why I have you know not included some multipliers that were hired that you might have seen okay so a recent lesson learned from the literature is that a really important source of the wide range of multiplier estimates such as I showed in my jel piece is actually due to the simple difference ways that they calculate multipliers I'm going to highlight two commonly used methods that often lead to Upward bias okay so I'm going to give you an illustration by just running a standard VAR this is for government purchases multipliers all right so it's going to be a structural VAR I'm not going to use my military use I'm going to use Blanchard and parodies identification method and in their identification method they're basically assuming that the unforecasted part of government spending in this VAR is the exogenous shock to government spending all right so government spending is ordered first I'm going to have quarterly data from 1939 to 2015. I include World War II here I get similar results without World War II it's just that they're estimated much more precisely with World War II in there five variables I'm going to have a lot you know the standard thing we do is put things in logs and vars right so log real total government spending per capita log real GDP per capita federal tax receipts three-month treasury bill just to think about interest rates and and that goes back to 39 and the inflation rate and four lags quadratic Trend all right so you estimate these sorts of things and then you say okay what happens when an exogenous government shock hits what happens to the path of government spending and output okay so these are the estimated responses all right when the shock happens using a bloodshot and karate identification shot log government spending jumps up as does log GDP they follow similar patterns but something to keep in mind is in many many of the estimations particularly this one there's a hump shape there okay that's going to be important now we want to calculate multipliers we've got to use those impulse responses so how do we use the dynamic response of those log variables to answer the question how much does GDP rise When government spending Rises by a dollar I'm going to show how seemingly small changes in the method can lead to large changes in the multiplier all right so you have estimates already but you've got to convert them to multipliers so as I said before the financial crisis we we didn't really think about multipliers a lot but I started in karate they used the word multiplier but as I will show you it's really more of a particular description of some impulse responses so what do they do well they compute the ratio of the log GDP response at Horizon H so that's the red circle two the impact response of law government spending all right so they always keep the impact response to government spending and they typically look at the peak GDP response to government spending what I'm going to show you in the next graph is just doing it for every Horizon but keeping the government spending the same now if you you probably can't see the numbers you would say gosh that looks like a small multiplier well it's not as small as you might think and it's because everything is in logs and therefore percent changes so what they did and what I had done in my qje paper we said oh we know how to convert elasticities we're just going to multiply by the sample average of GDP over government spending it's 4.8 in this sample so what happens if you do that you get pretty big multipliers all right basically all you've done is renormalize the GDP response by the the initial impact in times of 4.8 so when they report a peak multiplier this is actually higher than what they reported for their particular sample you get a multiplier above two all right now the problem with that that falls later the problem with that is can you imagine if you're a policy maker and you know they undertake this policy thinking they're going to get a multiplier above two and then you say oh I forgot to tell you you have to keep spending government spending and it's going to increase and so the impact on your budget is much bigger than you might think based on this multiplier so fortunately Harold ulick along with Mount Fort said you know we should calculate multipliers in this Dynamic context in a way that reflects the impact on the budget so what did they do they compute the ratio of the present value of the cumulative responses so suppose you want to know the multiplier up at Horizon 10 you take the integral under the impulse response of log GDP divided by the integral of the response of government spending because then that takes into account the dynamic path then they also because everything was in logs converted it to Dollar multipliers uh as with the previous method so what happens when you calculate the multiplier this way at each Horizon suddenly that multiplier of two you know is below one and uh the only time the multipliers are the same is of course on impact and this one that's allowing for the total effect on government spending is telling you that multiplier on average is below one although it looks like it might go up a little bit above one past 15 quarters all right so a lot of the big multipliers you've seen and and they're still being used in some published papers and good places I won't mention anything um are because they're calculating that Blanchard and karate way of doing things now that's not the only thing although that's the biggest thing and it depends on the sample you know like how much of a hump there is in your impulse response now as I said we all use logs because that's what you do in a VAR but then that gives you elasticities not multipliers and as I said we would just multiply by the sample average of Y over G but in Bob Hall he kept saying you shouldn't use logs and I said well I know how to convert things because he and uh Barrow and redlick hadn't run vars and they were just running things uh transformed in a way so there's one way to transform it the way they did it an easier way is Gordon and cran where you just divide both output and government spending by some measure of potential GDP or polynomial you know some polynomial Trend so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to re-estimate that model using the Gordon krin transformation because then I don't have to use an ad hoc conversion factor what happens there so that's the blue line all right multipliers go down even more in this particular sample and if I found that in a number of samples so they're more 0.7.5 and this actually solves a puzzle I had because in my qje paper I use that ad hoc conversion factor like everybody else and I was getting multipliers slightly above one and then I was surprised in a follow-up paper in NBR fiscal volume I was looking at private spending and I was finding the private spending decreased significantly well that doesn't make sense if the multiplier is above one private spending shouldn't be going down and then it was later when I was working with Michael Yang and Sarah zuberry on some historical data where the ratio of GDP to government spending varied a lot that I realized that this ad hoc conversion factor we were all using wasn't the right way to go now there's also an additional issue for tax multipliers which is most tax multipliers reported are based on the legislative forecast or the budget impact not taking into account Dynamic feedback okay but tax cuts raised GDP that's what all of these find with that big uh you know minus two to minus three multiplier which mitigates the negative effect of the tax cut on tax revenue so tax multipliers are even greater magnitude if reported relative to the actual change most of what I'm showing you are not reported relative to the actual change there's actually One Good Reason a lot of people don't like to report that is some tax changes seem to be at the top of the Laffer Curve and so there's zero change in tax revenue and it's really hard to divide by zero so all right bottom line many of the big differences that I wasn't aware of back in 2011 we are not due to the estimation method the sample it's just the way we're Computing multipliers because you know nobody talked about multipliers for the most part you know since the 60s and so we had to catch up on sort of standardizing the method and figuring out that these small changes have big effects okay so that was important for me to say so you can understand why I don't include you know every single study when I talk about uh the European fiscal consolidation or uh the arra so I'm going to be a little bit brief here in part because my discussions can talk a lot about it plus uh this is for the Jep and one of the other papers in there is going to be talking more about Europe okay so as you know in the wake of the financial crisis numerous European countries undertook fiscal consolidations and some were more spending based and some were more tax based and remember those multipliers can be really different studies using narrative evidence for identification find that on average tax-based consolidations have much larger output effects in spending based consolidations and these are consistent with the U.S findings now we still have a reason to believe that the multipliers were bigger in general during the European consolidation so one possibility is because interest rate were near the zero lower bound and we do have some evidence that multipliers could be bigger than so uh in a forthcoming book alaciovazi find that once they control for tax versus spending features multipliers in the wake of the financial crisis are not different from those on average however there's some really interesting indirect evidence from blushard and Lee and house probsting and tesar which suggests that may multipliers were bigger than people thought they were at the time so particularly with the bloodshard and Lee They show they regress forecast errors of GDP on uh the forecasted not the forecast error the forecast of the fiscal consolidation and they find that it's significant so there is a bias in the forecast of GDP that was linked with the size of the fiscal consolidation now as they say this is just an indirect way they can't exactly back out the multiplier but it suggests that whatever was in those models back then uh was uh not high enough okay so let me talk about multipliers during the arra all right as I said it was possible that they were higher because we were at the zero lower bound uh the cross state estimate so the impact suggests big employment and output multipliers and Gabe chaturoy Reich has a really nice forthcoming paper that sort of standardizes and synthesizes the arra evidence and he estimates multipliers from 1.7 to 2 on output or two job years created per 100 000 okay something else that he found is once he standardized these estimates this huge range you had seen before suddenly became much more narrow okay so so standardization has been really good for the fiscal literature now caveats fiscal literature is known for a long time sub-national multipliers are not necessarily the same as aggregate multipliers however uh chaturi Reich uses theoretical arguments from Farhan warning to argue that at the clb the cross state multipliers for externally financed spending are lower bounds than the aggregate multiplier so then this leads us with the question why are the cross state multipliers so much higher than those estimated using aggregate data and if you want to see how high they are this is a counter factual that I put together that says what would have hap given his estimates what would have happened to the unemployment rate had there been no arra and this is for 2009 to 2011. and my paper has more details on how I did this but it says that the unemployment rate would have risen above 15 percent had there been no arra and so this is even with all of the monetary things going on tarp and all of that all right so it's a big number so Gabe and I are still debating this uh I think that the existing arra multipliers don't apply to the aggregate okay and here's the reason they're not nationally representative the arra studies none of them waited they used per capita variables by state but they don't weight their regressions by state population that means that North Dakota is given the same weight as California if treatment effects are heterogeneous across States then the unweighted estimates won't be nationally representative also it doesn't account for all the government spending much of the arra consists of federal transfers to States and several studies have found a fly paper effect that there was induced State spending of more than one for one so what happens if we correct the estimates so Gabe has wonderful replication files I re-estimated his model but I wait each state by population and I use total state and local induced spending these estimates are for job years per 100 000 dollars but it's approximately equal to the output multiplier given his conversions all right First Column is his headline estimate 2.0 with a robust standard error 0.59 if I use his same model but then just wait by population the estimate Falls to 1.15 but bigger standard error 0.72 be clear you know these confidence bands are overlapping each other if I take all the government spending and then also weight by population I get 0.89 with somewhat smaller standard error but again they also could be one all right but it's just something to think about and it's it's amazing how much information people doing the ARA research got from 50 States but you have to understand that 50 states are only 50 states and so there's a question about which is the nationally representative estimate all right I'm going to I yeah so conclusions I'm not going to talk about the tax rebate 2008. there really has been a Renaissance and fiscal research so this is a really good thing that came out of the financial crisis and it's not going to go away like maybe some of the other regulations um we now know much more than we did 10 years ago uh Garden variety government purchases multipliers are probably between 0.6 and one though there are some credible estimates you know above one 1.5 you know there are some estimates there that I that seem to use the best practices tax rate change multipliers are probably minus two to minus three I initially said this is just too high I went through all their programs could not knock those down um multipliers and infrastructure and during periods of monetary accommodation are probably above one possibly substantially above one but more research should be done to assess the robustness all right thanks
