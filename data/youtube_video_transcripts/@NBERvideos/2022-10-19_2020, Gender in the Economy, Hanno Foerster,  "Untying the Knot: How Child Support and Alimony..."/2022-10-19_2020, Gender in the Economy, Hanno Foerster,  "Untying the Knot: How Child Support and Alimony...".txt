okay first of all I would like to thank the organizers for including my paper in the program the paper is about child support and alimony payments and I asked how these payments affect couples decisions in marriage and divorce and ultimately I ask how should child support and alimony be designed to be welfare maximized so the Point of Departure for the paper is that divorce has become a very common phenomenon over one-fourth of our marriages are divorced within the first 15 years in the U.S and also in a range of European countries and clearly where the breakdown has severe Financial consequences and so think of lawyer costs think of um splitting up financial and on financial assets but also think about especially for the lower earner and about losing access to the Xbox's labor income and for all these reasons most societies have rules and guidelines about payments that need to be made that are mandated between ex-spouses after divorce so these payments are commonly referred to as maintenance payments in the typical well-known components are alimony payments and child support payments now in the past decade there have been several debates about reforming and some actual reforms um of alimony and child support payments um in including um some U.S states uh one of them being Massachusetts and Germany France and the UK and in all these debates the arguments that have been brought forward were economic arguments related to an I think interesting concentrate of so from a sort of a planet perspective on the one hand or one argument in favor of high maintenance payments is to provide insurance for the lower earner um or the experts taking the children up for divorce so they could make sure that this person does not experience it too severe drop any income and um therefore in consumption upon divorce so there's one argument in favor of high maintenance payments the second argument in favor of high maintenance payments is to facilitate efficient household specialization so for some couples it will be efficient to special specialize and if you think of the person taking a step back career-wise to focus on home production clearly for going Korea Investments for this person is um is an easier decision to make if he or she knows that in case of divorce some payments will be received and then finally an obvious argument against high maintenance payments is that they will store divorce labor Supply incentives so if you compute these payments based on divorce labor incomes then both um the payer maintenance payer and maintenance receiver will have an incentive to reduce labor Supply to manipulate the payments in their favor so my research question or the research question of my paper is how should maintenance payments be designed um given this underlying creative and to direct this question I developed a dynamic economic model of American divorce capitalist decision making um where in divorce an important feature a distinguishing feature of my model is that ex-spouses are linked by maintenance payments so they continue to be tied together and make and are making decisions non-cooperatively in a strategic strategic interaction where the Strategic interaction comes about because I if I decide about my labor Supply have an impact on maintenance payments which impact my ex-spouse's optimal labor Supply which feeds back into maintenance payments and there you can see how strategic interaction comes about in marriage in my model decision making is subject to limited household bargaining subject to limited commitment where maintenance payments influence the expanses other spouses outside options and thereby have an impact on divorce rates um the distribution of household bargaining power in the household and also influence the incentives to engage in household specialization as I um previously alluded to I estimate my model using Rich data from Denmark and there's both register in survey data and these data cover a large range of variables that are relevant to my context for example I observe the precise amount of Maintenance payments between divorces the divorce exposes I observe who children continue to reside with after divorce so which spouse is taking the kids and I observe standard things like work hours wages and also housework hours from the Timeless data which also features some information on consumption um given the estimated model um I simulate part of factual policy scenarios where I change child support and alimony payments um and in the Second Step search across the parameter space to find a welfare maximizing a child support alimony combination so welfare maximizing maintenance policy and then the third step I solved the model under a hypothetical first best scenario where I remove friction from the model so intuitively this is like allowing couples to write a perfect Dynamic prenuptial agreement that can condition on all future States so very much a hypothetical scenario but nevertheless interesting as a benchmark for policy okay before I get to the model one quick slide on the institutional background um so in Denmark also in in the US and many other countries um maintenance payments consist of child support alimony child support being paid from the non-custodial parent to the parent taking the kids after divorce and these payments uh in most countries computed based on the non-custodial current income so that the pay us labor income and the number of children and in my policy analysis I also experiment uh I also stimulate situations where these payments also depend on the receiver's labor income so I'm the person who takes the kids and then secondly alimony payments these are payments irrespective of the number of children so even between couples without kids and are paid from the higher earner to the lower earn out for up to 10 years after divorce and here the formula is quite simple there's just a fraction of the income difference um that is paid from the higher to the lower then importantly all payments respond to income changes after divorce so if I am an alimony payer and I get a raise then the electronic payments are also increased accordingly and I can use the register data to verify that compliance with these policies is high so in in the US in Germany in many other countries it's it's known that these policies are not perfectly enforced Denmark is very good at enforcing the Danish government is very good at enforcing these payments and I can use the data to verify that enforcement is working okay then a very brief overview of my model um the model is a life cycle model um of two interacting decision makers female and a male decision maker and the couple is married at the outset of the model and may endogenously divorce in each subsequent time period um in each time period couples or ex-couples decide how to allocate um their financial budget or budgets between consumption and a risk-free asset so consumption and savings and choose how to allocate that time budget between working engaging in home production and spending time on media and finally divorce is also an endogenous outcome of the body now the um the graph here sketches the timing of a time period for a married couple so you can see if a couple enters a time period as married then love shocks hits so basically these are idiosyncratic preference shocks that make you want to stay with your spouse or want to uh want to leave him or her um if these love shocks are negative enough such with a couple deep bosses then there's an equal division of assets and there's an exogenous probability that the wife takes um takes the kids so this probability I calibrate from my data and in my data this probability is around 90 so most typically in Denmark um the mother takes the case after divorce then upon divorce spouses intact in a dynamic game where as I mentioned earlier the dynamic link because of the dynamic strategic interaction comes about because they are still tied together by the maintenance payments and basically so the decision of my Expos affect my budget set and this is how they are still lit um if couples stay married so if the love shocks are positive enough so the couple decides to stay married they continue to make Cooperative decisions so basically constrain efficient decisions and a limited commitment foreign then some more model features how do children show up children um the number of children is n and they are born exogenously they benefit from a home good queue that is produced from the time inputs so if um husband and wife engage in home production they produce this from good Q which becomes more relevant if more children are around in the household so this covers for and that there's a Time cost of having children and then on the other hand there's also a financial cost of having children um and this is accounted for by equivalent scale so basically the Assumption here being that children consume just a share of overall consumption of their parents consumption foreign by doing returns to human capital um so working today increases expected future wages and this introduces an important mechanism because this introduces individual incentives to self-insure accidentally by working a lot today I can make sure that if there's a divorce I have a high wage and I'm self-sufficient and this mechanism becomes less important if maintenance payments are higher so only if maintenance payments are high cupboards are willing to engage in in a household specialization then decision making in divorce is non-cooperatively I impose a stackable structure where the husband moves first while um during marriage spouses make decisions subject according to a household bargaining model subject to limited commitment which means their bargaining rates which reflect bargain power and they may shift over time so for 1000 will become optimal to leave the marriage there may be a shift in bargaining power and only if no rebar gaining can make both us want to stay marriage married then they are then divorce comes about um okay so this is a finite time Horizon model so it can be solved by backwards uh recursion and I I estimated by simulated method of moment estimation where Target and curricular patterns related to labor Supply housework divorce and consumption on the next slide I show a selection of the targeted moments so you can see on the on the top top left graph you can see um average time use in the household um for married and divorced um for many divorced couples the hatched bars here are data moments the plane bus are model moments so you can see that the model fit here is quite good I also fit the evolution of ever divorced couples so the percentage of divorced couples um after 5 10 15 20 25 years so as time time evolves um so here the dashed line is data the solid line is the model and then I also fit coefficients from event study regressions so basically the bottom left graph here shows you the evolution of work hours around divorce and you can see that in the data so there's the solid line the data um um work hours drop a little bit for both men and women upon divorce and the model reflects this um the estimated model and then finally an untargeted moment relative to consumption so female consumption divided by male consumption around divorce so this is imputed consumptions from data on assets and labor incomes and you can see that the model quite well even though this is an untargeted moment quite well captures the drop in consumption um in relative consumption that we see in the data then let me use my remaining time to talk about three key results of my paper so I simulate changes in alimony and child support payments for um 20 000 capitals and we're used for alimony the precise rule of thumb formula so the precise formula which is just a fraction of the income difference between higher and lower earner well for child support um I use an approximation so try to policy computed according to a complicated step function which I approximate by this schedule which is linear in labor incomes and the approximation Works quite well um so there are squared of the approximation is um just above 95 percent um and in my policy simulations I changed um the parameters highlighted in blue here so for element of a fraction that is played and then also the curvature and number of children the lump sum amount the responsiveness of Child Support to the payers income and the responsiveness to the income difference between payer and receiver the first result of my paper that I want to highlight is that I find that some policies can backfire in the following sense I find that both for alimony and making child support dependent on the income difference between custodial and non-custodial parent I find that what this leads to is an amplified consumption drop for women so um the two figures here show simulated event studies uh simulated event study on coefficients from simulated event studies and you can see that under no element payments so this would be Tau equal to zero there's a drop um of around 20 26 percent in consumption for women upon divorce and perhaps surprisingly we can see that as alimony is increased the consumption drop becomes Amplified for women where there's also an amplified consumption drop for men the reason behind this if you if we dig deeper is that there are severe laser Supply disincentives that come with alimony for the both divorced women and men and the underlying mechanism is that they are strengthened incentives to reduce work hours for strategic consideration so basically to manipulate the best response of your ex-spouse and and these strategic considerations are strengthened if alimony payments are increased of Child Support is made more dependent on the income difference between payer and receiver so result number one is alimony payments failed to provide consumption insurance and it looks similar for making child support payments dependent on the income difference the second result I want to talk about is the welfare maximizing maintenance policy so I search across the policy parameter space and to see which policy combination or which combination of policy parameters maximizes a utilitarian welfare criteria and I find relative to the status quo policy um switching to the welfare maximizing um policy would involve increasing the lump sum component of Child Support increasing the slope of child support in the payers income and making child support convex in the number of children rather than concave as it is understated support policy and finally we're using alimony payments if this policy were to be implemented it would reduce alimony payments and increase child support payments increasing overall payments by um 28 in the population that I studied the third result I want to talk about is um comparing the welfare maximizing policy that I just discussed through hypothetically at first best scenario in which frictions are removed from the model so the interpretation is in this scenario I allow couples to make binding commitments in marriage and basically write perfect prenuptial agreements so that we obtain the Pareto Pareto Frontier after divorce this graph what this graph shows here is male utility on the y-axis male X under utility on the y-axis and female X anti-utility on the x-axis for the status quo the welfare maximizing policy and the hypothetical first best scenario and what we can see is that first test not surprisingly is a Pareto improvement over the both the status over the state is Chrome but also over the welfare maximizing policy where the welfare maximizing policy is very much redistributive so it lowers mail utility by a bit while strongly increasing female utility so what this constellation shows that is that relative to the welfare maximizing policy in the real world policy space there's still scope for improvement and especially their scope for greater improvements highlighting um I think an interesting shortcoming of real-world policies as they are implemented um are basically the policy space as it's implemented in the real world okay in conclusion my paper provides the first study of child support and alimony payments and how they should be designed in light of the policy trade-off between consumption Insurance supporting household specialization while maintaining labor Supply incentives to this end I developed a dynamic model that incorporates this trade-off and importantly accounts for the Strategic interaction that maintains payments and introduced between ex-spouses and there's a novelty of my model um the findings based on my estimated model are that first of all some policies namely alimony May backfire in terms of providing consumption Insurance the welfare maximizing policy involves increasing child support and reducing alimony and finally comparisons to a hypothetical first best scenario revealed that Pareto games are feasible over the status quo but real world policies fail to implement them okay thanks for tuning in
