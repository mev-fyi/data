okay thank you very much so you know i thought what i would do is you know i have a few related papers i thought i was just going to quickly review a couple ideas from some of my papers and then just present i thought i would a few statistics about nbr working papers that have been sitting around on my hard drive for a number of years that had never fit into any paper and so i thought to give some of those so and i i guess it's sort of the main theme i wanted to stress at the beginning is that you know one might question why is it that this nber working paper phenomenon has continued to to grow and have so many work papers put out when you know in the 1970s nbr working papers served a real purpose you could identify which is you needed to get your papers two people so they could read them and if you put a little yellow cover on them and then stuck them in the mail to 800 institutions and you gave the author 50 free copies that was a way to get your paper out to people um you know that no longer exists that you know your paper is on your own website at the same time it's on the nvr website so why is it that this institution has continued to grow um so anyway a couple ideas i mean i think the main focus i have is that you know the reason nbr players have continued to grow is because our publication process has gotten worse and worse and as some sense the nber working papers are a substitute for the publication process and do what the publication process used to do in economics um so i can talk about two changes one that it's gotten much slower and the other is that journals also are no longer directing what people read um so the first this slow down fact so i have my 2002 jp paper also known as nber working paper 7804 you know i noted that this if you look at one measure of how long it takes published economics but the times when you submit a paper to when it finally gets accepted has grown over the last 30 years and i know someone has extended this some of these series out and i couldn't find it yesterday when i was looking for this but you know roughly it went from you know nine months back in 1970 to two plus years by the year 2000 and i hoped in writing about this that the series would then turn down and that has not happened um so it still takes two years to get paper published but what's also important is it doesn't take two years to get a paper published it'll take two years to get a paper published at the journal that accepts your paper um so then there's another trend this one i took from uh card delavenia nbr working paper 1865. this this chart shows you a graph of a number of papers accepted at top top journals divided by number of papers submitted on average in the previous two years of those journals so you can think of this as a measure of acceptance rate of top journals and what you'll notice is this is 1980 to 2013 1980 those numbers around 15 or so acceptance rates uh 2013 that's maybe like seven percent acceptance rate to top journals you think about it if if every paper is a seven percent chance of getting accepted you know that means you need to do 14 submissions on average before your paper gets accepted 14 times six months is seven years plus two years so that would sort of say that it takes nine years for papers to get published and it you know it's the situation is not that bad yet because many people sort of uh you know many people sort of work their way down to easier to publish journals but it's still i think the typical time you take the time lag in between journals it's many many years before any paper gets published what does this mean you know one is people say you can't publish anything on a topical issue because if you're trying to write about some recent development it's going to be five years old by the time your paper was going to get published in a journal but then it also means that even on non-topical things even if you're just sort of you know you're not working on a public policy you're working on theoretical econometrics you know if you're basing what you're doing off what was in the journal what's the recent journal articles that's what people were doing five years from now you're five years behind the rest of the literature you can't read those papers to sort of keep up with the field so you know what we need we need something you can read more quickly nber papers are something you can read more quickly that someone has just written this paper what have people written either if i'm interested in the topic i want something recent on the topic or if i'm interested in just where is this literature because i want to work on that literature second thing i want to talk about is another paper i have this is nbr working paper 13272. you know i argue that it seems like journals are doing less to affect what people read in the profession this paper had a few different facts put together you know one fact was that if you look at economists at top departments they're publishing less and they're both publishing less than absolute numbers and they're much smaller share of the field journals than they used to be uh second fact is that if you look at people at harvard it's not just the top journals they don't publish anymore they don't publish they don't publish not only field journals the top general interest journals people from harvard also don't publish as much and anymore simultaneously while that's going on though people at harvard they're not publishing in journals but they are being very widely cited they're actually doing better than the other top departments on that metric and then another thing is you run like paper level citation regressions you'll notice that once you condition on the author being famous the journal that a paper is published in the the journal matters less for the citations you know it used to be if you were at harvard and you published in a second tier journal instead of in the aer you'd lose 70 of your citations and it seems like now maybe you only lose 30 of your citations by publishing in a lower rank journal and i guess what ties these facts together what i argue ties these facts together is a model thing about this is just that the journals are just not so important in determining what people read and there's people who need to publish in the journals because you need to publish in journals to get tenure and to you know get promotions and and to get to get hired to get jobs in the first place um but increasingly sort of not publishing is a good alternative because you just you know it's many people their name can get them the attention to the paper so you need their name well you don't just need your name you need your name and you need someone to know that you have a paper and how do people know that you have a paper you can publish in the nbr working paper series the nbr working paper sends out 25 000 emails sometimes it's those 25 000 emails that may be sort of a big part of what the nber is doing and you know obviously there are other institutions ssrn is trying to do this but the problem with ssrn is ssrn has too many emails you know srn has so many emails that people stop reading the emails and finding out what what people have written so the people who are fortunate enough to be able to publish the nber series they can be in sort of a smaller more selective email um that's the way to do it the nbr also is very good at sending out emails not just to economists but to members of the media and so you can be in newspapers and other things for having been in an nbr working paper um so i figured i'd have some data what are facts that i knew now these are not facts that i updated because these are facts have been sitting around my hard disk that i never published um one thing that i did in looking at the 1990s at one point i looked at what share of papers were nber working papers and how does this compare and even by the 90s when there were many fewer nbr working papers than they are now nbr working papers had a fairly substantial share of a number of journals you can see i kind of 22 of aer publications had been nbr working papers 36 of qje papers percent of jpe papers those are big numbers especially when you consider that you know like right and they are half the papers are theoretical and so or half years worth theoretical now it's probably more like 35 or 40 or theoretical but um you know 22 out of 48 means almost like you know half the empirical papers the majority of the empirical papers in the qje were nber working papers that became qje papers um but another thing you do see in this chart is that right the nber i don't know if it's changed but the npr is not everything in the profession you know the nber had five percent of econometrica papers had been nber working papers seven percent of review of economic studies papers and so the question of you know nbr expansion i think that's something the nbr has to decide is does the nbr want to cover the whole of the profession or does the nbr want to be sort of very big and very important in parts of the profession and i guess that's sort of a you know nber policy issue of sort of what areas do they want to cover what areas do they not want to cover you obviously you run into this problem if you become too big you become ssrn and then no one reads your emails anymore and so it's a question of um you know is is there an optimal scale for the nber or how selective does the nbr you know some sense you know the npr is like what journals used to be that they are they are being selective and that's what gives people to pay attention but how selective do you want to be um another fact on your papers is at least in the 1990s nbr working papers are very influential um they're very well cited when i talk about well site here also i'm only talking about citations to the published papers not citations to the nber working paper but so i um this i did run a new regression yesterday so regressing the number of citations that a paper got on a number of explanatory variables for those who haven't seen a citation regression before many many many things are significant in citation regression the things that ought to be significant are the journal in which the paper is published the order in which the paper appears in the table of contents because editors put the often put the better papers earlier in the issue the length of the paper editors give more space papers they think are more important and then many things like how famous the author is like you know how many publications the officer has in recent years what institution the author is from all of those things help predict citations but then you put them in and let me say nbr citations matter too i thought again people the nvr likes data output so i just copied my state output it was the cheapest way to make up a table with this many variants um but you'll see that like right you know the order matters you get a point two two coefficient out of the pieces of six you know the page length gets a statistic of seven the past five variable that's telling you every extra paper you have in the top five journals in the last five years that adds six percent to your citations for each additional paper that's more of the well-known people get cited more the affiliation variable would say that people at harvard or top journals or top schools are 20 more cited than than other people controlling for the journal and where the editor put it but then the nbr effect there is um nber papers are 37 percent more cited than the average paper in that spot in that journal even controlling for the author's recent publication record in the author's institution um so and and you'll see i've got 12 different field dummies down there controlling for international finance and development and labor and pf and whatever so with lots and lots of controls nber papers are more influential if you want to also ask where does it come from does it come from the qj i think it's always a thing you want to do with the nber and the answer here is no like the nbrq interaction is negative not quite significant but sort of say in the qj the nbr papers are only about 10 more widely cited but it's in the other top journals that nber papers get a lot of citations again data from the 1990s not totally up to date but that's what i had thank you thank you
