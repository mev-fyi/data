anecdotally in this country african-american men are less likely to seek out prevented care than other demographic groups and they also have higher rates of medical mistrust um some of that has been discussed in the literature as being related to this horrific incident in our history of the tuskegee syphilis experiment which was carried out on african-american men between 1932 and 1972. in 1972 a whistleblower took the story to the news and and it became public knowledge that this was going on that there were men in the south that were being deceived thought they were being treated by uh by doctors by public health officials and in fact were just being experimented on many of whom were dying we used the sharp timing event in 1972 when it was revealed by a whistleblower that this was occurring and became common knowledge we used that event along with demographic characteristics and geographic characteristics to identify that that disclosure event reduced healthcare utilization and increased medical mistrust specifically among african-american men african-american men live on average about five years less than their nearest neighbor which would be in life expectancy neighbor which is non-hispanic white men some of these causes of death might surprise you it's not due to the gap is not explained by things like homicides or even hiv aids which disproportionately affect the african-american community but it's actually explained by more mundane if you will causes such as cardiovascular disease and cancer and why that's interesting is because again many of those diseases can be cured or at least the mortality risks can be can be displaced into the future if someone has access or avails themselves of primary or secondary prevention there was about a third reduction in healthcare utilization and a pretty significant increase in immortality related to the disclosure event as well as this increase in medical mistrust i led me down the path of thinking well what could be done we were able to construct a clinic run a clinic out of oakland california recruit african-american men from the surrounding alameda county mainly from black barber shops which are which are really comfortable familiar gathering places where you can get a really broad cross-section of the african-american male community and then we were able to randomly assign them to either african-american male doctors or white asian doctors and after providing them with free transportation providing them with free services so kind of getting rid of all the constraints in terms of transportation or in terms of cost what we were able to kind of narrowly focus on this question of wood concordance between the race of the doctor and the race of the patient would that actually make a difference and improve the take-up of medical care among among this particular group and we found that it did we found that it mattered quite a bit
