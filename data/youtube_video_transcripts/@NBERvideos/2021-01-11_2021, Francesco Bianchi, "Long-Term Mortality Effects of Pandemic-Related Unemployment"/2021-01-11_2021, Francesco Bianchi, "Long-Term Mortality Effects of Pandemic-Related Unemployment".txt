this is joint work with jada bianchi from harvard medical school and dongo song from johns hopkins university so in macroeconomics a more injury in the policy debate has been a lot of discussion about the short-term trade-off between containing the pandemic and preserving meta-economic activity we feel there's been much less discussion about what could be the potential long-term consequences of the kovid 19 economic distress so this paper is interesting this particular question so what we are interested in is that trying to understand if a severe economic distress can have long-term consequences on mortality rates and life expectancy so to answer this question we're going to adopt a time series approach so what that means we are going to look at the historical relation between the growth rate of life expectancy and death rate and unemployment rate so just to give you an idea of the data these are the series for life expectancy death rate and employment rate for the overall u.s population that would be the black dash line for the white population that would be the green lines and for the african-american population red lines we couldn't get data on other groups identified on gender and rates so what you can see is that thankfully uh uh human well-being has been improved over time so we see that life expenses and has been increasing the death rate has been declining and what you can see is that also the difference across the races have been declining so african americans tend to experience higher levels of death rate but this has been declining over time and similarly men tend to have a higher death rate and lower life expectancy than women and also this difference has been declining over time at the same time if you look at the plot for the unemployment rate you can see that african-americans tend to have higher levels of unemployment and more volatile unemployment rates so what we're going to do is to put these three series into a the regression so in particular we're going to have the growth rate of life expectancy the growth rate of the mortality rates and the level of unemployment so we are going to recognize that variables like life expectancy and death rates are not perfectly observable so we're going to allow for an observation error and we're going to estimate these uh with the bayesian methods so just to give you an idea about what this observation error does here i'm reporting the growth rate of the original variables life expectancy and death rate with the green line that would be the filter series that comes out of our exercise so what you can see is that these uh bayesian approaches gets rid of these very high frequency movements in the growth rate of life expectancy and death rate but preserves the core dynamics of the variables so now the second step is to look at the historical effects of an employment shock on these two variables so here we need to make some assumptions in particular we are going to identify the shocks using a so-called cholesky decomposition and so there's some identifying assumptions that a shock to the unemployment rate can start affecting death rates and life expectancy with a leg in the paper we also consider a different identifying assumptions in which we allow the opposite scenario in which all the co-movement between these variables on impact is due to the unemployment rate the effects for the long run are similar so we're going to focus on this particular identification strategy in the interest of time so what you can see is that a shock to the unemployment rate uh is very persistent so after six years there's still a probability that the unemployment rate is not back to where it was before the shock and it tends to have important effects on the growth rate of the death rate and the growth rate of life expectancy in particular the death rate goes up following the shock we can repeat the exercise looking at the different groups that we identify based on gender and race so here again the red lines correspond to the african-american population the green lines to the uh correspond to the white population and the black dash line is the overall u.s population so what you can see from this graph if you focus on the top panel is that a shock to uh unemployment seems to be followed by uh stronger responses for african-americans now this is in part due to the fact that this group experiences larger shocks so if you look at the impulse response for the unemployment rate you can see that the red line start from a higher point so part of the stronger response is actually due to the size of the initial shock so in the second row what we do is we normalize initial shock to be one percent for all groups and some interesting findings uh come out first if you look at life expectancy you still find that the african-american population experiences a larger decline in the growth rate of life expectancy but when you look at the death rate you see that white women tend to have a stronger response they want to control for the size of the shock and white men tend to have in the long run a stronger response so now we get to the core of the paper that is how do we use this historical evidence to understand the cov19 unemployment shock so the first thing we want to do is to get a sense of how big the kovit 19 unemployment shock was with respect to the typical innovation to unemployment so we do some identification in in the paper and we find that the kovi 19 shock was a three standard deviation with respect to the typical unemployment innovation and what is interesting here is that if you look at the different groups if you focus on the first column where the shocks are measured with respect to the typical shock to that group you will find something that has been discussed often also in the press that white women have been particularly affected by these recessions so you have that for them the shock was almost five standard deviations with respect to the typical shock now if you look at the absolute magnitude that would be the right-hand side the right column you see that african-americans nevertheless still have a larger shock it's just because for them shocks tend to be larger in general so with respect to the historical evidence it's not particularly large shock but when when you compare the absolute magnitudes african-americans are still more heavily affected than the other groups so then we uh try to understand what is the cumulative effect of this shock at different horizons so you can see here we computed the percentage change in life expectancy 5 10 15 and 20 years out and let's focus on the third column 15 years out we see that there is a decline in 0.5 percent in life expectancy that translates into 0.4 years in terms of life expectancy what about the death rate again focusing on uh the overall population that's the first row third column we see a three percent increase in the age-adjusted death rate and different place in 22 years uh sorry 22 additional deaths every 100 000 citizens so when we look at the cross-group comparison here we see that for white men we get a significant increase of 15 years out when we look at life expectancy going back for a second we see that african-americans again 15-year horizons have a short ever ever very sharp decline in life expectancy uh what if we want to translate these into actual death i i talked about the change in the definitely i want to try to get a sense of how many excess deaths we are going to have uh down the road so here the exercise is to compare what would happen with and without unemployment unemployment shock so in the paper we explained how we reconstructed the population in the two cases it's less simple than what it it could seem and what we find is that uh the additional death at the 15 years horizon for the world population would be 0.89 sorry 0.9 million so a very large number when we look at the different uh groups we find uh 180 000 and 270 000 additional deaths at the 15 and 20 years horizon for the african-american population just to put this into perspective this corresponds to 0.35 and 0.5 percent of the projected african-american population when we look at the white population we find that 0.8 million and 1.2 millions at the 15 and 20 years horizon and to put again this into perspective is 0.3 and 0.45 percent of the white population so again there is a slightly larger effect on the african-american population but i i would say that the effects are larger for for all groups and they're they seem to be equally distributed between uh men and women okay so let me give you a brief discussion of what we're how to interpret these results okay so first of all let me say upfront that this paper is not about uh claiming that we shouldn't have lockdowns so uh we see that there are studies these days that show that there are at least thousand 1000 lives that have been saved thanks to lockdowns so we are not trying to argue against this we are trying to bring attention that there is also a cost associated with the recession that is mostly experienced in the long run the second thing to keep in mind is that we use historical data and that's the only thing we can do uh to try to forecast what's going to happen in the future so there are series of factors that could make our results uh better or worse for example strong policy interventions could reduce the long-term impact on human well-being we need to take into account that this is the first recession with the affordable care act but there are also some factors that could make things worse so first of all there is limited access to health care there is a temporary discontinuation of preventive care then many employees have lost private insurance and more in general many citizens are reluctant to see a doctor because they're afraid of the contagion so to conclude so we find that unemployment shocks can have a long lasting impact on uh death rates and life expectancy where in full support of whatever measures the policy makers retain is necessary to contain the pandemics on the other hand we want to bring out bring attention to the fact that if the goal is to save lives we should try to do this both in the short run and in the long run and so additional economic measures and health measures are necessary thank
