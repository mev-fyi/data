uh honored to be here today a little bit scared it's a most nervous I've been in my 33 years of doing this because this is the first time I've talked about something where I can see a lot of people in the audience that I know a lot they know a lot more about it than I do um but uh here it goes so I wrote a book that was published in 2018 called information incentives and education policy um and uh the goal of the book was to uh kind of teach people who worked more empirical people who worked in the economics of Education what I thought I had learned from Al and Paul and Prague and others and to try to put it in all one in one book and put it together and um the theme of the book is that there are a set of policies that are viewed by education policy people as either ORS as alternatives and the theme of the book is they would probably be best viewed as compliments and you saw some of that today uh in in what Prague said and so we usually think about people who want to have accountability who want to close or punish schools that are low performing and we think about choice where people want to expand the what with vouchers or um with Charter Schools and we think about we think about these uh assignment mechanisms that take what the parents know and allocate uh people to schools based on what the parents have that is not uh in the accountability metrics and the argument I make in the book is that rather than viewing those as separate things the optimal system is probably one that involves all of those pieces and then uh as I was writing the book I started to realize this um and then it became more clear as I went on that there's probably a pre-stage of deciding what information the parents don't have that they need to have to participate in an effective manner on behalf of their children because another theme in the book is that there's two Agency problems one is between the taxpayer and the entities that are providing Education Services but the other is the the agency problem between parents and their children because the money's being given to the parents to use on behalf of the children and you can have situations where the parents don't make a great choice all right so I just said all this this is Derek Neal uh presentation Style say it all and then turn the turn the slot over um the other thing that I would add to it is I've got this 2012 paper with Gotti bar Levy called paper percentile and it makes the point that you can get away with a lot of the problems with value at you can get away from a lot of the manipulation problems that are present with value added by focusing on performance metrics that are ordinal and the basic idea is you take every student and place the student in a league with all the other students in the state that are comparable in terms of their demographics and their past achievement Etc at the end of the year Johnny gets a number on his head that is his percentile ranking if it's 0.7 he beats 70 percent of the kids in his League and then the performance metric for the teacher or the school or the team of teachers is a weighted average of those winning percentages and the weights are the prize in a lazier Rosen tournament where there were just two kids in League competing and it turns out that I think that's a much more effective way to keep score both for paying out performance stuff but also for accountability reporting because it's much easier to explain to people here is the percentile performance index of this school for children like your child and kids in this school that are like your child beat 70 of the other kids that are like your kid on the end of year exam and I think that's you know in terms of transparency and and communicating things to help parents make good decisions I like that better than value added and there's a large literature I won't go in today about because it's not scale dependent uh you avoid some other problems okay I wrote chapter six saying we need to bundle all of these things in 2017 and now I I wish I had written it a little bit differently and so I'm going to go over what I think I got right and then I want to talk about my do-overs okay here the part the most important part I got right I stole from Prague I would recommend everyone read his 2016 World Congress paper because I think uh very much in the in the theme of what Mark Miller had to say and very much in the theme of what other people have had to say today transparency and simplicity when you implement these things it's very important for getting past uh political economy barriers that allow you to actually have a reform that lasts and transparency is hard to formalize okay but this is I guess Prague is free to interrupt and correct me if I got this wrong but what I what I took from this was that it's a blend of positive and normative it means strategy proof okay and so we're not going to waste it has a positive benefit of no wasted resources on gaming like we saw in the 2008 paper and if the no gaming becomes common knowledge that's a very important political benefit if everyone believes that everyone believes that we're just reporting truthfully then people are less likely to feel that you know I'm going to listen to this Facebook group that says we're all being taken advantage of and it also reassures people that there's not some in-group connected with the city that their kids are getting special treatment and I think if you read the history of the last 20 years if you don't have those things it's hard to keep these types of reforms going okay and so I came up with this definition an assignment mechanism is transparent if the agency running the mechanism establishes the following as common knowledge simple rules that are that all understand these rules of the game and do simple non-strategic decisions these decisions rely on a limited set of information more on that below this is where I started to confuse myself and out comes respect announced priorities okay now this is where I may get in trouble uh because the people who actually understand auctions may come up to me afterwards and tell me I never really understood this but I spent a lot of time reading this famous Wilson paper okay and he laments back in 85 the way that game theory was approaching auctions and he was saying you know these models require all of this knowledge about what everybody else knows and the players have to be super computers and then the equilibrium you get out of it can be very sensitive to all the details of this laundry list of things that you assume and so he writes this as a believer that practice advances before Theory and that the task of theory is to explain how it is that practitioners are usually right I see a plausible conjecture these institutions survive because the employee trading rules that are efficient for a wide class of environments and I have this deep-seated conviction there there is a connection between the Wilson conjecture and the Apothic conjecture okay and they both involve D.A so Wilson seems to assert the double auctions are robust in a positive sense that over a wide range of environments optimal play does not require participants know everything or have access to con super computers optimal bids or ask are close to values and costs And Trades are close to it efficient the institution is stable because it exhausts gains from trade and Prague seems to be saying that deferred acceptance can have a similar type of stability property if it leads to simple truthful reporting and the system respects the priorities so that people see X post that it ran the way it was advertised to run and it exhausts gains from trade in that respecting those priorities you get the student optimal match now where I get a little nervous about this is that the people at the auction do this for a living and in Reading Adam's papers and and and perox paper in Louisiana Etc I think a lot of the problems that come in this literature come from the fact that people enter these mechanisms once or twice in their life as parents and so it's the job of the guy that's going to the auction to trade to know valuations right it's it's so this says to me that if we really want to go fully down this road that we need to think about how we're going to help the parents with their information problems the irony is I still believe there are things the parents know that we can't put in a data set that are important for allocation and so now I think of these Central lies assignment mechanisms in two different ways that kind of conflict with each other we want to figure out what parents know and try to find a way to use that for accountability without destroying the strategy proof at the same time we want to figure out what they don't know that they need to know and give it to them before they play and I think that tension of thinking of this two-way information flow is is an exciting area to think about going forward if you have costly information D.A doesn't work as well and so my first do-over is if I had uh uh if I had it all to write again I would rewrite chapter six and say here's something else that's complementary giving parents what they need to know that they don't know before you start okay and I skipped something here oh I skipped this I'm not a good theorist but even I can rig up a little model that makes three points if information is costly you can have altruistic parents who correctly decide not to invest in information for three rational reasons one is they might have strong preferences over another school attribute it could be commuting time it could be some like Band program and their kids really into music the other is that the cost of acquiring the information are high relative to the likelihood that would actually change the ranking and here's the one I think is most related to what Prague said depending on how you set up the priorities and what the supply of good schools are there could be a rational parent that says if I do all this work and I figure it out and I do the ranking I'm not going to get those better schools anyway the the equilibrium will strike back against me and so why bother okay and I think that logic is part of why Adam found what he found in Chile or Chile um we I have so many former graduate students that uh from there I I get embarrassed when I say it wrong so how much time do I have I'm over six minutes good okay I can go back to speaking at Georgia speed now all right so there's a paper in the qje that Adam and Chris and others uh published and it uh really makes a strong case that um parents don't understand um how these systems work they they found a group of parents who put very short lists relative to what you would need to list to make sure that you got some assignment and weren't in this secondary Market now maybe what I said before is uh kind of a rationale for why they did this um what we do know is they responded not some but not all responded to ex-post nudges to say you're sure you don't want to lengthen your list and I think we need a model and a lot of research and Adam tells me he's doing this about why it's so common for uh parents not to really understand how things work for them not to fill out a long list Etc and we need research on that to figure out what types of information interventions could get better inputs into these mechanisms to start with and my hunch is although I don't know how to prove it is that good X anti-information is going to be more valuable than kind of nudging people middle way through the process um there are these papers on structurally estimating uh uh preferences given and then doing simulations with different assignment mechanisms another good atom paper shows that even though it was a great step forward uh when chaofu and others discovered that there was a way to do this where you only had to assume that the players knew the marginal probabilities and that made these papers much easier to follow that's not quite enough because if you believe the New Haven data they don't know anything they really don't understand how the system works they don't understand what their marginal probabilities are of getting into anything if they listed it and you know it's it's not just Chile Connecticut's not any better and so the the parents really don't know what they're doing when they interact with these mechanisms um and then if you look at vouchers and I think this is important because all the red States now for good or for ill are passing voucher please we're going to confront an opportunity to go to these states if all of these things pass and say look if you actually want this to work and you want this to be stable and you don't want the train wreck we had in Louisiana you should combine this with an accountability mechanism that closes the bad voucher schools and has real you know restrictions on authorization and that provides information about academic performance X ante before we run the mechanism and that we have a well-functioning DA thing where all schools participate on equal footing so that we can build faith that this is actually a system that works um and so I'm very much team we have to increase the supply of good schools there's a little the transition between the chapter on mechanisms and the chapters on choice in my book is entitled rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic and uh and and I I think that that is the like subheading that I'd put under the abstract when frog publishes the New York City paper because it's just there's not enough good schools to really make big progress by assigning them better one minute uh same song second verse in uh Romania although I believe these guys really are not thinking about it the right way they show that there's a high correlation between rankings and value added for these high schools in Romania and then they show they can give better information and improve that a little bit and then they're puzzled that they don't get all the way to one well we don't want to get all the way to one part of running these assignment mechanisms is the belief that the parents know things that the planner doesn't know and that the planner can't create and put in statistics without causing a problem and as I said somewhere in these slides when it comes to reporting these accountability measures you can run from homesteman Milgram but you can't hide there is always somebody out there that is trying to find a hidden action strategy for gaming any system you come up with including the one that I proposed with Gotti in the 2012 paper okay so the second do-over um is that and we don't want to create the US News this is I said it and then hit the thing and then the last two over is the following um normal D.A is complete information and we want to think about two-way information flow the parents know things that we want to infer from the mechanism I think a big research agenda would be how can you do that and keep strategy proven right how can you but and here's the thing I've always said you know spot inspections we see that nobody picks the school nobody within a mile of this school picks it even though it has an acceptable academic rating maybe it's time for a School inspection um and I won't do the conclusion because I'm over and I basically am just repeating Prague anyway
