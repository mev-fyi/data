well okay never things are never dull thank you rob uh thank you jim uh we're delighted to start the second the second round of of the covet and health uh conference uh sponsored by nber and i'm especially delighted to uh introduce uh david cutler who will be talking about motor vehicle accidents just in terms of the framework as you could hear probably this is being recorded so that we can post it later to live stream for people who couldn't uh get on this meeting um there will be uh if if for co if there are co-authors involved during the talk you should feel free to ask questions in chat i'll try to come back to some of those um and co-authors should feel free to respond as well um figure 18 to 20-minute presentation and we have 30 minutes for each person so david the floor is yours thank you great and it's lovely to see everyone um again on the second part of our meeting let me uh let me share my screen [Music] and so the first thing i want to check is can you um can everyone see the the screen excellent okay and um i i'm going to open the chat it's actually just just me on this um uh so i will not be responding to comments during the talk but i will um uh try and save a uh a copy of them so this is a paper it's sort of an unusual paper in that every day that i work on the paper the number of data points grows um so i've sort of rarely had had a situation like that it's about a topic uh on uh motor vehicle fatalities in the coped recession let me sort of explain kind of the genesis of this because it's not not sort of the usual type of thing i work on so since um uh chris room's work um now a couple of decades ago it's been one of the truisms of uh health economics has been that mortality falls in recessions um and uh at least one of the big reasons why that's the case is because motor vehicle uh fatalities fall in recessions now actually just to set terms for a second motor vehicle fatalities involve two things one is it involves occupants to the cars the driver and the passengers and second it involves non-occupants pedestrians who may get hit by a car so that's included there as well so so so that was all fine you know taking that as given and then over the spring and into the summer there were a bunch of reports like what i've shown you here about you know people are driving faster on roads and the number of automobile accidents that very high speeds is going up and motor vehicle fatalities continue to rise and so on so so that sort of led me to think in my mind about the question of is this current uh recession or the impact of covets sort of having a different impact on motor vehicle fatalities than in the past and if so why and so that's what i want to talk about this paper is not done so what what happened was it was sort of bubbling over in my mind as you know we sort of uh uh the nia has been pushing us to think about the impact of covid on the economy and so in light of that i said well why don't i uh try and take a little piece of this and just try and see what's going on so there are two sorts of things one is sort of is it different that is are those headlines are those anecdotal headlines actually data that is is is there a different um uh trend in motor vehicle fatalities now than than one would have guessed and the answer to that is very clearly yes as i'll show you in just a couple of minutes and so that that part all had pretty certain the second uh part is a little bit more difficult which is why is that um and there are at least a couple of different hypotheses and i'll look at one of them today and i'll come back to some of the others later on um but the two sort of basic hypotheses that you can think of they're probably more one is that um speed increases have offset the value of fewer cars on the road so you can think about this as a little bit like a model where you know what people do is they hold constant the probability of being in a serious accident so if they're fewer cars i'm going to drive faster um and that will um then offset the the the uh reduction in the the chance of hitting in in the number of people to hit the second one is that um the um and this is what i'll be able to look at more today which is that um different act different driving has different amounts of uh fatality probability associated with it so driving slowly on a local road is not particularly uh high on the fatality list whereas driving your motors riding your motorcycle on the interstate is and so some of what may have happened is a reduction in the kind of safe driving and less of a reduction in the unsafe driving for example unsafe driving isn't it includes an accident with a truck on an interstate and if you say well now everybody's at home so we're having more trucks bring things to people then you may not have had a big reduction in the risk of uh of an accident should one occur so so i'll try and look at things like characteristics of who's striving to see how that's changed during uh during the recession just a little bit going from the anecdotes first to the um uh to to to a little bit more in the data i've sort of tried to get a sense that i'll know much more about this for some sense but i've tried to get a sense about are people really speeding a lot more so this is data from alabama on what percentage of the speeding tickets given out are at very high speeds so you can see 1 to 20 miles above the speed limit 20 to 35 35 to 50 and then greater than 50. so the the share of tickets that are over 30 my 35 miles per hour above this speed limit has gone up uh quite a lot in uh 2020 relative to 2019. if you look at montana this i just sort of tried to google around and see where i could get data if you look at montana the average speed over the speed limit for tickets has gone uh up quite a lot if you look at uh minnesota the share of tickets very high levels have gone up a lot this is so so so it's very clear that there are more people who are speeding of course or more people who are who are getting a ticket for very high levels of speeding unclear whether that's more speeding or whether the police are not pulling people over if they're only going five miles per hour above the speed limit either because it's deemed to be safer because they don't want to be interacting with people as much so so so this is just sort of a little bit of information so what i want to do first and this is the part i think as i say i can be somewhat more convincing on is is there a different relationship between motor vehicle fatalities and um the economy now than there has been for some period of time so i want to do that chris's room and his work of course used sort of state level data over time i actually don't want to set up the panel that way i want to look at the aggregate data and i just want to show you about some of the aggregate data the state level data i'll show you a little bit about is basically going to give you the exact same finding but so what i'm going to do what i did was i took long-term data on motor vehicle fatalities um per person and then i just want to sort of set up a prediction model for what should have happened if 2020 looked like previous years so i'm going to estimate the model i've got monthly data so i'm going to estimate the model of deaths per person on the unemployment rate so that's the key economic measure the relative price of gasoline which is going to influence how much people drive um but time trends and then i'm going to take out monthly effects because there's a huge bunch of monthly effects and how much people drive and fatalities of driving and so on and so i'm going to estimate that through 2019 and then i'm going to compare through 2020. the reason why i'm not so concerned about the exact specification here is you're just going to see that the outliers in 2020 are just immense so there's like almost nothing that's a specification that you could possibly think of the specification is doing that would affect this um the data come from various different reports supplied by states that are uh collected uh and put together so let me show you first just kind of a picture of is 2020 difference so what you're seeing here is the trend in motor vehicle deaths per 100 000 people um and that's a number that's gone down over time in fact if i'd gone back further it would have gone down even more so very big reductions in motor vehicle deaths um they go down a lot the shaded areas are recessions i haven't yet shown you kogits i'm i've left off the last few data points which i'll show you in just a second so so the the so so this is showing you that you can fit the model pretty well so in recessions so the key point you want to take from this is that in recessions that's this fall and this is exactly chris room's point so this is not at all anything new that i'm telling you here um if you then look at the prediction for 2020 and i'll show you this in a little more detail on the next slide the prediction given what happened to unemployment is this red line which is a massive decrease in deaths per capita what we got was this blue line which is a massive increase in deaths per capita and so let me show you this here this is just showing you how well the model fits from 2019 and 2020 so that the predict the model fits very well in 2019 um and then if you look at what happened in 2020 um you can see the prediction goes way down so it should have fallen by you know roughly uh 20 or 30 percent um and in fact aside from deaths falling in the month of april in every other month actually motor vehicle deaths have gone up relative to the past so and and the the volume of traffic on roads has gone down enormously but um uh but uh but the the the debts have have uh actually gone up again with you with the exception of the one month um this is march where half the month was sort of closed down uh april and so on um when what when uh people look at this they tend to look at uh divide this into two things one is what's happened to driving that is how many miles are people driving and then second is what's happening to the fatality rate associated with each mile driven and those may differentially be influenced by uh by recessions so i just want to do that a little bit here to to show you so this is um what's happening to uh miles driven you can see that again if you look at the red line miles driven fall in typical recessions so if you were to relate this to the unemployment rate you'd clearly see a negative impact of motor vehicles miles driven per capita um you would have expected given the increase in unemployment rates you would have expected some reduction in miles driven um in fact it was a much greater reduction in miles driven than one would have guessed i think in part that's because many of us like us don't have to drive anywhere but we're not unemployed so when you had to go to a job it was sort of uh there was some amount of driving that had to happen and i think some of what this is picking up is the people who don't need to drive uh but can still work and so so the unemployment rate uh it didn't go up by as much uh relative to the miles falling that then means and this is the other part here that then means that deaths per mile driven have increased enormously so again you would have guessed in a recession that in a typical recession deaths per mile actually fall and here they've they've just astronomically shot up by roughly the equivalent of 20 years worth of progress in deaths per mile so this sort of recession has basically erased about what the last 20 years or so of you know 20 to 30 years of uh of progress would be one other thing i was sort of interested and i see that frank had has a comment about uh about the geographic component which i've done a little bit on and i want to do and i want to do somewhat more um uh oh uh angus uh sorry sorry in response i guess this question i all those pictures i took out the mo i took i seasonally adjusted them so i took out all the all the monthly effects to otherwise you would just be dominate it would just look like a jagged line i wanted to to to get rid of those so i did a little bit of poking around about you know what's going on so this is just the change in the number of motor vehicle deaths um for the period april through october of 2020 relative to april through october of 2019 and this is the change in vehicle miles traveled over the same period of time so first thing you can see is that everywhere has had a massive reduction in vehicle miles traveled so a mean would be about 20 percent reduction in uh 20 long long scale uh uh vehicle miles traveled and then you can see the increase in um motor vehicle or change in motor vehicle deaths in a couple of states it's gone down john skinner new hampshire is the big winner here massachusetts i'm going to show you more data about in just a little bit so massachusetts is just about zero very slight decline and then you can see some increases many of these are very small small uh states the the red line here is the weighted uh regression line uh so it's so there's a very slight uh but non-significant relationship between these um so there's there's it doesn't look like there's anything you know it looks like these are basically dissociated from each other which really uh surprised me some this is total deaths what that means is that in areas where miles traveled fell by more deaths per mile rose by more so that these are so that you know these states had higher increases in fatalities per uh mile driven than these areas over here just to give you a sense of what we're looking at relative to the this is kind of the 2000 the great recession and the great recession reduced um uh miles driven by a couple of percent so these are far far greater than anything in the great recession one of my one of the questions which i haven't done enough on yet is why is this different than the great recession and part of my hypothesis maybe these declines were so big that you get a different response when the roads are really clear versus only slightly clearer so maybe there's a non-linear response i have not looked at that at all but i'm gearing up to try and do that if your favorite measure of recessions is unemployment this is showing you the change in the unemployment rate and and uh motor vehicle deaths again there's basically no relationship it is the case you know that this line is downward sloping kind of like the chris room uh fact would give you which is that higher unemployment is slightly lower uh deaths but in fact everywhere it's above zero it's never below zero and it's not a statistically significant negative line so i'm basically just going to take this as sort of these two are unrelated and at least my first pass is that these two are unrelated okay so um so so that then sort of leaves leads me into the second part of this which is why did deaths per mile or increase uh so much and so the model that i have sort of loosely here is that someone makes a driving decision that is they want to drive or they have to drive for work and then there are a few characteristics that influence um the accident probability um they typically get divided into three groups there's human characteristics of which one of the ones here is speed so that's obviously the one that that i'm going to focus on more but there are things like drug and alcohol use safety belt usage so on a little bit less clear why those should respond all those frank sloane notes there were changes in the uh ability to access uh uh bars um over this time period so that's something that i'm going to try and look at as well their vehicle characteristics what type of car it is and then their environmental characteristics the weather and is the road glare and things like that those all influence whether there's an accident and then that and then sometimes the accident is fatal so so what i want to think about here is how much of what's happening in terms of more deaths per uh mile driven is changes in who's on the road that is maybe it's still high-risk vehicles that are on the road and changes in the driving behavior and in particular speed although i'm happy to include the others as well that might influence both the accident probability and the probability that have a condition on an accident that it turns out to be a fatal accident so that's what i want to try and look at the national data don't have anything on the number of accidents over time so they they nor do you so you don't know like for example how many non-fatal accidents there are and of what types they are and so on so i can't actually do this second part nationally the way that i'd like to so what i'm going to do and i've i've got some of it here and more of it's going to be coming i'm basically assembling a ton of information from one state that does have a lot of this which is uh massachusetts so massachusetts has public records of all the automobile accidents so any accident is supposed to be reported if it's involves physical injury or property damage uh in an amount of a thousand dollars or more um either an individual or police officer can file it and then it would be verified by the police who then file a a report this is typically done for both liability reasons and for insurance reasons so there's a reason this would want to be accurate massachusetts also has actually very good data which i'm in the process of sort of downloading and assembling and all on vehicle miles driven on each road so they're a bunch of stations so the way you get vehicle miles driven is there a bunch of stations so there's a different stations in on a bunch of different roads they measure the number of cars going by so you can get volumes and you can get speeds because they measure speeds of cars uh so the department of transportation keeps a lot of of that data so let me uh show you a little bit so first first thing i want to show you is well are there you know maybe what's happened to the number of uh automobile accidents right so when i showed you the first the chart earlier on on automobile accidents which are on automobile deaths and vehicle miles driven the sort of hypothesis is with fewer vehicle miles driven there should be fewer accidents so what i want to show you here is what's happened over time to the number of accidents and and both any accident and then fatal accidents so there's a little bit of a busy chart the blue line here is uh vehicle miles traveled so you can see vehicle miles traveled um is generally pretty flat a little bit declining early in 2020 and then of course it falls enormously it falls by about 40 percent in massachusetts before recovering close to where uh it was in the beginning of 2019 below where you would have guessed it would be uh since vehicle miles travel tend to increase during the year the orange line is any crash so any crash with reasonable property damage and so on and that's actually gone down by even more so the number of crashes has gone down by uh roughly the same amount if anything a little bit greater than the um uh than than the vehicle miles driven what has not changed at all is the number of fatal crashes um and in this case what i'm showing you is crashes involving an occupant fatality so not not a pedestrian fatality so because i want to get away from who's outside and on the street and stuff like that and then as and as we're talking about that's the thing that's actually increased so there's basically been this sort of big divergence in that there are fewer accidents but the ones that are occurring are much more likely to be fatal um i tried doing so so i can this data go back and i've got the data going back and stuff this is the data from the great recession i haven't yet sort of estimated the full time series model yet um one of the things so so this is the the black line here is the dating of the great recession so pre and post the great recession and you can see sort of relative to what was a flat trend particularly in 2009 when the unemployment rate is at its peak i think jim is that the peak unemployment 2009 or 10. um vehicle miles crashes are definitely lower in 2009 10 than they were uh prior to that so that's um different uh that that's the same as as the um uh uh uh what i was just showing you for the covid recession and you know i'll do this a little bit more formally but it kind of looks like with a couple of exceptions that fatal crashes are down as well in the great recession whereas that's that not quite as much as the as the overall crashes but that clearly looks different here here's there's there's like a huge um difference and you're not seeing a gap you're seeing a little bit of a gap but a much smaller gap between the two in this figure than in the previous figure so that's i think part of the difference is that this recession is sort of uniquely different in terms of the crashes that are happening are more likely to be fatal let me just show you a little bit about what are the what types of things are becoming more fatal and what's going on so um i want to see how high-risk driving has changed so i need to define high-risk driving so um i can tell since i have data on every crash and i know if it was fatal i could estimate the probability that any particular crash is fatal using a bunch of characteristics and then i can predict whether that crash would have been fatal or not and then i can see i'm going to leave speed out of this because i don't really know speed for them all and then i can see whether the fatality the actual fatality associated with crashes which ones got more fatal and is that plausibly because speed will have gone up so let me just show you a little bit about the the um uh fatality risks i have a bunch of things that i can look at characteristics of the vehicle is it a motorcycle a car truck and so on the type of collision the time in the day what type of road all sorts of stuff like that um just to show you where people die so there are two types of of uh of uh basic ways one is um you're in a car and the car is in somewhere driving fast in interstate or whatever what what are these sort of big highways so that's so that's the first way you die the second way is you're a pedestrian and you're either crossing a very busy non-interstate or you're like in a parking lot you get hit by a car and then you um and then you uh get uh uh killed from that um if you look at the predicted risk it's actually extremely uh spread so it's um almost all crashes involve very little fatality risk with the exception that a few involve higher where higher is two percent so two percent of these crashes will turn out to be fatal um i'm going to divide them into kind of very low risk medium risk and high risk and what i can what i show you here is what is happening to the number of crashes by risk status and you can see that actually the the highest risk crashes decline decline by less so part of what's going on in 2020 is that the miles driven are actually declining more in the pla in the miles that are not likely to be fatal and so this is some of it i haven't yet compared this to to the great recession but that's one of my questions is whether whether this is different so at least part of it is we shouldn't be quite so surprised because the cars and the trucks that are most likely to have um uh fatal uh accidents are still on the road at least not they haven't gone off the road as much even conditional on that though high-risk accidents are more likely to be fatal than they used to be so if you take the highest risk accidents the probability that they result in death to an occupant has gone up um so there's some composition change but there's still some effect which is that the same accident is more likely to be fatal and that's um perhaps because of speed and as i said i'm in the process of matching this up with data on speeds on the roadways where people are going and how many cars we're traveling there so i can look a little bit more carefully at is it the case that in roads that became vastly depopulated by cars people just sped up more and therefore crashes when they occurred become more fatal and and is that what's going on here so that's that's that's where i am at the moment let me stop here and kind of open it up i saw a bunch of uh notes going by which i didn't uh uh follow all of but i'll let john skinner take over this is great thank you uh really really interesting and if anybody can explain why vermont's at the top and new hampshire's at the bottom it seems like i mean we even share a school district with vermont so so it's it's uh it's sort of curious uh if it's okay let me read you know one question was um uh so janet curry started off a a thread and and if you want to jump in and ask yourself but it it was basically about like are there different people driving people who aren't in school uh are they uh you know who are the people who the riskiness of people who still drive that people who ignore the stay-at-home things are they inherently different than like crazy drivers um yeah so that's on the that's some of this issue on the composition of the cars so i know less about who's driving than i do about who is involved in an accident um so i will be able to look in and see about that i don't um uh i so you know so for example i can do the i can look at you know for what share what what is the rate of accidents among say teen drivers or the rate of accidents among um you know different types of drivers so so and and those are a little bit wrapped up in that kind of composition thing that i showed you because those are all associated with the fatality probability but i but um uh what i don't have what i don't have data on is kind of how many people are just on the road of different characteristics so like i don't know you know out of everyone on the road in april what share the drivers are younger or older or um you know more likely to be whatever i will i will know about the types of cars about the the you know what what class of cars there but i won't know about other characteristics so i i just want to jump in and share an anecdote quickly which is where my comment was coming from which is that in this spring in new york city there were people drag racing down major thoroughfares including you know we have an apartment on riverside drive there was drag racing like all night on riverside drive you couldn't sleep and there was spectacular footage of crashes being shared on twitter you know where people were going and lost control of their vehicles hit parked cars went through store windows and so on so you could um uh definitely motivate some of this with that and and the thing is that that just never happens during a regular recession and i think it was also compounded by the fact that for a while the the police kind of pulled back giving anybody a ticket so uh you know because of all the other events that were going on so there were a number of very unique features of this and one of the things one i'm sorry one of the things janet that your comments suggested is that um there could be a non-linearity here that is that if the roads get really clear then you have a very big increase in in deaths because people will drive a whole lot faster whereas what you'd normally think about here your first thought to think about here is oh okay i'm not stuck in rush hour traffic it's hard to kill yourself from rush hour traffic because you're not going fast enough but now if rush hour has got fewer cars i get to drive a little bit faster during rush hour and the keys that may not be enough because you still may not be able to drive fast enough to do real serious damage whereas when the road is virtually empty maybe you can do a lot so i really want to look at at a lot of those non-linearities here and try and understand why this recession may be different and it's potentially a kind of non-linear situation like that but if you have a good video i'd love to have it because it would be a great way to start the we can demo it for you so angus asked about male female differences yeah so i know about so i know everything about the crash i know lots of stuff about the occupants but i don't know is who's on the road so if they're if you're not in a crash i don't know about the driver who's on the road what i will know are things like how many cars went through a certain area where they have information you know like on you know i-95 somewhere i'll know how many cars went by there but i won't know anything about the driver unless they're in a crash but i can have but i absolutely can say what's going on with the um uh with with the the with the distribution how many crashes are there for drivers of particular types and that that is um what's in you know this chart here is the sort of these are the high risk accidents which are down but not not nearly as much as the lower risk accidents um so so there are lots of questions you definitely engage the group the questions about more data can you get easy pass data can you get um cell phone data any prospects there um so the the the data on volumes of cars i uh i can get one of the nice things about massachusetts is there all these stations on the road so i can get them from those stations on the roads um they're more than just easy pass because they're um they do them not just on highways and the easy passes are not so frequent and you know they're not on all the highways so i can get data on the number of cars volume by hour um by day you know for for for quite a number of stations in massachusetts that i can get uh very well this i haven't um investigated um closely i think you've used some of this safe graph data so you may have a sense as to whether um one could get data on you know by type of person on what whether it looks like people are driving i i don't know the answer in it so i should look into that and maybe if costly knows the answer that's great and if not i'll try and find it out or anyone else too i don't think it's i don't know of a product that exists but i'm looking into it whether there is a possibility of them creating it thank you this is great there are other great questions here too also about about duis and things i guess you could pick up some of those uh yep i can also get you can also get i i've got data from estrous which i didn't show you on dui stuff there's a little bit of national data on that so i've got a lot of stuff on that i i took from the i should clearly do more on the state stuff but i you know i took from that that there's unlikely to be a lot of good hunting in that you know good fishing in that pond but um uh i should probably do some more great thank you so much david this is terrific right um our uh our next dog uh will be uh because i will be speaking on uh effective state cova 19 closure policy on non-covet 19 health care utilization and health so thank you i think you struggled a little bit with my name so it's ng zidane um oh ng okay thank you my it's a cool name from egypt my parents were uh cool kids in the 90s okay so uh let me share my screen and can you guys see my screen yes okay um all right so um this is uh work on none covered 19 care with costly simon and cody wing from indiana university let me just start out by saying that in march 2020 we started fighting a global pandemic in fighting this pandemic we have employed mainly uh two things public policy and medical innovation i think we're all waiting on that vaccine an unintended consequence of our efforts in fighting the pandemic has been that life stopped life entirely stopped in march 2020 and april um one thing we've seen is a decrease in non-covid19 healthcare utilization this presented both a problem and an opportunity the problem was we were all concerned and we're still concerned about what is happening to the health of these individuals that are potentially delaying or deferring care the opportunity however is that we may be able to estimate or study the value of medical care by looking at individuals who delayed or deferred care and then examining their health downstream so while it's sad what is going on there may be some benefit for us as researchers what am i going to do today i'm going to do three things one the boring bit i'm going to show you uh trends in healthcare utilization uh over time for the past few months you'll see the infamous dip and rebound of multiple services and then i'm going to try and think a little bit about what services are beneficial and what services are less valuable and i'll say valuable very sheepleishly because i still haven't had my head wrapped around it but i'll show you some trends by comorbidities and by patients then i'll ask um you know have the state policies really affected the decrease in healthcare utilization or has it been private choices and i'll maybe give some examples from past disease outbreaks that signal that this is not unique to the covet 19 pandemic although the magnitude for sure is unique final thing i'll do today is i'll take a stab at trying to think about estimating the downstream health effects for those who had deferred or delayed care and i'll do this really simply in two approaches um the first approach is i'll just do a natural history study where i'll follow people over time and see what happened to them the other approach is a little bit more complicated and i'll talk about it in a little bit okay so there's been a lot of work already on trends in decreases and decreases in non covet 19 care in fact electronic medical records systems have been generating their own reports to show us decreases in non-covet-19 care this is not unique to covet 19. so i recently read a study on mers in south korea which had 186 cases of mers in 2015 and south korea did this really cute thing where they published the names of the hospitals that have copic 19 patients in the newspaper and so people stopped going to the hospitals that were published in the newspaper we've seen this also in past examples like ebola in africa where women would avoid delivery in hospitals during peak uh the ebola time and even in the united states with the misunderstanding of how contagious or the disease spread of aids in the 1980s okay so first a bit is changes in utilization um here i'm going to start by saying it's really unclear um what the consequences of this delayed or deferred care uh is going to be uh are going to be and what care should and shouldn't be delayed so if you think about value high versus low value you may be thinking about the marginal benefit of a service but here we're wanting to also think about delayed care so non-delivable or non-deferrable and deferable care and they're not the same thing so while preventative care may be of high value it may also be the type of care that's deferrable um maybe some care that's non-deferrable is care with symptoms and not asymptomatic care so i'll try to think about this um in in more detail as we go on okay and then um before i show you any of the trends i just want to you know tell you that we've worked with the kobit 19 research database and they've given us access to electronic medical records which i'll describe in a little bit from a company called health jump we have prescription drug records from symphony and mobility data from place iq so the electronic medical records um that i'll show the data from today uh just so because it's a new company and not a lot of people have worked with it and it's a data integration uh company so what happens is electronic medical records like cerner and epic transmit their data to health jump to homogenize the data for them health dump then remits the data to us on a weekly basis so we are getting weekly updates of this data to be completely honest when i was writing this slide i thought oh let me you know highlight where why electronic medical records may be the best thing to do for this research because they include vitals and labs and lab values but to be completely honest with you beggars cannot be choosers and when we started this research in june we didn't even think that there was going to be healthcare data available for us to track the pandemic in real time i think this has been the most unique thing about this disease outbreak is the availability of data in real time okay so we have about 38 million people who are registered in this electronic medical record integration platform um they come from different emr systems um we are worried a little bit about sample attrition i'll discuss this in a little bit so what we do is we only study people that we know had visits in 2019 and 2020 a sample of five million or six million unique individuals just so you know we don't have to worry about who's leaving the emr system okay in the future we are linking the emr data with other data and i'm happy to answer questions about that post presentation okay we also have prescription drug claims from symphony this is a well-known data set and then we have state policies from a great effort by the urban institute some of our own data collection and then mobility data from places like you all right let's get to business so what are we showing um outpatient visits decreased um okay i'm not sure why my slide stopped moving do we know why all right there you go yeah it's just okay um so there was a 30 decrease over um the minimum point the worst which was the end of march early april and then a rebound in this is outpatient total so you can see it rebounds back this is data until week 40 of 2020 which is the end of september um if you overlay mobility like the dex place iq mobility on top of this chart you will not be surprised you will see that mobility and outpatient visits track pretty well the world stops people stop going out people stop driving but they also stop going to the doctor look at inpatient visits you'll see about a 40 decrease in inpatient visits again i think other people have published these numbers um it rebounds some but remains about 10 below its baseline value and definitely below 2019 even until october so this inpatient claims is until october 30th and it's complete um i have removed the covet 19 admissions and i've removed motor vehicle accidents after looking at the presentation schedule and some of the papers on there now if you overlay mobility onto the inpatient admissions you see something also perplexing i overlaid infections like heart attacks and strokes and they mimic the mobility pattern and so i sat there for a little bit thinking it may be that people are afraid to go to the hospital it may be that they're being harvested by covet 19. so if i overlaid death from covet 19 for people likely to have a heart attack or a stroke maybe i'll find an uptick it could be also a reduction in stress levels so i did the unscientific thing and i i called my father-in-law in the united kingdom who doesn't have one stroke but two so he's a man of experience and i asked him you know how come strokes decrease as soon as mobility decreases and his hypothesis is that it's the reduction in stress the stress of driving for example so um this is definitely something for plexi all right so now um i'll show you some policy effects and what does that mean what i'm interested in is i'm interested in understanding did these reductions in visits occur because we suspended elective procedures or is it private choices of individuals one way to do this is to just maybe do event study uh plots simple things using the stay at home orders the elective suspensions and then first case and first death so first case and first death here are really proxying for um fear of disease so this is the first announced death first announced uh case suspension of elective procedures and earliest of stay-at-home or business closure and we will see this throughout the presentation that predominantly um the only thing that matters is the first case and the first death and not the suspension the explicit suspension of the procedures or even the stay-at-home orders for example mobility decreased in almost all states in the united states including the seven that never mentioned the word stay at home okay so now i want to think about types of care so were there heterogeneous responses in how care was delayed or deferred were individual actions really relaying what we would think is beneficial care versus less valuable care and here it's treacherous so one way to do this is to think about low value care so what's low value care the literature gives us some examples from um clinical treatments that are known to be undesirable for certain diagnoses so ct scans for sinusitis head imaging for uncomplicated headaches and so on so things that are not medically thought to be valuable low value and then high value care i create some groups one group i create is preventative care but not any preventative care preventive care with a diagnosis or a justification so mammograms for women above a certain age lung cancer screening for men with history of smoking which i can identify in the medical electronic medical records um cholesterol screening for men and women who have a bmi above 30. so i create these cohorts and then i examine them okay um the most important thing to realize is that high and low value doesn't mean it should be deferred deferred or not deferred so think of something like preventative care preventative care is remedying something that's asymptomatic and so maybe thought to be deferable there's also another layer of complication which is that care that could be most valuable because a patient is comorbid is also care that may be most risky because the comorbidities in themselves are correlated with the infection to fatality rate from covet 19. and so while i may be you know really benefiting from that marginal doctor visit it's also the one where the marginal cost has increased since the covert 19 pandemic because of the infection to fatality rate okay so this is preventative care with the diagnoses i see that i list some examples here it decreases to about by 30 percent and then it rebounds um a move on you can see that the response is really after the first case the decrease starts to happen nothing from the elective procedures being suspended although most of these preventative services are not just e m visits they are blood tests and they are scans this group is diabetes management care it's a hodgepodge of everything diabetics get from blood screens to foot exams to full risk assessments um and here it dips up to 40 and then picked up again uh to predominantly back to pre uh pandemic levels okay again response to the first case this is something that's low value um you know by just based on the definition so i put here the clinically inappropriate uh care so sinusitis undefined causes and then plus a head scan for that patient low back pain unidentified and back imaging for that patient okay so here we see it decreases by 50 percent but it doesn't go back to pre-pandemic levels um all right and here we see that it responds to the first step i'm not keeping an eye on the chat so if it's blanking it's not because i'm blanking you it's just because i will get really flustered um okay so now i'm going to try and do this by patient groups um so what i'm going to do is i'm going to define groups of individuals that have comorbidities in 2019 take the diabetics the hypertensive patients the chronic circulatory disease the cancers and follow them over time to see what happens to their visits i'm not going to show all the plots here but one interesting thing is that if you look within a disease group by disease burden you may find interesting trends so here the first chart on the left is chronic circulatory disease a very big group of patients in the united states and within them i've defined them the way cms defines them as multiple comorbidities or a single comorbidity so are you a ccd patient with obesity as well or no obesity and so on and you can see that the group with no other comorbidities decreases less than the group with comorbidities and rebounds to normal levels faster we see less of that in diabetes but this just goes to show my point here is that if we think that the marginal benefit of care for a group is high and that group shouldn't be deferring care we should also be thinking about the marginal cost because the marginal cost is really going to impede the return as long as the covet cases are high since the infection to fatality rate is correlated with comorbidities as well okay um now we can step back as well and think about other inputs in the health production function so factor visits are not the only medical input there's also pharmaceutical interventions prescription drugs and we have seen early evidence of increases in prescription drug day supply this is to be expected the marginal cost of prescription drugs is actually really low 86 percent of prescription drugs are electronically prescribed in the us free pandemic um companies have now moved to zero delivery like cvs and insurers have been encouraging practitioners to give 90-day supply so when we think about the downstream health effects we have to also realize that there are substitutes and the marginal cost of these substitutes is changing um so here i plot some prescription drug day supply from symphony this is 92 of all commercial prescription drugs in the united states and i did three big groups i did insulin i did oral chemotherapy and beta blockers and statins together and one thing you see for sure is increases in the day supply specifically for oral chemotherapy it's really unclear here i haven't done much work and i want to do more here as to whether this is a substitution from infusion therapy that was given in the hospital towards oral therapy or just increases in doses but there may be changes in modality as well that's occurring here okay okay so now we get to the interesting bit the downstream health effects um when i started this i had two ways of going forward the first way is really simple just pin down or flag a patient that has a specific comorbidity in 2019 find out what happened to their outpatient visits oh we see their outpatient visits have decreased and find out what you see for inpatient visits you see inpatient visits suddenly surge after the reopening so this is a downstream effect of missing a doctor's visit so i do this for a few cohorts i define diabetics ccds chronic kidney disease hypertension and we track them down we're still working on this so what we would like to ultimately be able to do is track down their lab values by seeing their baseline lab values and their 2020 onward lab values so but today i'll show you their inpatient care so this is the share admitted as an inpatient for these cohorts the left-hand side has everyone except the chronic kidney disease because they get a lot more admissions than everyone else so they're on an axis by themselves so if you look at by the diabetes cohort two in a thousand would get hospitalized in a given month from the cohort that i identified in 2019. you see their inpatient admissions decrease as you expect with everything else that happened in the pandemic but then we don't actually see until october 30th any pick up in inpatient admissions so this is the the first kind of descriptive finding is that i'm not seeing surges in inpatient uh claims in um in later months but we are still in it we are still in the pandemic okay the uh second approach is um a little bit different so i realized in the electronic medical records that you can actually identify a visit that was scheduled but missed delayed or rescheduled because you will not find it in the billing and you will not find any notes from the doctor on that visit which means this visit was missed so what i did is i subtracted the visits that were actually realized or attended from the visits scheduled now i have potentially a cohort that had visits scheduled in february and a cohort that had visits scheduled on march and the only kind of difference between them is the cohort and marsh had to bear a health care hiatus that happened due to the pandemic so my assumption here the subtle assumption is that between scheduling and attendance of a visit there is some lag and so we should be able to see a surge in missed visits in the period of march april and then a decrease later if i take these two cohorts these adjacent cohorts and that's kind of what i'm thinking about doing and then follow them over time and find out the share that was admitted as an inpatient 60 days or 90 days post-missing a visit and maybe able to study the value of the visit itself okay so here is the share of missed or delayed outpatient appointments and the number so in 2019 about 12 of visits 12 to 14 are missed um or delayed um i should note that if you went and saw another provider that week that you didn't go to let's say dr zedan then um i don't classify you in this data you haven't missed a visit if you didn't come to your outpatient visit because you went to the hospital to be admitted or to the er i don't count you in this data either so i make some assumptions but approximately 12 percent of appointments are rescheduled or delayed and then this surges to 22 in the period of march april so about it goes from just 500 000 appointments to a million appointments that were missed okay now another point to note here is that the share of missed visits really decreases in august september and october 2020 there's definitely changes in the composition of who is missing visits past april because there's also changes in who is scheduling visits past april so we really just want to focus on the march april 2020 cohort okay so now i take these people and i stack their inpatient admissions and i look at the share of individuals who are hospitalized 60 and 90 days post missing a visit um i compare them to 2019 because there are seasonality issues to keep in mind so almost um all patients um who miss a visit the share of them that's admitted to an inpatient is lower in 2020 than uh in 2019. you can see the dip in 2020 around the march april uh period and that's really just coming from the total inpatient decreases overall but perhaps what's most interesting is that the people who missed visits in august this is the end of the chart 60 days later about 1.5 in a thousand have been hospitalized and that number is not higher than any other number in 2020 and it's definitely not higher than the 2019 levels so if it was higher i'd see like a surge at 3 in 1 000 or 2 and 1 000 have been hospitalized after missing a visit so i do this for 60 days and 90 days i'd love to do it for longer but you know um we are in the near future still okay this is great uh rap maybe time to ah perfect wrapping up so i'm done this is basically what we found and yeah i don't need the conclusions i'm done thank you this was a as really interesting and and i think that another valuable thing it's not just the results but also how uh ngfs sorry about mispronouncing your name but how you and your team have like really harnessed this data in such an interesting way i mean this is like totally new and and you can definitely see the value of this kind of new new age uh data um so so what's your sense this is sort of a broader question like in the future when things kind of quiet down do you think you know will we have too much hospital capacity you know is this is this do you think this is going to lead to so sort of a permanently lower level of healthcare utilization because this is critical for sort of predicting costs predicting insurance companies stocks things like that i just got asked that question exactly by a news reporter who said that they're worried about premiums in the future they want to set the premiums um so that's i think that's interesting and i think that's an empirical question um there may be substitution to um pharmaceutical interventions that last you know that dominate in the future over physician visits for example or increases in electronic prescribing that change how we see our physicians i'm not sure it's an empirical great um folks have there there are a few questions that uh costly was answering uh any does anybody want to follow up uh either raise your hand or just jump in so i see a question here how do the data get from the providers to the database the the provider allows health jump access to their electronic records and it's all automatic and and the other thing that that does play in here is is this sort of change in actual frequency of disease because if you know we we found well you get rid of pneumonia patients but certainly pneumonia and uh and copd have dropped a lot uh and but but it's sort of interesting if if you think that that the actual incidence of disease has declined in in um say in certain kind like maybe it's gotten worse for diabetes because people are people who are diabetic or at home and eating too much sugar versus you know some other kind of disease that may also kind of affect your results but i'm not sure how that would go yeah i mean there's a lot of this is the thing is that there's so much going on so if we think about hypertension for example hypertension you take hypertension drugs that reduce your blood pressure so you don't have a stroke i mean that's the clinical purpose but there's also changes in stress level that are occurring less driving um there are maybe stress triggers that have been removed not just added so yeah it's it's unclear whether there'll be changes in disease prevalence super interesting okay are we good to go thank you so much for terrific presentation all right uh bill evans chris cronin you're i i've made you co-host so you may uh take over the screen great thanks john all right so i'm trying to share let's see okay can everyone see my slides yeah and can you see my mouse as well if i move it yeah very good okay all right so for those of you who i haven't met uh my name is chris cronin um this is joint work with my colleague here at notre dame bill evans um and my hope for this talk uh is to do two things first i want to provide some basic facts about covet 19 in nursing homes uh and then i'm going to detail the relationship between nursing home quality and both coveted non-coveted mortality during the pandemic and my hope is to leave you with three big takeaways the first i'm going to show you compared to lower quality nursing homes higher quality nursing homes have had substantially lower coveted 19 mortality rates and maybe this is something that we would expect we're going to show that it's very likely that these high quality nursing homes are doing a better job of complying with cms guidelines they're doing things like keeping up with their ppe they have fewer staff shortages and they do a little bit more testing now a little bit more surprising is i'm also going to show you that compared to lower quality nursing homes higher quality nursing homes have higher non-covered mortality rates uh and we think that this is also consistent with these higher quality homes doing a better job of following cms guidelines namely they're exposing their residents to to more extreme levels of isolation now this second relationship uh surprisingly is is driven by nursing homes that are in areas where the risk of covid19 is fairly low and the relationship actually is so strong that compared to lower quality nursing homes higher quality nursing homes in low risk counties have a higher overall mortality risk or mortality rates and we think that leads to kind of a pretty clear policy recommendation which is that some of these restrictions about visitors coming into the home and isolating patients need to be relaxed in in more more low risk places okay before jumping into the data uh provide a little bit of motivation about why we're looking at nursing homes i think something we've understood uh essentially since the beginning of the outbreak is that the disease is particularly lethal for two groups uh the elderly and then people with particular conditions like alzheimer's diabetes and heart disease and this is just very clearly borne out in the data here i'm showing you cover 19 death rates per 100 000 individuals by age group and you can see there's just a positive monotonic relationship between age uh and and these death rates here i'm showing you alzheimer's deaths by week for 2019 and 2020 and something that i think is coming into uh people's attention a little bit more is four particular diseases death rates have just been a lot higher this year than they have been in previous years and the timing is totally consistent with the onset of the disease so um for alzheimer's deaths have been nine percent higher in 2020 if we look at diabetes deaths have been 12 higher in 2020 and for heart disease deaths have been 3 percent higher in 2020 and so all of this kind of motivates looking at nursing homes because these risk factors are highly prevalent nursing homes about 85 percent of nursing home residents are over 65 50 have dementia 30 have diabetes 30 have heart disease okay um now given that we're going to look at nursing homes we essentially have two options for data that we can analyze the first option comes from state web pages so 33 states are regularly updating their state dashboards with the number of cases and number of deaths that are occurring in nursing homes and these are fairly large states about 83 percent of the total population is covered by these 33 states and 90 of nursing home coveted deaths now we want to look at nursing home we want to look at individual nursing homes because we're trying to say something about the relationship between equality and deaths and so we're going to use cms data so this is this is data that's reported to cms weekly by nursing homes they started collecting this information uh the week ending may 24th and the fines for not reporting are fairly substantial so from the beginning we've had near a near census of of of nursing homes reporting to the source now the downside of for the downside of using these data is that there's a pretty clear undercount of nursing home covid mortality and there's a kind of a systematic reason for it in the first week cms allowed nursing homes to report either the cumulative deaths up to that point or the deaths that had occurred just in that week and you can see in the data that kind of overwhelmingly uh nursing homes reported the cumulative number of deaths but there are some that that just report reported deaths from that week which you can tell by comparing to the to the state dashboard um so everything i show you today we're going to be looking at deaths as of september 13th but you should know that everything that we're going to do we've also done looking just at deaths since march 24th where the data are a lot more accurate and essentially all of our results hold up okay so now for some facts first kind of uh to say bluntly covered 19 has been just a disaster in nursing homes as of september 13th 192 000 deaths in the united states um 74 000 in nursing homes so about 38.5 percent of the deaths that we've seen from covet 19 have been in nursing homes only about half of one percent of the population lives in a nursing home um we can also talk about death rates uh so if you look at deaths per hundred thousand individuals across the country we have about 59 deaths uh per 100 000 individuals in the u.s if we look outside of nursing homes this is 36 per hundred thousand outside nursing homes individuals who are over 65 years old it's 208 deaths per 100 000 and then in nursing homes it's just tremendously high so about 5 600 deaths per 100 thousand over five percent of the nursing home population has been wiped out by kovac 19. if we compare individuals in nursing homes and outside of nursing homes the death rate is about 150 higher in nursing homes if we compare that to kind of normal times during 2018 it was 50 so the the difference in death rates has gone up threefold okay fact number two nursing home death rates kind of unsurprisingly mirror the local population here i'm going to show you a scatter plot that compares the state non-nursing home covet 19 death rate to the state nursing home covid19 death rate and you can see just a clear positive strong relationship between the two so places that are at high risk that's where that's where folks are dying in nursing homes fact number three uh covet 19 is not the only mortality risk um here i'm showing deaths per week for individuals who are over 65 years old starting in 2018 and 2019 if i compare that to 2020 we can see a spike in the total number of deaths that that's totally consistent with uh when when case rates went up in the u.s so in mid-march uh and that difference in deaths has persisted so overall i think it we're north of 300 000 additional deaths this year um now what's interesting is if i take this this black line this total deaths and i subtract away from it deaths that have been coded as covid19 deaths you can see that we still have a substantial number of excess deaths uh in the u.s kind of absent people dying from the disease and so the thought is like these are probably still associated with the pandemic um for younger people you could think this is probably suicide risky behaviors or people drinking and then engaging in risky behaviors for older individuals you know one part of the story is people not getting health care that they should be getting this is the over 65 population we want to think a little bit more about nursing home individuals living in nursing homes so we could focus on on on a subset of individuals who are very likely to be in nursing homes namely those who have alzheimer's so this is a the cdc estimates of excess mortality for alzheimer's patients through the end of september this year they're estimating that about 30 000 there have been 30 000 additional alzheimer's deaths this year which you might think okay these people are in nursing homes lots of people are dying from coveting nursing homes but if you actually look at what the number of people with alzheimer's who've been diagnosed with with covet who are dying it's a small fraction of that 30 000 additional deaths so something's going on with this additional 23 000 people that are dying this year that wouldn't have died last year but they don't have all right the fourth fact these deaths are highly correlated uh in just a few nursing homes and so if we look at september 13th just five percent of nursing homes account for 40 percent of covet 19 deaths uh in uh yeah covered 19 deaths in nursing homes and actually 58 of nursing homes have yet to have a coveted death and that the second bullet point you might think well this is just like geographic variation right there's some places that haven't been hit very hard with covid yet um and so we consider them a sample just of nursing homes that are located in counties in the top 10th percentile for covet 19 deaths and we're also going to limit the sample to those with more than 100 beds so we're getting rid of kind of small nursing homes that they they don't have a death because they they're just small right and then we're going to think about how many nursing homes in these high risk areas are avoiding death if we look at may 24th you can see that still over 30 percent of nursing homes in these really uh high risk areas have avoided having a single death all right if we fast forward to september 13th we still have about 15 percent of nursing homes that haven't had a death and you know you can see if we add these two bars and we've got about 35 percent of nursing homes that their their death rate is less than two per 100 beds and so these two figures really kind of motivated the project for bill and i because we're looking to see like there's some nursing homes that they figured it out they're in like really dangerous areas and somehow they're preventing their residents from dying okay so the research question we did have in mind you know imagine you have a loved one that you're that in the midst of the covet 19 pandemic um you've got to find a nursing home for them to go to kind of what observables would you focus on and the first thing that comes to mind is like well it still should just be high quality nursing homes they've been thrown a curve ball it should be high quality nursing homes are the ones that are able to to to figure this this puzzle out okay so the research question then kind of becomes well are the highest quality nursing homes are those the safest homes during the panthen okay so we're going to use a fairly straightforward statistical model to answer that question we're going to use a negative binomial model for coven 19 death counts as of september 13th our measure of quality we're going to use the cms 5 star ratings for those of you who aren't familiar there are there are four different cms five-star ratings for each nursing home one based on state health inspections one based on some staffing metrics that are reported by the nursing home another based on quality metrics that are also reported by the nursing home and then an overall uh rating you can think is kind of a weighted sum of these three we're going to focus mostly on the inspection rating it's it's thought to be the most objective because it's it comes from the state health inspections and isn't just from self-reported information by the nursing home and even cms when they calculate this overall rating they weight this inspection rating uh the the highest okay we're also in this model going to control for some confounders that we might think are both correlated with coping 19 deaths and nursing homes quality so we're going to control for things like the nursing homes acuity index this is a measure of how much care individuals in the home need the profit status of the of the nursing home the share of the residents they're over 65 the share that are on medicaid so on and so forth we're also going to control for the local infection risk uh by controlling for the county level covet 19 cases per thousand individuals we'll do that with a three week lag because on average it takes for someone who does die they die about three weeks after they've contracted the virus and then finally we'll we'll include state fixed effects um so on the next slide what i'm going to show you i'm going to report coefficients from this model as we move from one to five star rating okay and so you can see pretty clearly uh that as the nursing home quality ranking increases that the the percentage of covet 19 deaths declined so this says that five star homes have 24 percent fewer cobit 19 deaths than a one star home if we want to think about how large that is in terms of human lives a one star home has about 3.3 cobit 19 deaths per 100 beds that means that at a five star home there's about .8 fewer lives lost per 100 beds okay so the next question we were then interested in if we see these high quality homes reducing deaths we want to know how they're doing it i can start off by telling you what they're kind of surprisingly what they're not able to do quality is not predictive of any resident cases or having any staff cases so these high quality homes don't seem to keep covet out of the nursing home entirely we can also show that high quality homes aren't preventing staff spread so conditional on staff having a case we don't see that high quality homes have have have fewer overall cases among their staff what high quality homes seem to be doing is they predict they prevent resident spread so conditional on having a single resident case quality high quality homes have fewer total cases and the the magnitude similar to to the death prevention so five-star homes have about 23 fewer cases than one-star homes that still begs the question kind of like how are they doing this and we're limited in the data in terms of what we can actually see what we can see in the data are things like how many staff shortages has the uh has the facility had during the pandemic and have they had any ppe outages across a bunch of different uh ppp metrics and we can say kind of very confidently these relationships are really strong that high quality facilities definitely have fewer staff shortages and fewer ppe outages okay now again this also was kind of like consistent with this idea that high quality facilities are are following cms guidelines a key part of the cms guidelines pertain to protecting residents by preventing visits into the home and also by isolating residents you can think both uh they can do that strenuously or not so strenuously conditional on someone nearby becoming infected or just allowing residents to interact with one another during meal time and during kind of common activities and so that was the next thing we really wanted to think about is kind of what are the implications of of those visitation policies um to provide a little bit of background the very first memo that was released by cms two nursing homes in light of the pandemic was on march 13th and literally like top of the line bold letters red italics everything they could do to get your attention they said that facilities should restrict uh visitation of all visitors and non-essential healthcare personnel for certain uh with the exception of certain compassionate care situations such as end of life among the additional recommendations uh cms recommended that nursing homes canceled all communal dining and all communal group activities so essentially cms was saying for the time being while we're trying to figure this out you know have everyone stay in their room and limit their contact with anyone else these guidelines were revised about two months later on may 18th but the criteria for allowing outside visitors into the home as most of you are aware were incredibly strict um so in order to have visitors come into the home they were recommending you needed to have community spread declining for 14 consecutive days no new cases in the home for 28 days no staff shortages and the ability to test everyone every week so pretty strict and what that meant is that most nursing homes ended up with very little visitation if any through the end of the summer as a result of that towards the end of the summer we started to see all this anecdotal evidence um that that this isolation was really taking its toll in nursing homes so lots of op-eds in in popular newspapers arguing that um that there was an incredible amount of despair and depression and within the homes among the residents and this was even potentially costing human lives um so we you know we wanted to see if if we could kind of uh speak to like whether or not that that was actually taking place all right so we're going to return to the original statistical model the negative binomial model and all i'm going to change is the outcome variable instead of looking at covet 19 deaths i'm going to look at non-coded deaths in the nursing home and the question again as a reminder that we're trying to get out here we're asking if high quality nursing homes prevented cohen 19 desk by adhering to cms guidelines do they also experience more non-coveted deaths by exposing residents to extreme isolation and what i'm going to show you same as before i'm going to report coefficients as we move from a one to five star inspection writing and sure enough what we find uh is that as nursing home quality increases uh we have kind of large and statistically significant uh increases in the non-coveted death rate again if we want to think about how many human lives this is uh one star homes have about 7.9 non-covid 19 desks per 100 beds uh so in these high quality homes we're seeing about .7 additional lives lost per 100 beds uh the natural thing to do then if we have covades and non-clover dust we can look at total deaths and how that relates to quality you can see from this figure that uh so again we're just negative binomial model where the outcome variable is is total deaths and we see no statistical relationship between between nursing home quality and the total number of deaths okay so like those findings i don't know we came we come up with this and we think this is hopeless it seems like kind of a damned if you do damned if you don't situation we've got uh high quality nursing homes that that seem to be able to prevent covet 19 deaths but a a terrible result from that is through exposing their residence to isolation um we have these non-covet deaths where the effects essentially wash each other out so the question is like is there anything we could do about that so the next thing we thought is well you know what if we focus on low risk places what if visitation and inner nursing home activity restrictions what if they were lifted just in areas that we don't see much covet 19 so to try to speak to that we we return to this non-covet death model but we're going to split the sample by county case rate whether or not the nursing home is above or below the the median county case rate so the first thing i'm showing you here outcome variable is is non-cova deaths and i'm focusing on the high risk area so the county case rate is above the median and what you can see pretty clearly is there's there's not much of a statistical relationship between nursing home quality and non-cova deaths in these high-risk areas which means the relationship that i showed you previously has to be driven entirely by low-risk areas so here i'm showing that if the nursing homes in a county with uh with a case rate below the the median for the country um 19 uh higher non-coveted death rates in the high quality nursing homes naturally then we look at uh all deaths or total deaths um and again in high risk places we're seeing not a strong statistical relationship between nursing home quality and the total number of deaths or the excuse me the total yeah total number of deaths but in low-risk areas we see that higher quality nursing homes have more overall deaths um for a one star nursing home let's see my my videos blocking okay for one star nursing home we have about 12 desks per 100 beds so you can think these high quality nursing homes in low risk areas they have about 1.8 additional lives lost per 100 beds let's see okay so real quickly you know maybe some of these have come up in the chat i can't see the chat uh some alternative explanations that you might think about uh you might think maybe high quality homes always have more deaths this seems pretty unlikely we haven't been able to get death data from previous years but in our data we can see that high quality homes have much lower medicaid [Music] rates of residents who who are paying with medicaid um they're much younger residents at high quality homes and the homes they're less likely to be for-profit so kind of all of all three of these things are predicted of higher death rates so it seems unlikely that that this is just always true of high quality homes something that we dedicate a lot of time to in the paper is this idea that maybe homes are strategically reporting coveted 19 deaths you can imagine high quality nursing homes that are well managed might want to recode deaths away from covet 19 in some way to help their reputation with regard to that you know i'll remind you this non-covered excess death relationship is driven by low-risk areas where very few people are actually getting covered in the paper we even show if we limit the analysis to counties where there's not been a single cova death period that still high quality homes are having more non-coveted deaths than low quality homes finally uh you know conversation i had last week suggested you know maybe this isn't and actually the previous talk maybe this is in isolation maybe this is access to healthcare you know maybe that's true um i still think that's part of an isolation story that people are isolated and they aren't going to get health care at the same time again excess tests here are driven are in low risk places where hospitals aren't at capacity so you know if hospitals are in tech capacity and a patient really needs to go to the hospital you you would think that a nurse would recommend that they go also remember many of these excess deaths seem to be among folks with alzheimer's it's not really clear that like lack of access to health care would be the main driver okay so to conclude high quality nursing homes uh we show manage or protect their residents from covered 19 mortality but this seems to come at a cost namely increased isolation excess non-covered mortality um that latter relationship is heavily concentrated in homes with low covet risk um so we think what this means is that we you know just more nuanced policy is needed namely we should allow kind of relaxed visitation and communal activity guidelines um in areas with little to no risk and actually kind of uh near the time that we finished up this paper uh cms updated their guidelines kind of exactly in this direction okay so that's everything i have thanks all right a lot of information lots of questions um uh and uh bill has been very effective in responding to them uh so uh bill as i say if if you feel like jumping in feel feel free um i think there there are there seem to be a fair number of questions about well you know what is it about what what makes these five-star uh nursing homes different is it that they're more willing to kind of look after the patients in the nursing home is it that they have higher paid staff uh that aren't kind of going back and forth to other nursing homes and and some of the questions seem to be you know addressed when you look at places that have like zero cases uh in the county although again that's you know sometimes counties are pretty small um but i'm i'm i'm wondering do you have any thoughts about like um did it seem as if in states with in in in nursing homes with like fewer kind of restrictions uh on visitors do you have any way to sort of test that hypothesis directly that it's visitors versus maybe nursing home residents who see one another and chat with one another or what's the mechanism yeah so that that's a good question we we haven't dug into state policy much so what i can say is is quite literally every state in the united states uh you know followed this cms guideline on march 13th um by early july about half of the states in the u.s were starting to allow visitors back in but with pretty tight regulations um so people had to wear mass they were really strongly pushing that visits take place outside and even now most states are now allowing visitors but there's an interesting like north-south divide that like southern states it's like you have to be outside and northern states are having to make different accommodations because it's just too cold to be outside um what we've actually dug into in the paper is just what i presented so the we we can see that these high quality nursing homes have fewer ppe outages um that suggests that they're managed better and they're kind of better able to forecast what they're going to need they also have better supply channels that allow them to get the ppe um but in terms of like distinguishing between inter nursing home activities and visitors we we would just have to do more work looking at state level policies because we haven't done that yet so uh yeah so there there are also these questions about that that when judy chevalier talked about that the multiple staff going back and forth but again uh uh that would be ideal if you had cell phone data too but that might be a little too much anyone else want to jump in and um we have a few minutes i have a question this is really interesting just a lot of information too so apologies if you said this and i missed it but it's the mystery of the higher deaths of non-cova deaths in these five-star places or four-star places if you went back a year in time and you looked at mortality rates in nursing homes again just divided the way you've divided these counties below and above the median what would you see yeah i'm not really sure and actually you know this is a room of people who who uh knows a lot about available data sets and if someone had a recommendation for how we could go and find death data at the nursing home level in a you know in previous years that would be fantastic but to my knowledge we we don't have that um so yeah without data i'm not really i'm not really sure i honestly i would expect i would expect either no relationship between quality and death or i would i would actually probably expect the opposite um as a you know as i said the the low quality nursing homes when you look at their the characteristics of their residents way more likely to be on medicaid way more they're older um they're more likely to be a minority so lots of things that we would think predict death um you see that at the low quality nursing homes and so um that you know in previous years that's what i would expect but i can't verify so you know they're older meaning that the fraction above the age of 65 is higher is that right yeah but it's yeah it's kind of a black box right because if they're given the depth is linear more or less in age if like the age structure within those nursing homes um encouraging somebody to do qualitative work on this yeah i i don't disagree i mean that the pattern is somewhat predictable right so like as people age they they kind of they maybe enter their first nursing home not being on medicaid they run out of money then they qualify for medicaid that's naturally when they're older and they're sicker and they transition to a worse nursing home as a result of that so literally like my my grandmother-in-law just went through this process um so so it's sensible that kind of these low-quality nursing homes are are made up of older sicker people right um andy levin did you have a question oh yeah i just wanted this a really really interesting paper um just wanted to mention that the catastrophe in the nursing homes was really during the first couple months the first several months of the of the pandemic i'm just checking the cms i mean cms is incredibly transparent about this so you can download the individual case data for the nursing homes um but um since uh june 1st according to this spreadsheet i may be looking at a different source uh than the authors but um 44 000 deaths since june um the total cova deaths in the united states since june is uh like 150 000. so the fraction of nursing home deaths is a total of in the first two months was was huge but the good news was that and you know the the evolution of understanding of how to protect people in nursing homes improved a lot um so the good news i think the one of the messages on there on one of their first slides was that this was a catastrophe not just the united states but in many countries where the nursing home deaths were horrible during the first two or three months and then the practices really did start to improve a lot still not perfect but but a lot better yeah so i i totally agree i i do think it's interesting and i wasn't i alluded to it but i wasn't able to show it today so a couple things one if we most of our mismeasurement is in those early northeastern states like new york like new jersey when we drop them from the analysis this relationship between nursing home equality and both covades and non-copa desk looks exactly the same it's also the case that if we only measure new deaths since uh late may um again the relationship's totally the same and so this you know if you believe this story about us having these excess deaths because we're exposing people to isolation and that's that's what that's what this nursing home quality gradient is is picking up um that relationship hasn't gone away that's that still exists but i i i will agree yeah the magnitude of the problem is probably lesser than it was this is great uh one uh final question let me just paraphrase jim paterba's uh sort of question also kind of aggregating up uh uh edward norton's question uh how much do you think is of this is is sort of coding discretion uh five-star nursing homes are clearly good at coding getting five stars so is there any correlation yeah so um we were really worried about that in the paper spent a lot of time on it i think the most convincing thing we can say is is again if we go to counties that literally haven't had a coveted death and we look at the relationship between nursing home quality and non-coveted deaths in those counties it's still the case that high quality nursing homes are having more non-coded deaths so in those areas like there's essentially no there's very little risk and it can't be it can't be miscoding in those places got it great okay this is a really good presentation you're here um maria i've made you co-host i don't know who if if you are presenting presenting okay thank you john let me share slides and hope that that works can folks see that yeah it looks good and just a full screen um great well thank you so much for including us in the program this is a joint work with victoria udallova at u.s census who i think is on the call as well as to other of her colleagues at u.s center census katie gennady and kathy keith finlay as well as with jeff cox who i think is also on the call who's a graduate student at mit and amy finkelstein um and so this i would describe relative to the previous papers as sort of the macroeconomic version of the of of the of this discussion in particular we're going to look at the impact of covet 19 pandemic on all cause mortality by various demographics national and state by state and will give you a lot of data and facts but uh kind of fewer explanations and are hoping to actually you know generate a discussion um people trying to um help us understand uh these facts in in future work so i would be very grateful for any of your comments on on that dimension all right so what was the motivation for us of doing this project um the original motivation and you know it took us a while to actually get the data and do this um was that there was lots of evidence at the start of the pandemic coming out on covet attributable mortality and were all counting covey deaths however it was less clear how access all cause mortality was developing and especially so but by demographic groups and across different parts of the country um the other kind of two parallel discussions that were happening and seem to not be truly connected is um that we were observing you know people were either talking about mortality impacts of the pandemic or economic impacts but not both at the same time and as a result we feel like we know less about how and especially why the early economic and health impacts of the pandemic varied by demographic groups and geographically so we will be interested eventually in trying to understand why in this particular talk i will talk more about how so we're going to document some facts and then uh hope again to open the discussion of trying to understand why there was this uh geographic and demographic variation in both the economic and health impacts of the pandemic so why is it important to think about access all-cause mortality as well as um you know why there are differences across different demographic groups and geography well in some sense you know these are crucial inputs for policy making for two reasons one is understanding who is actually the most affected in a whole package right so if we don't talk about purely covet deaths but all deaths um as well as uh understanding the different the differential impacts of potentially direct effects of infections versus indirect effects of the pandemic and i think we've talked a lot about various indirect effects today as well as um in in the previous session um there was a lot of discussion of you know deaths of despair and so forth that could be resulting uh from indirect effects of the pandemic and understand and and kind of whether it's one or the other can lead to very different policy implications so understanding that is important um again we will be kind of delivering more facts towards that but not necessarily really answering the question um at the end of the day but hope to open the discussion so what are we actually going to do in this project we're going to use administrative data for the first full month of the pandemic so april 2020 um to compute access all-cause mortality by different demographics group and groups and geography we're also going to supplement this with survey data from cps to measure the economic impact by different um demographic and geographic groups and then our plan for next steps and is to try to link various survey and mortality data at the u.s census to try to understand what are the actual causes and consequences of different demographic and geographic variation in uh both the economic and health impact of the pandemic we're also hoping to expand the timeline but today i will basically be showing you all the results will be for april 2020 so think about this as the first uh very first month of the pandemic so we're going to use um sort of three basic sources of data so um we're going to uh uh some of our analysis and we'll it will rely on cdc vital statistics data that has been kind of the most uh used in the analysis of this pandemic we'll be using the cdc data to both compare our estimates um that will be coming from other administrative data sources on the national impact on mortality as well as um to try to understand what fraction of deaths that we're estimating in all-cause mortality are attributable to covet deaths so what is kind of the dif what are the what are the uh non-covered deaths in the data as well as uh using cps survey data to measure some of the economic outcomes our main source of data will be individual level administrative data and um census data so we will be using census version of the social security administration's numiden file from january 2011 to april 2020 um so for those of you not familiar with the new midden file basically imagine that's a list of everyone who in the us ever has a social security number people are born they kind of get into the numeraton file so we observe their date of birth and then whenever they die we observe their date of death so it's kind of a role rolling file um of all individuals who um have a u.s social security number that's kind of a rough uh rough definition of that um so from the newman file we'll be able to observe people's date of birth as well as um sex then we're going to use um sense's internal linkage apparatus to link these uh nubian data to 2010 census decennial census why do we want to do that is to get get a measure of self-reported race so the interesting kind of measurement aspect here if you start looking at racial disparities in uh mortality is you know how do you measure race so there is some measure of phrase in ssa in immident directly that comes from implications and then um we think kind of you know you know there is a lot of work that has been done by um but by the census thinking that you know self-reported race in the census is actually kind of the most accurate uh measure um that uh that that we have so that is where we're going to link census to numiden to get uh measure freeze and then in addition we'll also link numident to the address databa database at the us census to get geographic information so a couple of notes for those of you just interested in uh in the data a couple of notes on kind of data quality so there are actually interesting differences on um the reporting of deaths between the cdc vital statistics and numerous some of us like if you look at how death data is generated it comes from very different channels to the vital statistics versus to the social security administration um reporting so you will see that um you know some of the numbers that you might see now in our data might not quite match to the numbers that are reported by the cdc roughly they're sort of in the same direction and and very similar but there are some discrepancies and there are certainly differences in reporting of race because in the vital statistics race information comes from death certificates while we're going to be using a race reported by individuals to to the census so the advantages of using lumidance linked to census relative to the cdc data is that first we're going to have as a result of kind of new minute being a roll call of everyone and observing date of birth of individuals we're going to have the same data for numerator and denominator for mortality that is important because when you're using cdc vital statistics data on deaths cdc doesn't actually report kind of the population level what is the population for which you want to um take uh this death set that as the numerator if you want to compute mortality so instead you have to kind of go to census data and try to just compute the general number of individuals in the u.s so you sort of have a measurement error in the numerator relative to the denominator which we avoid by using numident um and second advantage is that we're going to use race from the census which is self-reported rather than from death certificates so that's um as much for our data let me give you just some very brief summary statistics on um on this new midi dangerous data set linked to 2010 census just so that you have a sense of kind of what are the characteristics of the population that we're going to be looking at so if you focus on the first column here um these are april 2020 numbers pure uh 2020 numbers where in the data we'll have 241.5 million individuals this is after our various sample restrictions for people for for whom we can observe race um can link to census and so forth out of this we have 276 000 deaths um i think the primary you know average age in the population is 45. and there are about 50 women so one kind of thing to uh that will be important to keep in mind when we're doing our analysis by race is how many um what are the fraction of different races in the population which essentially will guide our statistical precision right so how many people of different um uh racial categories we have so about 66 of the population will be white individuals 15 hispanic um uh 13 uh will be uh individuals who have reported being black non-hispanic and then five percent asian non-hispanic um and then uh less than one percent of um other other uh race uh groups and this is pretty similar before april 2020 and for the whole 10 years between 2011 and 2020 so there's been not much differences over that decade there so what do we estimate here i'm actually showing you uh the uh aggregate data from uh the cdc but we matched it also to numeraton so this is pretty similar so we observe substantial aggregate access all cause mortality in april 2020. so panel a here is estimating this is actually very similar methodologically very similar to what david cutler was shown at the beginning so that spares me the a bit of an explanation of what we're doing here but it's pretty simple so we're basically plotting a trend so the red line is the raw data of mortality per 10 000 people for the total population in all months of april in various years so 2011 april 2012 april and so forth so the red line is just raw data and you can see that it fits a linear trend very well so then we just project this linear trend out of sample to 2020 so that that predicted all cause mortality in april 20-20 would have been roughly um seven individuals per 10 000 but the observed all-cause mortality in april 2020 was 2.4 per 10 000 individuals more so it's about uh nine point uh uh nine point uh four uh in uh individuals in total per ten thousand who are dying um and uh we calculate that um at the end of the day the access all-cause mortality was 2.5 individuals per 10 000 people and out of that 75 percent are coveted attributable deaths so there is a pretty substantial number of these that are of these deaths that are either not coded as covet death so there was a uh just the discussion that uh uh jim peterborough started on you know how our uh covet deaths coded so from that perspective it's actually really important to look at all-cause mortality especially if you worry about differences in coding across states and across different time periods um the other panel here is showing you um a similar exercise where we're taking cps data and they're trying to show you the effect of the economic effect of the pandemic so there are obviously many different ways to measure that what we did here is just taking um computing the share of people who were employed relative to the population of these individuals in different again different aprils of different years and what you can see here that employment was generally employment to population ratio was generally rising before 2020 and the predicted trend for april 2020 was about 61 of individuals employed but what we actually observe is almost 10 percentage points lower employment so you can see that there was a pretty substantial increase in mortality and the drop in employment as we kind of all know from various uh other reports so the uh these aggregates however mask quite substantial variation in geographic impact and what we observe here by just using this really aggregate data is that there was large differences in how geographic incidence looks for mortality versus economic um impact so for mortality and aggregate in the first month of the pandemic which is not surprising we see this very concentrated impact of the virus um in uh in new york in new jersey while the economic impact is quite geographically widespread even already in this first month of the pandemic which is presumably attributable to the implementation of various policy responses as well as just to how economy you know is connected uh across different states so why am i showing you this map and talk about racial disparities well i want you to kind of have this as a snapshot for when i'm going to show you the geographic variation in um uh racial disparities and all-cause mortality because um this may be kind of informative uh in interpreting these results and especially thinking about the potential indirect effects that may be contributing to the geographic variation in mortality gaps by release okay so um now let's uh go to these estimates by race so these aggregates that i've just shown you for the whole country in fact mask large differences in excess mortality by demographic groups and here we're going to focus on um differences by uh uh racial groups so we estimate this for seven different race categories in the paper here i'm going to show you on only a couple of estimates so this is the same exercise of predicting mortality trend and comparing it to uh the observed numbers by different races using this numident data so this is mortality for 10 000 individuals for white non-hispanic individuals and um this is panel a and then in the right hand side panel you see this for black individuals um what you see are kind of two facts one is in general mortality is much lower among black individuals in in the baseline and that is primarily driven by uh age composition as i'll show you in a moment but what is striking here is are there large differences in the increase in mortality in april 2020. so for white individuals we observe um two per ten thousand excess mortality versus predicted about ten per ten thousand so an increase of 2 over 10 uh per 10 000 uh deaths while for black individuals we observe an increase of six per ten thousand over the baseline of predicted eight per ten thousand so it's almost doubling of mortality for black individuals and an increase of about 20 percent for white individuals both of these are are very large increases but it is uh striking that the differences are quite pronounced across races and we observe you know different versions of this for for for other different races so one thing that is important to keep in mind here is that there are large underlying differences in age distribution by race groups so when we see um various raw uh uh data points reported in uh various um you know newspapers or or whatnot it is important to uh to know the underlying age distribution actually um here is a table that just shows um the average age by each race race category that we observe in the data so on average people in the us are 45 years old but you can see that hispanic individuals are substantially younger so 38 39 years old on average white individuals are 47 years old and black um 42 and then asian 45 american indian and alaska natives non-hispanic 42 um and uh hawaiian and pacific islanders are again um uh much younger at nearly 40. so keeping in mind that the age distributions here are quite different is important when trying to um actually make meaningful comparisons across races so in the next um table here and this is sort of a lot of numbers but i wanted to show you sort of the full scope of what we do for each race category um what we could we what we do is that we compute excess mortality that i was just showing you in the graph so these numbers here correspond exactly to what we saw in the graph for um white and black individuals we see this two per ten thousand um individuals excess mortality for blacks um six per ten thousand uh excess mortality so this is unadjusted and then you can see when we equalize age distributions these numbers change quite substantially in particular um so we are normalizing here to the age distribution in the full population as a result the excess mortality for white individuals goes down because they tend to be on average a little bit older and for hispanic individuals for example goes up substantially because they tend to be substantially younger so these are the largest differences we actually don't see too much impact of adjusting for uh sex composition or for geographic variation geographic variation is important for smaller um racial groups because of the differences in where people are located in the country obviously um but then ultimately our adjusted estimates where we are adjusting for age sex and state suggest that there was 1.5 um excess mortality per ten thousand among whites um four among uh uh hispanic individuals seven among um uh black non-hispanic individuals and so forth so um again here we see that uh there were these large racial disparities um in uh aggregate at the national level so the other interesting point so you know these are kind of just precise estimates of these national differences the question is um how do we try to understand these and one way to try to understand this is to first look at the geographic variation in how the levels of excess mortality vary across the country in the same first month of the pandemic by race so what i'm showing you here are two maps for white um excess all-cause mortality in april um as well as for uh hispanic individuals and you can see that you know there are some similarities in the patterns in the sense that new york new jersey is always going to be more pronounced for everyone in april but then um there are also kind of a lot of states where here we pre we see quite pronounced more uh excess mortality among hispanics but not so much necessarily among whites and actually um when we put this into uh a relationship it's easier to see the differences in the gaps across states so what we're doing here so now this is comparing um white and and black individuals um so here we have white non-hispanic excess all-cause mortality on the x-axis and excess all-cause mortality for black individuals on the y-axis so there are kind of two things you will note one is that the scale of the axis here for black individuals is much as is kind of much more pronounced so there is uh much higher numbers in some states in particular in new york excess all-cause mortality for black individuals was more than 30 individuals per 10 000 so these are really large increases and the other thing that is notable here is that there were several states where we observed nearly zero white excess all-cause mortality but already in april 2020 high black and hispanic all-cause mortality so this is interesting because if you think that you know in some sense if white all cause mortality is measuring this the direct spread of the virus in some sense then we are observing this excess mortality among non-white individuals in states where potentially the direct impact of the the direct viral impact of the pandemic may have been relatively limited suggesting that it is conceivable that these are driven by sort of indirect effects of the pandemic or there is something very special about how the pandemic in those states was only spreading among non-uh white populations uh for example which seems a bit less um a bit less plausible um and um so that's kind of it for me maybe sorry yeah sorry i want to make sure there's time for questions and things so um so i'm going to uh kind of conclude with this slide so i think our main takeaways here is that we observe pronounced geographic creation in the pandemic's impact on health and economic well-being at the national level that is not surprising we observe large differences in the impact by demographics by age and race in particular i haven't shown you the results of for age given time but by race you can uh there are large differences and then we also observe geographic variation in these differences so across states the gaps in excess mortality by different races vary a lot so what can explain this geographic variation and hopefully uh people will have more thoughts in the discussion is one is obviously the direct impacts of the virus viral exposure transmission of fatality rates may vary across states to explain the gaps we will need to have more than that we'll have to have some kind of differences that are varying by race across states rather than just as a geographic variation and then similarly indirect impacts of the pandemic such as economic impacts motor vehicle fatalities that were talked about previously healthcare utilization and so forth um so our next step is trying to understand the mechanisms um that are we think are crucial for policy making of what is driven what is driving this geographic uh variation is it the direct or the indirect effects of the pandemic and i think this is generally important for understanding not just the covet related policy but also the general causes and consequences of differences in health by socioeconomic status we hope to do more work by merging in more various data sources but also just curious to hear what people think are potentially the mechanisms involves implications thank you hopefully i didn't completely run out of time now we still have time for a few questions and thoughts i i particularly i can't wait to see may in june uh i i just think we patterns totally different um amy has volunteered since she's been sort of monitoring so amy do you want to take the uh uh discuss kind of the questions um yeah i actually from i you only told me towards the end that i was volunteering to discuss the questions so i was actually paying attention to them but not necessarily collating them um but um the the like so many of them i tried to respond to and hopefully we can get the chat from the conference departments so we'll see them all um there are a bunch of questions angus uh raised it and i think bill evans did as well about doing things by finer geography like new york city versus the rest of the state or urban versus non that's definitely on the to-do list um there was a terrific question about um sort of how much of these racial differences are explained by differences in pre-existing conditions which we would love to do and i somewhat unfairly um asked the person who who made that suggestion if they could come up with any data and he politely responded he's not the health economist on the call um so so i put it to the group someone put in the chat um that of course we at the county level we can take data from the barfest but we don't know of any way to do that yet at the individual level um and then finally um you know bill evans had a fantastic suggestion about you know narrowing in on the counties where there are no covet deaths say by may first and trying to look at you know impacts there so and there are many other comments and i'm i'm sorry that i'm not getting to them all now i would say the main thing we're very much eager really i mean everyone always says they're eager to hear feedback but we really are in the sense of as maria said you know we now have this apparatus set up we can look over longer time periods we can look at finer geographies we can link to some additional demographics like education and occupation in the acs um and honestly we'd love to hear from you what you think are the hypotheses for what we're currently finding that we could explore or what you think are the interesting questions we should be looking at in these data going forward so actually and people should feel free to raise their hands or just jump in but but there were a few questions about like well what's the difference between this versus the cdc data and and and there was a victoria i know you sort of discussed it a little bit but maybe could you talk a little bit about that because um there were two i think so is the question how do our results compare because that was one set of questions and the answer was jeff put it in the chat we're comparable there where we can do the comparison they're very comparable or are you asking more about why we would use these data rather than the cdc data okay so i will defer to victoria who's the expert but just at a very big picture level the well there's one the denominator point that maria brought up which you know we don't want to especially when you get to smaller and smaller demographic groups trying to estimate population is is challenging but also at least currently uh the cdc publishes mortality you know by say race but not race by age by state by whatever but maria can talk much more knowledgeably about um some of the differences between the two data sources sorry i mean so there are some differences in terms of you know what is included in which data set and we can debate at the minimum kind of what you know what is better it depends on what you want to measure but i think at the very like at the statistical level it's just for numerator data we have individual level data so we can do any type of you know comparisons and adjustments while cdc data as far as we know at least for now is is reporting a lot of things at aggregate level and then a lot of things are masked especially once you start looking at races by state by age even if it is theoretically reported in practice they will mask a lot of the data so it's not really usable if you want to do you know and certainly if you want to link it to any individual level comparisons then you can't do that with cdc data yeah oh this is victoria and i i would just add to that that um there's there's actually been a lot of work looking at sources of race and ethnicity data and uh data on race and ethnicity that cdc gets uh frequently is reported by funeral directors um and so kind of there is some measurement issue around that and so we were able to look at self-reported uh data on race and ethnicity which we think is is a better measure of that this is great good well thank you it looks like there's the chat goes on uh but i think it's time to take a break uh for sorry john is there a way that we can get the chat oh yeah totally yeah no the chat comes to me in fact a little known fact that i learned from running webinars before is that oftentimes like even amy if you're emailing like victoria saying what's wrong with that skinner guy oh no you're going to see all that i think it all comes down to me because i because i because this is a but anyway i promise not to look uh this is always useful to know but um yeah private chat is is not private oh man amy if you amy if you um look where you type in your chat they're the three dots if you click those three dots there's an option first save chat oh okay do i get to see the private chats you you might uh but uh anyway thanks david so so we're we're giving you 15 minutes for lunch maybe a few minutes less uh and uh and and then uh as amy suggested we re zoom at 12.50 thank you amy uh and uh and uh very much looking forward to hearing from from david weir and about what the hrs is doing uh to track people through the pandemics so thank you all terrific group of papers thank you all and i'll see you at 12 50. thanks hi john um this is rob can you make me the host um quickly and i'm gonna see if i can work something out thank you i will all right i'm gonna make you the host again john sorry my my my idea did not pan out thank you alright everybody welcome back i hope people have lunch or at least got a chance to just uh stretch for a couple of minutes um so we're going to pick up with what i think are some fantastic sounding papers in the afternoon so the first is going to be by i saw david weir and i saw helen levy and i also saw ken langa and maybe including jessica and gabor on the effect of covet 19 on older americans preliminary results and i think rob has given you the control oh uh gobbler has control he'll do the slide i'm going to spend just a few minutes at the beginning and then uh gabriel will talk about the results okay take it away thank you david and john for including us it's been great to see uh such innovative use of novel data sources we're going to change that now and look at something much more traditional and that's the health and retirement study guideline gut slides well there they are i hope do you see them yeah not yet you are shared you are [Music] okay how about now do you see it now oh that's odd it says screen is shared no oh my let me try to share it again the first time it was almost there it didn't just didn't quite connect yeah something might have happened okay so let me let me do this again sorry about that um oh my goodness yeah well i can start playing there we go perfect all right thank you so uh this represents work collectively by uh the management team from the hrs uh who david uh named previously uh next slide got him trying yep okay so just a quick outline of uh what we'll do next slide all right um so the hrs uh began its 15th way binding away the data collection in march beginning of march uh and of course by mid-march uh all in-person research contacts have been stopped everywhere in the country um hrs was fortunate and we've been for some years now uh a mix of telephone and in-person interviewing uh with a questionnaire that works pretty much equally well uh for the common content in both modes so um we're able to continue and telephone and essentially our number one priority has been to keep the panel going through this uh to maintain the consistency of the study and its rhythm uh as as the most valuable thing we can do long term but at the same time we recognize that this uh pandemic was having a big influence on people's lives but to not ask them about it would seem odd to our respondents and to not collect some data about it would uh be a dereliction of duty i guess uh the problem is that unlike some studies which stopped doing their data collection they went to do a covered focus focused uh we were doing a 90 minute to two hour interview uh and we couldn't really tackle on a whole other data collection to that so we embedded within our core data collection what we're calling that cover 19 project and that consists of about a 10 minute added set of questions that are in the core interview which is now always by telephone an open-ended question about individual experiences that we'll be transcribing and some additional content in the psychosocial lead behind questionnaire where we have a little more flexibility about adding things we also have some additional future plans that we're not going to talk about today and we've actually begun now mailing saliva kits to respondents uh to do antibody testing uh and we will be doing a mail questionnaire to all our respondents in 2021 to capture uh more of what's happening now and will happen in the beginning of next year vaccine in particular okay um the other thing you have to know is the sample on each has since 2006 been spread into a group uh that gets an in-person interview we call the enhanced face-to-face or eftf interview and a half that gets it primarily by telephone and people alternate ways in terms of which mode they're in so we have half of the samples scheduled for in-person interviewing and they had not been released from the pandemic kit and so we decided that they represented our best opportunity for a truly random sample of code related content so i held them out from the field until june while we developed the new content tested it got it into the field um and um so uh we are going to be talking about early release of uh data from the group that went out in june next slide why uh is it important that we do this nhrs well mentioned is an example of what people have just been showing for our own reminding us are the most vulnerable groups people 55 and older uh over samples of blacks and hispanics uh we have this long prior history of relevant health economic and social measures and we hope long follow-up uh we have prior genetic and blood samples in repository for uh analysis of biological determinants uh and we have linkages to social security medicare and medicaid next we also span the geographic variation in known cases so took the hopkins data and put it into quintiles and asked what fraction of the wheelchair sample is in each quintile and it's not exactly 20 we never represent the most hardest hit areas slightly uh relative to the others but it's a pretty good balance overall next uh so timing as i said we set out uh phase one in june uh and now uh for the first time in our history we've actually released data from a wave that's still in the field uh so we got to around a 60 response rate in that first grant uh and decided to go ahead and make an early release of those data uh and are out there uh and publicly available for you all to use it's the whole hrs interview uh plus this uh new covert content and so that's all i have to say now gabon was showing you some results uh from there thank you very much do you hear me okay thanks so um david told you about uh some of the exciting things that we that are ongoing in atria including the testing all all respondents for uh covered antibodies currently in the field currently uh under collection and uh extended uh psychosocial questionnaires to be mailed to uh various uh bits of our sample including and we also plan on maybe a standalone mailing questionnaire next year what i'm going to be talking about is none of those exciting things i'm going to i'm going to show some results of this uh covered 19 uh survey module that we fielded on what's about random quarter of our sample now this is phase one is around quarter phase two is going to be another random quarter but it's as as david uh mentioned this is this is still ongoing data collection response rate is about was about at sixty percent when we stopped when we released this data so it's about three thousand uh people and and i'm gonna use the survey weights to uh uh that mostly balances uh race and ethnicity in some state level variation that are not um not equal uh so this graph shows just the histogram of of the day the week of interview most of the interviews happened in uh second half of june and in july and the date of the interview is not random not randomly assigned there's some is there's quite some variation in in a lot of things across time so i'm not going to do any i'm not going to show any any across time comparisons but whatever i whatever we'll see is representative of the summer of 2020 mostly july i think of july there's quite a lot even within that module that approximately 10 minute long part of the questionnaire and i'll in this talk i will focus on on a few things mostly those that are uh that are that you can analyze from mostly from survey data and you need actual people to give actual responses and you cannot really substitute admin data for those so some of that is is concern other that is uh income and spending and if you get to the end of the talk i'm going to show you some uh some things that people tell us in their own words so these are the concern and experience questions one is there's a there's an overall concern question scale 1 to 10 and then there are various levels of experience of covered whether the respondent themselves had called it or tested positive for calling uh whether somebody else in the household had called it or was test deposit for kobe and what we think is is is very is going to be very interesting is whether the respondent knows someone who had to call it or someone who had died from covet so these are the the reason the left side is by education groups and the right right side is by race and ethnicity uh about one point five percent had coveted you know reported to have had kobe in this sample uh that's uh not not much uh much interesting heterogeneity there copied in the household is now combined the respondents and their households that's about twice the the rate but again not not significant differences where we see significant differences is whether someone someone with a respondent knows someone who had coveted and there uh there's a very steep education gradient that's probably due to the size of networks people have the more people you know the more likely somebody from that group had called it on the other hand if you if you break this down by by by race and ethnicity you need you see that you see that african-americans have an especially high rate of knowing someone who died from carpet and i also ran some regressions and this is this is this is a people's response to concern average concern is pretty high on a on a one to ten scale it's about eight standard deviations about 2.5 there's not much going on by education the right panel shows something else this is the proportion of people who are not at all concerned that's only five percent in the sample but among white non-hispanic males that's closer to 10 but sample sizes are small so uh here are some regressions i'm going to come back to the results but there's one picture that i think is is is kind of interesting this is the gender difference in average average concern by by jander and whether single or in couple and uh so the the overall average is something like 7.5 and the single women have a are the top and darkest line there it's a flat line across age single men are the bottom green line and it's the the difference is pretty wide it's about three quarters of a standard deviation and the the difference closes starts closing after age 65 and closes by age 80. by age 80 there are no differences in terms of concern across gender or whether in a couple and that's kind of true for for other uh other uh demographic characters as well uh there we had questions about foregone and deferred healthcare we uh saw uh presentation uh harnessing uh admin data for that what we have now is survey responses and uh these questions explicitly ask for delayed or not not getting the care at all and these are the categories by groups of education major surgery outpatient surgery prescription drug uh very low rates of foregone or delayed care now doctors visit for new condition and doctors visit for ongoing condition or for uh screening or medical checkup are more of a higher rate and there is a kind of an increasing uh education gradient but it's by far the strongest for dental checkups i mean i think the reasons are kind of obvious there's a lot of uh yeah we also ask why why the respondents thought these were these these types of terror were delayed or foregone and by far the most important is rescheduling by doctors in hospitals there's a there are questions of kobe don't work and here uh it's a stack bar chart on the left side uh among the people with zero to zero to 11 years of education almost half stopped working most of them were furloughed the second the most in most important category is other reason as opposed to quit or lost and that this kind of let's under progress to to make sense of what other reasons and if you look at people who continued working but their work changed that's the right side right right side picture what we see is hours uh changed for the lowest educated people and working for hope from home that's for people like us college educated people not for others effect of on income expenditures and and uh uh hardship i would like to focus on just uh income and and spending and uh income up or down relatively low uh rates of income going down and relatively little about education as opposed to what we see in terms of spending on the right-hand side here i mean there's a steep increasing gradient of decreased spending yeah that was okay so spending is is negatively related to education the more educated cut spending the most and that's true if you condition on other things as well and it's especially so if you look at decreased decreased income hispanics stand out even if you condition on on education and age and uh of course income decreases more for people we have a lower age group in our in our sample who still work uh whereas in terms of spending it's the most educated who cut back spending by far the most and of course the youngest work and i think reasons that are not very surprising uh so uh two more things you know i think this data is going to be eventually valuable to uh to see kind of effects of kobe on stuff and in terms of stuff i i show results with from regressions with three different left-hand side variables that are survey measures of health self-created health it's uh the way it's going to shine a regression is standardized and higher values are going to mean better health depression it's again going to be standardized here higher values uh more depressed and the subjective probability to leaving a target moving to a target age on a scale of one uh to a hundred people are asked what the chances that they're going to live to a target age i converted to that to a zero to one probability on the right hand side there are these covered module variables uh in the hrs and i refer the condition on the 2018 values of all of these three outcome variables so they're going to be on the right hand side and demographics and yellow so these are the result results from the first set of regressions in which the right hand side variables are concerned and experience with coping and deferred or delayed healthcare and yellow are the coefficients that are statistically significantly significantly different from zero when conditioned on everything and we see that separated health is actually negatively associated with deferred doctors the prudential is probably absolutely selection and that's what we kind of see in the subjective probabilities as well but the product visit is negatively associated with self-created health and and depression yet perhaps surprisingly neither the our concern measures nor or uh other uh uh uh exposure to cobalt measures are are really seem to be related to depression and if you look at uh work and economic variables how they are uh associated with uh with suffering health depression or the subjective survival probability this other other reason of to stop working is an interesting category these are probably voluntary separations they're associated with a higher cell created health and uh we don't see anything about we don't see anything with respect to working from home for example i mean there's there's a lot of selection there's a lot of selection going on uh there's there's something that we see about help received non-money health non-monetary help received is associated with the with the uh worse uh health and higher levels of depression probably it's again a probably reverse causality so uh i think you know this is this data has a lot of potential for the future uh especially when combined with the rest of the panel and when we're looking at longer term outcomes and of course all of this data can be combined with uh linked with the cms data or social security data in a secure environment and of course uh state level policy changes can be uh linked to to the data as well again in a secure data environment so i think there's there's a lot more to learn from this data than what i have just showed and maybe this particular module of of uh covet-related questions is not going to be the most valuable part of such analysis but there are some interesting things here that are that i think are not you would not be you would not be able to see otherwise and one is this these results uh about uh knowing somebody who had coveted and knowing somebody who died from copyright close to forty percent know someone who had coveted and close to twenty percent know someone who died from calvin in our sample and this is summer this is the summer and so that's going to increase um probably a lot for the fall wave and level of concern is high there's a small minority that is not concerned and there are some interesting patterns by not not not only by uh race and education that people would would guess but also by by whether uh people are single and it's a single man single white men have lower average concern than almost below age 70 have lower concern than anybody else and then uh another interesting result is um is uh is that spending decreased more than so more people report their that their spending decrease then the proportion of people report their income decreased there's not much of an educate education gradient for decreasing combat there is a there's a there is a remarkable result for hispanics and uh spending decreased for the uh younger and more educated part of our sample and there are the associations with with the current health and there are some interesting positive as well as an interesting uh negative results i mean by that i mean no results um these are very primary results so i don't want to spend too much time on them just closing with the uh with uh just a taster of what people told us about half of our respondents are providing some answer to the following question are there other things about your experience since the chronovirus pandemic started that you you would like to share with us at the end of the interview we are in the process of transcribing those so 50 say something of those 50 20 are transcribed now so it's about 10 of the 3 000 people that we have in this sample but it's work in progress there are some very interesting ones uh some responses that you think are you know closer to an average response but you also have to and uh so there is a there's actually uh if our if our linkage is correct which is not 100 sure the second bullet point is from a married woman of age 76 with a college college graduate degree and having reporting a pretty high concern who thinks this is a hoax by the way the concern is about the whole situation not the disease itself so uh that's not necessarily um uh an error here but something interesting and uh somebody with the proxy respondent and adult child for for her mother and was in nursing home so i think this text might also provide some good opportunities to to uh to mine in the future that was it so far thanks a lot thank you um so there was there were a couple of questions about how this compares to other data and david weir said you'll be able to compare them to other surveys when you can get their data i don't know if you want to add anything on that well i mean i mean the slide david showed about the uh we have so this is the summer so so experience of kobe this is still kind of uh not not as frequent as but but we have a remarkable remarkably good match of uh over the geographic and time variation of of coped uh experienced and uh and the uh uh and the admin admin sources and we also have some some other results like the effect of the stimulus payment program and what we see that we haven't presented anything on that here that matches quite well with with other other sorts of other surveys that that you know one thing that i have that you have that i have to emphasize is that everybody was improvising when when putting together this questionnaire so there was less harmonization across surveys than than ideal because everybody wanted to get get out quickly so it's going to take more work than usual to compare things across surveys i think but we of course will do what we can let me ask you if there are particular bunch of comments let me ask you if there are particular issues in the chat that any of the members of the team want to address [Music] i have not followed the chat but i will take a look um bruce do you want to ask your question [Music] uh sure no i was just wondering if you could look at how mental and physical health um vary um according to the case rates and different you know i mean i don't know what level of geography you have presumably you have a fair amount of detail i don't know whether you can use it for you know what i say you use it for research purposes but across geographies case levels um and the various policies that um that folks uh that folks are experiencing absolutely before you before you take that one sylvia had a sort of similar theme which is how does it compare pre and post covid so i don't know if you know about either of those dimensions geographically or time series uh well i mean all of our so the publicly available data is not very detailed in terms of geography but there is a there's access to uh pretty detailed geographic information in this in our secure data environment which you can work with from home as well and uh and there and when we are we're trying to put in uh data sets that will describe state-level policies and and maybe other variables but any every researcher can bring their own geographic data in and and link it to the hrest but this is a panel so you can also condition on on on individual level pre pandemic things like you know in the last set of regressions we conditioned on three pandemic outcome levels of audio all the outcome variables which is a big plus of panels like such as like the hrs so i would just emphasize i mean the data are out there uh you can look yourselves uh so when we look a little bit and tasha is changing at the individual level basically for the older population at least those who are willing to do a survey in this environment we don't see big changes in depression measures um maybe more fine grain or more subtle measure would show a little bit more but other studies find the same thing with bigger effects on younger people than there are on older people even though older people are much more vulnerable biologically to the disease they seem more able mentally to handle the situation okay thank you all um very nice paper very nice very good job um why don't we move on to um java grooms alberto ortega joaquin rubal calpe i hope i got that right on racial and ethnic disparities essential workers mental health and the covid pandemic thank you so much thank you all um in advance for your comments and your feedback this paper racial and ethnic disparities essential workers mental health and the coronal virus pandemic was something um alberto joachim and i started to think about very early on in the coronavirus we were collaborating on something else we began having dialogue about how vulnerable populations may be um disproportionately affected by closet and so we started to investigate or started to brainstorm on how we could look at this and we became part of a survey group which ed vargas is part of okay so go a little bit on background spend most of the time on the data methods we use a unique survey data nationally representative to look at mental health distress and go over the results and probably and get in a little bit to what we hope to do in the future so as many of us are aware of as of today there are 276 deaths in the united states from covet point million confirmed cases in the u.s january 21st marked the first reported case in the u.s and about a month later on february 29th was the first reported death there was a national emergency declared on march 13th and by the end of march 30 states had stay at home orders the survey we have multiple waves in our survey the survey wave we're going to focus on is right towards the end of march when the survey was fielded at the very beginning of april so we were really interested in looking at how covet has affected american households beyond exposure beyond mortality and as coronavirus as we went into march in april became pretty clear that black communities were being disproportionately affected right so here's a snapshot when we look at the population the black population in louisiana it's roughly 32 percent of the state population are african-american yet in april as of april 6 70 of the covet-related deaths were identified as black through the cdc and we see illinois and michigan relatively close about 14 to 15 of the state's population is black but about 40 to 42 percent um were counted as black deaths for covet right individuals that passed away from covet were identified as black and carolina was pretty um representative at 22 of the population in north carolina identified as black and roughly 22 percent of the culver-related deaths but to give you a sense of what was happening in the united states on april 15th because this is in the middle of when we fielded our survey so of the states that collected information on race and ethnicity below are the number of states which reported an over-representation so more deaths more covet-related deaths than the state's population of that race and our ethnicity so for individuals that identified as asian it was one of 19 states and i believe it was alabama for individuals that were identified as black it was for 18 of 23 states hispanic zero of 20 states one thing to note for hispanic and indigenous is while they weren't over represented for covet-related deaths they were over-represented for covet-related cases at this time indigenous it was one of 12 states i believe that was new mexico and for individuals that were identified as white that passed away from covet it was zero of 23 states that were overrepresented now just getting a snapshot of what was happening so this is the end of june or end of july and this is looking at covert related depth per 100 000. and we can see that those individuals that were black are african-american um substantially at greater risk of passing away from covet 19 relative to the rest of the other racial and ethnic groups in the united states you can see um native indigenous people and hispanic or 40 um cover related deaths per 100 000 and then asian white uh native hawaiian and pacific islanders and other were right around 30 um covert related deaths per 100 000. so it became really clear to us that there was a disparity in cases and in immortality as related to covet what we really were interested in is okay we know more people are dying from covets that are black that are hispanic but what are the other outcomes tell us are they affecting these vulnerable households so motivating force behind this research is as the u.s charts a path forward how would incorporate policies that ensure racial and ethnic quality as part of the recovery without understanding how the covet 19 how covet 19 has impacted black and hispanic communities beyond viral exposure mortality and we focus on black and hispanic communities for multiple a few a few reasons one our survey um we don't have enough observations to look at indigenous people pacific islanders or individuals that identify as asian and two we were also in this paper we also exploit this idea of whether you're an essential worker or not and we know that black and hispanic workers are more likely to be front line workers essential non-health care workers what are we interested in so given this racial and ethnic disparity of covet 19 cases mortality and exposure we use a nationally representative survey to assess how reported mental health distress differ by race and ethnicity and across current employment status so in our survey we ask questions about whether individuals are working from home or not and if they're considered an essential worker and if they are if they work in the healthcare industry or not and these are all self-reported so getting into the data so we use the national panel study of covet 19. the data we utilize has been collected as part of a larger survey fielded by ucla in collaboration with university of new mexico arizona state and unc chapel hill so it's really great this panel study started right before the pandemic was declared a national emergency on march 11th was when it was first fielded but the first wave didn't ask the economic questions and the mental health questions and the financial stability questions that were asked in ways too so in ways to alberto joaquim and i were lucky to become part of the study and we were able to introduce economic questions mental health questions financial stability questions as well as some education questions we have um wave three as well we don't utilize that in this study but we are hopeful to utilize it in the future and we look at it for some other research we're working on related to covid and we are in the process of working on wave four and hopefully fielding wave five as well so wave two the wave two we have a little bit over three thirty three hundred observations and roughly about two thousand of them are a panel they're from wave one and roughly one thousand is a fresh cross section each time we go back into the field we introduce a fresh cross-section this is national household it's a national household survey we have data down to the zip codes our racial breakdown is roughly 70 percent white 70 of respondents are white a little bit less than ten percent are hispanic and a little bit more than twelve percent are black and it's these economic and health questions um that were introduced in ways two that we're really gonna focus on for this paper so for our survey questions for employment we have information about whether you are unemployed and if you were unemployed were you in the labor force or not were you actively looking for work we have questions of whether you're an employed non-central worker and if so are you working from home right so when we talk about employed non-essential worker in this paper we are strictly talking about those individuals that are still working but are working from home and just remember reminder that we're looking at the first few weeks of april this was still pretty early on during kovic and then we asked questions about if you're working and you're not working from home are you in the healthcare industry or not and so employment three four and five is really what we're going to focus on in this paper looking at mental health distress across rates but also across worker typology and we have other variables about financial benefit about financials we have unemployment insurance benefits stimulus one of the really interesting questions um my colleague joaquin rubicon was on on here to help answer questions later but i believe he's the one that introduced that thought of this idea this question we asked questions about when did you apply for unemployment insurance and when did you actually receive it so we have information about how long it took to receive it and we see some differences across rates um on length it took to receive we have questions about stimulus what were you spending your stimulus on if you haven't received it what do you predict yourself to spend your stimulus on household income do you live paycheck to paycheck we have other questions on physical health eating habits right substance use we have questions on distance learning we have household levels questions that look at age size composition of the household how many children live in the household how many elderly live in the household but for this paper what we really focus on is this mental health so we use a quasi ph29 and a quasi gag seven we take three inventories from the ph29 that get at depression and two inventories from the gad7 that get it anxiety unfortunately we just didn't have the bandwidth in this survey to ask all of these 16 inventories so we focused on those that we felt got really at depression and really focused on anxiety and this is what we've seen other studies do as well so what exactly mental health questions do we ask so for anxiety we ask um so in the past two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problems anxiety feeling nervous anxious or on edge two not being able to stop not being able to stop or control worrying and then when we're looking at depression it's little interest our pleasure in doing things feeling down depressed or hopeless and trouble sleeping at night and responded um each of the mental health items were surveyed using a four-point scale right so not at all several days more than half a day and nearly every day so rough back there's a few limitations to the paper as it is now it is a descriptive paper right we use descriptive analysis it is not causal while we're hopeful to get at some mechanism um in our future research this paper as it is today is descriptive there might be selection bias in terms of the employee type represented so we weight the data to similar to what's done in burfish to look to resemble national nationally what is happening one big caveat is we don't have baseline analysis right we didn't have the wherewithal to think in february or january to put this survey out so what we do and in our paper we describe this a little bit more is we look at birthes and we look at what was happening in the response to ph 2 um 9 and gag 7 in bertha's in 2018 also another limitation is our worker typology is self-reported so there's no way to cross-reference this we didn't we didn't and i don't know that we would have asked what their current industry they work in or what their job title is okay so this is what we um superimposed our results up against what bertha's results were for 2018 and so burfus was in the red ours is in the blue and what we see is that across white hispanic and black on average we see elevated levels of depression and elevated levels of anxiety and i we feel pretty comfortable that that's what we expected to see that across the board everyone was going to report elevated levels of depression and anxiety we see some differences across race but nothing too glaring so how does reported mental health distress differ by race ethnicity and across employment status so a previous result and then i'll get a little bit more in depth but we observe a statistically significant difference in the mental health distress of black and hispanic respondents in some of the worker typologies relative to white counterparts results suggest elevated mental health distress for all black workers but particularly essential non-health care workers and for hispanic essential non-health care workers and this is this follows what our intuition was that essential non-healthcare workers are typically lower paid workers front line industries have higher level of exposure so to get at this we use um two models so to assess mental health distress across race ethnicity and worker typology we employ two models the first we estimate the probability of experiencing mental health distress across in each individual inventory so across all five individual inventories and then we estimate the severity of mental health distress from the quasi dad 7 and phq 9 scores and so there we generate a score similar to what's done in versus so using a logistic regression we our dependent variable is a dichotomous variable one if there's any worry in the past two weeks and zero if no worries reported our variable of interest is that intersection between um employment the employment indicator and the race binary and we control for state fixed effects we have a vector of state-level pandemic response policies and we have a vector of individual level characteristics as well as household characteristics and then for a second model we transform our measures of severity using the z-score this approach allows us to interpret intergroup differences of symptom severity in terms of standard deviations and so our dependent variable here would just be this um quasi-gad7 and phq-9 score again it's quasi-because we for gad7 only use two inventories instead of the full seven and for phq9 we use three instead of the four nines so let me kind of in terms say what we find our results fine so for these essential non-healthcare workers for individuals that were black we find a statistically significant increase um and elevate it so we find really significant elevated levels of mental health distress across all five inventories ranging from 27 to 52 percentage points for those that are hispanic we find statistically significant elevated levels of mental health of mental distress across inventories ranging from 33 to 62 percentage points we do find some particularly significant differences for essential health care workers although i caution these results because when we cut across we only have i believe roughly around 200 essential health care workers in our data set for the entire um study when you start cutting across the race you get to such a small group one of the interesting results that we weren't expecting to find is non-essential workers the workers who are working from home those individuals that were black reported elevated levels of mental health distress for three of the five inventories so to give you a sense um the green are the essential non-health care workers so we can see for anxiety worry depression um lack of pleasure and lack of sleep we can see all statistically significant increases keep an iron time okay so for our next model what we did oh sorry here so for our next model is the scores so what we see here is we instead of looking at each individual inventory for the depression and for anxiety we created a score and we see similar results for individuals for essential non-health care workers we see between 0.7 and 0.8 standard deviations for elevated levels of depression anxiety and for hispanics we see nearly across the board one standard deviation right we see an elevated mental health stress of 1.1 standard deviations for depression and about 0.9 for anxiety so we limited our results robust to limiting our data to those individuals under 65 um it's across multiple measures of anxiety and depression including and excluding the five state states with no stay at home order and control for perception of 19 exposure so we asked questions similarly to the previous um presentation whether individuals knew someone that passed away from covet whether they were exposed to govit so we were able to get a sense of perception of covet exposure so conclude in conclusion across all inventories essential non-health care black and hispanic workers have elevated levels of mental health distress we believe this presents strong evidence that black and hispanic workers face different mental health stressors than the white counterparts in the same employment type this is especially important given black and hispanic workers are over-represented in jobs front-line industries but relatively low wages and often no employer provided health insurance one of the questions we asked on a survey was about health insurance and we do see a difference so looking at essential non-health care workers it was roughly individuals that identified as white roughly two percent of potential non-healthcare workers lacked health insurance roughly eight percent of hispanics lacked health insurance and 10 of those individuals that identified as black black health insurance right so between eight to ten percent of black and hispanic essential workers working through the pandemic very early on in april lacked health insurance so moving forward it's essential to ensure that the pre-existing barriers in seeking mental health treatment do not further exacerbate the prevailing disparities in diagnosis and treatment of mental illness interventions to help combat a looming mental health crisis might focus on meeting people where they are to help provide adequate mental health mental health care and i think it's important to note that the co-occurrence of mental health and substance use there's a lot of possible looming other side effects of these elevated levels of mental health distress thank you my welcome questions uh my co-authors are here also to hopefully help answer some questions thank you that was a very interesting and extremely well presented um ellen mira had asked the question she she told me she had to run off to something but she asked the question given how how much higher coverage mortality is for blacks are you surprised by these findings or is there a way to kind of benchmark them like man this is really big or i'm surprised it's not bigger or you know like like how do i how do i interpret the magnitude of them that's a good question sorry i'm reading the question as well so i think you know we control for exposure one thing i i would like to go back and look at a comment i got just a couple of days ago i'm presenting this work is if we stratified by perceived exposure how might these these look different right we're stratified by race but also by employment type but what might it look like if we stratify like by exposure um joaquin did you want to add anything to that um i remember looking at the results initially and one of the i was i was actually surprised that we didn't see a larger disparity than what we saw um given our results and so we really looked at the the the literature on resiliency across race and ethnicity to see if there was any evidence there and we got a lot of mixed results and so um yeah i'm not i'm not really sure why um you know we weren't getting larger disparities than what we had thought but i to add on to that to um one thing that was about financial employment that a situation so or because i'm worried about so i do think that that may be contributing to our results that we see for um non-essential black workers right so for non-essential black workers we still see anxiety and worry and i don't remember who we cited in our paper but right there's like a saying that black men are the last to be hired first to be fired so i do think that some of this worry of employment um could be contributing to this mental health distress something we're hoping to do so we have this information for wave 3 as well something we're hoping to do as time goes along is better understand the mechanisms that are causing this we thought it was really important in real time to expose what's happening to show these associations while we continue to work to better understand the mechanisms causing these associations sorry to jump in could i'm trying to think about sort of the variance of you know what the work how much of the worry is about disease versus jobs and you do you said you had zip code right so have you i mean i realize you sort of get have vanishingly small sample sizes but i'm wondering have you looked at that even sort of like you know medium below medium high above median or something along those lines so i think that's something we're still working on so what we had done for the first pass is look at perceived exposure and control for perceived exposure but you know we're talking about going back and trying to figure out some way to characterize actual exposure since we do have zip code data so i i agree i think that could be really useful in understanding if it's covered something also to note is um this survey was filled in april so this was before george floyd passed away this was before a big push for black lives matter movement we do have wave three which was um after that so seeing those differences could be really interesting as well we also asked a lot of questions about people's perception around george floyd as well and and the national response to that so we can control for a lot of that as well i'm looking through the questions you know one question we've got in the past is using versus as a baseline one of the issues we have with this paper is any pre-studies that look at previous studies that look at mental health distress won't have don't typically have information on the employment type so being able to control for race and employment type pre-cove it becomes pretty difficult and so that's what we're still working on finding a way to look at some causal inference of covet across worker typology and race but that is a little bit more difficult for finding let me just open it up to either any of the chat questions that you want to address or any questions that other people have just feel free to raise them you may want to stop sharing just so you can see everyone there you go thank i you it would be interesting to compare these to things like the hrs and other data sources the household pulse survey and things like that as well one thing lisa we created this survey and then the pulse survey came out one of the reassuring things was i believe the pulsate survey also uses two inventories from um the gag seven and two inventories for phq-9 to get at this level depression and anxiety too which was reassuring for us okay that's a really good suggestion one person asked if we can use a benchmark the differential responses across race from other survey pre-covert and we hadn't done that but we could do that right we could do that looking at verses thank you so much thank you very much thank you that was terrific okay um uh and then our our final paper is going to be uh larry baker kate bundorf and maya russian slater on racial and ethnic disparities in primary care use in the coca-19 pandemic okay um i'm sharing my screen here so hopefully you all can see this okay great um thank you so much uh for including us on this very interesting program um and thank you to all of you for being here and just sticking it out till the last session um so this is joint work with my colleagues lauren baker and kate bundorf at stanford um and uh this work wouldn't be possible without fantastic research assistance from our pre-doctoral research fellows christine kim and kate moulton and so we're looking at racial and ethnic disparities in primary care use um and the fluid 19 pandemic um of course um so just to sort of motivate this work you know as everybody on this conference knows there exists large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities and access to primary health care and use um so broadly speaking black and hispanic patients face higher barriers to receiving adequate and timely care than their non-hispanic white counterparts now while the evidence on the impact of primary or preventative care and sort of health outcomes as well as health care spending is of course varied and mixed you know broadly speaking we think that timely primary care is important and therefore you know disparities in care might contribute to disparities and health outcomes so um as we all know cloven 19 has created unprecedented challenges for the health care system um but there's relatively little known about how these disparities specifically evolved during the pandemic you know we've already seen today quite a lot of work on various um aspects both um in terms of the impacts of covid on outpatient and primary care use such as the paper presented earlier today by uh ngz dawn and co-authors um and then of course also we know a lot about we're starting to know a lot about uh the disparate impacts of the pandemic um across different races and ethnicities in terms of actual infections caseloads and deaths and then just now we learn more about mental well-being um but it seems that we still don't know quite as much about disparities um and access to care um so just to sort of uh bring us all on the same page you know what we know so far about covet 19 in primary care use based on the ever-evolving and quickly expanding literature so of course we know that federal state and local regulations have meant that many health care have had to either limit or completely stop normal operations and of course individuals have also changed their behavior both because they're concerned about getting exposed to the virus but then also because they are losing many people are losing their jobs and with that they're losing their employer provided health insurance so just one data point on this um a nationally representative survey of non-elderly adults conducted in may of 2020 shows that almost half of adults and families who have lost work-related income are foregoing health care they would have otherwise gone um you know so so again so we know unsurprisingly there's a large reduction in outpatient primary care use that's been documented using various data sources so one sort of thing i think would be interesting to try to understand is what's driving some of the differences and the magnitudes um across you know that work um and what we'll be showing you here today of course different data means different clinics for example are reporting in those data from different areas um also different just methodologies and different timelines um but you know so i think going forward it will be useful to try to understand more about kind of how to compare across these different studies um and we also know that you know this reduction is not the same for all types of care so for instance um there's actually less reduction in access to mental health care as well as some of the urgent care in part due to more use of telehealth and then you know there's this question of is this mostly driven by policies like state home orders or is this mostly driven by individual behavior our read of the literature is that you know it suggests that most of this is driven actually by individual behavior rather than policies per se now when it comes to racial and ethnic disparities uh and the code with 19 pandemic you know as we've discussed in the last few uh talks black and hispanic individuals are both more likely to contract the virus as well as more likely to die from it than non-hispanic whites although of course there's some diff important differences across geography and across those two subgroups what about disparities in care utilization for those who have not contracted the virus so one question is whether minorities uh bear a disproportionate cost of the pandemic on this margin as well and then digging into that of course there's diff all kinds of differences within those groups so for instance are there differences between patients of different ages like children versus prime age adults versus those who are over 65 so one paper uh by whaley at all uh show do a little bit of analysis uh by race ethnicity using information on zip codes um so in looking at the composition the ratio of ethnic composition of uh patients zip codes finding that those in zip codes that have a higher proportion of racial ethnic minorities actually experience smaller reductions in outpatient visits in march and april 2020 but that study did not have access to individual level uh race ethnicity data and more generally um you know we know less about other racial groups so asians um american indians indigenous people um largely in part due to sample size constraints so what we're going to do in this paper is we're going to use a novel large scale real time so to speak although there is some lag data for more than 1 000 family medicine practices in the united states to answer uh the following four questions so first how did primary care use change in the first few months of the pandemic relative to prior years um and then what were the differences in primary care use across five racial ethnic groups uh before and then during the pandemic so we're gonna look separately at hispanics non-hispanic black non-hispanic white non-hispanic asian and non-hispanic american indian alaska native um are these baseline disparities and pandemic related changes and disparities different across patients of different ages again we're going to focus on children under 18 prime age adults 18 to 64 and then individuals age 65 and older and then lastly are these baseline disparities as well as the pandemic related changes and disparities different across different types of visits so for now we're going to specifically look at visits that are seen that are preventive as coded as being preventative visits that have any vaccine associated with them these could be also coded as preventive or they're just for the vaccine and then all other i.e non-preventive and non-vaccine-related visits so our data is the prime registry so this is a qualified clinical data registry certified by centers for medicaid and medicare we have electronic medical record information on health care delivered by over 1200 family medicine practices in total about 5.8 million patients who have been seen since 2015. um and you know we're still this is a huge data set it's fairly new and we're still working out all the details of all the variables that we have but for now um we have information on patient race ethnicity age gender health insurance status although i will caveat that that it looks like this information is actually not super reliably coded and then diagnosis as well as cpt codes so the way that we conduct our analysis is going to be a little bit different than what has been done in prior work in which folks have typically just sort of aggregated the total number of outpatient or primary care visits of different types and sort of looked at trends over time here because we're interested in trying to look at disparities by race ethnicity by age by type of visit we want to be careful in terms of accounting sort of for pre-existent differences in access to care and years prior to the pantomic so what we do to do this is we're going to focus on sort of four cohorts of patients where we define our cohorts by those who had at least one visit in 2016 and the second cohort is patients who had at least one visit in 2017 then those who had at least one visit in 2018 and those who had at least one visit in 2019 okay so these are patients essentially who have some some contact uh with uh the clinics that are in our data um and then what we're going to look as what happens to their likelihood of returning for another visit in the following year specifically in each week of the following year um in order to make sure because you know this data is relatively new and um there's some variation in which practices report um in different years of the data um in order to make sure that our results are not being driven sort of by practices that are dropping out and so on and maybe those practices are located systematically in places that have different racial ethnicity compositions in order to sort of avoid issues along those lines we're going to limit our analysis to a consistent set of practices that are reporting data in each february of 2016 through 2020 right so we're focusing on february because that's sort of the last month pre-pandemic um and so we're going to look at the practices that have been in the data every february of every year um and and looking at what happens to patients with those practices as i mentioned we're going to look at patients return visits and each week of the following year right now we have cleaned up data through week 21 that is the week of may 18th 2020 um but you know we're getting updated data every few months or so so we're hoping to be able to extend this analysis further out uh we're going to look at five racial ethnic groups as i mentioned for three different age groups and for three types of visits um just to give you a sense of uh where our data is coming from this is just a map of uh the locations of patients that are included in the prime registry you know i'm not gonna try to spend too much time on this other just to point out that our data is fairly broadly national with counties all across america having patience in this data okay so just to give you a sense of the characteristics um of our cohorts um so here in the top panel we just have some baseline uh patient characteristics uh mean age is around 47.48 about 43 to 44 of our sample is male and then you see the racial and ethnic distribution um here down below um one thing i just want to highlight here is that it's helpful for us that the composition of the four cohorts that we're studying is quite similar right so it's not the case that the patterns that we're going to be finding for 2020 return visits are going to be biased by the fact that the types of patients who are in the 2019 cohort are sort of systematically different from patients in early cohorts that does not appear to be the case which we wouldn't have necessarily thought would be the case but it's reassuring to see um and then in the bottom panel here uh we're showing you some of the kind of the outcome variables uh that we'll be looking at um so here uh it's we're reporting the share of these cohorts that have at least one uh preventive visit vaccine related visit or other type of visit uh through week 21 of the next year it's approximately mid-may of every uh of every year um so already you can see that for the 2019 cohort right the uh that's the cohort that we'll be following in 2020 you know you see substantial reductions um in uh all three categories of visits um although there are some differences in the magnitudes across the three types okay um so i think this graph which just uses kind of raw data uh highlights um kind of the what we're looking at and also uh motivates um some of the empirical models fairly simple empirical models uh that will be that we'll be running um so here what i'm showing you is data from our two of our cohorts so the 2018 cohort that's the last pre-pandemic cohort and then the 2019 cohort that's going to be our pandemic cohort right these are the patients whose visits we're tracking in 2020 okay and then the lines here are different colors i'm sorry if you can't distinguish across all the colors because we're trying to plot it for all of the different racial and ethnic groups uh the black line shows uh return visits for all groups okay and then you see the different categories in the different colors below um and i guess the thing to note here is first uh there is some you know seasonal variation across weeks of the year in terms of uh the likelihood that uh patients are returning for subsequent visits um but there's a clear fall uh in that happens at week around week 12 of 2020 and so that's going to be the week of march 16th 2020 of note is that the federal emergency declaration happened on march 13th the friday before that and so a lot of stay-at-home orders and uh were issued immediately after that um so you see there's a big decline in return visits immediately following that uh for the 2019 cohorts but there are some differences in terms of the magnitude of this decline relative to the pre-pandemic levels um across the racial and ethnic groups that we'll be examining um in our analysis um and essentially what we're going to do is we're going to look at the difference in return visits following the pandemic for the 2019 cohort right and net out seasonal differences in return visits across weeks of the year using the prior cohorts okay so then we can also look at differences in patterns for patients in different age groups so some interesting uh things emerge here so first of all as you notice our y scale is scaled uh the same across the three graphs here so use comparison of these magnitudes um so for kids um one thing that you can see here is that you know first kids have um somewhat lower likelihood of uh uh being uh of returning of in the subsequent year for follow-up visit for example relative to patients age 65 plus which is perhaps not surprising so pre-pandemic and then it falls uh once the pandemic begins and what's interesting that any pre-existing racial and ethnic disparities um so the different color lines on this graph basically disappear right um almost entirely um the only group that we see sort of being even lower than the other groups here is the non-hispanic asian children for whom we see even lower rates of return visit following the pandemic okay for the elderly so those who are age 65 plus you see sort of first of all baseline visit rates are higher which is perhaps not too surprising um there's still a big drop um but the sort of disparities um continue to exist um following uh the pandemic um and you know there are some sort of changes in the relative magnitudes of cross-racial groups meaning that that some disparities are actually reduced um that we're gonna explore uh in our analysis okay another way of sort of looking at our data is to as i mentioned previously to try to account for sort of the typical seasonality that occurs in different weeks of the year in terms of return visits um and so what we're showing you here are coefficients and 95 confidence intervals um on interactions between uh different week indicators right so week one through 21 of uh of any given year with an indicator for the 2019 cohort which is the cohort for whom we're studying uh the pandemic return visits okay so uh so a couple things to note here first these graphs are showing you that relative to the average return visit rate across all years in our data 2020 return visit rates are lower already pre-pandemic okay you see that by looking at the coefficients for weeks 1 through 11 right on these graphs and they're lower than that horizontal red line okay but of course there's a drop starting with week 12 that week of march 16 2020 but one thing that's sort of interesting is you see that there are differences in these magnitudes across racial and ethnic groups so the fall for non-hispanic whites for example is bigger than uh the fall for non-hispanic black patients and is also bigger than the fall for non-hispanic american indian um the fall for hispanic patient is approximately similar to uh non-hispanic points okay so uh what we do in order to sort of quantify these differences a bit more concretely is uh we collapse our data into cohort by week of year by patient race ethnicity cells and then we estimate regressions where we as the outcomes we look at um the number of return visits of different types per 1000 patients in each week of every year by patients of each race ethnicity group okay and we regress that on an indicator for you know being in pandemic time so that's uh week 12 2020 march 16 2020 or later um and we include race dummy and race dummies and full set of race by week uh interaction terms as well as um uh interactions between our race dummies and the pandemic indicator to look at differences across racial groups and okay uh so that's what these results look like um so here we're looking at uh return visits per 1000 patients across all age groups um aggregated together um split by you know any type of visit and then preventive vaccine related or other okay so uh the emitted category here is non-hispanic white patients um and then you can see the bottom here um the the interaction terms are showing you the differential effects for different racial and ethnic groups relative uh to the non-hispanic white group um so what you can see is that sort of for the main effect of being in pandemic times there is a large drop in visits which is about 23 per 1000 patients that's quite high right relative to the dependent variable mean of 61 per 1000 patients um but there's interesting differences across racial and ethnic groups so for example the magnitude of the fall in these visits for non-hispanic black patients is actually smaller um than that for non-hispanic white patients so that disparity so to speak is actually lowered um and if you look at whether this is driven by preventive visits or other types of visits it's entirely loading on other types of visits so it's not that the disparity in preventive visits is being reduced it's that uh it's you know one hypothesis is that non-hispanic black patients might have more more kind of urgent care needs because of various underlying health conditions and other reasons um and so there's sort of less uh postponable uh care uh for that group uh when we look at for example non-hispanic asian patients uh the disparity is actually widened right so the the reduction in these visits for that group is even is bigger uh than than for uh non-hispanic white for hispanic actually the difference in the reduction is not statistically different uh than for non-his standards okay then we look separately across age groups so this is what it looks for kids as you saw from the raw graphs basically the there's a huge drop in visits for kids um here we see that this sort of happened across the board for all categories preventive vaccine related as well as other categories um and then you also saw sort of in the raw data graph that any disparities kind of really got compressed and basically very few kids were returning to see primary care doctors once the pandemic started across all of the different racial ethnic groups and you see that here sort of by by the fact that you know for example for non-hispanic black kids um there's no significant difference uh following the pandemic on the interaction term um you know potentially there's a bit of exacerbation in the disparity for parental visits um and maybe a narrowing of disparity in vaccine related visits okay um the pattern for adults age 18 to 64 is here in this table so adults are kind of um have actually the smallest in terms of magnitude reduction um in in pandemic in visits during the pandemic again kind of across the board for preventive vaccine and other and you know again there's some differences across racial ethnic groups so some disparities are made bigger so notably here for the non-hispanic asian group uh whereas others are made smaller uh following the pandemic um but you know and you can see here that um you know for hispanic for example this is being driven by preventive indexing uh related visits okay and then here's uh for the age 65 plus you know as before i noted before they have a much higher baseline rate of um of uh visits um and what's interesting actually here sort of the the the pre-pandemic disparities right so the coefficients on the main effects of the race ethnicities dummies suggest that um individuals from minority backgrounds actually have higher rates of visits potentially due to higher rates of various chronic conditions for example and some of these disparities um so some of these despair disparities are going the other direction uh following the pandemic okay uh so for example the fall for hispanic patients on the pandemic is larger relative to non-hispanic white okay um so what we've learned from this analysis so far is that you know consistent with other data we find that primary care visits fall substantially starting with the week of march 16 2020 what's interesting in our analysis is we do not see much evidence of a rebound at least through the end of our data currently which is the week of may 18 2020. that's different than what's been documented in some other studies um you know there's a lot of reasons for that potentially we have different data that's drawn from a different set of primary care clinics we're using a different method right we're not just counting aggregate visits we're looking at return visits of a set of cohort of patients who have some interaction with the clinics that we have um and then there's differences across uh racial and ethnic groups so i have some numb back of the envelope numbers here um you know i wouldn't pay too close attention to all of these numbers exactly because we're still working out um our analysis uh this is somewhat preliminary but there are sort of there's some evidence that subdisparities have gotten smaller right um so for example the black white american indian white disparities are reduced following the pandemic whereas the asian white disparity has widened but the important point here is that the reduction in disparities is not driven by preventive visits but instead is driven by not preventive visits so potentially urgent or non-avoidable visits uh the widening of the disparities appears to be driven by both preventive and non-preventive physics um when we look separately by age groups we find that the magnitude of the reduction in primary care visits in relative terms relative to the baseline means is the biggest for children we see a more than 50 percent drop in visits across the board the black white disparity uh in vaccine related visits appears to fall but widens for other types of preventive visits um we see a relatively smaller reduction in the in the number of visits for asian children and this is driven entirely by non-preventive vaccine related visits relatively bigger reduction for hispanic children driven by both preventive and non-preventive visits and relatively small reduction from american indian children driven by preventive visits for those who are age 65 plus in baseline years as we've talked about non-white patients have higher rates of non-preventive and vaccine visits these fall by more relatively more hispanic and asian patients by less for black and american indian patients and then relative to non-hispanic white patients vaccine related visits fall by less for hispanic black and american indian patients and by more for asian patients so this is just like a first crack at some of these uh questions i think there's a lot more that could be done with this data you know what we've learned is that the code 19 pandemic has of course presented a huge disruption to the delivery of primary care these impacts were not necessarily equally distributed across racial and ethnic groups however or across patients of different ages so some questions that you know we thought about and you might be thinking about could these impacts be driven by entire practices shutting down so it's like entire practice is shut down and those practices are concentrated in certain neighborhoods that have different racial and ethnic compositions that appears to not be the case uh so our results actually hold up if we restrict to practices that still existed you know already in the middle of the pandemic basically by april may 2020 um what about you know are some of these differences driven by differences in underlying chronic conditions and i think that's potentially a really important uh question to look at um we could do that um we're still working on cleaning up the data to figure out how to account for chronic conditions what about differential responses to state local regulations so you know there's been quite a lot of work trying to understand the impacts of the regulations and trying to tease out the impacts of the regulations from individual behavior um it may be the case that the impacts of these regulations are different across different subgroups um so that's also on the to-do list to look at these effects so that's all i have um and thank you very much uh for your time thank yous because it was one measure of the interest there was a very lively chat that was going on um yes i'm sorry i didn't have a chance to chat let me just ask kate bundorf whether because she was i know she was responding is there anything that she wants to raise or have you discussed um i i don't think so there were lots of goods they made a nice to-do list for us in the chat you know thank you so you wanted us to look at uh televisions they wanted us to look at coded visits they want us to look at cancer screening they want us to look at uh types of chronic care uh and those are all a good idea interested in doing oh and i think you too suggested we could look for that kind of drive-through visits that folks were talking about and we'll definitely ask the data supplier to see whether that you know would be identifiable on the data set oh here i'll give this one to maya do you expect these effects and disparities to be short-lived or will they come back when things rebound yeah i think that's a really really good question you know i think yeah one of the motivation i think for looking at this you know it's sort of interesting obviously it's really interesting to try to important to try to understand you know the disparate potentially disparate impact um of this pandemic on different subgroups and try to understand you know who's most vulnerable in a variety of ways to try to direct the resources as much as possible to those subgroups um but i think kind of like a broader big picture question in my mind is you know they have you know there's obviously persistent large pre-existing disparities um and access to care by race and ethnicity the pandemic is this huge shock to the whole system right for everybody is it gonna reset something or is it gonna make it even worse right and i think we'll only learn that you know as we continue to look at the long-term trends um and you know to try to see what happens to these groups i mean it's sort of i think for kids for example you see basically there were you know meaningful gaps uh before the pandemic and then they're just completely you know go away once the pandemic hits um you know obviously that some of that is just like no kids or very few kids are going to see the doctor uh clearly but you know what's gonna happen going forward and i think that's an important question um so speaking of the long-term impacts how's that for a transition john skinner and i have a question that we want to raise to the group and that is so we originally thought we were going to have one half-day meeting or one couple hour meeting uncovered topics and health economics and so we sent out something in october i think it was asking for papers and we got back so many that we decided we should have two half day meetings because there were so many good ones and now people seem like thoroughly energized even after the second half day meeting and there were still lots of papers that we were interested in hearing so the question is are people like too zoomed out to do any more of this do people want to have another half day meeting sometime in the winter do people what do people have of you at all let me ask you since it's impossible to als say words at once let me ask you just to put in the chat if you would you know i i'd be up for more i think we've probably had plenty let's look for other avenues anything like that anything you want to say yeah dean willard right [Music] this this may be publication bias certainly we're not seeing the null i mean it seems like i mean this is this is a a fun working group and and i think we you know half day we these this sort of uh half day meetings sounds like a great idea i think we could do is make maybe in the early winter send out a notice and schedule i think you think david are you including europe yeah actually uh you know that getting the did you say that elsa is is is getting uh is doing survey data too david or ralph elsa and share i've done um surveys yeah that would be great and and uh you know the other thing is is uh is to have sort of a session on data sources because we've seen a lot of new data sources here and i think that's going to be useful for people thinking about doing their own research i know i've talked to coastally quite a bit about all of the different data this c3n or whatever you know all of these kind of data sources that are becoming available so sounds good maybe we should have a little one data sources yeah dean's involved too okay good excellent all right so i think that provides excellent guidance for us we'll try and start a little later we have to move it a little earlier today so because we know many people want to go to the health care meetings so um great all right well thank you to everyone thank you to the paper present i'll leave myself out of it but thanks that i learned a lot from all the papers that that that i saw so thank you thank you all the time
