so just some basic definitions uh you know to address organ donation shortage in the US and improve its organ matching process the U.S Congress passed the national organ transplant act in 1984 and the Act established the organ procurement and transplantation Network to maintain a National Registry for uh transplantation and United Network for organ sharing is the non-profit organization that manages the opts since 1986 with contract with the federal government a lot is happening these days about eunos and I'll first talk a little bit about that for example in January 2023 eunos launched the first national liver exchange pilot program with the participation of 15 transplant centers and many of us in this event have expertise in research and policy on liver exchange hopefully we can contribute to this exciting initiative for a location of various organs for deceased donors eunos also has been developing a new system for the last few years it's basically a prior to point system eunos promotes it as a more Equitable system and it already launched for the case of lung uh uh but the new system in development already created some anxiety in some groups for example uh so far leaving donors at highest priority under the existing system and it's a really good idea because of incentives considerations but now they are worried that this will change and their prior living donor status will be merely one of several factors that determine priority and you can imagine that can reduce uh Supply quite a bit as it is often the case in the design of such allocation systems in the field there is an oversight of incentive constellations so this is another area where we can be useful but perhaps the most significant transplantation news came just two months agunos Monopoly in the U.S transplantation policy and some of the main concerns about you know include uh too many organs being discarded damaged or not being collected faulty Technologies sometimes geopardizing transplants poor performance facing little accountability and so on according to the Washington Post story I showed one of the objectives under the proposed Federal reform is bringing more transparency to do sometimes procedures of how patients and organs are matched now another key feature of the proposed reforms highlighted in the Washington Post story as follows Health Resources and service Services Administration however is proposing a modular system of improvements that could be tested independent of one another and gradually knit together into a new system while the old one is still running so what is my point here the bottom line is we have there are lots of opportunities for us uh for our ideas but for these ideas to make any policy impact they have to be transparent and in harmony with the rest of the system we cannot just make uh you know all kinds of uh you know suggestions it needs to fit in the system so I will talk about the following question which factors contribute to a possible success of a market design research in the field uh and I will build on my experiences with policy makers and experts from a range of areas since uh 1990s and I will offer my perspective on this which is somewhat different than uh the median researcher in the field so I'll talk about mainly about kidney Exchange and when we introduce this application it was a highly unusual application and it did well it saved lives and it is Saving Lives thousands of lives annually why was that unexpected well it was way outside the traditional domain of economics but let me also emphasize another aspect why it was unusual how from economists was volunteered as Outsiders and it was not solicited right so we offered our own ideas and somehow managed to you know influence policy so how did three economists managed to develop the tools for and help to establish the infrastructure which regularly patches so lives so how did we do it the key is was the following the key was common stakeholders that we can help them to improve their institution in aspects they care about by using the tools they are familiar with or is that the minimum they are comfortable to use and without creating any issues we didn't offer a market for organs right so and I think this point is very general uh to have a realistic chance to influence a policy and aspiring Market designer needs to earn an in-depth understanding of the mission of the institution along with the Practical and transparent plan to improve it often the history of the institution can be very instructive and policy expression if you are writing your papers to change an institution then this is an impact this is an implication on the kind of question you gotta ask you cannot just have really the ideas which are either unclear or considered uh kind of what so how did kidney exchange start in us and in New England uh it didn't start with us uh approved by the eunos Board of Trustees in Fall 2000 the first kidney Exchange program in the US was established in New England which was you know which is eunos region one in February 2001. with the leadership of Frank Delmonico in order to overcome barriers to living donation due to biological incompatibilities the program made two types of Arrangements the first one is you know pair of kidney exchange regular two-way exchange this is a direct exchange of toners between two patients with incompatible donors a second one was the following it's called list exchange and this is essentially a priority in the deceased on our list in exchange for the kidney of the incompatible donors okay now the first one of those pair kidney exchange was originally proposed by a very well respected transplant surgeon uh he was indeed editor of transplantation proceedings for more than 30 years it was first carried out in South Korea in 1991 and the transplantation Community issued issued that concerns a statement in 2000 declaring it as ethically acceptable and this is the best thing you'll hear from doctors I mean this this shows Paradise huge enthusiasm okay and the first pair kidney Exchange in the US was scared out in Rhode Island in 2000 I think wrote uh I'll mention that so list the exchange on the other hand it was introducing Ross and good also transplant surgeons in 2000 is Major appeal is its organizational simplicity like you can do it just with one pair but there was a major ethical concern and the concern was this would be detrimental to blood type or patients on the deceased on our list basically because of the you know blood donation structure okay you know type O blood type O patients are disadvantaged because they can only receive from type of uh donors uh but they can donate to anybody so there is this National Injustice so the consensus statement highlighted the ethical concerns that involve type O patients so there was very different treatment for uh Care Connections versus list Exchange despite the ethical concerns New England included list Exchange in its program in 2001 and the decision was defended by its leadership as follows uh this Exchange program has a clear utilitarian goal we have to have more recipients undergo successful transplantation by expanding the pool of compatible live donors right but reflecting the concerns much of the discussion in Delmonico at all 2004 involves the precautions taken to mitigate the adverse impact on this exchange on type of patients on the disease donors they were very apologetic in the first three years much of the transplants in New England came from list exchanges you know they found 17 list exchanges in three years and they found Forex uh you know paired exchanges uh which provide kidneys to eight patients one problem was prior to our involvement in 2004 the program in New England did not collect data on living dollars of kidney patients that was not a database so that explains a small number of transplants from Pair kidney Exchange in early years of the program now arranging living list exchange does not require a database okay but that too had issues and the issue was the following because it's still less preferred form of kidney exchange a prequisite for eligible for this exchange was to assure that no pair of kidney exchanges feasible between patient and any other patients registered in all 14 transplant centers in the system in a system which doesn't collect database right so so that and as a result there were long delays and this was a friction so under these circumstances we shared the first draft of our paper with Dr darmonico and conveyed our interest to collaborate with them to improve their kidney Exchange program so we didn't just appear with the wild idea actually and our timing was well and let me tell you how we wrote this paper in the first place and I were faculty members at coach University Istanbul K who visited all road at Harvard University for the academic year 2000 to 2003. during his visit as I understand the very first days actually wrote alerted him that a paper that I've written as an unusual direct application in kidney transplantation there was a very clear mapping between my model and uh kidney exchange as a result the mechanism in that paper also had a direct application so in principle we could use this mechanism but that's not what we did so let me explain regulating the claims for unattached house either vacant house or located during the procedure with an exogenous priority list you request my house I get your mechanism organizes two types of exchanges one is cycle so these are existing tenants trading their current houses and the other one is chains so one individual tried her prior to for an unattached house and the remaining individuals trade their current houses pay of kidney exchange analyst exchange corresponds to these two type of arrangements with only two individuals okay now while regulating change through an exogenous prior to list was also a viable uh policy for kidney exchange we made the following observation we could mitigate the adverse impact on list exchange on type all patients on the disease donor list by actually not choosing an exogenous priority list or at least having the flexibility not to do it and through other chain selection rules so we offered a larger manual more importantly we Illustrated that we know what's going on we know what they care about and we have solution for it so in raw some as an inward 2004 we addressed both goals of the transplantation Community with this generalization of the mechanism you know proposing the house allocation paper now our informed and cautious approach resonated with Dr Delmonico who was the chief medical officer at New England organ bank and subsequently he made our group The Following three requests first he said given the skill of simulated welfare gains why to bother with this Exchange in the first place right I mean so uh you know you don't need list exchange if you can give this kind of efficiency the second one was due to logistical constraints you should only consider two-way exchanges and the third one was to avoid the situation where patients and hospitals May compete for donors with certain characteristics we must assume that patients are indifferent between all compatible donors and honestly it is the third request which had huge efficiency implications actually which I'll talk later we accommodated all requests in our next paper which formed the base of the New England program for kidney exchange approved by the renal transplant oversight Committee of New England in September 2004 nebc became the first kidney exchange system that adopted analytical techniques from Market design and optimization so subsequently our team coded and run Napier software for several years and our partnership resulted in in a number of additional breakthroughs with collaboration with our netcap partners we show that larger exchanges and special TV exchanges are very important we show that you know you can break simultaneously for some change if they are stuck with you know non-directed donors and Dr Delmonico or actually include these changes advocated for it to the broader medical community we published rhythm however we made Limited progress in one important element and now in our original verb since preferences were assumed to be straight compatible pairs participated in kidney exchange so that you know they can get a better kidney but when we were asked to assume that you know patients are indifferent between all compatible kidneys a natural mechanism to include compatible pairs uh disappeared okay and essentially an implication of that is a large majority of blood type O patients with non-ordoners you know cannot be matched basically so because there is a huge officials lost embedded in the system that we started I'm an a patient I get an old kidney from my donor this comes with a huge efficiency loss and this happens a lot so what can be done to include this harder to match pairs in uh kidney exchange like that let's think about this well one possibility is the global kidney exchange you know my Christian old world champion what you could do is you can match them with patient owner pairs from countries where there is no possibility of leaving donor transplantation right so that's one thing that you can do now the number of global uh kidney transplants is 52 in seven in seven years 17 of them are those International patients uh 50 30 and they have 35 U.S patients to get kidneys but for reference the number of kidney exchange transplants in that period is more than six thousand okay so why is the number not bigger and the reason in at least in part is political economy a big challenge is the mixed reaction in the transplantation community and I'll share you know uh you know one of this and indeed Dr Delmonico who was key for our key you know initial collaboration and all these advances is a leading figure in the opposition against Global kidney Exchange uh like he has a paper called opposition to irresponsible Global kidney exchange there's a declaration of Istanbul you know all nations that these groups suggest that you know this is basically organ trafficking and uh so I will I cannot uh I can't neither say these you know points make sense nor I can completely ignore it all I can say is it's there right and you know this is the Doctor Who helped us to make this happen how did it turn completely against at least certain animals of the idea so the contrast between the early success of kidney exchange and the opposition on global kidney exchange High lasts the role of cautious approach in building Partnerships with experts in other disciplines and policy makers so that's my broader point okay so what can be done without upsetting doctors uh one idea that might work it is more subtle and when it's subtle unfortunately you know some of the gains they will not offend doctors but uh they will also not see the implications and somehow we need better mechanisms to convey these ideas so one idea that can work is the following for certain to include compatible cares in kidney exchange you can incentivize them to join the pool by giving the patients some form of a priority increase in the disease donor list in the event of another venal failure in the future and why is this valuable well because a living donor kidney functions on average to after 12 to 20 years there is something wrong with the battle nobody stopped the kidney the kidney failed because of an issue with the body it will happen again right and people are unlikely to decline this uh you know Insurance just to get the kidney from their brother or spouse right now in the last several years about 1100 patients in the U.S receive transplants through kidney Exchange according to our estimates for each 10 percent of incentivized Spears the number of transplants can be increased by about 180 so if we can incentivize 60 of compatible pairs we can double the number of kidney exchange transplants ethics of this policy is favorably discussed by several members of Canadian transplantation community and this can be considered as part of the ongoing reform on Bruno's disease donor allocation system for kidney so-called continuous distribution system but one challenge is we need broader consensus to influence the national policy and that is a challenge it's not easy to influence this is donor policy at the national level so maybe this conference will help hopefully Jennifer you know I'm looking at you but Force other organs it may be possible to incentivize blood type compatible pairs to join donor exchange through more local policies for example think about liver exchange you cannot donate your entire liver you donate a low profit right and there are size compatibility requirements now leaving donors for liver typically donate either the larger right lobe which is 60 to 70 percent of the liver mass or the small smaller level 30 to 40 percent of the liver mask or part of the lab law called segment 203 for small children now morbidity and mortality risk for dominance like four or five times higher under the right lobe transplantation donors don't wanna take the more risky option it's significantly more risky on the other hand to survive the operation the patient needs a graph of at least 40 percent of the volume of his or her dysfunctional liver which means left no typically will not work right well now we can utilize this actually so in particular what we can do is like I'm an a patient I have a an old donor who needs to donate they need the risky right law well we'll be happy if my donor donates the less much less risky left lob so that this race will also be avoided and as a bonus we'll be saving another life right so so incentives comes more naturally and economists need to make these ideas clear so they don't appear naturally for practitioners well we follow this and these ideas result in a partnership be between the liver transplant group under the leadership of Dr Cesar ilmazet in a university in Malaysia turkey and our team of design economists this Center is actually the second largest liver transplant group worldwide with 250 300 living donor liver transplants annually and in for reference in 2022 the U.S total was an all-time high of 600. so this is a big Center the agreement was reached in 2019 but because of covet it started uh you know like seven eight months ago in less than a year 15 patients received liver transplant through the program in four two-way one three-way and one four-way liver exchanges and to the best of our knowledge to for the liver exchange is a world first so so basically now in the last five minutes I will generalize the lessons that I get in the context of kidney exchange and also in the context of school choice in you know approaching policy makers and people in the other field in other areas okay now uh so so basically you know these are ideas led to a mechanism a market design Paradigm I now refer to as minimalist Market design and it will be clear why I'm calling it minimal it's more more like you know minimally invasive Market design actually okay so uh in kidney extension school choice you know it was a learning process it's I didn't follow an approach systematically I thought what makes just sense you know you know I'm outside there how do I you know I'm also you know you know push social skills uh so I mean I gotta give them something like how do I come with bad news you know show that what they are doing is messed up it becomes the national news sometimes and uh they come to the conclusion that well this guy is right let's abandon the system and at that party is saying right it's not a very uh I mean this plan needs to be uh taught carefully right so but after we did good in kidney expansion school choice uh I started at implementing this idea consciously and systematically in several other settings and to my and many others surprise succeeded actually in changing you know serious institutions so let me summarize you know what the main ideas is and how this Paradigm works I call this minimalist Market design this constant economic political or social institution that is deployed to fulfill a number of objectives typically it has a many components each serving its own purposes and interacting with each other in various ways think about U.S government's policy of you know like statement about you know these different animals uh you know working together knitting together so and so forth now suppose that the institution fails in some of its objectives maybe some of the components are broken or maybe there's an issue with the interface between various components how can a design Economist be helpful in addressing these failures how would experts and other areas show these kinds of problems how would the surgeon address an analogous failure on our human body what about the mechanical broken car these experts would first identify the root cause of the failure whether it has to do with the component itself or an interface between various components and directly address the failure at its source a surgeon would remove disease tissue or organs repair body systems or replace disease organs with transplants a mechanic would repair or replace the one part of the broken car so minimalist Market design is a paradigm under which a design Economist operates exactly in the same way so what do you do you first identify the primary objectives of the system system operators in designing the institution so these objectives potentially include key objectives that remain outside the scope of mainstream economies that might not correspond to a maximization problem the history of the institution might be very instructive to figure out what is the mission of this institution you next find whether the current institution satisfies these primary objective Zona if it doesn't then there is uh potential if it doesn't then there's potential for policy impact with the compelling alternative design to materialize this potential into successful redesign to root cause of the failures should be identified and then the failures of the current issues are addressed by just interfering with its flow components and interfaces as if the surgeon performs a minimally invasive procedure you don't mess with parts which are not broken so the this uh Paradigm has been working uh well you know U.S army decided to change its uh you know branching mechanism through it we were able to communicate these ideas to Medical ethicists uh and Healthcare professional and informed and help with vaccine rollout in 15 plus states with allocation of therapies and directly coded antibody allocation rule during covet and also this approach tries to mimic what policy makers were trying to get in the first place but couldn't because they don't have the benefit of formalism and there is external validity for this approach from school choice from affirmative action in India exactly the steps that we mentioned will happen was rediscovered in the field after the paper was those papers were written well so probably I should stop here and uh thank you very much
