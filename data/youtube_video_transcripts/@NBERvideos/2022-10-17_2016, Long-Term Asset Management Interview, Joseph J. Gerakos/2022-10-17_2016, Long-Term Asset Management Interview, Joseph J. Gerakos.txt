if we look at the financial services industry one large sector is what is referred to as the asset management sector and we talk about the asset management sector these are this it consists of firms that specialize in managing portfolios so we're talking about firms along the lines of BlackRock Vanguard Fidelity a natural question that arises is how well do they perform the sector really consists of two parts the first part is the retail part and the retail part it's basically what we're talking about mutual funds that you and I can purchase through our Fidelity account or through our e-trade account these are mutual funds that are easily purchased by the individual investor the academic Dynamic search up till now the consensus is that basically we don't find evidence much evidence on average of skill for portfolio managers on the retail side and this implies that an individual investor who goes out and buys low-cost index funds puts them in his or her portfolio that investor is going to do as well or better than if that investor had instead bought let's say mutual funds active mutual funds now that's just one part of the sector the second part of the sector is the institutional sector and when I talk about institutional sector I'm talking about products or portfolio management services offered by firms along the lines of BlackRock two institutional investors and when I see institutional investors I'm talking about Pension funds endowments such as University endowments and things like Sovereign wealth funds the institutional side of asset management is twice the size in terms of dollars than the retail side and this is important because the institutional side even though we're talking about institutions per se these Pension funds endowment Sovereign wealth funds they're holding retirement funds for a large percentage of the population similar to the retail side asset managers on the institutional side on average you don't find much evidence of skill however over the 2000 to 2012 period if we take into account the costs that institutional investors would have incurred to manage those assets in-house instead of delegating them to the asset managers it's about equal so it's about indifferent you think about institutions we're basically indifferent between managing in-house versus delegating the assets and this arises because it's costly to manage assets in-house you have to hire your own portfolio managers you have to have a compliance Department you have to carry out your own research and so on but what's interesting about this sector the asset management sector specifically the institutional side the thing that's interesting right now is there's a rise of something called an ETF which isn't which is which is an acronym for an exchange traded fund These funds you could think of are similar to index funds and they provide access to benchmarks such as let's say the Russell 3000 large cap value small cap value they put access to these benchmarks or these factors at a very low price from 2000 to 2012 there wasn't much liquidity available in these ETFs but currently what we're seeing is the liquidity for these ETFs is increasing and what that's implying is that the comparative advantage that asset managers had from 2000 to 2012 appears to be deteriorating
