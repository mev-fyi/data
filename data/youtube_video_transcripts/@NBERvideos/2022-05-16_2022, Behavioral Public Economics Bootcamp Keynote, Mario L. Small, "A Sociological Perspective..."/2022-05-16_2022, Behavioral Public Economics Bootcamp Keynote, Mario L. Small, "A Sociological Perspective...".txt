okay thank you uh thank you so much and thanks for that lovely uh introduction um i just noticed i'm on camera on the computer so i'm gonna go ahead and stand over here um so it's a it's a real pleasure to be here i uh for a number of reasons um i really enjoy speaking to economists um and psychologists uh i do somebody laughed no i do some of my best friends are economists uh speaking of this great um so no but part of the reason i do is precisely the translation work i think uh hunt was right uh in a hint that part of the difficulty in the reach of ideas and sociology to other disciplines is language uh as in the language that can't be understood outside of it but i think the problems with language are not just problems of translation the problems sometimes of conception i think in sociology um sometimes the language is more uh complicated than it needs to be not because the ideas are more complicated but because they're not fully fleshed out and part of what i enjoy about speaking to economists and particularly economists of the kind who like reading and speaking to non-economists um is uh that you're forced to identify a common language that i think is really good for social science in general so um oh i have i have this i don't have this um okay so i'm going to talk about social perspectives and discrimination this is based on a paper with the great diva pager uh a close friend of mine who sadly passed away a couple of years ago uh but was a fantastic sociologist of discrimination um i was more of a sociologist of institutions and i thought it's just a great opportunity to work together so here's what we're going to talk about so this was based on a paper that we wrote with the idea of speaking to economists and so i'm going to tell you things uh to start that you actually understand better than i do so in economics as you may have heard there's two kind of traditional and onenote models of discrimination and what i'm going to say is that so economics would benefit from expanding beyond those two and in fact even a third model that mariam bertrand and others have been proposing over the last couple of years um and uh in doing so i think it'll be useful to keep in mind that sociology is an expansive field in a couple of ways it's expansive uh not just in the topics it studies which many social sciences are but it's also expensive in its methods so you can you know find clever instruments and run regressions uh in college of a sociologist you can go into a community or neighborhood and spend two years there just observing people and colors of a sociologist you can interview a whole bunch of people about their lives and write about it and call yourself a sociologist you can bury yourself in the archives and study historical documents for two years write it up until colleagues of a sociologist and i think that's a great strength of the discipline it is also a weakness in that it makes difficult uh conversation across multiple subfields but it turns out that for the context of discrimination it's actually a strength because it allows an expansiveness that i think and i hope i show you will be useful for our conference so i'm going to give you are three reasons economists should consider not only taste and historical discrimination but also institutional discrimination so the taste model which you all know popularized by becker is a model of discrimination in which people are said to discriminate when they're willing to pay a price to not associate with a particular group right that's why you know i'm willing to pay more so i don't have to hire african-americans if i'm white or whatever the case may be the statistical model which emerged a little bit thereafter by arrow phelps and a couple others is a model of discrimination in which people don't necessarily have a taste for it's not that they prefer not to associate with a particular group um they're just assisting an individual on the basis of the characteristics that they believe the group as a whole has and you all have debated kind of how valid those inferences are and like where how much experience should matter like a good bayesian and how people are deciding what the average characteristic i'll just leave that out to you to figure out but the idea is that these are two different models and some people have tried to see how different they are whether they make different predictions and so on but they have in common the idea that discrimination is a conscious decision i'm deliberately deciding to you know give somebody a job or not somebody else a job and that it's an actor a human being who's making that decision and those seem obvious but especially for behavioral economists but it turns out they're not that obvious so first the reason that first one the conscious decision might not be obvious is uh an idea from psychology and sociology the notion that you've probably all heard about the notion of implicit bias and the idea is that a person might be acting on the basis of an unconscious bias against the group meaning they don't consciously want to not associate with the group and they're not even saying oh no no i don't want to hire this person because i know this group is why they just implicitly and psychologists have developed tests to determine that you might or may not have an implicit bias meaning a bias you're not aware of they might just not want to hire you even though they don't realize it's because they don't want to associate it and marianne bertrand and others have done some nice work trying to encourage more economists to think this way there's a third alternative to the model but i'm going to talk about instead it's a very different kind of model discrimination which is i guess a fourth which i'm going to define as differential sorry institutional discrimination which i'm going to define as differential treatment by race that is either perpetrated by organizations or codified into law you'll notice there's some use of the passive tense there and that is on purpose and that is not an example of sociology in terms that obfuscate things that aren't clear and i hope i'll convince you that by the way you will notice that i'm using the term institutional discrimination uh the words structural racism structural discrimination systemic racism all of that stuff i don't use in this paper it turns out i don't like those terms at all even though after black lives matter they've become really popular in part because i don't really know what they mean um uh yes for example i have yet to hear somebody in the media say here's structural racism as opposed to the non-structural racism we see in this other case i'm kind of still trying to understand what that means i know it involves systems and as you can see also the waving of the hand but i don't know what that is uh but i do know what institutional discrimination is and i'm hoping to convince you uh uh by the end of this brief talk but the key the reason it matters is that it does not require an actor today to either not want to associate with somebody else or to aggregate on the basis of food trades or to even have an unconscious bias in other words it's institutional in part because it can be perpetrated by an organization regardless of who's in there or or codified into law so uh just to give you an example of what i mean this is like this is going to be uh my my mediocre i'm going to say no fairness attempt uh graphically representing what we're talking about so in a taste model an actor doesn't want to associate in a statistical amount model an actor is just making a guess on the basis of characteristics and therefore they don't the right actor doesn't like the yellow actor and after i created this i'm realizing that reds and yellows are also in some context used derogatorily so but in this context i might use reds to refer to the red balls not people and yellows refer to the yellow balls not people so the reds uh either have a taste or a homeric and the unconscious bias is that there's something else affecting the red actor that ends up resulting in them discriminating okay what i'm going to argue is that if you think about balls as people and boxes as organizations that among the things that could happen is that the organization matters more than individual for the active discrimination so the first of three points i'll make is that organizations can discriminate irrespective of the intentions of their members this is key so what i mean by an organization is a set of people and institutional practices formerly organized around a global purpose so an organization is both the people and the practices both why am i calling practices institutions so um you know harvard university um as an organization is its faculty it's students and staff and its practices are graduation course enrollment et cetera okay why are practices institutional i'm gonna and i'm sorry i mean some definition of terms is necessary and you haven't deserved and but we're gonna get through this pretty quickly uh practices are institutional in two different ways um one is normative so um the term norms is often common in economics these are formal or informal expectations of behavior that people in an organization feel compelled to follow so informal one is your university's requirement that nerve brick attendant you have to get outside letters right an informal one that's not qualified anywhere but it's still an expectation is the idea that as a faculty should be polite students turns out as we were just discussing that informal expectation varies from institution to institution for example at the university of chicago is probably a little bit less of a an institutional practice and it is especially in some of the departments under the division of the social sciences god bless it okay but um institute practice can also be institutional in a different kind of way which is cognitive not normal in other words not in terms of uh being mandates or expectations of behavior but just the kind of understanding of some aspect of the organization i give the example here you know in a particular university psychology may be perceived as a high or low status major regardless of uh any mandates right that's just a separate kind of thing it turns out both kinds of institutions wouldn't matter or in economics you know econometrics is i think hypersleep maybe and uh other other selfies that i will not mention perhaps not more so and so that is simply an understanding it's not a mandate that you actually for example do uh econometrics okay so organizations can discriminate what i'm arguing is by instituting practices that treat people of different races or groups but i'm using races in this example differently regardless of whether their practices were driven by prejudice and regardless of whether the managers directors or employees following the norms are themselves personally pretty best and one example of this is uh referral based hiring so familiar this is an organization a box a firm with only red dots only red people and red dotted people people in the red category um and uh but in a world in which the labor pool includes both large and levels and we know from sociology and network analysis that there's very very strong network homophily i think you might call it a sort of meeting uh or friendship assorted meeting it's a sort of friendship meeting probably um yeah yeah people tend to associate it's a regularity that's been found multiple times people tend to associate people at the same race so reds are more likely to difference with reds and yellows are more like brands with yellows in a context where like many organizations do the firm says we're gonna get people an incentive for recommending somebody who successfully gets hired and this happens in a whole bunch of different ways some firms live some companies literally give you like 50 bucks if like for this is for low-level jobs if you recommend somebody they take the test and they get in um it also happens in a different way the way some departments hire for example but in a context where the networks themselves uh of course initial homophilus what's going to be the case is that that company for every new hire is going to be much more likely to hire again another person this is a very simple model doesn't require anybody to be racist it doesn't require anybody to personally prefer to hire people at their own race nobody has to make any statistical guess about any personal attributes nobody has to be having anybody's bias people just have to follow the incentives created by the company now but what key what's key about is that many practices are actually race neutral in theory like that one would operate in a context where there's an existing difference that's racial that ends up resulting in discriminatory treatment so and this is why i'm using the first discriminatory treatment so from the perspective of the person trying to get a job you essentially were discriminated against even though from the perspective of the company nobody was being racist and so that's one example a person actually doesn't matter and an important part of this is that institutional conditions are matter because they have strong stay in power so the reason we think not just in terms of actors for organizations is that organizations can experience 100 turnover with their institutions being completely fixed you know with the the idea that in order to get tenure your department had to request outside letters existed long before any of those any of us here was born and will continue long after we're all gone it's just a very powerful institutional norm and there are many norms in many companies like referral based hiring seniority based layoffs blanket background checks and so on that are going to have the same kind of institutional power so the institution is actually what matters not really the people second example historically yes the historical historic discrimination can have contemporary consequences again because of organizations in other words part of the reason that focusing only on the decisions of an actor in the present to understand discrimination is that actions in the past because of the staying power of organization could have contemporary consequences so i'm going to just give you an example to sort of make this a little more tangible decisions of president doctors may not matter first previous decisions that as long as they were institutionalized into the practices of the organization as long as they became institutional as opposed to just the habit of the people who are the managers may play a role and then those practices even if they change might have long-term consequences so for both reasons this matters a really nice example is housing in the united states so just to give you a brief summary i'm sure many of you are familiar with this homeowner's loan corporation started in 1933 as a way of basically encouraging the billing of homes to give a whole bunch of people jobs and after that the federal housing authority was instituted in part to expand the number of americans who owned their own homes there were several aspects of these organizations practices that we now take for granted that were only institutionalized by them then so first mortgages that were self-amortizing and that had fixed terms and that lasted as many as 20 30 years for in the 20s you often had to buy you would often have a mortgage and you would pay it over years and then your term is up and you still have to pay money because of accumulated interest so the practice of self-amortizing loans where you're signing you know exactly when the loan was over was actually institutionalized in the 1930s uh second and this was a big in fact bonanza by the federal housing authority was the insurance of loans so the federal housing authority in the united states began insuring loans up to 90 percent of the value of the mortgage meaning um if i'm a banker uh rather than me taking the risk and requiring that's what's often the case for you to pay fifty percent of the down payment i'm only going to pay you 50 of the of the value of the home as a loan the federal housing authority said i will guarantee for you the banker up to ninety percent of the value of the loan it's awesome right it's like free money as long as you follow our requirements for the evaluation of the property and secondly the neighborhood adding the neighborhood which now seems completely obvious and the evaluation of the house was instituted at the time so right so there's an asset the house and the fha said we're going to totally guarantee 90 of the value of that loan as long as also the house is in a neighborhood that we have determined uh is a loanword and that was huge creating the neighborhood as part of the valuation of the asset which is not obvious is huge and they put this it was literally institutionally codified in the underwriting manual now how did this matter the underwriting manual it turns out in addition to institutionalizing these practices have very strong explicit racial bias this is literally quotations from the manual we don't have to like imagine whether people had some sentiments if they were completely open about it number one uh if an error had if sorry before that the manual of course is familiar is responsible redlining so the hrlc created the redlining maps and i'm going to talk about in a minute but you all know what it is well you don't know what it is because especially if you're not from the united states as i was not as i am not um i couldn't even believe that this happened so the united states um the fhas the actually the holc before sent assessors out to neighborhoods to evaluate neighborhoods and great neighborhoods from a to d a neighbors were wonderful and were loanworthy be neighbored somewhat see not so much do you forget it and um the reason the practice was called redlining is because um the grades were reproduced in maps where a neighbors were painted uh green uh b neighborhoods yellow uh i don't forget what seniors were and the neighborhoods right i'll show you an exam in a second but so if you're trying to get a house in a deep neighborhood we're gonna get the loan by the fbi and so if i'm a banker and somebody comes to me and says oh i want a loan i said where's the house and i learned that it's in a d neighborhood and i said well they won't guarantee it's why am i going to take the risk [Music] so number one number two said explicitly going back to the language if a neighborhood is to retain stability it is necessary that the property says continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes so nano said we're not going to give you the loan if you integrate neighborhoods okay you got to keep them racially segregated number two it demanded for protection from adverse influences so the property that we insure it cannot have in the neighborhood adverse influences and what is that no code implication of inharmonious racial or nationality groups right so again no integration and particularly the undesirable population and what's funny is that that is a little bit [Music] circumspect because it doesn't name any racial groups but i'm going to show you in a minute that it was not circumspect at all and finally uh there you go uh it literally expressly required the evaluation of the neighborhoods to report the proportion negro in the neighborhood and this was expressly an indicator to downgrade a neighborhood from an av to cbrd just to give you an example of what this looked like so this is a redlining map of durham north carolina yeah there we go the bees were in blue a's are in green b's and blue c's and yellows and these in red and so if your property was in a dread you weren't going to get it right here's another red lightning map for those of you who are not familiar with la so there were tons of these maps you can still find them online you can see some of those citations right there and here's here's what it looked like so the federal government sent an assessor out remember i just said the evaluation of the neighborhood was now part of the process so the assessor imagine somebody with a clipboard um this is a little where they just went to the neighborhoods and they observed so this is a neighborhood in philadelphia they got a security grade of d so the red line he wasn't going to get a loan and the assessor couldn't just make it up they have to report exactly on what basis uh the greater god was the greater god and so i'm on the favorable influences in other words good for the great close to businesses good transportation subway etcetera trolley the negative ones the detrimental inferences negro concentration very explicit and in fact just in case there was any ambiguity if you look under the inhabitants uh type foreign born expressly literally how many negro yeah so first negro yes or no and then second literally what percent it was 80 and so that was a core part of the reason the neighborhood got a d is there infiltration remember the subtle language before of what very expressly growth right and so this happens and there's tons of these this we don't have to make this up so this happened very very clearly and very expressly now the id and here's the rest of the form you can have fun sort of examining this is why sociology gets to be fun because you can go into the archives and counselors tenure if you spent a lot of time just studying all clipboards in the 1930s here's the key so the fha program worked millions upon millions upon millions bought homes because banks said this is essentially no risk you put 10 down the fha guarantees 90 there's no risk it's just money and moreover americans get to buy homes which everybody wants the key is this the key is african-americans if you think about it they're essentially excluded why they're more likely to as we saw to live in the red line neighborhoods well i'm not going to get you a loan there they might say ah well i made a big money i went to nbr uh summer institute and i learned a lot about economics got a great job got a good tenure i'm going to move out of here into the white neighborhoods infiltration and the conflict of racial and harmonious groups so essentially it was a huge affirmative action program targeted primarily at watts funded by taxpayer dollars and so it's very very this is now i'm not saying anything controversial this is on the record now what's interesting about this would do we know that it's actually a causal impact i mean it wasn't as if at the time the bankers had no racial animosity it wasn't as if the bankers were sitting there saying oh my god i can't wait to give money to african-americans just because it's a wonderful thing and the federal government came in and screwed it up there was a lot of racial animosity among bankers among sellers among brokers among a whole bunch of people so the question though is if institutional discrimination historically is a thing meaning if institutionalized actions and again i hope we're clear what we mean by institutionalized entered into the rule books that affected incentives at the time had an impact on uh had a discriminatory impact over time but what you'd see is that redlining itself should have negatively affected african americans and that is in fact uh there's a couple of papers actually some economists there's a new version of this paper now i think it's published at this point i haven't i haven't had a chance to study the new one but it's substantially the same what they did is they looked at changes over time among neighborhoods on the opposite side of the red line boundaries they considered those boundaries that in their estimation were the least likely to be drawn endogenously so as a result of exogenous things they compared cities that were just above and just below the threshold for redlining so cities below 40 000 were not part of the mapping that i just described um and anyways the short answer is they found as many different instruments as they could and um you can read the paper yourself you would be able to evaluate even better than i could uh far better it's an economist uh it's an economist's paper but they found strong effects on segregation and also lower home ownerships rates and worse values as a result of airline okay so here again there are banks but if you think about it the banks don't have to have any animosity taste doesn't matter no that actually matters because there is an institutional rule affecting the planet's behavior okay third historical discrimination also and this is the last point and we'll sort of wrap it up besides explanation also has contemporary consequences via laws and so here what i'm arguing is that um laws that were originally designed with explicit discriminatory intent where there was no ambiguity by a bunch of people who were like gary becker's taste based group uh end up in the books and those individuals died but because they're institutionalized in the books they can have long-term consequences on uh that are discriminatory in nature so that again you skip ahead many years and the actions of contemporary actors don't actually matter because a lot of it is already institutionalized being codified in the bubbles here i'm gonna tell something it's not exactly economics but it's close enough and lots of economies study politics these days so i think it counts uh which is federal and disenfranchisement disenfranchisement laws um so as you know in many states scandinavians can't vote for homophones can vote and again they're it's not saying african-american fellows can't vote and white ones can't just tell them you can't vote but here's what's interesting for some background so in 1970 the 15th amendment gave african-americans officially the right to vote shortly thereafter a lot of states began state constitutional conventions up and throughout the south with primary purpose so these are conventions learning convention room where state legislators meet to reshape the constitution of the state and the primary objective for many of these was explicitly to restrict the black vote okay and how did they do so well especially given the 15th amendment well it turns out that the fourth amendment had made it okay to disenfranchise and remove the right of vote for people who commit certain serious crimes and so a lot of the conventioneers then said well let's figure out how to classify crime so that we restrict the black vote um we're in a constitutionally sound way and again if you were like me when you first heard this you're like well that's kind of far fast i mean i'm sure there were all the factors that play well let's look at um their language she said there was no one because it's kind of amazing when you go into the stores must have so much fun studying this so here's the president of the 1901 alabama constitutional convention describing in an address just like this one the objectives of the conv of the convention he's saying i think his name was john williams i'm saying in 1861 as now the negro was the prominent factor in the issue and what is it that we want to do well within the limits imposed by the cons by the federal constitution we want to establish white supremacy in this state the justification for whatever manipulation of the ballot that has occurred in this state has been the menace of bigger domination i mean this is this is why we're doing this guys here's a an 1894 editorial major south carolina newspaper encouraging readers to vote for a state constitutional convention state up the opportunities offered the white people of the state the white people in the state in the coming election to obviate all future danger and fortify the anglo-saxon civilization uh i don't know what it says about irish italian etc and that is jewish and that is the calling of a constitutional convention to deal with the all-important question of suffrage and here's a really nice this is congressional federal congressional testimony from a politician in 1903 he's saying when i was a rather young man mississippi was trying to get up some sort of constitution that would get rid of the ignorant negro vote by the way here i think ignorant is modifying negro not vote as in the vote of the negroes ignorant not we just want to remove the ignorant negroes votes and keep the non-ignorant negroes voting get rid of the ignorant negro vote of course they have to get up something entirely fair or not has meanings in the constitution so anyway people are very explicit about there was no ambiguity there was no worries about this and so the key is they did it so they do it a bunch of things that was relevant poll taxes literacy requirements etc but the key is they had data on the kinds of crimes african-americans perpetrated on american perpetrated and then just literally just reclassified uh crimes committed by african-americans as felonies and said if you have a felony you can't vote right is it like remember like the crack cocaine versus powdered cocaine distinction or similar kind of this this goes ways back and so it was very very explicit reclassification you can look at it before and after and moreover they included things like moral turpitude uh that gave opposition there's a lot of judgment a lot of legal and said yep at the fellaini okay turns out many of these are still legal in many states today because again they were in the books right these individuals all died it didn't actually matter but because the laws were all fair constitutionally and they remain in the books and they have consequences there's a really nice paper by chris eugene and others that looked at um the likely it's this kind of match comparison likely voting rates by uh lightly likely voting rights and voting patterns by felons in florida in 2000 and they should suggest pretty convincingly that if the florida fellow misinterestment laws had not been in place more likely would have won based on the rates at which that demographic would vote and votes democrat and votes in presidential elections uh which would of course have meant that gore would have been president instead of george w bush and we wouldn't have had global warming no no no uh i don't know i was kidding i was just just joking uh probably would have had overwhelming regardless so here the idea is different right white supremacists very self-described white supremacist clear intent gary becker type imposed voting laws they die off it actually doesn't matter because the laws are there and eventually you have this communication so what a market what am i doing is i think the models of taste and statistical discrimination are wonderful models because of their clarity and their ability to lend themselves to empirical testing i think the unconscious bias model is a great thing to import from psychology just as in the context of behavioral economics the field is importing a lot of things from psychology what i'd like to encourage is that we open ourselves up to the idea of institutional discrimination as a topic that may not have been within the balance of classical economic thinking about something like discrimination but which and i think it's pretty easy to see quite easily lends itself so empirical testing uh at least by the way a lot of applied economics works but broadens how we think about these models and secondly i know this is a behavioral economics and policy world but i'm going to sort of invite you to think about discrimination at the kind of power levels rather than well yeah i haven't followed enough of the field but let's just say that a lot of the nudge units and other behavioral economic types policy oriented units have been really most focused on the consumer side i guess nobody just call it that the consumer side which is great but part of the thing that institutional discrimination points is to us a little bit more on the other side can you not politicians think differently can you nudge legislators who think differently can you nudge the people who decide where to put up a payday lending establishment all right that's it i'm hoping that's useful to you and i thank you very much for the opportunity
