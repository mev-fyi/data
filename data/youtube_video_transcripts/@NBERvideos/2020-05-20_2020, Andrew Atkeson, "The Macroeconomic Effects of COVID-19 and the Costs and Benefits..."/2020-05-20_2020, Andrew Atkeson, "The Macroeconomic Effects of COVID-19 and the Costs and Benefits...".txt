what I thought would be useful to do because there's so much new information coming at us every day and we interpret it you know with alarm sometimes positive and the stock market goes up and sometimes negative like today I guess and the stock market's going down it's kind of hard to figure out what to do with this fire hose of information so what I thought I might try to do is just give a framework to kind of put the information as it comes in in context a lot of what's going to go on with the macroeconomy will obviously depend on what happens with the progression of this disease some of what will determine what happens with the progression of this disease is public policy and so all along you know we're gonna have governors and the president and mayor's weighing the costs and benefits of social distancing and making decisions about how to proceed and those decisions are gonna have a big impact on what happens to the macro economy and then of course we all have questions about second waves and is this going to come in the future so what I'd like to try to discuss is first just a snapshot you know we hear announcements that we're bending the curve what have we achieved with the sort of distancing that we're undergoing now and perhaps more importantly the second question is what are the public health experts hoping that we might achieve when they're giving recommendations about social distancing what's the target what's the quantitative target they're aiming for so that's the second question I want to discuss and then we have a counterfactual though I guess in Georgia it might not be a counterfactual what's going to happen if in the near term we abandon social distancing in terms of the progression of the disease we also have to prepare ourselves to think about the counterfactual if we do that are people going to react would we actually get much of an economic benefit if we did abandon social distancing now because would people actually choose to go back to work and spending there's some historical data on that that I think is relevant a lot of the discussion of the costs and benefits has to do with the question of what's the fatality rate of this disease and perhaps could we have target you know more targeted interventions to protect the vulnerable and perhaps the biggest mystery is what are the long-term scenarios for this disease this fall next year the year after that etc and so you know at the end I guess every day we each have to try to put this together to weigh the costs and benefits of social distancing and make projections about what's going to happen so I'll conclude with a little bit of discussion of that so let me just start with laying the groundwork Jim mentioned actually you know was rather alarmed when Angela Merkel came out about March 10th and said two-thirds of Germans were going to get this disease and that's you know what caused me to say boy we really have to figure out what's going on and you know in the United States we hit a thousand deaths on March 26 and we've had five doublings of that to 32 thousand deaths by April 15th and so at one level if you think about trying to make forecasts about what's going to go on I kind of joke that this is like valuing a very fast-growing company like Tesla or say you know Apple when they first issued iPhones it's like seems like the sky's the limit for what might guide might might happen until we can figure out what's going to cut off this exponential growth now we have good news not just in the United States this is a graph that is showing on a logarithmic scale the same as what I had on the previous graph of what's happening to cumulative deaths around the world measured in days and the country hit the 25th death and you could see for all the countries highlighted in this graph that there's been a bending of this curve so countries that were growing initially with doubling times of every two or three days are now seem to be bending down to be say once a week or even slower than that and so this is this is quite good news and you know most of these countries have implemented social distancing some of them perhaps less so than others and this is meant that what we see when we look at the growth rate of deaths on a daily basis that we're coming down from say like a daily growth rate of 30% to something that's considerably slower and we hope that we could say we could causally attribute this to the social distancing there is always the possibility that this is just something going on in nature that's slowing down the progression of the disease globally and maybe it would come back but we hope that this is the causal result of our social distancing so you'll hear forecasts of what's going to happen the in the state of Washington the group the IMA chi modeling group that gets a lot of attention from the White House is forecasting 60,000 deaths by August first and so clearly that's a dramatic slowing in the growth rate of cumulative deaths that are forecast and you might ask you know where's that forecast coming from is it some complex structural model epidote is ease model that they're using I think Bob Hall who is of course very prominent here at the MBR has shown that know you can actually reproduce their forecasts pretty simply so what Bob Hall does is he looks at the data for the growth rate of Cuba on a daily basis and so that's the red line that's bouncing up and down as the data comes in and that growth rate is clearly declining as what we've seen and so he just fits a line through that growth rate that's the blue line you see at the graph and then it can't the growth rate can't go below zero so he makes it look like this hockey sticks when it hits zero it goes flat and so that implies you know a very dramatic slowing in the progression of the disease and the Washington state and the model coming out of the IMA Chi group that shown in the curve in red that this is their April 17th forecast with the pink shaded error being the uncertainty bounce around it so you could see that you know a rough rule of thumb is there essentially forecasting a continuation of the slowdown in the growth rate of deaths that we've been seeing so far now so what's the goal like how long are we supposed to do this social distancing and what are we trying to achieve and so on April 17th when they did their new forecast this ima Chi group came out and stated a quantitative goal which i think is quite a quite interesting to think about they're looking to get the prevalence of the disease down to one active case per million of population so that would mean for the United States as a whole you know 330 cases and we're starting from we might have 500,000 active cases now and of course a lot of unmeasured cases so this is a rather bold goal to have the objective is if we can get it down to that level we could follow policies similar to what's done in South Korea or Taiwan and do contact tracing and simply isolation of the sick and maybe those who've seen the sick you know encountered the sick and with these forecasts that I've just showed you they're actually predicting that we would get there within you know some cases parts of the country in early May some parts of the country maybe not until June so we're looking at say four to six weeks to attain that goal coming off of that what I would call empirical forecasts based on the decline in the growth rate that we've seen now I wanted to be clear about this because you know everyday you can now obsessively watch the death numbers and think about or the active case numbers and think about are we making progress substantial progress towards this rather ambitious goal of turning this epidemic into a kind of more conventional public health problem of dealing with disease ice outbreaks and you know in detail and letting everybody else go back to work now we can ask the counterfactual what would happen if we abandon social distancing now obviously well short of that public health goal of getting case active cases down to one per million the models that people are using are typically based on structural models of the disease let's start with the concept that people can be fit into one of three categories that they could be susceptible to the disease make that BS they could be actively infected and contagious at this time that would be in category I or they could be resistant for this disease which is new you're going to get resistant because you got it and recovered or you died or alternatively if vaccine is invented we could convert susceptible people into resistant people directly with the vaccine and a key assumption in these models that I'm going to come back to is the assumption that once you're in the category of being resistant you're presumed immune to a second infection and perhaps for a long period of time okay so just to think about reading data on the where we are in terms of how the population is distributed across these categories the S at the start should have been virtually everyone in the world and the number of people infected at the start would have been about 15 to 30 people who would have picked up this disease in that C in that market in wuhan to start worldwide and then this was data from yesterday at World ohmmeter which of course lots of people look at for the data the confirmed cases worldwide was about 1.6 million so that's the people were thinking of as being in the infected category and the resistant would be correspond to their closed cases eight hundred and five thousand if you look at those you know 79% of them survived and 21 percent of the closed and you know confirmed cases are ending in death but that whole category of eight hundred and five thousand is the resistant category so the basic structure of the model it's a bit like a model of unemployment people flow into being in fact and people flow out of being infected the difference between this and a model of unemployment is that this is contagious we typically don't think of unemployment as being contagious so people start off in the susceptible state s and they flow they become new infections when they encounter infected agents and that be certain parameters that are key to think about in the model we'll have a beta t which is a reduced form parameter that combines both the rate at which we interact with each other in society and hence bump into each other there's the disease parameter itself is how easy is it for me to transmit the virus to you when I bump into you and then there would be questions like are people using prophylactics are they wearing masks or not shaking hands or washing hands more carefully those are all things that would come into that transmission rate beta and that's why I put a sub T on it because that can change over time not only for natural reasons but because of mitigation and prophylactic steps that people might be taking the model also has a simple assumption that you know infected people are walking around in the course of their daily lives and bumping into people at random uniformly and that'll mean that they'll only have the opportunity to transmit the disease to the fraction of people who are susceptible some of the people that they bump into might already be infected so that is irrelevant or be resistant so again that wouldn't transmit the disease then the other flow in the model is from being actively infected to being recovering and as I mentioned you you flow in this case before we have a vaccine either because you survived the disease or you die from the disease and we think of that flow rate what we call the recovery rate from I'd R which I denote by gamma on this slide as a biological parameter it has to do with you know how long is the virus contagious in you when you're sick how long does it take you to recover from it so that's something that for now since we don't have effective antivirals is something we can't really alter for this disease all of the social distancing measures are prophylactic measures we might think about would be loaded into the parameter beta T so a key concept in this model is basically a comparison of the effective transmission rate which is beta T times the share of susceptibles s T over N to this print this recovery rate gamma if the effective transmission rate or the rate at which we're acquiring new effect infections exceeds the recovery rate the infection grows if it's smaller than the recovery rate the infection shrinks and that's really what's going to govern the transmission and the course of the epidemic so people talk about this in the newspaper and in the literature all the time in terms of two numbers we have an a basic reproduction number and an effective reproduction number the basic reproduction number is a comparison of this transmission rate to the recovery rate at the start of the epidemic if you don't take any steps to mitigate its transmission and if everyone that an infected person bumps into is susceptible to the disease so you can think about this being essentially a comparison of the transmission rate to the recovery rate initially in Wuhan and China or say in January in February in the United States when we had the disease introduced by people coming in from other countries and they unaware of what was going on we're bumping into others and transmitting the disease so we think of this as being a characteristic of the disease mainly and we have that an epidemic grows at the start if it's basic reproduction number exceeds 1 if the transmission rate in an unmitigated state exceeds the recovery rate over time though we have that steps are taken and more people become resistant so a smaller fraction of the population is susceptible and so at any moment in time later in the progression of the disease the effective reproduction number reflects this comparison of what would the transmission rate be from now on compared to the recovery rate and if mitigation lowers that beta T parameter social distancing lowers you know the rate at which infected people are bumping into others or if the population share that is susceptible drops low enough if either of those two happens then the effective reproduction number falls below 1 and the disease starts to shrink so we actually refer to the case where the fall of the effective reproduction number below 1 when the share of susceptibles s over n Falls low enough as what that's what they mean when they say herd immunity this is a goal that a lot of people talk about and I'll come back to in the discussions now I've set this model up to try to do counterfactuals and think about what would happen if we stopped doing social distancing now so two things that would be of interest would be what would we expect in terms of a peak infection rate and what would we expect in terms of a cumulative burden of the disease and what I mean by that is what is the fraction of the population that in the long run would get infected I've updated parameters from my MBR working paper because the disease is evidently growing in the United States much faster than it did in China and so I consider a range of basic reproduction numbers between one point six and three and I'm using this to think about what would happen if we just abandon social distancing completely now this is a graph that shows the fraction of the population that would be infected at any point in time over the next hundred and eighty days and you see that the scenarios obviously differ depending on the rate that you anticipate but we should get then in a relatively short period of time a big spike in the peak you know in infections that could of course have severe consequences for the healthcare system even now with the time that they've had to prepare for this um and this is what you know Angela Merkel was referring to when she said that we should expect two thirds of Germans to get the disease this is showing the ratio of the cumulative cases to the population and so in all the scenarios considered over half the population ends up with the disease in many cases a very large fraction almost everybody ends up getting the disease so the forecasts I would say if we dropped mitigation they come out of standard models would be for a lot of disease in a relatively short period time say here under six months the alternative of course weed mitigation this is a graph is that you kill off the disease early so this is a graph from a paper in cell discovery that was applying a model of this kind to Wuhan very early on in the progression of the epidemic there and what it shows in this graph is a total number of infections according to the model this is shown first in purple and then gray and at blue and then estimates are given in yellow and red and what's in black inside this entire shape is what are the confirmed cases in Wuhan at the time so this model was saying they had considerably more cases than their testing was showing and it was growing quite rapidly but you see as we go from purple to gray to light blue to red that the they're having the effective reproduction number drop and once they get it going below one either 0.9 in the red case or 0.5 in yellow case then the disease gets to die out even though Wuhan is a city of 11 million people you know so 84,000 out of 11 million is not a large fraction of the population getting the disease and this is the scenario that I would say this is the type of picture that the public health people would like us to see in the United States coming from our the social distancing that we've been doing of course though with the number of cases that we have this you know the peak that we're talking about being at a much higher level now are we actually you know you can interpret the growth rate numbers in that we see in terms of deaths or active infections in terms of what is this effective reproduction number so there's a website that gives you live estimates of the reproduction number by state these are their numbers yesterday I show to show you progression over time from New York in California and then in the bottom panel across all the states we're kind of in a situation right now where we've gotten there the effective reproduction number down close to one so that means the infections not really growing but we don't really have it below one yet to make the infection shrink so this is a number that I think is worth tracking every day and in fact I'm working with Jim stock and a bunch of Harvard graduate students to do our own version of trying to estimate this effective reproduction number in real time and to give uncertainty bounds around it so that we could follow the progression of the disease in real time so this race is to the raises the question when I say this graph raises the question you know we're kind of halfway to our goal which we've slowed the growth of this epidemic but are we going to be able to actually get it to shrink to get us down toward to that goal of one active case per million but the question of you know what happens if we did go through this scenario of lifting lockdown and just telling people to go back to work or go back to shopping and so there I think there's interesting experience I'll give you a minute to read what's on this slide but there's interesting experience from the 1918-1919 epidemic a man named John Barry who is a very prominent historian of and has a great book about that experience of the 1918-19 epidemic he also has a nice article in Nature that's very short published in 2009 where he makes the point that as he says fear not illness kept people at home and he discusses the absenteeism levels even in critical industries during wartime such as shipbuilding and railroads so we have not seen this response yet in the United States I'm not aware of it going on in other countries but we're in a situation where we're having 2,000 to 2,500 deaths per day if we thought about this going on it's a six eight or 10,000 or even 20,000 deaths per day one has to wonder how Americans would react and whether the alternative of lifting lockdown now would actually lead to a recovery of economic activity in the near term another factor that comes up and I think is of considerable interest is just how dangerous is this disease I mean you'll notice what I showed you with that si our model is that I didn't really distinguish between people who recovered I mean we were resistant because they recovered and people resistant because they died in part because I think it's very difficult for us to know what the fatality rate of this disease is without an accurate measure of what the true infection rate is you will see estimates of the infection fatality rate everywhere between 1% and 1/10 of 1% the 1% number would come from something like the diamond princess where we had the population was on the cruise ship was controlled there was no inflow and outflow and we were able to test everyone on the Diamond Princess an infection rate but you know people would argue that that was an older population and in fact an infection fatality rate of 1/10 of 1% might come from the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt where again we had everyone on the ship tested and no inflows and outflows of population but of course that population was very young and hence it was not you know the young seem to be doing quite well with this disease that might be a relevant experience for experiment for colleges thinking about opening up in the fall you know the the scene might be very much like the theater or Roosevelt but any one of those fatality rates leads to quite a large number of fatalities in this first round of infection of the population you know if we just use as a rule of thumb that we would expect within 180 days of unconstrained transmission that two-thirds of the population we at least two-thirds would be infected we'd be talking about 200 and somewhere between 220,000 and 2.2 million deaths so that's a pretty wide uncertainty bound but I would say even 220 thousands a pretty high number now what's in this table is data the New York City released about the deaths there and what's strike about the table is that in the third column it says with underlying conditions and what you see is that a very large portion of the debts regardless of age are coming in with some underlying condition it's listed in the notes diabetes lung disease cancer etc and so these data do you know raise a question that perhaps an approach that's tailored towards protecting the vulnerable those with underlying conditions might be something that we need to shift to if we need to come up with some kind of alternative plan to the current kind of broad plan of keep locked down going until we can get the case count way down but then what happens in the long term and so what I'm showing here is a graph this is probably people have seen this this is a fatality rate from the 1918-19 epidemic in the United Kingdom and it's quite evident that the disease count came in three waves at that time and apparently you know influenza-like diseases tend to come in waves and they tend to have a lot of variation in their transmission speed that's natural could be related to the weather could be related to other factors that may or may not be connected to mitigation steps and I emphasize this because although we've had a lot of encouraging news around the world from the bending of these curves I mean I guess I did mention earlier there is this possibility that what we're seeing is not the benefits of social mitigate but perhaps a common factor that's being driven by something in the natural evolution of this disease that we don't fully understand now I don't intend this picture to be a prediction that we're gonna have a much more severe second wave this is just you know what happened in history it is kind of interesting that you had this very big second wave comes in the fall and then of 1918 and then it actually died down there in the winter of 1918 and came back again in the spring of nineteen the winter of 1919 and came back in the spring of 1919 so this was not the case of you know summer and winter fluctuations because we see a lot of death in in a cold relatively cold time and then a pause and a bunch more death again in the spring so I just I want to emphasize this as anytime you're interpreting any kind of numbers don't over interpret in terms of causal impact it'll take a lot of research to figure out the causal impact of mitigation but if we think about longer term disease scenarios there's an article that came out on April 14th in science that basically asked the question what if immunity is not long-lasting in what if the transmission of this disease has a seasonal pattern that's similar to related coronaviruses they're listed at the bottom of the chart here is OSI 43 and HKU one and the team that wrote this science article simulate a somewhat more complex disease model where instead of having the category r4 resistant be a permanent state of affairs it's something that is temporary so you transition back to being susceptible after some period of time and there's five panels in this graph they correspond to five different scenarios of disease progression under different assumptions about the seasonality of transmission and the persistence of your immunity to the disease and each graph so the blue line and the red line in each graph is showing patterns having to do with known viruses and they're you know thinking about different scenarios they're about how all of these things will go move but the the item of interest might be the gray or darkish line where in in the scenarios that they're considering say in panel a they're thinking at the spike of disease prevalence this year we would have seven point five percent of the population infected at the peak but then in twenty one twenty twenty one twenty twenty to twenty twenty three etc we would just have echoes they would be about a third to a half as large in panel B the persistence of of your immunity is a bit longer so the echoes are much smaller the most optimistic scenario is in panel D where immunity lasts long enough that the disease actually disappears so what I would say if we think about macroeconomic impacts there's a lot of uncertainty as to what's happening in the long run so to finish up it seems to me in the near term that we have one what I'm called a public health strategy of continuing with extreme social distancing for six plus weeks to try to get active infections down to a very low level and then turn mitigation over to a large public health effort and that would have to be carried out for years the alternative strategy if you lifted lockdown immediately this is an alternative we would probably see a big spike in deaths and infections in the near term and I have to wonder if we would get much economic benefit out of that if fear would keep people at home and I have to wonder whether we would get much benefit in terms of herd immunity if immunity is not long-lasting and it does seem clear given the possibility that immunity is not long-lasting that we would still need the public health effort long term under either strategy so when I personally think about these do I kind of vote for the first strategy but I would say on a daily or weekly BET basis I might reassess that if we don't see the effective reproduction number falling significantly below once
