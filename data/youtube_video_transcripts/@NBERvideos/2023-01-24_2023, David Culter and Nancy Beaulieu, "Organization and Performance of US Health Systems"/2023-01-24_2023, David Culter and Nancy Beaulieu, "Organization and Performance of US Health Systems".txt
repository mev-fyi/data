I'm David Cutler and I'm here with my co-author Nancy bolier and what we want to tell you about is a paper that just came out that we're incredibly excited about on the organization and performance of U.S health systems so let me before telling you about what's in the paper let me tell you a little bit about the cast of characters involved Nancy and I led a team of a lot of folks you can see their names on the left hand side of the screen that are looking at how do we judge the how do we measure the organizational the organization of Healthcare in the U.S that is how integrated is Healthcare and then second is what are the outcomes of being more integrated versus less integrated so there are a couple of parts to it but let me tell you first that the reason we're doing this now is because one of our papers on this topic is being published in Jama and it's going to be officially available on January 24th 2023 it's a special communication so it has a lot of detail about things and so partly we're hoping to demystify a little bit of it here This research has been supported by ahrq the agency for healthcare research and quality under the grant members that are here as a u19 mechanism that ahr Cube put in place we worked quite extensively with with ahrq and the other uh systems involved the other researchers involved with hrq to to to do this work and so we're grateful for the financial support as well as the intellectual substance that were that was brought by all different compo all different parts of this so what is it that we're doing well let me give you a little bit of the context for it which is that Health Systems in the U.S have grown dramatically in size and importance so what do I mean by a health system I mean an an organization that's composed of various types of acute care providers we're going to Define it as at least one hospital at least 50 Physicians and at least 10 primary care physicians with that they have to be at least some amounted in one area and then they can be much bigger than that and they can go on into multiple areas and so we've sort of known because we see a deals you know in newspapers and in journals you see a little bit here and there that Healthcare is getting more organized bigger but there are two things that we have not known one is kind of just how big is that that is if you get away from case studies and anecdotes how big is the consolidation in health care and then second is what are the characteristics of medical care that's provided in organizations that are more uh uh uh or organized but more more centrally organized versus less centrally organized so how do we how do we compare care and of course there are a couple of different dimensions that you want to know about one is uh the cost of medical care that is what is the cost of Medical Care higher or lower in uh bigger organizations in bigger systems of care and second is the quality of care higher or lower so what we did in this papers first we brought together a very large research team working through a number of different uh data sets I'll tell you briefly about that in a second to figure out um how what what does the organization of Medical Care look like and then second is we use data for Medicare and a large commercial insurer to look at how the cost and the quality of Medical Care Compares along a number of different dimensions between system care providers and non-system care providers let me first I'm going to tell you basically about what we did with the data and then Nancy is going to come in and tell you about the results so let me just give you a very brief sense about how we constructed the data remember we're thinking about networks so a network is an organization of hospitals and of Physicians you can think about it kind of on the screen here you have oftentimes you have a chain home office a group of related providers there will be one or more hospitals underneath them sometimes there will be independent Clinic groups sometimes there will be Clinic groups which are affiliated with hospitals so all sorts of different arrangements for those and we wanted to bring them all together that's not the easiest thing to do so we actually did that with several different databases we have a database of Physicians so we know where Physicians are practicing and you know who they're practicing with the physician practice database then has information about those practices in terms of who owns them what they're affiliated with we have links to hospitals both inpatient and post-acute acute and post-acute Care Facilities so we have a separate database for that and then many are owned by Chain home offices and so we have a separate database of chain home offices and we then link across all these different databases we use data from CMS in terms of who it pays who it writes checks to data from IRS 990 forms non-profit forms data from the American Hospital Association data from a large commercial insurer data from a variety of different Medicare systems all to try and get a sense of what all these relationships look like and there's really an enormous amount of energy that goes into that so I did want to highlight that that's one of the contributions here is the ability to put that together and that's one of the reasons why this research hasn't been done is because it's been so difficult to do that so once you do that what you get so now I'm going to turn it over to Nancy who's going to tell you about what it is that we found out about the Health Care system in terms of its organization its cost and its quality great thanks David uh so as David said we are going to use this uh data set and we're going to link it to claims data and other data on hospitals and physician providers and to look at what providers are in systems with their characteristics are and what the characteristics are providers that are outside of systems and then um we we come up with several findings a few of which we'll highlight here so it turns out that a good share of providers and Medical Care are in systems um um and so you can see uh on the uh in the figure that uh about 60 percent of hospitals um all types of hospitals and 80 percent of hospital beds over 80 percent are actually in systems uh and then on the physician side uh about 40 percent of Physicians and 40 percent of primary care physicians are in systems so that's quite a large share of uh all the providers in uh in the US who are in systems and then when you turn to look at uh the medical care um starting first with Hospital admissions uh we expected that a very large percentage of um admissions among system patients uh would be in system hospitals but we also found that uh that system hospi hospitals provided a very large percentage of the Acute Care in hospitals to patients who had non-system primary care physicians and a similar type of pattern you can observe also for specialty Physician Office visits so when you just go to see a specialist for system patients a very large percentage of those visits were provided by Specialty Physicians who were members of Health Systems uh and a substantial percentage of uh of non-system patients obtain their care from specialty system Physicians as well next slide David thank you uh so moving on to the performance analysis uh we did we linked these data um on providers to claims data both Medicare claims data and Commercial claims data and we did analyzes on a number of performance Dimensions uh when looking at the Medical Care Quality what we found was on average and across you know a large number of measures that uh that the quality was higher for people in systems and Health Systems patients who were uh who were had primary care physicians who were in systems um and then we also of course looked at the cost uh of providing uh this care and we found that the care is actually much more expensive than systems and uh we did some analyzes that also looked at uh how these results varied by uh the size for instance of uh The Physician practice and we found the biggest price differences really were among small and medium uh physician practices so when you consider these two things together that the quality is marginally higher in systems but the the cost is is quite higher uh we conclude that overall systems really haven't lived up uh to the promise of better quality and uh and lower costs
