and start with um should policy aim to increase labor supply for older workers often that's taken as a given um but i want to ask whether we should take it as a given how this gets prioritized with other things we'd want to do and then the implications of how to answer this question for policy then not completely connected um but partially connected want to talk about the growth slow down a little bit of a longer perspective on labor force participation and then a brief look at the pandemic so i think we're all familiar with lots of different ways to frame and phrase the importance of working longer on braunstein at all a paper that included john chauvin has just a lot of really great illustrations of for example increasing retirement saving by one percentage point for 10 years is the same as working um one or two months longer they also have something like working three to six months longer is the equivalent of having made one percent more over your entire career so there's a set of powerful examples and illustrations of the power of working longer there's also a whole macroeconomic discussion that i'm going to circle back to and discuss in greater detail but people who worry about the disappointing slowdown in growth from say 3.5 from 1950 to 2005 to 1.7 a lot of that is them worrying about demographics and if you assign an economist the task of solving that problem i mean you can't get all the way back to 3.5 an important part of the solution probably is going to be increased work by older workers some sort of individual story and a macro story here there also seems to be a um a deadweight loss story here a standard sort of government failure story of someone that was told for a long time but one of the most recent careful quantifications of it was from our kotlikov using their fiscal analysis model um and they talk about the incentive of booners to earn more significantly limited by a plethora of explicit federal and state taxes implicit taxes loss of federal and local benefits a particular concern is medicaid and social security and they document lifetime tax rates for older people of 35 to 55 and of course we know that means it's not just that in the interest of growth we're taking people who really hate the idea of working and like forcing them back into the factories but we're taking people whose benefit um from working as measured by you know what they're producing the social benefit of their work measured by what they're producing measured by their marginal product is higher than what they're actually receiving um right now and as a result they're making a social mistake by not working a social mistake because of that tax switch now the types of policies people have proposed are lowering social security tax rates for older workers um increasing the number of years counted towards benefits crediting additional work to benefits in some form allowing medicare to cover insurance for employed older workers and letting companies basically drop them from insurance raising the age limit for the eitc there's probably a couple others as well i mean all of these are in the vein of reducing that tax wedge which discourages um older workers leads to sub-optimal work leads to worse retirement and lower economic growth so i think so far this is like the relatively standard story um that people tell and now um and i sort of almost had written on these slides and then started to ask you know this is two separate questions um one is what's the best way to achieve the goal of getting people to work longer that takes the goal is given the second is just getting people to work longer pass a cost benefit test and that's essentially comparing this issue to a set of other issues i mean you see this type of thing all the time jim and i have been in rooms where people were talking about corporate tax reform and their basic goal was to have the deadweight loss of the corporate tax system equal to zero which if your only goal is corporate tax that makes sense but if in doing that you're raising other distortionary taxes you haven't necessarily reduced deadweight loss in the system as a whole and to some degree what you want is the distortions in the corporate system to be no worse um than the distortions um elsewhere um you get that sometimes in discussions of you know where there might be two rooms one room is discussing retirement security it's about how people should save more and another room is discussing how the middle class is getting squeezed and it's about how they should have more consumption over the course of their life and those two end up being in tension with each other and so the hour back in kotlikoff paper didn't have uh didn't have marginal tax rates for any younger workers on the 2017 paper that i just showed you so i said oh you know i want to find those because to some degree the answer to the question of how much should we be worrying about this particular tax wedge is to some degree the question of what are the tax rates look like for under younger workers uh well their paper didn't have it but they have a 2020 nbr paper that i don't think has been uh published and endorsed in full by the nbr just how the papers work because i understand it according to the newspapers joe um uh okay well okay i had no idea that they weren't all true um uh so they have 20 20 paper uh with david alt a different set of co-authors david altic among others and this is their median lifetime marginal tax rate for someone in the middle resource quintile they're trying to do all-in they're looking at all taxes they're looking at all benefits they're measuring it in a present value lifetime way there's a lot of sort of black box or maybe maybe it's all transparently documented somewhere but there's a lot a lot a lot of assumptions um that went into this so i wouldn't sort of go out there and state with confidence that this is right but this picture doesn't scream out at you that there's some big distortion for older workers relative to what we already have um for younger workers i mean it certainly doesn't scream out for you that you want to lower um the marginal tax rate for older workers if that meant sort of holding everything else equal effectively raising it for others um and and the like this is the middle quintile at older ages this just shows their results for the lowest middle top and top um one percent it's the median lifetime marginal tax rate um there's enormous variation as we all know um within all of these i couldn't quite tell what was going on but part of what i think was going on was at younger ages you had certainly lower incomes more people for example having phase outs of benefits that like the earned income tax credit or on the child tax credit i wasn't quite sure why for the top quintile um except that for them the social security taxes in some sense are always distortionary and that you're getting a very low return on them and you're effectively paying um in present value the full social security tax if you're in the top one percent whether you're age 20 or age um 70. so that was my guess here was there's a set of benefit uh programs that are phasing out for lower income and for higher income um than not getting a return on your social security um doesn't really matter um but you can look in the last two categories i just did 60 and 69 and 70 to 79 minus the more uh prime age work that's relatively small and there's not you know that that much of a pattern um now the only people that could make decisions based on this are people who like maybe like larry kotlikoff might be the only one who would understand every aspect of the economy well enough to make his labor supply decisions on uh lifetime marginal tax rates um the bottom here is current year marginal tax rates these again have a lot of stuff that's not necessarily overly visible to people as benefits phase out um and the like but at least it's a little bit more plausible that you sort of talk to your neighbor learn that they made more they got less eitc than you paid more in taxes than you or whatever else and the current year which might be more behaviorally relevant don't you know exhibit a particularly strong pattern if anything you know if you start to think about how actual humans think about this rather than what the model would say you might want to raise the tax rates especially for the lowest and middle income quintiles for younger workers because those are the ones where the social security payroll tax the 12.4 is essentially entering as something close to zero um in certainly the lifetime marginal tax rates in their analysis but where a person might think that they're actually paying 12.4 or maybe just 6.2 in payroll taxes so there are other considerations here um of course um there's the classic um atkinson stiglitz taxing things with that are less elastic at um higher rates uh that are more inelastic i that guys that said it correctly both times that are more inelastic at higher rates and certainly you have more elastic labor supply um for older workers they're sort of not sure whether they're going to work or not somebody at age 40 is going to work no matter what so why not tax the person at 40 more heavily than the older worker there's another one which it goes i think the other way which is i'm very worried about a 40 year old who drops out of the labor force for a year the implications that has for their earnings 10 20 years in the future the probability that they're working 10 or 20 years um in the future and so in some sense there's a larger present value cost of discouraging someone a 40 year old from working than there is a 65 year old where you know there's not a lot of you know in year 10 and 20 of the present value calculation um there's not a whole lot of mass and earnings um and the like and so this says to me maybe you want a relentless all-in effort on people that you know catherine is one of the people in this room that's worked on on all the different every age group um labor supply and more of a work on that then there's a last consideration which is sort of paternalism which might be that you think people misoptimize and you know then trying to understand how they misoptimize is quite important i think the view 20 years ago and still the popular view is that people had a lower living standard um in retirement they were less happy um in retirement so they were making a mistake by retiring early and maybe we wanted something to sort of discourage them from making that type of mistake sort of endless debates in the retirement adequacy literature but i read it at this point is much much more sort of mixed to neutral to possibly people even have sort of a better living standard when you adjust for like them cooking their own meals and the way they actually um consume and the way their leisure complements their consumption in retirement and so maybe there isn't quite the same you know paternalism problem that we want to solve about somebody in their working age versus their older age for younger workers there's a whole nother set of considerations they're another group that's quite elastic um for them though sometimes the choice is between school and work and so what how you think about the present value of that choice is um is to me unsure so i don't leave all of this discussion saying you know it's a mistake uh to focus on marginal tax rates for older workers but um but i do leave it a little bit less sure than i was uh before i pulled the numbers um for younger ages and started thinking about how it all compared and thinking that maybe one needed to think uh you know more carefully as to why uh the focus was on this which of these or other justifications for it now everything i've showed you is for the united states this is the famous uh gruber uh milligan and wise uh graph which shows tax force to retire and um and the number of men who are retired um and you can see the united states is towards the bottom of the tax force so it might be if you looked at that graph of marginal tax rates by age across a wider range of countries you would see in france belgium the netherlands and italy and some of these countries have changed their systems um since then and have reduced them but you would maybe see something more like the story that we're actually making a mistake by taxing this group and in particular this more elastic group more heavily than we are um other ones and just another way of showing these data um the united states is towards the very high end of the employment population ratio the bars are for 2017 there happen to be dots um for 2007 and this is you know as much as possible um age adjusted so it holds fixed the age distribution across the different countries so you have new zealand and korea higher than the united states but the united states really is higher so you know part of where this led me was thinking rather than sort of normal everything's a disaster in the united states everything's horrible let's have a conference to figure out how to fix it um that maybe uh this is about how the united states roughly got this right by having the same tax rates across different age groups and you know what it is we can teach um the rest of the world at least the rest of the world um excluding new zealand and korea now none of this speaks to policies that don't cost money or even save money um this was about sort of starting the presumption that you want the same marginal tax rate on different ages and different types of activities that you wanted a neutral tax system um there's other things like eliminating the retirement earnings test after the normal um retirement age that is less about money and more about optics and objects that matter a lot to people um raising the earliest eligibility age or the normal retirement age which uh the second obviously operating through the signal value that's associated with it um and whether there's other policies um to support and encourage older workers and thinking sort of more about these rather than the marginal tax rate ones on the other issue with the marginal tax rate ones which is not just the abstract you want an optimal tax system to be effectively equally distortionary across everything is that we just don't have a lot of money um right now we're on sort of the wrong side of where we should be in terms of tax revenue and so yes maybe if you did social security reform that restored solvency and lowered the payroll tax rate for older workers that might be an optimal social security reform but even getting that reform done is going to be quite hard and even within that reform if you care about for example benefit levels you get trade-offs there i just want to put a brief plug in and i think it sort of gets at this distortion and how distortions might be different for older workers and younger workers for one policy that isn't usually as much part of the older worker conversation it's usually in a set of other conversations and that's wage insurance you can motivate wage insurance by saying that unemployment insurance creates a distortion if you choose to not work and make zero you get half of your old earnings but if you choose to take a job at a lower wage you don't get anything um you don't get any form of insurance and this can discourage you from taking a job at a lower wage um this distortion is probably more serious for older workers because they're the ones who are more likely to only have a new job opportunity at a lower wage either because of the trajectory of where they are in terms of skills because of the health costs associated with them refer back to my point um about medicare maybe even just because of some unfair form of age discrimination and so i think the case for wage insurance for older workers say 55 and up you take a job at a lower wage after you involuntarily lost your job and it makes up half of the difference in your earnings and that's paid out over say five years as a way to keep people in the labor force and address this distortion i should have said the distortion for unemployment insurance also might be more serious because this might be an age where you're making a decision about whether to exit uh the labor force or not exit the labor force and so i'm not saying this is like the most important policy but insofar as you haven't already had three papers on it maybe it should have like one part of one paper it's not too late so now i'm gonna turn to a topic that in some ways is related um to what i just said and in some ways not related um to what i just said which is the slowdown in economic growth i showed you the slowdown before before talking about it it is worth thinking seriously about why we care about economic growth and how we measure the value of economic growth um in macro if somebody takes a job making sixty thousand dollars gdp goes up by sixty thousand dollars and we count that as economic growth um in micro um if somebody takes a job making sixty thousand dollars then we say welfare goes up by sixty thousand dollars uh minus the loss of their leisure now i've never been completely comfortable with the micro model for say you know a 40 year old without children um for me rather than work being disutility or losing leisure so reducing the utility you get from leisure um work to me seemed like a connection to a community a positive thing and to the degree that non-work was addictive you could make a bad choice today that um would would hurt you and compound down so when i think of you know we're in a recession and the fed creates jobs um i don't think to myself isn't it sad all the leisure we've lost i think look at all the jobs we've gained and i measure them roughly at the value that people were paid when it comes to older workers though the micro perspective has a little bit more appeal i mean it depends on the age but you know people talk about older workers leaving the labor force because of covid i don't have some prior view as to what the right labor force participation is for 75 year olds i don't certainly shouldn't be a hundred shouldn't be zero uh maybe you could say it's whatever it would be without the distortions um that we have but if a 75 year old discovered during covid that there were more fun things for them uh than they had realized in terms of spending time with their grandchildren or they learned to play golf because that was a safe outdoor activity and then they didn't go back to work um when the pandemic cooled down i'm a little bit closer to the micro view on that of sort of revealed preference the value of their leisure and that we shouldn't think about the sort of growth that comes from older workers as having quite the same value um even if you take a 40 year old to get the job at 60 000 or 75 year old that gets a job at 60 thousand the forty year old i'm almost comfortable counting that it's a sixty thousand dollar gain the 75 year old i'm more comfortable counting it as like a ten thousand dollar gain um the difference between you know what they were being paid and the value to them of time with grandchildren and golf um again i'm not sort of this isn't like a deep conviction i have i'm sort of confused about how we go back and forth between deciding whether work is good or not in other discussions if you talk about the eitc and it encourages people to work um that's good if you talk about making the child tax credit into an allowance and that discourages work well that's an income effect people consuming more time with their children that's good and so um um you know we're not we're not all consistent about this in our heads and i'm trying to be but unsuccessfully um so i just wanted you to have that in your head when we think about growth coming from this source um no there's this great american slowdown um all these different articles about the new normal um potential gem growth was slower these are all pre-covered so i'm trying to sort of assume look at where we were in 2019 and then extrapolate out on the theory that we're in something relatively similar to that um now um the new normal interestingly sort of was actually fully predicted um people treated growth in the pre-covered years like some disappointing surprise the growth rate in 2019 was 2.3 percent if you go back and look at the forecasts that the social security administration the congressional budget office made in 1989 the social security administration thought growth in 2019 um was going to be 1.9 in 1999 they actually got more pessimistic um and thought growth that year is going to be 1.4 and then if you look at cbo just prior to the pandemic they thought growth um was going to be i think 2.2 so the slowdown we've seen in growth actually didn't catch the forecasters by surprise it caught them by surprise only in so far as you sort of forgot what you know steve goss knew in 1989 which is there's gonna be a lot more older people and older people don't work um as much as younger people and if anything growth over the decade before the pandemic was surprisingly good um this is by the way even if you include the down of the great recession um and the uh uh this just uh is one you know cbo from 1998 looking and i did this um two years ago i'm just showing these slides again um in case you all missed it or forgot it a word present uh this was the cbo uh the the black line is the actual um and the orange line was cbo and i it wasn't like an arbitrary cherry pick thing a lot of forecasts would have told the same story all the forecasts told the same story but you look at the forecast you look at what actually happened um 20 years later and reality was better than what the forecast said the forecast was for 2 growth and the actual was 2.2 um then there's that difference in that one year which is what i showed you before and this was cbo's forecast they had this very dismal forecast of 1.8 for potential i mean that's a reasonable reading of potential um but that was even better um than what they had forecast and the forecast was based almost entirely on the types of demographic issues that you know everyone in this room uh knows really well um and for what it's worth today we're actually more optimistic about growth this is the latest um survey professional forecasters not the latest but it's the latest one that had 10-year growth estimates um this is where the forecasters think we are on 10-year growth if you look at the same 10-year window forecast uh you know about 20 years ago all of the forecasts for that same 10-year window that these uh forecasters are forecasting now were just much much lower so if anything the story is a story of a sort of pleasant surprise of 1.8 growth if that's what you think it's going to be going forward whether that's where i'd be on these 10-year things if anyone had asked me um is actually sort of a lot better than what we thought before and why is it so much better well the most important uh you don't you can't read every part of the forecast because they don't forecast every age group's labor force participation and every aspect of productivity um and the like but it does look like the main error that forecasters made and the reason the world turned out better than they thought it was um was actually labor force participation um so the shift to older workers was the reason for the unsurprising decrease in growth but it's also the reason for the surprising increase in growth relative to earlier projections that didn't really understand this was happening and didn't um extrapolate it out so we've done worse we knew that but we've done less worse than we thought and both of those older workers are playing a really big role in if you want to understand potential going forward understanding you know how much more of a participation increase we can expect for older workers is incredibly important and i'm hoping um in the question period someone can tell me and this is just the picture i think we've roughly seen the actual labor force participation was just falling and falling and falling for this group and then it turned around if you do age adjusted that's just using the 2019 population shares and applying those to the participation rates going back to 1968 i think or maybe 64 to 64. um you get the picture looks very similar it's sort of an amazing turnaround and an amazing increase and basically at every point forecast implicitly seemed to assume that was going to stop flatten out and maybe even mean revert um and go down and i should say part of this is when i was at cea we got there were tons of articles speculating about why labor force participation and say 2014 2015 were so low or so disappointing we're so terrible i went back and looked at forecasts from eight years before and we were actually ahead of what those forecasts thought we were ahead again entirely because of this and that's not to say by the way it wasn't disappointing i think it was i think it was because of prime age workers um so that's not sort of a defense of the obama economic record um but just an observation about this um i think we all know the participation for every age group for women for men uh you know i've learned from you why this is shift to less physically demanding jobs increased education lifespan spouses working and the complementarity of work elimination of the early retirement earnings test and the increase maybe just a social institutional change of partial retirement and of unretirement going back to the picture i had before labor force participation on the x-axis here is 2007. on the y-axis 2017. almost every dot for a country is above the axis so labor force participation for older workers increased almost everywhere you can see it increased most for countries that started with lower labor force participation and if anything there seems to be a little bit of convergence um the u.s increase was among the smallest over this decade but that's because it started um the highest and and countries like or economies like the euro area started much lower had a bigger increase and so we've seen some convergence if you continue the types of pre-pandemic age specific trends we see you're going to see labor force participation continue to decline this is because older workers working more still isn't enough to make up for the larger fraction of them plus the younger workers um working less and this forecast is very similar to cbo and very similar to what you get with aging only since the error for young people and old people is roughly offsetting so my very last thing is just a brief look at the pandemic and i know you took a much longer look at it yesterday so the main thing i want to do here is just draw some connections and differences between older workers and other age workers and between the united states and other countries just to put that down on the table as food for thought this is what's happened to the labor force participation rate it's down 1.2 percentage point from where it was prior uh to the pandemic 0.3 is what you would have predicted just using aging alone um the weird bump in january is bls updating the population controls and that's um covid deaths showing up all in one month you want to spread that out over the previous year we don't know exactly which months to spread it in over the previous year and you see a distinct contribution outside of aging both from under age 55 and um over age 55 um breaking out the contributions um it's just amazingly heterogeneous it doesn't really lend itself to one story people tell child care stories that uh both in my work with melissa kearney and willie powell and claudia golden's work don't really hold up um to the evidence but you see women and men are basically the same people tell early retirement stories but you see age 55 the contribution um is basically the same 16 to 24 had looked a lot better um but it's gotten a bit worse um lately and you can see all of that um in this chart where you know if anything the you know interesting thing to me is at first older workers which you can see in gray were declining less than many of the other workers but they've also recovered more slowly and so in some sense the divergence has actually grown a little bit this again does age adjustment within each of these three age groups which tells a little bit of a different story than the one you saw in for example the new york times yesterday which showed some numbers that were partly partly a function of age changes so trying to understand what the commonalities but also the differences the initial experience being less severe but then the later experience in some ways being worse for me is an important part of the story and just the final point on this is the international comparison which is that the united states for older workers is doing a decent amount worse than this is employment rates than all of the other advanced oecd economies so whatever explanation you have in terms of long covid or you know changing taste around retirement or whatever else you want to square that with the fact that covet has been similar in all of these countries but the labor pattern has been different now i should have shown you the difference in difference between this age group and the other age groups across countries there you actually wouldn't see a pattern if you did this for overall workers the united states looks a lot like this too so this may be some telling us something um about for example employment retention programs versus unemployment insurance i was a bit skeptical of the important difference between them early on but i'm increasingly thinking maybe there is or maybe it tells you something about labor market institutions but um and by the way the other thing to keep in mind is gdp in the us is stronger than almost all of those countries and the labor market recovery is weaker than almost all those countries the difference is productivity has been higher i think that less is innovation and more as people running themselves um ragged here so just to conclude um i do think getting older workers to work more is good from a micro perspective and their well-being good from a macro perspective but i'm still not exact i'm not sure about why um than i was before i started thinking about it for coming in on to this group and i think getting the why might focus on which are the right policies and which are the wrong policies in terms of economic growth this is profoundly important in terms of well-being it may be somewhat less important than the aggregate economic growth because of sort of taking into account the value of leisure and taking that more seriously um for this age group and understanding the pandemic it's good to look at older workers but good to look at how their story has sort of changed and varied over time relative to younger workers and relative to other countries so thank you
