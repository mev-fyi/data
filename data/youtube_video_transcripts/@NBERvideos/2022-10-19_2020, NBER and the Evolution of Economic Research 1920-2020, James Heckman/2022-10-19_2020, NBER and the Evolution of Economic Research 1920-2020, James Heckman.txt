I I really honored to be able to speak on this topic and I have a certain personal interest as Jim just said I was at the end of the ER New York in uh part of its Heyday and the uh in the development of human capital for the first three years in my academic career and participated in some of these seminars but I actually would have a slight not a quarrel but suggestion for improvement of this paper and that is I think if you really wanted to organize a session about the nber history I think you might better organize it by the creative individuals who who really built these programs already talked about kuznets and burns and Friedman if you go forward I think the retrospect would be better organized around the creators rather than around certain programs that exist at this point uh and I think to be honest that in this particular paper not in the other papers in the session the paper on Newman capital is mistitled the reason why it's misitled is that NVR was not an incubator an incubator is actually a controlled environment that nourishes the growth of organisms so you can look it up on Wikipedia or whatever in the truth I think the human capital group in nber revolutionized by combining both Theory and data and to explore a really big problem we heard already in the previous presentations that many in the NBR group were very interested and very very clear in collecting honest useful data that would be above any kind of Suspicion so I would argue that there was a kind of Revolution and that any incubation if it was was basically by people like Jester and Victor Hughes who funded some of this work and and singled out of brilliant Scott I like Becker and also mincer so I think the novelty was was that it was just not in the data analyze but in the theory that organized diverse data across fields and it really brought Theory to the analysis of data in a way that really wasn't common at the end of the ER we even heard that in the discussion of the monetary Theory so the second point I like to make is that the human capital and the golden cat's paper is a little bit conflated with Becker's creative agenda I mean everything that Becker did is now called human capital the paper starts off by defining it as an investment but if you look at it and I think that the true the true way to recognize the the goal here is that Becker really was a fundamentally original thinker and he created a lot of ideas and he created them in this Matrix and I I think the one thing that really is missing in the paper is the role of the Columbia labor economics Workshop which I think was symbiotic with the bureau I mean because of Burns Burns were that Colombia and then of course at uh at the end of the ER they did have this relationship and it was the case that scholars in the NBA a lot of the appointments they are working for Grants and so forth were also Columbia faculty and then later City University of New York faculty but I say I single out Colombia because there are a lot of people a whole Cadre of PhD students who were fleshed out papers that built on and extended the Becker events or framework so Becker had a great impact and was across all these fields that are still active at the nber fertility time allocation human capital I'm not sure you want to call it all human capital but I think since 72 when Schultz wrote an essay for the bureau these things have been conflated in some way so I would try to clarify that and also try to understand and clarify the role of the uh of some of these sister organizations I would also go back to Milton Friedman if I can for a minute uh Milton Friedman played crucial role in a lot of the workers discussed they've heard about that but there are links that are interesting to make and that should be made Friedman was an undergrad at Rutgers and he was a research assistant to Arthur burnt who is his teacher that's a link Burns was working on his PhD thesis under Mitchell and one of his Ras was nonetheless Milton Friedman so Friedman was actually right there at the beginning working at business cycle racing as an r-rate accusedness he created income from independent professional practice and I I believe the theoretical work in that book is really into Milton Friedman also a lot of the work in Henry Schultz's theory of Demand is due to Milton Friedman but the point is is this book has already been mentioned played a fundamental role right Claudia was right that the notion of General versus Pacific Capital permanent versus transitory income the modern methods for analysis of panel data was a huge inspiration for much subsequent work and I think it was actually a prototype of what later became Friedman's methodology of positive economics now there was a mention of a delay in the publication of paper but I think it's a creative villain it was a good delay in some sense because the the person who had the delay was seeing Reinhold known as he was a Reader's Digest right now he he had an objection but it's a very modern objection and it's an objection that's still held up to this day namely ability by us he was in Cleveland was saying the high return to being a physician at the U.S was really due to the fact they had invested and created essentially human capital and right final noise basically pointed out well look it could also be ability by us and you better settle this more clearly and I think that's an honest I think it's good it's in the Euro tradition the kind of insist on those high standards of evidence and uh Freeman played a role you know defending uh against uh koopman's Burns and Mitchell and he even wrote a paper about Wesley Claire Mitchell as an economic theorist so these people had a heavy influence on what later became in that the bureau project I would also mention Stigler not only in the sense of his work on iO and rates of return but his work on search Theory it was later in this famous 62 jpe lawyer now coming to Becker there's no denying that Becca played a tremendous role a crucial role not only in the sense of creating ideas a vast array of ideas but he built on Friedman's methodology of positive economics in his work namely he was using multiple sources he was using what might be called A Narrative Approach along with a quantitative approach and I think he was very very uh he implemented these Friedman principles in a very productive way and of course he created this this masterpiece about that put together in a way that Friedman's research program wanted people to put together theory that had Direct application to the original problem being considered which was did the U.S under invest or over invest the human capital but also had a lot of other auxiliary applications so that was his notion of testing a theory and then looking at its multiple implications so beckerd's range of Interest spawned a number of programs number of fields are across economics crime law economics earnings inequality Health a lot of these grow out of the Becker workshop and the people working with Becker but nonetheless I'm not sure how to call them all human capital I think so I think you'd want a differentiate backer from human capital although it's hard it certainly there is a difference there was one other group that I think might be mentioned when you look at nber in New York and that was the work by uh and the group led by finest Welch at City University it's probably been mentioned in one of the papers that Finance was the first had the first NBR working paper in the modern series but I think uh he played an enormous role at the end at the New York mbdr and he he alone it was he was a separate Force he brought a lot of young people together people like Smith and Willis and others and and uh he coordinated the nber work with the work at City University it was the second poll of research so I would argue that this is a good paper it's an interesting paper it has a lot of interesting facts talks about human capital it's not I think it needs a clear definition of human capital and if you want to talk about the work of Gary Becker there's a lot to say and I would definitely say that's great if you want to say that nber has benefited a lot from a Gary Becker I'm saying that's true and a lot of the rest of the world has but I think it's really important though to think about some of these other sources just historically and also to recognize that with a lot of the Cadre so it seems to me the last part of the paper the last few periods I guess I guess you'd call it the filmstein period and so forth it's a little different uh in the sense that you these programs these ideas they weren't fully formalized but you know people like in law and economics Bill Landis a Packard student from the Columbia labor Workshop uh Mike Grossman who's a student Rebecca at the Columbia labor economics Workshop these people actually uh respond by this group they many of them stayed associated with the nber some left so I think I would I would separate then I'm not sure that NVR was so much an incubator in the sense that I gave is the technical definition but I think it really played a very powerful and finance these people and there were people some of the project administrators who aren't really that well known today big Fuchs is known Tom Jester uh is known to many people who work on certain kinds of longitudinal data but maybe not so well known so I would sort of clarify this but I do think it's a good paper and I think that uh that the nber really has carried on the backer Vision I guess I'd be more upfront and say it's more Becker than as human capital so great thank you
