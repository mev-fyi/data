well thank you so much uh to Irene Barack and Michael for inviting me here it's a great pleasure uh to be here I have to say that this will not be as exciting as I'll talk uh I think together with Healthcare economies the energy economists are infamously known for losing their audience after three slides so I hope I can last about five and keep you engaged with what I believe it's one aspect of Market design the design of energy markets that you should all worry and care about so the more mind that we can bring into this area of research the better of that we all will be so before getting into why Market design and electricity is important let me make sure that we are all in the same page I'll do this like oh hold in a minute like this this is what I'll be talking about electricity and it's um basically into this patch how it's allocated how it's produced and how it's demanded so that we are on the same page traditionally electricity game from power plants it got into the Big Grid then into the small grid and then eventually it got sold to either manufacturing commercial or residential buildings more and more the market is changing I actually really enjoyed Al's comment on the surrounding is changing so is the market still working because the surrounding in the space of energy has been changed dramatically I wouldn't say not even in the last 10 years but in the last five three two one years every year my slides become tremendously outdated not slightly outdated but tremendously outdated and one of the major changes that we have seen is the introduction of economically by level Renewables either on the larger scale side this would be the large wind farms or the large solar far terms that you might have seen in many parts of the country and also it's becoming economical at the residential what we call distributed scale at a much lower voltage so all of these has changed the market tremendously in a moment in which the market needs to change as you may know we are struggling in the fight of climate change and we need to decarbonize our economies and this means basically bringing combustion to near zero for all of our activities and we are very far from being there in the transportation sector but also in the electricity sector fortunately the electricity sector is one of the places where we have done some progress thanks to Renewables and it's one of those that's expected to decarbonize the fastest so the question is how we how do we rethink electricity markets now that they have to do a lot of heavy lifting now that they have to decarbonize not only their own sector but absorb absorb the emissions that are coming from many others like the transportation sector all of a sudden cars will become part of the electricity sector uh so many changes have been happening Renewables as I said is the good news that we have in there batteries are also a space where we see a lot of innovation not only based on um scarce resources like rare or type batteries but also batteries that don't rely on the scarce resources so a lot of innovation there that's the good news a lot of innovation in Energy Efficiency a lot of innovation in demand response also a lot of innovation in the carbonizing other sectors for example with heat pumps decarbonizing uh heating at residential and Commercial scale or with electric vehicles decarbonizing the transportation sector at the very least at a small and medium scale if not even for the tracks so a lot of properties there a lot of good news the bad news is that all of all of this is done in combination with extremely growingly hazardous extreme weather events that make the electricity Market in itself also more important but also more flimsy more kind of susceptible to failing as a market so I'll be talking about uh what I see as potential ways in which to think about Market design in this context that's ever changing um so how do we design electricity markets let me go back to the very very basics so in electricity markets I often tell my undergraduates it's a textbook example of how markets clear in Our Minds when we teach them about demand and sorry uh demands and supplies so when we teach them about demand and Supply I always tell the undergraduates look you know like 3D markets not only there's an underlying demand curve in your mind an underlying supply curve in your mind I just downloaded that demand and that supply curve from the electricity Market in the Iberian Peninsula and you can literally draw it there's a supply curve which is the cost curve of the generators there's a demand curve that's the willingness to buy from these suppliers they submit them in a centralized auction which typically happens every hour or every half hour so that's the product electricity for a given hour of the day or electricity for a given 15 minutes of the day depending on the market and then we we basically clear the market by maximizing the Surplus uh in technical terms we could say that this is a two-sided multi-unit uniform action which sounds fancy but in late terms it's basically Crossing demand and Supply every hour every half hour of the day finding the best allocation in the market so here I highlight that this works because electricity is seemingly an emphasis on seemingly homogeneous good so we can just Stack Up willingness to accept willingness to pay and find the efficient allocation in like one second it does take a bit longer these are large auctions but we can clear it pretty quickly with a linear solver so it's done a larger scale every single day many many times in huge uh markets now under ideal conditions not only did this super simple to explain and kind of an econ 101 textbook example of a market under ideal conditions this also gets the incentives right so here you have my Marcel Boynton who was the CEO of EDF electricity defense for many years and also a great Economist and he um emphasized in his Peak load pricing model which is basically the crossing of the mandum supply that this type of market clearing this two-sided multi-unit uniform action will give us the right incentives in the short run and it will also provide the right incentives for firms to build the right type of power plants in the long run so this is amazing and maybe I can just sit down there and be done because this gets everything correct so that's great the problem is that obviously life is not so simple and there are many things that make electricity not such a simple good and as I said we tend to lose our evidence by slight free I was aiming at life five so why is electricity not so simple first of all electricity follows very particular laws of physics when it flows through the network so this exchange of electricity between demand and Supply is actually quite severely constrained by where the demand and Supply are and how that demand and Supply need to flow also it's not amenable to bilateral agreements I cannot just had you know I don't know you that I will sell electricity to sell and I will sell my electricity to sell I will just throw it into the grid and you know by the magic of the centralized auction I still will get her electricity but maybe it will not be mine it will be some electricity that that will flow to her so these this makes uh the simple uh model not work because all of a sudden like this is not no longer a homogeneous good and it really depends where in the grid you're located at what times in the grid you are demanding that that this can actually clear notice that I didn't quite mention here but also the Mandan Supply need to clear at every single point in time so it's not that I can say hey Estelle I'll produce it now it didn't fridge come get it when you want just doesn't doesn't quite work so demand and Supply also might not be according to the very best incentives and Market design here has obviously an important role to play but on the supply side we all know about strategic behavior and how some firms might actually accumulate quite a lot of Market power in these markets that are very high fixed uh on the demand side also there's a tradition of having the demand side quite oblivious about what's happening there so it might be a very inattentive demand yes some Asians have incentives but they might not be able to fully internalize all the all the all the potential efficiencies that can be realized there I was telling you the Mandan Supply need to clear at any point in time in normal markets we can store things in an Amazon warehouse and yes there are limits to storing in an Amazon warehouse but weekend of kind of a store and sell in electricity there are batteries their importance is growing but it still is limited in scale and this balancing of demand and supply has to happen even with batteries so if I think about matching demand and Supply the batteries need to be doing exactly the right thing to make sure that the man and Supply are matching at every single second millisecond if you wish uh um of time if the month and Supply don't meet at every single point in time ensuring that the voltage in the network is in in kind of sink blackout can and in fact they do occur as I was mentioning extreme events are on the rise and we are witnessing an increase in blackouts that are of wild nature it's not like a slight kind of misalignment between supply and demand it really situations where demand and Supply do not even see each other in that picture so uh uh it's it's again something that we might worry about Market design might fail to work if the market disappears um uncertainties another aspect that one might worry about in that model before everything was perfectly known and it happened all in one step so firms were completely aware of their costs their available production when we go into renewable territory that production is much more uncertain the cost of Commodities are also a bit all over the place recently especially if you come from Europe like me and and that might also affect how markets are working finally in The Boy tour model that I was showing you that boy to sorry that my friends is terrible so so in that model um everything happened at once even the long run so power plants are magically built that will basically match the long run best of scenario but in practice uh power plants particularly when it comes to combustion fossil fuel power but of plants are extremely long-lived assets so there is a bit of a market design question of how we're going to get rid of them gracefully so that's that's again other parts of uh of Market design that are important so I'll go over each of these in a bit of a detail I'll talk about location and how we have been thinking about this from a market design point of view I'll go into Market power complementaries and some of these other issues time permitting I will also show you an empirical example in which Market design seems to matter is from a paper of mine that is not terribly a good paper it's kind of an okayish paper but I think it's the one that best highlights how Market design can matter you know electricity markets if I don't have time to cover that paper don't worry because I already told you this is maybe not my best paper so um I was already mentioning the grid is uh very particular it it does create externalities between a generation in different sites it's not that we can perfectly control uh where electricity flows and by injecting power here I basically have impacts to every node in the network uh by changing the flows and by changing how the bottlenecks are expressed into that Network so there is a large body of uh literature that shows that uh the best is to price the that congestion into the market and instead of having a simple Market where the Mandan Supply cross the best Market design would have a different price for every single location that's what it's mostly done in the US and this is what's called locational marginal pricing lmps but this location on marginal prices we don't see them which are meant to reflect the shadow values of congestion and losses into the grid they will penalize generation that's far away they will penalize the narration that's in a place where generation is not needed and it's kind of a stranded and bottlenecked there they will reward investment in areas that have super high prices because no one can get there so all these good shallow values that are reflected in Olympics are for example not used in Europe in Europe they do love the demand courses reply I showed you that the man crosses to apply of the Iberian Market and instead they have a second step where they figure out okay we just crossed demand and Supply but actually that demand and Supply cannot cross so how can we redo this from a mechanism design Market design also but mechanism design is an awful choice and there are many theoretical reasons why that's bad empirical leaders also recent evidence that shows that it's not only inefficient conceptual it's leading to large marketing efficiencies and this is a paper for example like Kristoff Graf and cothers who look at the Italian market and they show that these two-step settlement can be highly inefficient both in the US and Europe lmps are applied sorry in in U.S olymps are applied to the generation side but both in U.S and Europe in the demand side prices are much much coarser part of it is that politically it's not very glamorous to tell the demand side that oh you live in a rural area and you are kind of there's not many people there so I'm gonna make electricity very expensive for you that tends to work poorly lmps can also be quite volatile so you might happen to be in the wrong spot and your neighbor right across the street might be in the good spot and it creates maybe a differences in braces that are hard to explain socially and politically so we don't see that there but it's becoming a bigger issue as uh people put solar panels on their rooftops because now we're really having much more variation in World Generation rooftop solar might be useful versus it might not be useful so new directions will we see granular crisis finally coming to Europe under which design and will we see granular prices for consumers and under which design some people have in my opinion crazy ideas about blockchain coming to uh the generation of solar rooftop I think we are not not there that's my view but maybe some lower hanging fruit can be done to price a rooftop solar better um transmission constraint is also very important when it comes to the energy Temptation because many many new lines are needed I put here a few sides but it's impossible to cite everyone it's very clear that Renewables are not necessarily placed where people don't need them and that we need to throw these big lines well the process for building new lines is not very streamlined transmission is a huge object it's completely um connected so no line is separate from another except very particular lines for a manufacturing site let's say a big big manufacturer in industrial conglomerate so there are many externalities in how to allocate the cost of transmission if you want to build a new line is that a first mover kind of disadvantage that you pay for the line and then other people put it right on it so how can we coordinate the investment offlines and the investment that goes with the line and I think I believe there's a lot of room for creating clearinghouses for how we build new lines in Europe it's quite centralized it's treated as a full natural monopoly but still there needs to be a transparent process for having people beat into where they want to go and what the lines might be most valuable in the US some of it is left to investment like Merchant investment but Paul and anjan already showed that that doesn't quite work that this is in nature a public and private situation where the public part is very important so we might be seeing better processes better cleaning houses by the way Chen you here has a great paper showing how all of this is becoming very inefficient with a lot of queuing and lots of a lot of missed opportunities so I do think as a new direction we really need to rethink algorithms for planning new lines and how that process goes with new with new investment Market power too many papers to explain a lot of it starting with the debacle of the California Market in the early 2000s where California basically imploded in its electricity Market with huge prices um there's emphasis in the literature about how sequential markets can have and I would say the open questions at the moment are how Renewables and batteries will interact in these Market power conundrum there's also a growing risk for Market power in this moments of crisis in these extreme events I guess the word could be price guarding the market doesn't clear the price could well be Infinity so how do we discipline this kind of type of moment I'll talk more about this in a second as new directions again people are already working on this and America women for example has a paper on that so how batteries exercise Market power how Renewables impact these these um these are seen by the way removals are tiny you can enter very small so there is this sense that physical ownership could be very very scattered and improve Market power but in some of my work I show that actually a strategic ownership is very concentrated in some Financial firms so even if physically it's like Mom and Dad kind of wind farm here Mom and Dad's solar panel they're the actual strategic bidding is done by by large by large companies that do eventually have quite a bit of Market power in this in decentralized auctions so complementary it is a non-convexy this um so um when I showed you that graph of crossing the man and Supply it was one hour in one hour we were fixing the world but in reality the gliding of electricity has lots of links between ours and one example that I worked on during my thesis was a startup cost that if you start a power plan maybe uh you don't want to start it for your one hour and then shut it back down it's just bad for the power plant but also expensive so it has Econo direct economic cost but also indirect kind of breaking down the thing the probability of breaking down goes up so you want to kind of operate the smoothly so uh Richard will talk more more about this but he has a great paper showing how the right pricing can be done by using the Dual variables in the linear program that comes out from fixing the discrete variables I hope I described it properly but in practice uh policy makers and Market designers don't quite use the best design because maybe there are many Shadow values and that would be too complicated so we use some realistics in how to clear markets I studied one in my Azure Market a paper where basically I looked at the revenue requirements so power plants put their normal bids but on top of that they say but by the way don't even bother if I don't make at least a certain amount of dollars during the entire day so that provides a link between hours that's not feasible to provide with only hourly hourly bits other markets don't use this type of video with a still we have a paper looking at something that they can very interesting for the mechanism design folks they call it indicative bidding they allow firms to talk every half hour or every hour in this market where they keep talking they keep playing the market but none of those market cleaning outcomes are binding in any way other than figuring out what the other firm might do in theory this is good because they can better schedule their operations I imagine some of you have other thoughts on so one New Direction that I think is important is that markets have basically tweaked their weird rules their weird characteristics to more or less work but in the presence of Renewables we are actually seeing a lot more need for starting up and shutting down power plants now there's wind now they're solar now there is nothing so we need to do that much more so will these traditional mechanisms still sort of get the job done and one example from a Spain imagine Market people I found that for startup because it tends to happen only once a day that mechanism wasn't too awful but now with Renewables it might happen several times a day you really have to be on the tip of your toes and that mechanism might not be good anymore retail Design This is also an area where we are seeing a lot of innovation I will not have a lot of time to talk about this but there's a lot of Hope into making consumers more aware of prices and more responsive to prices it might be literally making the consumer aware or maybe more implicitly making something or someone related to the consumer aware so here we see a lot of Technology Innovation where the technology at the homie responding on behalf of the consumers so the consumers still have not much of an idea of what's happening but at least something or somebody some artificial intention intelligence scheduled in their homes it's kind of responding on their behalf in the absence of our consumers that are responsive there's a great theoretical literature showing that this can be highly inefficient both in the short and in the long run there's also quite a lot of research showing that the allocation of the grid costs what it costs to Consumers to have reliable electricity to avoid blackouts how to allocate the cost of avoiding blackouts can also be very challenging antola rooftop has made that even harder because as I was mentioning pricing solar and the value of solar rooftop is quite a controversial issue and here again I think there is a lot of room for Market design many many states Nevada and California have had to revise their designs for tariffs born and solar because their net metering policies were basically economically financially non-viable and they were leading to a lot of equity distributional concerns so lots of new directions here how to optimally design retail tariffs for rooftop solar I don't think we have figured that out and some of it does involve a lot of Nitty Gritty engineering not sure how much of it can be translated to retail prices again given the concerns about the political viability but the wood area of research also how will Home Technology interact with the market and how can basically this response be better integrated to harvest all these potential efficiencies finally scarcity we need to worry more and more about the scarcity and blackouts I've been trying to talk to the TSO the transmission operator in Spain and in France about blackouts they really don't like to talk about it so even the transmission operator tries to pretend that this is not happening but we know as a fact that with extreme weather events and basically extreme loading of demand into the very hot days this will become more and more common we also had some scares and they thought there would be quite a lot of blackouts due to the failure of having natural gas it did not pan out but it was an actual uh believable and and potentially binding geopolitical uh concern so I think we need to think more and more of what to do when the market fails and when really the market design becomes irrelevant because the mainland Supply cannot possibly cross there are some interesting new papers at the theoretical level suggesting how to put price caps and how those price caps might not be incompatible with what we think is the efficient outcome in these markets and I do think there's more to be done empirically I myself am working in the space of how to do blackouts blackouts happen very seldom so there's very limited research on them because they really don't happen so you would have three observations or something like huge blackouts I mean there's now some evidence from Texas but it's one big blackout that happened in Texas so I'm trying to work on the algorithms for doing blackouts at the moment algorithms for blackout did like okay I black out an entire neighborhood but as my mirrors are now allowed to complexify that decision and instead of blacking out the entire neighborhood you can partially black out that doesn't mean partially black uh blacking out half the people in the neighborhood it means that you can put people in half mode and this is enabled by a smart meters this type of blackout was not possible before before you had to put people in zero or one but now we can put people at half but if we don't develop the right protocols these blackout policies which are obviously I could show to you in one second that they are more efficient unfortunately if we don't put the right protocols in place the moment that they want to hear them they will not be ready because in this kind of ship everything needs to go according to plan and you can Manchester something improvising on the spot so many new directions there I think it's not fun to think about this but we need more people thinking about this and if it's an irrelevant common certain exposed I will be the person most glad about it so but I do prefer to work on a potentially relevant worst case scenario so that we are ready just in case so in the last two minutes I'll briefly mention a paper I already said this is not uh my best paper it's not super well identified but I hope I give you some kind of hints on why I believe Market design is very important so this paper is evaluating the impact that wind power has had in Spain using a very long time series of hourly data so I see every hour how much winter is and I see the cost to the system and it's a very simple paper asking cost to the system wind power okay so really simple paper so the part that's exciting to me is that during these 10 years of our data there have been many Market design innovations that have tried to improve how wind is incorporated into the market and I think that's where many of you could contribute wind and solar are becoming more economical because the costs of wind and solar are going down but wind and solar are also become more economical if we design the market better and we integrate them better into the grid this is already happening and many markets are in obeying their design to include Renewables in a more effective manner for example California which is a separate Market operates typically only for California their Market has convinced everyone in the western interconnection to participate in a balancing market and a big part of the motivation was to betterly integrate Renewables bringing big efficiencies and also making wind and tour more cost effective Germany have moved to more frequent markets so that we can clarify the uncertainties regarding wind in a faster way kind of in a more way and Europe in fact has moved into a more continuous trading fashion because with wind and sorry you want to kind of update the stuff more often so in Spain I will show you an example from a change in the wind premium it was basically a change of how wind farms were paid so not that deep of a market design change but by changing how wind farms were paid they reduced the costs of integrating winds into the grid so the regression is very simple I take data from Spain and I address the cluster of integrating wind into the grid these are congestion cards and reliability costs having power plants available on reserve this type of stuff so I regress that on how much winter is and not surprisingly the more when there is the higher these costs although a good half rule part of the paper is that yes they are higher but they are not insane so still go with good good good wind but can we reduce this cost can we make this a slope a bit flatter can we make wind not increase the cost of operation so much so in the paper we look at a regulatory change that basically stop the subsidies for wind farms these subsidies were making wind farms with Lilo in other markets they even bid negative because they want to get the subsidies so they will be negative and it leads to its crazy misallocation because winds wind farms are reading something that's not reflecting their true costs so they change that and the bottom line is that that thing went down not well identified but I think a hopeful kind of a spin on why Market design matters so many open questions I hope I gave you some thoughts but I do believe for all of you in the room we need to make the energy transition and Market design is a critical element of it so I hope I encourage you to work in this area
