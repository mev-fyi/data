let me tell you a little bit about this project um i'll begin by stating uh what my colleague jerry carlino at the federal reserve bank of philly would have said which is in no way is this an official statement of the fed uh this is our own work and the fed has not got anything to do with it in in an official capacity um let's see if i can get this to do things does that work excellent um so the uh the motivation for the exercise was uh of course the the great recession and uh the passage of um the american recovery and reinvestment act um it was a big chunk of change and the the thing that was striking to me as somebody who works in state and local governments was how much of this money was actually given to a state uh and local sector uh approximately forty percent of the total amount of money involved in this um uh particular policy was uh transfers to to state local governments i think it's long been recognized that state local governments are important uh in the economy for sure but the question in the macro sense is how um and both cbo and cea at the time uh were really had no idea what to do with uh this sector in turn in trying to make projections as to what the impact of these transfers might be um they basically used household estimates of responsiveness to tax cuts and federal estimates of spending had no sense of how the states would deal with this money divided up between taxes and spending and they basically did the best they could uh made assumptions and and ran with it um the lurking in the background of all of this is a friend maybe to some of us uh ned graham like who uh wrote some very important papers in the mid stimulus plan that came out in the 70s and the bottom line was it didn't work um these guys basically the states got the money and they sat on it uh and so the question is what what do you do about this sector and it's and it's clearly a an important policy issue in these federal unions i found a quote from an nber scholar from 1952 and i think it made it pretty clear and the bottom line of the quote a man's name was james maxwell the bottom line of the quote was states can't do much for themselves because of course all the activity will drift out assumed drift out of the economy and go to to neighbors possibly and that the only thing to do is to turn to the federal government for this kind of macro policy so state and local governments were basically out of the out of the discussion when it came to macro policy i sat at the knee of musgrave and oates that's what i learned musgrave's textbook if you look you look in the back and look under macro policy state and local government you'll find one paragraph out of the 590 pages of this masterpiece it just basically was an assumption that the state local government sector couldn't really be a player uh in the policy environment and yet we saw from aara um they were a very important part of the story so what we're pursuing here is that the question of uh whether musgrave and oates are are basically right about this assumption um that everything the state local governments can't do much and everything needs to go to washington and uh uh so is the i call it the musgrave oats conjecture and is it uh empirically correct um in anticipation uh we get five basic conclusions from the exercise it's this is a a blend of a paper that we had done earlier and then some new work on the macro side but the bottom line from the from the first paper is that states running deficits and i'll tell you how they can do that even in the face of balanced budget rules states running deficits can in fact impact their own economy we've got some evidence that that can that the governor can do something um on the job front if if they wish but there is pretty sizable spillovers to what we're going to try and argue our neighboring states economically neighboring states when you do the the cost per job exercise which sort of became the the uh the metal of the um the analysis of aara it turns out that it for the states to do it it's about 71 000 bucks a job you can ask the question of whether that's money well spent or not economically and i think that's an important question one we don't pursue systematically but if you bring in the spillover effects the numbers go down to something like fifty thousand bucks a job so um looks like coordinated fiscal policy has a role to play um in this exercise the question then is how do you do coordination um it turns out in our economic union the feds can't go to the states and say thou must spend x you've got to give them incentives to spend x and we do that through two mechanisms grants and aid of which there are two major forms one we call project aid what you will know in the popular press is shovel ready uh and it's viewed in our analysis as what we'll call fungible that is you can move this money around anywhere you want to a large degree and the second program is what we'll call welfare aid and the key feature of this welfare aid it's medicaid and up until the mid-90s afdc the key feature is that it's a price incentive you don't get the money unless you spend it and and then secondly the programs that are affected by this price incentive are going to be programs that largely benefit lower income households and we'll see exactly how that works the short of the story is that federal aid can make a difference in terms of we estimate uh can make a difference in terms of of income growth and the the one that is most important and most significant in terms of both statistics and statistical significance and economic importance is welfare aid so the the punchline of this thing is give money to states who will then have an incentive if appropriately structured to give money to lower income households that seems to be where the leverage is in this particular policy we do a a policy simulation not to meant in any sense for for a variety of reasons i think most of you will appreciate uh to be a critique of aara as a policy but we do use the policies offered in aar age and run it through our estimates of the macro economy so i call it a policy mix experiment and we find out that reallocating resources away from project aid and toward welfare aid would have bumped up the performance of aara uh policy mix by about 30 percent um so there you know there's something to be said for uh doing the analysis i hope um and uh and seeing where we where we get from all of this so um i'll be real quick um states impact on their own economy what we end up doing is estimating um a a model in which there's growth in jobs and growth in population so the state does well people move in and we try and tease out what the relative mobility apart of these programs are we look at two policies own state deficit which we call own d and it's going to be defined as cash flow so a state faces a balanced budget a requirement but it's on what's called the general fund and they can do things like borrow money and invest in capital perfectly okay so as a stimulus program we're going to count that long-term debt increase or increase in short-term debt if they succeed in running a deficit as part of owned deficits and also on the pension side and trust fund side we're going to allow them to run deficits so they can take money out of the pension fund spend it this is cash flow spend it and it's balanced against contributions into the plan and so it's not looking at the overall stock of wealth in these things and unfunded liabilities is strictly a cash flow basis so even states that have balanced budget rules have the legitimate policy capacity to run deficits in the short term and we're going to call that own death or own deficit and the numbers are not trivial about 390 dollars a person we'll get to some numbers later on when we look at state behavior in which the general fund surplus is on the order of 24 bucks surplus or deficit and the question is what fills the gap between the 390 and the 24 and the answer is federal money so own deaf excludes federal money we bring that in as a separate policy variable with this ap federal unconstrained aid and we we run the model we try to address the issue of spillovers um and we we made two swings at the ball um one was a file tip and one maybe was a single um the the file tip um was uh go through a very detailed input output connection if oregon wants to build uh wants to to produce some wonderful white wine they need oak from somebody for the casks and they they need whatever they had to wind and so forth and so we we looked at the input output connection what's missing is we don't have the demand connections in this from the input output table so we turned to another um another approach which was based on work by one of our colleagues at the philadelphia fed ted crone in which he looked at coincident indexes for the business cycle over a whole network of states and he decide and ends up setting up business cycle regions essentially and that will include aggregate demands so that's what we end up using as our our definition of neighbors um and a whole set of controls and uh year and state fixed effects et cetera et cetera et cetera so we estimate this thing um we we hope we did it well um and the the bottom line from the estimation is uh we're going to look at one standard deviation increase in own deficits which is 390 bucks so you bump it up by 390 bucks and ask the question what happens turns out that's about 100 increase in own death they go from 390 to 780 per capita so it turns out from estimates is about 100 percent increase in the rate of growth and the rate of growth was 1.2 percent so we'll bump it up to 2.4 percent take 0.012 multiply it by the total number of jobs at some baseline point and we get a number that's 34 000 jobs uh so there's a bounce to the ounce from this thing um we looked at the impact of own death on population mobility there's in-migration uh into the state uh as a direct function of this increase in own death um and we asked the question what kind of you know of those folks moving in do they have jobs we don't we don't have estimates of jobs of immigrants but we know the ratio of of jobs to families and so we throw that number atop the migration number and we get a number like about seven roughly seven thousand jobs so from the governor's point of view um he doubles his own deficit uh bumps up jobs in the state by average state by 34 000 of which his residents um at the time will be uh enjoying a 27 thousand dollar increase in 27 000 uh increase in jobs um what's the cost of all of this 390 times 6 million people in your state it's 2.4 uh billion dollars divided by the 300 or 3 400 uh 34 000 jobs and you get a number 71 800 uh bucks so that's a number it turns out um in in some ways reassuring there's a lot of folks who've been working on this problem um and coming at it from a whole range of different angles we've done what we've done in this one paper and uh and and our macro work and they're all coming in with numbers that look about like that uh so um yeah if there's going to be consensus these you know you run these macro policies it's going to cost you somewhere from a low estimate of 30 to high estimates of bill dupour and his colleague tim connolly of 500 000 bucks but most of them are settling in around 100 to 50 to 100 000 bucks a job uh you know we don't pursue it but the interesting policy question is uh is that good welfare policy or not social policy or not um uh the the second thing to emphasize about the results from from this particular study is the bang for the buck we take the own death and separate it into spending and revenues and the bank or the buck really is coming from the revenue side tax cuts um and uh and not from the spending side which is going to be a result we'll get in the macro uh the macro stuff as well and then and then lastly the impacts are short-lived this is an impulse response function and you get a shock in uh period zero of of the deficit and uh we we find about uh all the action is in the first year um i don't know whether this is reassuring or not but it was certainly interesting to me is a couple of comments about this picture the governor does get a payoff in that first year and and the estimates around 34 000 jobs then there's nothing for the next 10 years and so supply ciders would say gee you invested in infrastructure and that ought to help growth over the long haul and we don't see any evidence that there's a supply side effect in these numbers um and but it to me anyway interestingly is when that debt starts being repaid uh namely 11 years out you lose jobs so it's uh enjoy me now pay me later kind of story and uh politically sure why not let's do it let's be myopic have a great time um and uh you know i've done work on balanced budget rules here's the case for bbrs if you want to um so um the uh the question is uh the spillover side of the story here's california um the uh the the nine percent upward bump is uh uh i'm sorry the 390 upward bump um is about 10 percent of own revenues i'm going to make the case that would make a nice rainy day fund they ought to be shooting for rainy day funds on the order of five to ten percent in case of recessions go ahead and spend it it's money that's sitting in the cash account um so pull it out and spend the stuff um so if you're gonna say is there a case for rainy day funds um here's a number uh ten percent can make these kind of uh impacts it turns out we've done the simulations for all the economic regions the far west region is california arizona nevada oregon washington those are the linked states by the crone neighborhood measures get about 160 000 jobs in california for this at a cost of about 90 000 a job uh the spillovers are pretty sizable to the other five states 108 000 total number of jobs is 267 000 jobs from california's deficit brings the cost down to 53 000 bucks a job uh so why not sit on your hands in arizona and oregon and let california do all the heavy lifting uh and end up paying for the deficit um the question could then be put well let the other states bump up and would california want to sit on its hands and so that's the other part of the experiment we bump it up we have the other five states uh collectively bump up their deficit and california uh gains 43 000 jobs in that instance so you've got a a free rider problem potentially here and the argument is let's think about coordinated coordinated fiscal policy so that's where we go and um uh uh this is basically uh uh aara um as i mentioned um in contrast perhaps to france and uh the scandinavian countries the center government wants the local government to spend more they say spend more and in the u.s you've got to you've got to induce these guys to spend more and they do it through lump sum grants this ap project aid education highways general revenue sharing and the like and um we stick tobacco settlement which was a big program uh in the late 90s a big policy in the late 90s uh and we treat that as federal aid you can argue for why or not why to do that it turns out the results are pretty robust to dropping it but we we put it in there the welfare aid programs are going to be aftc and and medicaid um under aara it's all medicaid aftc became a lump sum grant temporary assistance for needy families so the analysis allows for that um the it turns out that eight federal aid is a pitcher that maybe you can you can see federal aid is growing a lot faster than federal government direct purchases and when you do this macro stuff there are sort of three variables two variables in in the original approach to this stuff revenues and spending government purchases and then the revenues are going to be money and money out transfers to households so unemployment insurance social security medicare all of that is going to be netted out of revenue so you're going to have a net revenue flow when you do this stuff what had gone on in the previous work looking at fiscal policy as it impacts the macroeconomy is to treat federal grants to states as if it were a direct transfer to the household so you netted it out of revenue in for a public finance guy who worries about state local government that seems wrong and what's wrong about it is it it makes the assumption that the household the government sector the state and local government sector is going to behave just as the household sector would like it to behave so the behavioral response to transfers to a governor is going to be the same as a behavioral response as a transfer to me and anybody who has a stake in the game called the flypaper effect uh would probably say no or maybe yes but there it is let's go look at it and see what's going on um so we're going to dissect that and you see the um um the the obama policy uh you know really drives up all this stuff big time uh the thing i'll make a comment about um the revenue uh you see bouncing along is the dash line in the lower picture you know you hit 09 and it falls a bundle um and now that what's going on there there's there's tax cuts uh transfers to households uh but most uh importantly from an empirical uh an analytic point of view there is automatic stabilizers revenues are going down because the economy is going down so you get a big bang downward in revenues now when you do the analysis any of you guys have ventured into macro and i don't recommend it um you got to separate out the automatic stabilizer part from the policy part and that's what the the empirical exercise is trying to do um so we we go ahead and we do the empirical exercise just very quickly there's been a lot of good things done on aara what we i would call impact studies um you know money goes to a county what happened to jobs in the county um the effects uh are it's there uh there's no doubt about it that it's there and uh the estimates are on the order of maybe 70 to 100 000 per job um the problem uh from my point of view with those estimates um though in the end we're going to find out that at least our macro work ends up being probably let you be fairly comfortable with these impact studies is you don't know if the jobs coming into a county are being stolen from the neighboring county so there's you know there's no way of sorting that out so it's an aggregation problem you got to do aggregate work for this and um and then secondly um the timing these guys these previous studies which are all really nicely done um and uh nicely instrumented as one would hope um uh you get a one-year impact so does this stuff linger into years two three and four who knows so that's the point of what we did we our approach is the structural var approach um again if you're a macro guy you probably just turned off your hearing aid and stopped listening to me but i'm going to charge on the pro of that approach from our point of view is we can deal with welfare in that approach that the con is our identification is totally by uh structural assumption uh so there's no good instrument for this stuff and so that that's an issue for this but let me tell you what we get um what are the multipliers like well the first thing i want to stress is this is sort of a a table that i won't ask you to pay attention to but take a look at it we can replicate blanchard and peratti who are the guys who originally crafted this particular approach the important thing is ripping aid out of revenues it turns out to matter a lot and the revenue effect the aid effects around have multipliers on the order of 5.5 the revenue effects now bump up to around 2 and in some cases three multipliers of two and three that's pretty much what the uh the more instrument oriented approaches are finding so ripping aid out turns out to matter a lot uh in this stuff the second thing i'd want to stress is and again taking a look at table four is um what in aid is driving the story it's welfare aid the the thing that in in some ways is most interesting to me is the minus .01 impact multiplier what the hell's going on there we're giving these guys money well policy gets announced what do these guys do they go i'm going to submit a grant and not spend anything until they approve the grant so there's actually a fall in capital spending uh in in the three-month window or four-month eight-month window they're waiting to get their grant graham lake found the same thing and um uh in in a much more detailed micro approach so yeah i find that interesting in the timing sense the welfare effects are really pretty sizable and really quite comparable to the revenue transfers so the idea is give money to people as cash give money to states who are required to give it to people as cash and you get effects the last thing was we went uh and again i won't beat you up with this we went inside um what i would call the black box of the uh of the macro model an estimated estate model and asked the question could we you know if i give you a buck in one way how do you spend it what are the multipliers and what are the implied multipliers for aid if i give you a buck in another way namely welfare how do you spend it what are the implied multipliers for aid so we estimate a state model stick in the multipliers from uh the macro estimates um and do some calculations and and the thing that to me is striking is we can get back uh from the this simulated or rationalized uh state model multiplier we can get back the impact multipliers the one-year multipliers from the macro analysis and the key thing and the key driver of this is the um is the incentive effect of matching aid you end up you give these guys a dollar uh through matching aid um if you're going to spend the dollar i i you only get the dollar if you spend a dollar so some of you spent a dollar then here's a dollar um and and the dollars are going to credit constrained households to a large degree so the argument is that's probably where the impact is um we we did we asked the question how much bang for the buck do you get if you alter the policy mix um we run the var on the uh the innovations of the uh of aara there's a revenue bump up of 45 billion uh spending bump up of 11. notice the spending bump up doesn't occur until 2000 2010 quarter one why because even though the programs were passed in 09 quarter two um why it you had to apply for these things uh and the feds wouldn't sign off on it you didn't get the money and the money didn't go out of the system until your program was actually approved um project aid uh there's something called stability aid this was money sent right away to this town to the states for schools and and then there's the project part of it which is money that they had to apply for so that explains the 210 and then the welfare money went out right away um lump it all together into a revenue bump up and a welfare bump up and you get a 30 improvement in the impact on jobs so targeting this stuff as money to people uh really does does make a big difference so why the heck did washington use this inefficient relatively speaking uh thing called project aid you know shovel ready aid uh and the answer probably not surprisingly is politics they had to get this thing passed so you're going to pass something um there's a wonderful book uh by grunwalt called the new new deal if you guys want to get into the guts of policy trying to decide whether you should leave your academic position and come to washington if you like the book you'll come to washington if you go oh my god who wants to do that for a living you'll stay in academics but it's a wonderful book and uh it's pretty darn clear that all the players orzog and all others uh understood larry understood um we ain't bringing out new programs baby because that's gonna open the pandora's box for these guys to dink around for months maybe years to pass anything we're going to take what's on the books and we're just going to say more and that's what they did and ap project aid was on the books and so that's why it's part of the mix and governors love it give me money uh unconstrained money so it had a lot of political support republicans to two republicans voted for it but that was it um but it really was a political necessity to go with this uh the apa so the end story is um at least from my point of view is three lessons musgrave and oates uh were right uh raises a question why is the eu lagging well they didn't have fiscal policy so if they want to do something they better think about fiscal policy uh and uh uh that means a fiscal union um lesson number two in designing stimulus policy basically what you wanna do is i would argue give money to poor people um and do it through the states that's certainly gonna be true in the eu so they better have a social insurance program good luck on that dimension and lesson number three uh remember that any time you do this it's a democracy and the question is again who can resist thinking about the eu do you want to turn that over to the eu parliament uh not me uh so turn it over to the ministers uh but then you run into that wonderful phrase the democratic deficit um so all of this is great fun i recommend uh others of you who find it interesting to wade into the waters thanks a lot
