okay welcome back everyone uh we're going to start with a conceptual lecture on methods uh i have to say that i've never tried to do this in one hour before so fingers crossed uh i'll try and make it so it doesn't uh uh go uh too fast but uh there's a lot covered so i think everybody uh who who has come to this boot camp is already aware that behavioral economics is increasingly playing a prominent role in economic policy analysis and in policy making and that evaluation what we would call welfare analysis is a critical component of that now the problem of course is that standard welfare economics defers to choice it proceeds based on the principle that if the individual chooses a when b is available that a is better for the individual than b and the question is whether that simple observation makes sense if choices can be inconsistent biased and so forth all the phenomena that we think about in behavioral economics so behavioral welfare economics is critical if we're going to do this sort of policy evaluation because it provides foundations for drawing normative conclusions when you have behavioral agents so this lecture i'm going to go through several topics i'll begin with behavioral critique of standard welfare economics and then turn to solutions what do we do about it so first the critique it's important to start with a clear and shared understanding of what standard welfare economics is about so on this slide i've listed three premises which in some sense are the philosophical foundations for standard welfare economics uh if you read for example daniel houseman's work he's a philosopher he describes standard welfare analysis in in this fashion uh the first premise is that we have coherent preferences which we represent with this standard binary relations symbol and those preferences govern each individual's judgments about their own well-being now technically what we mean by coherent is that the binary relation is well behaved in the sense that it's complete and it's transitive and furthermore it's applicable regardless of context or framing of the judgment okay the second premise is that each individual is the best judge of their own well-being and the justifications from that are familiar from philosophy first of all there are standard arguments for self-determination in the tradition of classical liberalism my own judgments about my own life are paramount because after all it is my life second there is the cartesian principle that experience is inherently private and not directly observable by others and consequently i am the only expert on my own subjective experience and that's why my judgments about myself require deference the implication of this premise is that this binary relation is normative that it isn't simply a description of how the person judges it is a description of how we will make judgments about whether the individual is better off or worse off and then the final premise is that each individual's preferences determine their choices when they choose they seek and achieve the greatest benefit according to their own judgment subject to whatever constraints they face and formally what we mean here is that from any choice set the consumer will select a maximal element under this binary preference relation and it follows from that that the binary preference relation is discoverable from choices and therefore if we look at choices we can figure something out about those individuals that individual's judgments which exist according to the first premise and we defer to that according to the second premise all right now let's turn to critiques there are two main classes of critiques of this uh of this uh paradigm that come from behavioral economics and they fall into these categories the first are what i call implementation critiques so as you know hunt has already talked about it essential theme of behavioral economics and psychology is that people often have difficulty making choices that advance their objectives examples of that people may hold biased beliefs they may engage in motivated reasoning they may be inattentive they may misunderstand principles that govern the relationship between their choices and the outcomes that follow they may rely on heuristics and they may act in ways that undermine their own objectives these all should be understood as challenges to premise three which is the implementation premise and that's why i call them implementation critiques these critiques say well maybe we do have these preferences but they don't find our their way into our choices okay then equally important but i think has gotten less attention uh in the behavioral public economics literature are what i call coherence critiques and coherence critiques point to certain findings in behavioral economics and psychology that suggests that people don't actually have coherent preferences to begin with and this is in some sense a more fundamental critique it is a critique of premise one the premise that says that there are these objects that they exist and that therefore we're going to look for a way to discover them this these critiques call that into question now you could have coherence critiques to take the form of saying well we don't believe that preferences are trans maybe they're acyclic instead of transitive that i think is not really what we primarily have in mind here there is a fundamental coherence critique that says that people don't actually have preferences that they can access when they make judgments when they make decisions that instead what they do is construct their preferences and they do so contextually so this is known in psychology as the the constructed preference hypothesis and this reference here is to a book edited by liechtenstein and slovic that has a series of uh uh of uh essays on this issue but let me break it apart a little bit to explain more clearly what this is about the idea is that as we go through life we have experiences we have sensations they are highly disaggregated we have them at different moments of time in different states of nature at a single moment in time we may be experiencing multiple different kinds of sensations some of the time we are called upon to make an aggregate judgment about all of these things for example we might be called upon to make a choice or someone might ask us how are you feeling overall or what is the satisfaction you derive from your life now the the idea of this hypothesis is that you can't make those judgments by consulting your true preferences or by consulting your aggregate experienced utility because those things simply don't exist what we have is disaggregated experience so instead what we do is construct our aggregate judgment separately within each context and the context of construction can influence the aggregation process by influencing the weights that we attach to different dimensions of our experience so for example the context may make certain dimensions of our experience more salient and then in constructing our judgments we may attach more weight to those dimensions so under this view there is no true preference there are simply constructed references which depend upon the context in which i constructed them which is why i now write that binary relation with a little subscript f f stands for frame your preferences now simply depend upon the frame in which you're acting they aren't right or wrong you simply have different preferences in different situations what's the evidence for the constructed preference hypothesis well the the evidence that people point to are situations in which people's decisions depend on the framing of their choices the choice problems that they face and where those frames don't plausibly enter into their preferences where they're they're they just seem to be things that the person wouldn't care about or wouldn't confuse them okay a good example is the phenomenon of anchoring and coherent arbitrariness and i've given the reference here to a paper by ariely lowenstein and prelik they do a type of experiment that others have done i'll give an example in this experiment a subject is given an opportunity to buy an object let's say a nice bottle of wine and the first stage of the experiment they're asked to write down the last two digits of their social security number so i would write down eight six and then the first task is do you want to buy the bottle of wine for that dollar amount for me 86 and i answered yes or no so uh oh battery is running low what do we do about that there is we have now just unplug it i don't know whether that did it if we suddenly just uh lose power we'll have to regroup um okay uh now i've i've lost my train let's see where were we oh okay so i'm talking about ariely lowenstein and prelik the second stage of the experiment is um an incentive incentive compatible elicitation of the willingness to pay for the bottle of wine and what they find in these kinds of experiments is that the last two digits of your social security number is then correlated with the amount that you're willing to pay for the wine and very strongly correlated and the interpretation of this is well you've manipulated the framing of the problem in a way that has impacted the construction of the judgment that basically what's going on here is the last two digits of your social security number become an anchor for constructing your judgment you start to think of value in terms of that amount and you construct your judgment from that another set of examples involves decisions with no immediate consequences that are sensitive to the weather at the time of choice i've given two examples here one involving automobile purchases whether you buy convertibles on a sunny day the other is about voting so think about voting you're going to vote the person won't take office for months or more so the weather on the day that you're voting should have no connection with the outcomes and it's not that plausible to say that the weather is affecting either your understanding of the choice or somehow your experience of choosing matters depending upon the weather it's more plausible to think that the weather is somehow affecting the salience of different aspects of experience now of course cleanly differentiating the sort of context dependent preferences from context dependent implementation problems that is frame does affect your understanding uh the accuracy of your understanding that is very difficult but there are papers in the literature that at least point in this direction okay now in principle one could also envision a third class of critiques which i might call judgment critiques which you know so far we've talked about critiques of the first premise and the third premise this would be a critique of the second premise it would assert that people just have bad objectives and so we shouldn't defer to them if there are foundations for such critiques they're not going to be found in behavioral economics because in claiming that someone has bad objectives you're just expressing a difference of opinion so on close examination when people make critiques that sound like judgment critiques they're usually implementation critiques and i've given an example here so you often see the claim that people are too present focused which sounds like a judgment critique right but the claim is actually that people with preferences suffer from self-control and cause them to act on which you may recognize is the standard delta model where beta is less than one you're just discounting the entire future by some factor whenever what at any point in time okay in other words implementation critique not a judgment critique all right if you agree with with me and with us that uh there are some you know very serious critiques here that we we need to do something about then that will require redesigning welfare economics how do we do that there are two competing paths main computing paths there are actually more but um two main competing paths that we could follow the first is to try to fix choice-based welfare analysis and the second is to discard choice-based welfare economics in favor of doing something like subjective well-being which i abbreviate swb in other words to use measures of well-being like self-reported happiness or life satisfaction it's important to recognize that those two approaches are trying to measure different things that they are proceeding from different philosophical traditions that involve different definitions of welfare they are not measuring the same thing okay self-reported well-being draws on a school of philosophical thought called welfare hedonism you you can describe the main the main principle of welfare hedonism as follows well-being consists solely in the presence of pleasure in the absence of pain in economics we associate this view most prominently with jeremy bentham who viewed pleasure and pain as a single aggregate but it's also associated with john stuart mill who actually disagreed with bentham because mill didn't think that there was an aggregate sensation mill's view was closer to a philosophical tradition known as mental statism which simply says and you know there are [Music] [Music] um those are incorrect [Music] fantastic unless somebody [Music] um [Music] um [Music] is that they are [Music] so that's another approach [Music] um [Music] um right and that's that's getting into one of the other challenges to um uh to uh yeah we'll touch on this endogenous preferences is a challenge to standard welfare economics endogenous preferences is also an issue that i've been working on and i have a current project on how to do welfare analysis with endogenous preferences where they're you know driven you know by social context and things like that um but uh those are all challenging issues okay um let me pick up where i left off um so uh i talked about social wealth subjective well-being drawing on the philosophical tradition of welfare hedonism choice-oriented approaches draw on what's called desire theory or sometimes preference theory the the main principle being that well-being consists in having one's desires satisfied now what that means is that the actual state of the world is what the individual wants it to be and not whether the individual necessarily knows that to be true okay there is a subtle variant of desire theory that says that the actual state of the world includes my mental state so i may care about my mental states and if i care about my mental states then my mental states matter for welfare and you can kind of get back to welfare hedonism let me give an example of this because it's all a little abstract the traditions that i just described talking about their differences are important because they diverge in con in contexts that are important to behavioral economics in particular situations where people hold false beliefs and or belief-based utility okay so uh this is a parable that i like to give which i call the case of the oblivious altruist there's a small town in arkansas that experiences massive flooding that leaves many families homeless norman and by the way all my examples everybody is either named norman or norma and the reason is this is normative analysis i know groan really that's a growner i know so norman is altruistic and he would contribute a hundred dollars to a relief fund if he knew about it okay the government provides relief and they pay for it with taxes and those taxes include 100 levy on norman norman never learns about the flood or the relief effort and by the way he absolutely hates paying taxes okay so norman has has false beliefs now does the relief effort improve or reduce norman's well-being so if you are a welfare hedonist you have to believe that this reduces his well-being why he doesn't know about the relief effort all he knows is that he's paying taxes and he hates paying taxes so his subjective well-being has declined all right what about simple desire theory which simply says does the world conform to the way you want it to be well norman there's if there is a need so his desires are being satisfied and therefore under simple desire theory he's better off what about under the subtle version of desire theory well under that version it's not clear he could be better off or he could be worse off the reason is norman might have a preference for living in a world where these sorts of needs are addressed by the government regardless of whether or not he knows about it in which case this makes him better off he might also have a preference for living in a world that addresses these needs only if he knows about it in which case he's worse off okay now if you look at those uh implications i think a lot of people have trouble with the implications of welfare hedonism for that example uh subjective well-being encounters other conceptual problems uh an example is what i call the aggregation problem i've already said that mental states are disaggregated over time across states of nature and so forth arguably there is no aggregate of mental state and if we pursued this approach we would therefore need a principle of aggregation where that principle would not be based on mental states it would have to be based on something else because the aggregate is not under my hypothesis a mental state so what is uh subjective well-being what does it do well it resorts to linguistic principles of aggregation in other words it asks someone to question how happy you are and when you answer that question you will aggregate over the dimensions of your well-being according to your understanding of the definition of the word happiness and that definition could differ from person from person to person depending upon how they learn the word when they're growing up okay that aggregation principle has no has has very little normative force so the lecture here is going to focus on choice-based approaches i'm going to turn now just beginning with what i call behavioral reveal preference and this is the approach that i think economists are generally attracted to first so what's the basic strategy well many economists are reluctant to really to relinquish either the first two uh premises either the assumption that people have coherent preferences or the normative victim uh that preferences ought to govern welfare analysis however they credit the implementation critiques so they're willing to accept a relaxed version of premise three in other words a connection between preferences and choices that is imperfect okay so the modeling strategy then becomes to supplement standard models of choice with additional elements that represent cognitive biases that purportedly account for the imperfections that we're observing in choices the approach consists of several pieces first we assume that there is the utility function that rationalizes choices and you can see i write it as u of x which is the item that you're selecting in f the choice frame so you can have frame dependent choices this is sometimes called decision utility or exante utility a term that i hate for reasons that i will explain uh shortly um the next component is that we evaluate welfare according to a normative objective function which we'll write as v and v will only depend upon the thing that's chosen it won't depend upon the frame the frame is assumed to be outside of the scope of the consumer's concerns then loosely the difference between these two objects which i'll read as little b reflects bias now why do i say loosely i say loosely because as i think everybody here should know from their first year of study in graduate school to monotone transformation make that difference whatever i want when i say difference between them i mean ordinal differences between those two functions which i've just used that as shorthand now this approach invokes a principle which basically says that if enough is known about the process that maps preferences to choices in other words about the bias function if we know something about that bias function then we can recover both preferences and bias parameters from choice data so this is a direct extension of revealed preference which is why it's so attractive to many economists now you will notice that this approach does nothing about coherence critiques it's assuming that people have [Music] there's no room for the coherence critique in this and as you'll see that gets it into conceptual trouble okay so um this approach faces a number of challenges i'm going to run through them the first is the challenge of specifying the consumer's concerns what's part of the consumption bundle what's the frame the second is the challenge of identifying biases how do we recover information about that bias function and the third is something that i call the inflexible consistency requirement i'll explain that when we get to it let's start with the first of these the challenge of specifying the scope of consumers concerns here's a motivating illustration which i call norman's lunch suppose we ask norman to order his lunch for a scheduled meeting one week in advance and whether he selects a sandwich or a salad depends on whether he's asked at 1 pm right after he's eaten lunch or at 4 p.m late in the afternoon when he's hungry this is actually based on an experiment in psychology by reed and vanderbilt okay so here the natural assumption is that the domain of preferences encompasses food items that's what the individual cares about intrinsically and the time at which norman makes his choice is the frame which we which we write as f and that maybe that influences construction of judgments maybe his hunger makes things more or less salient or alternatively it may distort the expression of those judgments into choices it may disrupt disrupt his cognition he may have trouble thinking when he's hungry okay um so you'll notice that this factor has another identification the interpretation is that norman's well-being depends not only on the food that he eats but also on what he orders and when he orders it and under that assumption a consumption bundle consists of bundles specifying both orders and meals and there are no decision frames it's another interpretation of what's going on here now that second interpretation actually suggests uh a variant of the behavioral reveal preference approach where what the analyst does is simply expand the scope of consumers concerns to the point where all of the inconsistencies vanish and where we can rationalize choices and then proceed as if there are no biases so an example of that would be google and pessendorf's notion of temptation preferences which account for apparently time inconsistent choice reversals without assuming time inconsistency by assuming instead that people care about the set from which they are making a choice as well as the option that they select from the set okay we'll return to that in a minute because two issues arise the first is okay we need some sort of objective method for drawing lines between decision frames and the elements of consumption bundles and then the second issue is that depending upon how we draw this line choice-based welfare analysis may become impossible okay so um issue number one of those methods for drawing the line between decision frames and consumption bundles um formal methods for doing this remain underdeveloped this is something that people generally wing in applications all right so possible options are you can ask people what you can identify conditions that affect choice through channels that appear to be other than preferences okay for example channels where you can demonstrate that a frame is causing confusion about options okay that is showing something other than preferences is going on but it's very difficult to draw this line so i just want to flag this as something that needs more attention we don't have all the answers yeah the second issue that i mentioned is that drawing the line in certain ways may preclude choice-based welfare analysis and this is this thing called the non-comparability problem which i actually talked about uh earlier this morning i mentioned it as well and it says that if the experience of choosing falls within the scope of consumers concerns then welfare is not recoverable from choice okay let me give you a broad conceptualization of why this problem arises so choice-based welfare economics is making prescriptions for a new planner by asking what an affected consumer would choose if they were offered the same alternatives okay now in situations where consumers concerns encompass the experience of choosing the planner's task if they were to make the choice and the consumer's task if they were the mit to make the choice are inherently non-competent the reason is that presenting the planner and the consumer with ostensibly the same menu does not mean that the alternatives when they are correctly defined are actually the same if if the act of choosing is within the consumer's consumption to just give an example of that if norma's well-being depends not only on what she chooses but on what she personally chooses to forgo because of temptation for example then her choices can't shed light on the best choice for a planner because she personally chooses to forego nothing when the planner makes the choice okay here's a simple illustration of how you can run problems in in settings that seem you know not not not esoteric at all very natural kinds of situations norma has to divide ten dollars between herself and a friend she's averse to bearing responsibility for leaving her friend with nothing when other choices are available and therefore no matter how the choice is framed she defies the money equally okay even if she were asked to decide between letting somebody else make the choice where they she knows that they're going to give her the entire pie okay or making the choice herself she's still responsible if she hands off the decision to someone who she knows is going to give her the entire prize there's no way to avoid it so we're going to assume that she's inherently selfish and fervently wishes someone would take the decision out of her hand and give her the entire prize but there is simply no way to pose a choice problem that would reveal that preference because any choice problem that gives her the option between these two alternatives is one that makes her responsible for the outcome and therefore she'll choose a path that ends up with equal division okay so how can we avoid the non-comparability problem well the first alternative is to assume it away and that's actually the first two points that that i've listed here you could assume that consumers concerns just don't encompass conditions pertaining specifically to the experience of choosing that is conditions of choice as opposed to conditions of subsequent experience maybe we can live with the assumption that while people may have some emotional experience from choosing it's not very large compared to the consequences that they experience later on so maybe as an approximation we could accept such an assumption we could also make a possibility is to assume that the consumer only cares about the conditions of choice under well-defined circumstances does with temptation preferences um the final thing that one can do and this is work in progress uh that i'm doing with demetri and with one of our participants christy kim christie is somewhere here um i can't spot people with the masks on i'm sorry um is to define [Music] mental states that is to stop thinking about the options that people pick and start thinking about the mental states that choice problems induce and to treat those as consumption bundles and we are arguing in this paper that that is still in progress that this does provide a way around uh the non-comparability problem but not enough time to go into that okay let me turn to the second problem the second challenge which is the challenge of identifying biases so implementation requires the analyst to recover not only you which is decision utility you can get that through standard methods it also requires them to recover v the normative objective function so to do so we have to have a clear understanding of what v is to measure something you have to know what you're measuring so what exactly is v when you look at the literature there are kind of three different ideas of v floating around one is that v represents experienced utility or exposed utility the second is that it represents true preferences and the third is that it's just another kind of decision utility so i'm going to run through these and ultimately argue that three is really the only coherent way to think about this okay let's start with first interpretation that v is experienced or x post utility that's gained a lot of traction for example raj chetty talks about this interpretation in his eli lecture but it's conceptually problematic so in the first place the interpretation confuses welfare perspectives it appears to be slipping into welfare hedonism by equating welfare with exposed hedonic experience which needn't be the case in desire theory i mean remember the the case of the oblivious altruist uh where you wouldn't experience uh whatever well-being norman uh is deriving from that situation he doesn't experience it um so a couple of problems with this interpretation the first of all the assumption that people derive welfare only from experience is limiting because it excludes non-experiential objectives the example that i just pointed to uh the second problem is that there are natural and important settings in which experience can't plausibly include the aggregate welfare evaluation v the v just can't be something that you experience okay so think about um uh expected utility um in expected utility v is e of u it is the expectation of the utility function even if you think you experience the realizations of you you don't experience the expected value of that that never happens okay that is an aggregator that is not part of your uh hedonic experience so it's never experienced you can't refer to that as experienced utility similarly aggregation over time same thing i mean we think of people of having hedonic sensations at each point in time so you know where is the single aggregate experience the intertemporal aggregators is a construct that's imposed on top of those experiences the second interpretation is that and that a bias choice is one that's contrary to true preferences that's a common view that you hear a lot and it doesn't have the same conceptual problem as the first interpretation because you and v are at least the same kinds of objects they're both ex-ante desires but the question here is how would you learn what true preferences are in applications what makes a preference true what is the the inherent defining characteristic of truthiness okay so the dominant approach implicitly that there's a decision frame for which bias is absent this bias function is equal is just a form of decision utility in other words it is a utility function that choices and that's actually how we end up implementing this in most cases so let me give an example of this and talk about biased beliefs for a minute here i think the existence of frames for which bias is absent is an implicit assumption that people often don't make extras [Music] [Music] uh what is that about well it's actually based on it that substitution is based on an implicit assumption that is testable that in a setting [Music] um there is a frame [Music] okay now you'll notice you'll notice that using this is okay now unfortunately this third interpretation introduces a circularity trap and think about it this way we're now identifying bias by looking for choices that conflict with true preferences and we're inferring true preferences from choices that are not biased because we're doing a revealed preference exercise so where does this start okay so a key challenge in behavioral welfare economics is to try and find an escape route from that trap way of identifying biases without reference to preference mythological principle in practical applications uh identifying which choices are the biased ones can be extremely challenging think about norman's lunch does hunger cloud his judgment or does it focus his attention think about the examples that i gave where framing involves weather does rain cause irrational depression or does sun cause irrational exuberance if you're going to say that there's a bias here you've got to you have to ask these questions okay let me give you a more consequential example one that comes up all the time how should we evaluate time inconsistent behavior that you see all the time in the literature is that unbiased choices are the choices that we make in period zero with full commitment okay those are the ones that are only governed by delta and not by beta full commitment choices so that's known as the long run criteria ignore beta just discount by delta and that reflects this supposition that present focus is actually present bias that it is a bias and the question that you need to ask yourself is what principles and or evidence support that respect how are we reaching that conclusion and i'm not saying it's wrong i'm just throwing out a few observations to make it clear that this is not something that's obvious all right herded views of present focus are not universal zen buddhism teaches that we ought to learn to live in the moment second when you study deathbed regrets what people most commonly regret on their deathbed is that they didn't spend enough time with their friends and family enjoying life and living in the moment you don't find people saying oh my god you know so the question i might ask mainly to tweak some of my colleagues uh the criterion is a reflection of what i call type 8 paternalism and what i mean by that is you've got a bunch of very successful economists and psychologists who are type a personalities they work all the time and so they think other people would be better off if they did the same thing okay now maybe that's right but how do we justify it formally okay uh so now we come to the rigid consistency requirement the point here is that behavioral revealed preference requires the analyst to identify biases so that what's left the unbiased choices it meant a coherent preference representation technically that they satisfy the weak axiom of revealed preference and that requirement actually precludes the development of objective and rigorous standards and methods for identifying biases why do i say that well if we just go ahead the situation where the remaining choices are not internally consistent uh and indeed i think if you accept the coherence critique then there's no hope [Music] okay instead what this requirement does is force you to make assumptions about bias the first of all lack objective support and exceed your understanding of the actual choice processes um so uh recall the example of go back to that question which type of weather causes a bias you might develop an objective criterion for identifying biases and and look at that problem and say well i don't think that either of those choices is identifiably a bias this approach says can't do that you have to go back and declare one of those things a bias you don't have a choice in norman's lunch same thing one o'clock versus four o'clock you have to declare one of those things a bias even if you don't have a foundation for doing okay um so uh you know that's the consequence of ignoring the coherence critique the coherence critique says you know in those situations neither of those choices may be biased and you may just have to live with that so that brings us to the general framework for behavioral welfare economics how then should we proceed if we want to find a way around this problem um well let's go back to the foundations here were the three premises of welfare economics we can ask how should we reformulate those promises in light of both the implementation critique [Music] and this is all going to follow the work that i've done um so here to make progress we're going to distinguish between what i'll call direct judgments and indirect judgments direct judgments pertain to outcomes that we care about for their own sake and indirect judgments pertain to alternatives that can lead to those outcomes so making judgments about a financial instrument for example that's an indirect judgment because we don't care about the instrument directly we care about what it delivers most fundamentally if i make direct judgment if i make judgments about my mental states those are direct judgments but indirect judgments may pertain to consumption goods that influence those mental states now neither category of behavioral critique impugns direct judgments or therefore by implication correctly understood indirect judgments uh if you claim that a direct judgment is flawed well that's just the judgment critique it's just the difference of opinion if you claim that there's some variation in direct judgments and that means maybe that you shouldn't defer to the judgments well that doesn't really address the basis for deference to give an example if you had a panel of experts and the panel of experts didn't all see eye to eye would you say well let's completely ignore expert opinion entirely well no you'd probably still say let's try and find what the experts agree on right so here an individual under different frames making different choices is kind of like a panel of experts on their subjective well-being there's no reason not to defer okay so with that in mind i propose the following two premises the first is that with respect to matters involving either direct judgment or correctly understood indirect judgment each individual is the best orbiter of their well-being and then the second is that when people choose they seek the greatest benefit according to their own judgment whether correctly or incorrectly informed subject again to whatever constraints they face so you can see that this accommodates coherence critiques because there's no requirement here that direct and correctly understood indirect judgments are mutually consistent indeed there's no mention of preferences at all okay so how do we apply this the scope of consumers concerns the second step is to identify all decisions that merit deference and i refer to this as the welfare relevant domain so premise b tells us that choices reflect judgments so what we're doing in the second step is to retain or exclude them according to whether the judgments are correctly or incorrectly understood that's the objective in in step two and that's step three constructing a welfare criterion based on the properties of choice within the welfare relevant domain and credit [Music] based on the first promise all right so this is closely related to behavioral revealed preference you can think of behavioral reveal preference as involving similar steps except we're requiring their consistency of choices after step two so that we can conduct a standard revealed preference exercise in step three and the key to the general framework is to devise a welfare criterion for the third step that accommodates inconsistencies among choices the choices that merit deficits okay so that we're allowing for the coherence fatigue if we can do let's fall were they may [Music] um okay uh so what i'm gonna talk about here [Music] the question is how do we accommodate the inconsistencies among judgments that merit deference which under the coherence critique we're pretty sure we're gonna find okay let me do step three first solve step three as i said well then you're freed up to do whatever makes sense in step two if we manage to come up with something that accommodates any inconsistency so we define a welfare criterion as a binary relation w just x w y means that the individual is better off with x than y [Music] choice-based welfare relationship satisfy what is [Music] a little bit harder to understand its consistency with the welfare relevant domain just says that if x is chosen in some decision uh problem within the opportunity within the opportunities set at [Music] because if you said that you'd be saying that choosing is a mistake because it can be improved [Music] okay so um a natural candidate here is to use something called the unambiguous choice relation which just says that x is unambiguously better than y xp star y if and only if within the welfare relevant domain there's no decision problem where x is available but where the consumer chooses y um now this accommodates that are associated with coherence fatigue it simply means that keystrokes in this relationship means that we are admitting normative so that's what we're going to do they're simply going to live with a degree of ambiguity in our welfare judgments so there's a theorem uh binary relations satisfying those three problems so the implication is that if you accept those three properties it's the only game in town this is how you have to do choice-based welfare analysis okay uh the application is fairly straightforward so a simple example is that depending on framing norman always chooses a mug over four dollars and always chooses five dollars over a month but between four dollars and five dollars his decision is frame dependent so in that case what you would say is that the equivalent variation of giving norman a mug is between four dollars and five dollars now to be clear you're not saying it is an unknown value between four dollars and five dollars on the contrary you're simply saying that there is normative ambiguity that you know it is uh there is it is defined as a range rather than as a point um tools for aggregation aggregate equivalent variation compensating variation um uh because of time i'm not going to uh go through this in detail but this is a picture just to show [Music] uh um [Music] yes you can do all the standard tools of welfare analysis um generalized to this framework you can do all of the same things basically with an incomplete relation that okay so this shows the range of normative ambiguity that you would get from that okay so now go back to step two and i i'm almost done uh because i'm going to hand this topic off to hunt but this is identifying the welfare relevant domain so our objective in step two is to identify and remove choices that reflect incorrectly informed indirect judgments okay because if it's a correctly informed indirect judgment we defer to that so an incorrectly informed indirect judgment is one where the decision maker mischaracterizes either the available actions or their consequences a phenomenon that we refer to as characterization failure it's the mischaracterized the decision problem and the way this approach is by referencing aspects is can be circularity [Music] so here are the general strategies for identifying characterization failure that will elaborate on one is to investigate whether for a given class of decision problems people make correct inferences about available actions and their consequences okay what are what do people think the consequences of their action what do they think they're going to be if they're wrong then there's characterization failure for that problem the second is to investigate people are equipped to make correct inferences about the available actions and their consequences instead of looking at the inferences let's ask whether they have all the tools in place for making those inferences tools and information so deploy cognitive processes involving attention memory forecasting and so forth as would be required to infer options and consequences correctly and then my final slide is just an observation that it could turn out that step two yields a welfare relevant domain that's just right in the sense that it's both comprehensive and internally consistent rather than too large in other words one that still contains inconsistencies and in that case he star simply specializes to reveal preference okay and then we arrived think of as a true generalization of behavioral revealed preference if you're practicing behavioral reveal preference you're making about decisions about how that framework still yields interesting conclusions policy conclusions okay i know i went long partly because of the disruption but that's it for um yeah that's it for our first lecture so
