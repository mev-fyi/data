[Applause] thank you i'd now like to hand over to the first of our author professor brian wright from the university of california at berkeley professor wright thank you well thanks very much first of all i'd like to thank rebecca and richard and the nba for asking me to come and talk about agriculture today and as steve coonham was talking i was thinking if this were 1965 you'd probably be addressed by eminent academics different ones including probably paul ehrlich and garrett hardin who would tell you that the challenges faced by agriculture in the next 20 years are so severe that we have to give up on the idea of actually feeding the existing populations of china and india bangladesh we have to use lifeboat economics and we just need to be realistic that technological change isn't going to be large enough to outrun the malthusian [Music] logic of increasing population versus a lesser increase in food supply we know that didn't happen and we know it so well that we've actually forgotten it and so i think it's appropriate to think about what's been going on in agricultural research what's been going right and some threats that agriculture faces now that may also be relevant to energy research so the history of agricultural research in the united states is a history of incredibly large rates of return and so you can say two things about that one is that there's been almost a constant increase in food supply outrunning increases in demand domestically that um light blue line on that graph is output the inputs are the pink line and you can see they're a very different trajectory so that's been a history of success rates of return have been in the range of 40 or 50 percent and that's impressive an economist would say that indicates highly effective research systems and not enough investment because that margin rate of return is too high there should have been more dollars in that enterprise the output has been better nutrition longer life expectancy not just in the united states but similar enterprises have succeeded around the world benefit cost ratios measured at realistic cost of capital for the government are in the range of 32 nationally about 21 on a statewide basis which is relevant because much of the research is done at the state level managed at the state level partly federally funded and 11 times this benefit cost ratio about 11 to 1 of the spillovers between states so that's one reason why the federal government subsidizes the states because the states don't have the right incentive to do all the research a lot of the externalities exist between the states and indeed between nations also but the time lag between when the investment is done and when the return peaks is about as much as 24 years this means to have an effective system you need to have effective persistent attention to this problem through the ups and downs of the economy and that's a lesson which i think energy can learn from the history of agriculture and agriculture also needs to relearn itself the geographic dispersion of agriculture depends upon the geographic dispersion of the environment and that's something else that many forms of energy research now face also you can only have wind energy in certain places you can only do cellulosic in certain places and so many of the energy enterprise researchers will be very like the agricultural research needs of dispersed environmental technologies another interesting factor about agriculture which might be somewhat true of energy in the coming years is it's been uniquely dispersed across nations this pie chart here is not a old ban the bomb sign this is actually a pie chart showing the shares of developed country public research expenditure developed country private research expenditure and less developed country expenditure and what you'll notice is less developed country expenditure is a third of this about matching public and private research in developed countries all of that less developed country research is public and half of the developed country research is also so you're going to have partners in the agriculture game in the future and i think energy will look more like this in 20 years than it does now you can see these are just some figures i won't dwell on about the research intensities of different less developed countries and developed countries developed countries have a research intensity about 2.64 percent of agricultural output goes to research brazil has 1.4 and brazil is an amazingly flexible and dynamic actor in this area china is another one the the ratio of expenditure to output here is low not because the expenditure is low but because the output is increasing so fast and it's being so effective india also is doing quite well in this area and all lest valve countries have even higher research to output ratios than china and india even though they dominate less developed country research expenditure because of their large populations now unfortunately energy and agriculture share another phenomenon recently especially and that is that recently the research expenditures tend to fluctuate with the prices of oil and of food so that and also when the needs don't appear so great attention gets diverted i think too much to secondary issues and i think that's true in both our sectors but on the other hand it's also true steve has emphasized that you need that continued political support i'll just um skip this one but you'll notice that the most important international research is done by the consumptive group on international energy research in national agriculture research and that expenditure which is expended to determine by many nations and other non-profit groups tends also to not only fluctuate with the apparent short-term needs in the agricultural sector but it tends to get too easily diverted from the fundamental need to focus on production increase and productivity in the main in the main food supply areas i think rebecca has mentioned and richard and also that research enterprise has a number of different parts making it linear is an oversimplification but it's a good simplification you need basic research going through technology invention innovation products and then you need the diffusion into the users and those are very different activities and then a different kinds of research enterprise it tends to be true that what's on the left is better done by public sector or non-profit sector by universities the intermediate to basically a mix of public and private and dissemination of technologies to final users has been proven to be much better done where it's feasible by the private sector so we need this mix of different actors and getting that mix right is a real challenge involving not only cooperation cooperation of the private sector but also effective political [Music] communication on a sustained basis privatization has preceded especially the united states in agricultural research very fast since 1980 in 1980 two things happened intellectual property rights became strengthened and the biotech revolution started at the same time and genes turned out to be patentable so all of those things gave very strong incentive for the private sector to be involved in certain parts of agriculture research and as i've just pointed out the private sector has about half of total research in the united states in agriculture but don't let that fact make you imagine that the private sector has taken over what the public sector originally did effectively i'd say both private and public actors now would agree that they've learned more about the appropriate roles of the other in this enterprise and they're both very important president obama gave a speech recently where he said we have also have to strengthen our commitment to research including basic research which has been badly neglected for decades the fact is though the basic research doesn't always pay off immediately it may may not pay off for years when it does the rewards are often broadly shared that's why the private sector generally under invests in basic science that's why the public sector must invest instead while the risks have been large so are the rewards and i think that's been shown to be true in agriculture it raises an important question that's why the public sector must invest instead and the key question is can the public sector still support the necessary persistent commitment in agriculture or energy to get the job done through the ups and downs the will occur in prices the international political scares and the other things that tend to distract attention in agriculture the current success i think reflects political genius in the last century i don't know whether it was deliberate genius or the better kind which is serendipity but the hatch act and the moral act established with sustained federal funding sources in the form of land and other other sources dispersed politically supported and somewhat competitive research enterprises in all the states of the nation and this was in a way a reflection of what had happened in germany germany before germany was formed as a nation where different german states founded by research from universities in chemicals and fertilizers actually had established a large number of experiment stations competing with each other and when germany became a nation in the 1870s there are about 20 experiment stations existing on this competitive local model and that really became consciously or not a model for the land-grant system in the united states and the land-grant system of course had a permanent political and economic base which allowed consistent expenditure on education and research over a large number of years which didn't really pay off for about 30 or 40 years in a way that was readily observable but ever since it's been paying off in spades now it's under attack but i think we should learn from the kind of persistence that was founded on this political and uh dispersed public sector competitive model i think i'll skip that so just move to my conclusions my first conclusion is that private firms have shown motivated by intellectual property rights that they're efficient and very fast actually at developing promoting and disseminating commercial technology packages to consumers or to farmers in this case this might have come to some extent at the expense of small firm entry it was kind of a one-shot deal we had lots of entry in this originally when there weren't any intellectual property rights it's not so clear whether this can be sustained as a model so effectively unless we pay careful attention to the design of intellectual property policy secondly the need for local adaptive technology where it occurs should motivate dispersed research enterprises that can then compete with each other to some extent upstream research will probably be the province more of public sector and non-profits in both agriculture and in energy if it's going to be really effective we're still learning how to do public private partnerships we're learning that at berkeley with the ebi a half billion dollar partnership between a national lab two universities and bp where steve used to work and steve had a hand in that it'll be very interesting to see how that succeeds or fails in providing effective cellulosic technology the question whether this kind of sustained attention that we need decade by decade not minute by minute or day by day is really feasible in the current political environment and that's something that other social scientists i think should pay careful attention to thanks very much i look forward to hearing the rest of the day [Applause] uh my name is dave tardis and i work at usda uh i i read with a lot of interest your paper i have a couple reservations about it because it's like you have a nice anecdotal story about how farmers went to low-till farming but i think part of the big picture that you're missing in the paper is the tremendous strides that agriculture made in energy conservation over a long period of time not just in terms of how it got to be more productive i mean you imply that but you'd be nice for you to sort of make that a more central piece of what you got that's a really interesting comment of course agriculture was the original user of biofuels a large amount of the especially in the earlier part of the century a large amount of the progress that was made in agriculture was freeing up all those fields that used to be used to feed the horses that pulled the plows and that's a very interesting story so when people talk about introducing bioenergy into the united states they really should be talking about reintroducing and a lot of that was agriculture that's a good point thank you very much okay i'd like to introduce professor ashish aurora from carnegie mellon university from duke oh sorry from duke university who will be talking about the chemical industry and i'm looking for your slide here you're here right maybe lessons that's lessons from the internet no accelerating is the end of it how about this one yes got it there we go good morning thank you very much as rebecca's introduction indicated i've recently changed employers right so the chemical industry and i'm mostly going to be talking about the from the history of the industry rather than the more recent developments but i think it i hope you'll you'll see that it's it's of use the first thing to note is the chemical industry grew came of age at a very different time when when large-scale government involvement in the economy was was definitely the exception rather than the norm um despite that and in in this sense it's it's sort of an exception to what brian just said if you see this is the chart from 1971 nsf figures this is the share in of basic it shows you two things and i'll summarize what it shows in the interest of time it shows that the chemical industry was extremely r d intensive and it funded most of this research through private dollars okay so at this point we could sort of since this is about mostly about public policy we might want to stop and say well there's not not a great deal to be learned but in fact i would submit to you there are some very interesting things that we can learn from this there is one prominent instance where the government intervened very heavily in in innovation and this was the synthetic rubber project during the second world war around 1941 there's about 10 000 tons of synthetic rubber being produced in america and there's this very real fear that america will be cut off from from the supplies of natural rubber so the primary objective in some ways resembling well not with the same we don't quite have the same urgency but there's the sense that we needed to increase at that time there was a very clear sense that we needed to increase the supplies of of production of synthetic rubber there was a public private academic partnership set up lots of uh firms were involved in this both rubber farms petrochemical firms uh university departments um and this was then extended after world war ii this program in some ways was a smashing success so the output of synthetic rubber increased 85 times which isn't quite incredible seven times peak german production and mind you this was using german technology this technology essentially had been was was ready for prime time this was the butadiene styrene technology so it succeeded in its primary objective which was to increase the supplies of synthetic rubber it had a couple of subsidiary objectives uh which was uh improvements in in polymer science and improvements and quality and there the success was much less pronounced in particular if you think about contributions to polymer science observers of this program have concluded that the the contribution was modest as at at best right most there were significant improvements at this time most of them came from sources that were outside the program the conclusion i guess at least i draw from this is programs that are about increasing supplies are very different from programs that are about increasing increasing knowledge about increasing innovation and we must not confuse them right the second point that dr conan mentioned is this idea that change comes very slowly and this is the chart of how fibers synthetic fibers have diffused and the top blue line here is is cotton and this purplish line here is synthetic man-made fibers of all kinds and this this only you know you can see this is about uh 80 100 year period a century old and this it takes 70 years before man-made fibers overtake cotton and professor coonan basically laid out the reasons why this is so and it's just worth emphasizing that this is a general tendency of all producer goods anything that gets used as an input in somebody else's production tends to have this this property there is an interesting exception which i want to talk to you about which is the switch from coal to oil as a feed stock in the chemical industry um i don't know if you can read any of this stuff here so let me just read it out for you in 1950 well actually in 1938 when when nylon is discovered and dupont trumpets the introduction of nylon it is made from coal air and water not petroleum air and water as it eventually will actually be made that's that's the central role that coal played in chemical production not as an energy source but as an input in a short decade things changed quite dramatically so 1950 50 of us organic chemical output was based on natural gas and oil by 1966 one and a half decades 88 the change is even more dramatic in europe for obvious reasons in 1949 only 9 of british organic chemical output was based on gas and oil in 1962 it's 63 percent the first petrochemical plant in germany takes is started in 1950s by 1973 90 of organic chemical output is oil based right so this was a fairly dramatic change it takes about a decade and a half or two decades and the remarkable part is there was very little government intervention in this in other words no government mandated this there was there was no large-scale government subsidies to some extent this tells you that the point that rebecca made earlier when you have a clear demand and this it's seen as going to be persistent private sector will respond and will make these large-scale changes now there were some other things that happened alongside this required major developments and advances in in technology uh it required a very significant diffusion of this technology and this diffusion too in contrast to the uh to to what brian presented about agriculture was mediated by markets by profit-oriented farms and that's what i want to get to next um this picture here is a picture of an oil refinery in india in jamnagar in 1997 which took place with almost no comment in the world press by mark contrast when a company introduced a small car in india it was on the front pages of new york times and and the wall street journal what's remarkable about this this refinery it was the biggest refinery in the world the biggest grassroots refinery in the world built at a cost of six billion dollars then and has been expanded capacity has been doubled it's now uh 12 billion dollar cost it made india for the first time a net exporter of gasoline believe it or not but that's not the most interesting part the two parts i want you to focus on first that it happened without comment okay you might say well refining his book is boring so is car technology the the internal combustion engine is is about as old as as refining if not older okay the fact that it should happen without comment tells you we take it for granted yes this this technology is a commodity listed here are the key key technology suppliers let me read out backtel blue and uh sorry black and v tech dark global foster wheeler eop criterion catalyst stone and webster davey power gas it's a market you can buy this stuff by contrast think of how what it is like in in automobiles tata had to develop more or less a lot of its technology internally this tells you what a difference it makes if there is a market or if there is not okay i won't belabor this chart but this tells you where what the sources of technology and engineering expertise are for plants globally petrochem chemical plants globally all over the world in 1880 and 1980 in 1990 a very large fraction of the technology is sourced externally and can be purchased on a market that's the takeaway i want you to uh i want to take you want you to take away from this or differently much of the diffusion of petrochemical technologies in the world has taken place through markets and these technologies are being actively sold by profit-oriented firms both large and small right so that's the last part of my presentation now which is coming to so what what made this possible rebecca had highlighted these three things so but i just want to exemplify them these sefs that you see here are specialized engineering firms these are engineering contractors whose business is to supply technologies for chemical plants free sometimes they also develop new technologies and offer them for license in other cases they act as agents for the original innovator the first and this is a sort of a summary of what what my research has shown in the research of others the first takeaway is that these kinds of markets flourish this sort of market for technology flourishes when you've got vigorous competition in the downstream product market the best way to to illustrate it this is with a story of uop most of you don't know but the largest the most important source of refining technology over the last century has been a company called universal oil products so the company outside chicago when this company started it was competing with standard oil right and so this company's business model was it was the technology supply to the independents now without vigorous antitrust there would not have been any independent refiners in america there would not have been a market for uop we would have missed some of the most important uh advances in refining technology without eop so the first thing is you need competitive product markets if you want this kind of competition in or if you want this vigorous technology market second and you may have missed this when you have these kinds of companies like uop thing fundamentally changes with the product companies themselves oil companies have been remarkably open in terms of licensing their own technology bp shell and even exxon have vigorous licensing programs for their technology one reason is if they don't somebody else will you you can no longer keep this keep this held because there's now a market out there so this that's what this chart shows this shot shows when you have these sefs or independent contractors active and licensing then the incumbent producers the chemical and the petrochemical firms are also active in licensing their technologies a related point to this again i'll go back to the history is therefore you need to think about anti-trust not just in the product market but also in the technology markets and the the us department of justice and the ftc with rich gilbert and others have been very active in this aspect of it and making sure that we don't get monopolies up in in the technology market as well finally this goes back to ip patent protection appears not to have hurt a very robust market for technology diffusion in the chemical industry in particular these specialists these technology specialists do well when they have patent protection in fact they require patent protection to compete against the large established companies that's my last slide so this on the first column you have what i think are the main takeaways from the history itself which is this is an example of an industry which was the first science-based industry this was the first time we had the systematic application of science for economic purposes to design new materials starting with synthetic dyes and then moving on that despite this strong science-based character this was funded largely by private and private funds government support for basic research was an exception rather than the rule one reason why this was so because there was a very clear route from science to dollars or from science to being able to make money and there was significant increase in demand so i didn't i didn't get to talk about this because i wanted to move through but you know for example in the 1920s and 1930s the growth of the automobile had a significant uh effect in encouraging investments in refining technologies in new types of plastics lacquers finishes that kind of stuff and not only has this industry relied on private dollars for innovation it's also relied on the market for diffusing these innovations universities have played a very important role but for the most part it's been institutionalizing the disciplines the knowledge and in training people rather than as an active source of new new technologies um what are the implications that we see from the history for energy innovation and i don't want to over claim or let me let me sort of qualify these i've overstated them in the interest of being clear as george orwell once said it's better to be clear and wrong than to mumble so i'm going to be i'm going to be trying to be clear and wrong which is this suggests government programs are much better at coordinating large-scale production when the technology exists then in bringing forth radically new technologies that support for the demand for new for new technologies is probably much more effective or is is at least as important as trying to subsidize the creation of new technologies and third we should not neglect diffusion it does no good to have new technologies if they are not widely deployed for either of the two objectives and in this i would recommend to you that comparative markets both in the product space and in the technology space are very important thank you [Applause] yes i'm philip weber congressional budget office on your table of the specific technology the specific technologies that were the big share by the independent firms and the non-independent firms air separation was uh really different the reason i am asking this is that a carbon capture and sequestration one of the biggest cost elements is the separation of the co2 and it's very inefficient now and very low what are the factors that uh make that the in-house rather the sef roll so low for the air separation technology so it's a good question my sense is one reason the share is low is because the producers have been very active in licensing their technologies air products boc uh linday these were all very active in in licensing out their own technology and i think at least they actually actively had business models where they would help you engineer their plan so there was less of a scope i think for independent suppliers for plant design so the the the producers were also doing this as a business uh i'm david mitch from university of maryland baltimore county i'm just struck by the contrast with the the previous presentation in terms of private versus government and i'm not sure i'm completely clear on on why the chemical industry might have been different than agriculture you know i wonder if you could comment more on that um i well just i think probably rebecca did it deliberately to heighten the contrast and perhaps i'm overplaying my my hand in some sense but again i think the chemical industry came of age in the 1870s where you know there was no other choice and so we might be seeing a kind of selection effect and moreover you know starting starting right then the german chemical companies that first started investing in in-house r d managed to realize very significant gains from that and therefore that business model where you invested in r d and and you made money uh perhaps got institutionalized and in america this it took a very significant anti-trust action against dupont before the trustees of the people were running dupont were convinced that the only way they could grow was through creating new products and and materials and businesses they could not grow in their existing domains and so in some sense and this was a decision that i think serendipitously happened to be right the other big chemical company in 1920s was ilite chemicals most of you have not heard of them they were the second biggest chemical company they chose not to do that and the consequences were what you know right i think also to look at chemicals you need to look back into the early part of the 19th century the development of aniline dies in the quest for a replacement for quinine in anti-malarials yes in in united kingdom which wasn't supported by the united kingdom uh industrial sector so it went to the academics in germany to develop applied technologies in german universities maybe in around the 1840s and then that became the foundation for the german chemical sector which then went on to dominate the world so much that in the 1920s and 30s for example when an american company got the patent for aspirin part of war reparations it couldn't actually develop the technology until it imported uh experts from germany to show them how to do it over about a decade so i think that it's partly the fact that the needed technology was developed way earlier than the 1870s and we're seeing now the application of that technology going on today [Applause] so we have one more presentation before our break i'd like to introduce professor ian coburn from boston university good morning thank you i uh highly recommend you to read the the somewhat lengthy paper that uh scott jack and i have have written on this i don't have time this morning to to delve into i think some important details and subtleties uh the paper begins with a our motivating example is to think back a half dozen presidents and reflect on some science policy initiatives from the uh the 1970s and i think that's you know president nixon in short order both declared war on cancer uh and uh launched project independence uh and i think when we look forward from the third episode there's two very dramatically different experiences of these two sectors as the chart shows uh you know breakdown of federal non-defense r d spending uh you can see that the blue the blue part there is is health um energy is is this the green part and there's been really a dramatic difference uh it's i think you know tracing out why that might have been what the implications uh have turned out to be 30 years later for the uh technological progress in this sector's is is very interesting one thing i think we can say about about the life sciences sector is that a capacity has developed in this country and in others which i think is is truly remarkable uh not just the ongoing you know ongoing stream of very important innovations but also this kind of institutional technological capability to to get on and solve problems uh quite dramatically this is this is you know the the nasty green thing there is the hiv virus uh and that the chart to the right you know shows what could have been uh you know the kind of disaster we see in places like sub-saharan africa uh taking off the united states but really nipped in the bud and to a great degree i think we can you know attribute this to the ability of the life sciences system both fundamental scientific work supported by taxpayers and the uh commercial part of of of this sector to get on this problem and come up with a pretty dramatic uh response now hiv aids of course it's not cured these are these treatments are uh palliative rather than curative but it's still i think a dramatic illustration many of the same stories can be told tremendous progress in in dealing with some you know very difficult problems in human health areas of mental illness heart disease uh sometimes some types of cancers and so forth so to first order think about you know what's going on in this sector in terms of innovation and uh you know has it worked yeah absolutely uh clearly uh government support and government policies played a very important role and in our paper we sort of work through and think what do we think of what do we understand as being key drivers of this life sciences innovation system the first and perhaps most obvious i think is a very high level and a relatively stable level of public funding for basic research a lot of money gets spent through the public health service some of the other agencies particularly nih but also through some other programs uh that has contributed to and supports uh process we've developed a very large you know very highly skilled and highly specialized r d workforce uh and that has taken place against some interesting interesting aspects of the economics of pharmaceuticals uh which are very different from a commodity product like energy i think it's it's obvious but worth dwelling upon these changes public support takes place against the background of fundamentally very high willingness to pay for new products you know differentiated new products if you couple that together with insurance driven demand you know the restaurant where where he or she who orders doesn't pay and an interesting role of quite stringent regulation on the health and safety front by fda about who is allowed to sell products this is generated you know demand factors which i think have been very conducive to commercialization building upon these infrastructural investments in basic science and workforce development fourthly we see this is a sector which in our view you know we the critical factor is that there's a bottom-up process of project funding and project selection if you like much of the nih budget and other agencies money is distributed to work on problems principally through a process of peer review and investigator initiated projects inmates run the asylum here we also see this sector where you know the patent system seems to be working pretty well information communication technologies and software people are really scratching their heads and i think are very worried about you know the costs associated with a patent system which appears to be bogged down a little bit out of control in this sector at least so far intellectual property rights have worked pretty well and play a pretty very important role in allowing innovators to capture value from their from their work and and to echo something as she's just said these intellectual property rights support an active and important market for technology lastly when we think we point to key drivers here i think it's the the pervasiveness and intensity of competition not just in the product market uh but all the way through the value chain i'll expand upon some of these ideas in a moment thinking about what has happened since the 1970s focuses us on on i think as economists on this you know the evolution of industry structure a lot has happened uh in this business this is a gross oversimplification but this way of thinking about industry structure um what i would call the good old days this was a set of institutional arrangements prevailing in the 1970s and through into the 1980s which which created the z drugs you know zantac zoloft zoco and so forth uh this was one in which there was a relatively distinct boundary between public sector science and commercial science which was largely conducted by you know big pharma is the term people throw around to describe large vertically integrated companies that do everything from bench science through to to sales and marketing as the industry evolved not least because of sustained support of basic science things got a lot more complicated on the one hand public sector science expanded and and big pharma shrunk somewhat but we also saw a rival of a lot more different players the growth of biotech industry which operates at the interface between public science and commercial science and the arrival of new competitors companies like amgen biogen and genentech which operate in parallel essentially as large integrated companies rather than being r d boutiques or specialists in particular technology now the evolution of this industry structure has had very interesting effects on who the list of players are and how they interact there's radical change in the science of de-emphasis of chemistry as a technology and increasing emphasis on biology reflects the transformation of fundamental science but it's driven by and as as interacted with a variety of interesting economic phenomena these would include things like the emergence of new entities we're familiar now with these these science-based entrepreneurship companies the small scale close to university dedicated biotechnology firms but at the same time we've also seen the you know the rise in consolidation of academic medical centers and the the appearance of a whole lot of entities venture capitalists patent lawyers university tech transfer officers and so forth all of this sort of ferment in terms of of different types of organizations has been accompanied by an adaptation and adjustment of the large incumbent firms the federal agencies the universities and other established players in this sector the end result and this is not a not a picture of a biotechnology product it's not an engineered antibody it's a map of the industry drawn up by by some colleagues in sociology uh the detail is not important it's just to illustrate you know there's a this maps out connections of different kinds financial commercial technological between different kinds of entities innovation today takes place in the context of this very complex dense interrelated network of institutions all of that has to do i think with conscious policy choices and as you know some self-organizing evolution of this system with that as background let me now turn to to what we think are important lessons to draw for thinking about how to to promote innovation in in climate change and energy technologies uh point number one and this is this i think is becoming a uh a constant theme in these in these presentations already you know it takes a lot of time you know the investments that began with with nixon and things like the war on cancer and setting up the national cancer institute and so forth pay off decades later and that is that is that is that is you know truly fundamental to thinking about these problems the fact that the clock needs to run for a long time i think focuses us also on the value of sustained funding or alternatively the costs of instability and one thing which i think has has built ins built the capacity to innovate in this sector is things like labor market development you know a lot of people have to make long-term highly specialized commitments in human capital in an environment where the budget goes up and down that becomes you know kind of a kind of a courageous choice for an ambitious young person uh instability and funding therefore you know can only lead to to under a under investment in specialized human capital or other kinds of investments we look at the you know the decades it takes to take on problems like cancers you know the level of sustained attention and career development specialization you really need this to be operating in a stable factor [Music] secondly uh as i pointed out you know the inmates run the asylum in the sense that much of the cumulative advance in biological sciences and biomedical sciences is driven by investigation initiative initiated and peer-reviewed funding allocation you know there's not a lot of top-down command and control now there are public health priorities identified which steer funding you know there are political considerations who sits on on which committee uh you know can at the margin move funds around certainly the case too that the product market for pharmaceuticals also generates incentive steer resources but this the basic innovation agenda is driven by the curiosity uh of of individual researchers and i think it's that role of of curiosity academic freedom entrepreneurship uh you know outside of top-down command and control institutions which has generated a diversity of experimentation and and long-term benefits in terms of the accumulation of knowledge and the advance of science here thirdly competition this is a business which is intensely competitive at all levels and much of the competition is focused on innovation being new and being first is really important in almost all of the activities that go on in in the life sciences in the world of universities uh and taxpayer supported research you know there is intense darwinian competition amongst individual investigators between labs and between universities looking for grant funding and the nobel prize that generates you know powerful competitive pressures to move forward to be first to be new taking a step away from academic research into the world of of commercial science now there's a very active interface now between the market and and taxpayer-funded research which is the biotechnology industry there are thousands of entrepreneurs working just off campus mostly funded by private equity and venture capital competing in this market for technology they're chasing after resources talent and opportunities to come up with new ideas move them forward and then sell them to to downstream collaboration partners and then finally get to the product market in pharmaceuticals uh again i think the noteworthy feature about this is you know that prices are high but it's also intensely competitive it's a fragmented market driven largely by what we call you know schumpeterian competition that is to say coming up with new molecules to compete against existing set of products that's uh now one important dimension of competition another is that the market institution has been set up that's a kind of a push you know you get your new product it's patent protected uh you know or fda protected for some period of time but then you get you know savage competition for your products within your molecule from the generics that creates a powerful incentive to move on find new things uh keep going to echo something that xix was talking about uh in terms of antitrust policy i think once you recognize the pervasiveness of competition its connection and you know its role as a driver of innovation here and i think it connects us to thinking about anti-trust policy and how valuable competition is at all points in this process and that the one thing which i think is remark about the life sciences sector there isn't really a choke point in any of any of the levels of this of this chain we don't see domination of activity by by uh single single entities or individuals that creates valuable competitive pressure also supports the diversity and experimentation [Music] fourth lesson transparency and openness life sciences i think are uniquely close to to academic science and academic norms you know mertonian science sharing priority disclosure uh you know turn out i think to to pervade a lot of activity not just in the world of universities but also in commercial activity you know these meltonian norms support very valuable things which are not obvious at first glance they support transparency and disclosure and these drive i think the cumulative advance of technology i think it's worth noting this occurs even in very close to the market commercial activity you know pharmaceutical companies conducting late stage clinical trials are still doing so largely under the rubric in an environment which is pervaded by norms of academic science we see things like you know pressure to disclose clinical trial results operate registries a lot of the stuff is published and observed you know in real time and not conducted on the conditions of commercial trade secrecy now ip and patents play an important role in creating product market incentives interestingly enough they seem they seem to manage to coexist with open science uh five or ten years ago i like many other people was very worried that the that the propertization of science was going to you know cause a train wreck and that you know the reach of the patent system into basic science and universities was really going to choke things up and cause all kinds of problems with with access and sharing and transactions costs now that doesn't seem to have happened in this industry people seem to learn to live and that you know open science and and exclusion based intellectual property rights so far seem to be coexisting and supporting uh disclosure providing incentives to to innovate and driving this cumulative technological advance lesson number five is the product market and the role of rewards to innovators now in the health area there's just an intrinsically high willingness to pay there's a lot of money on the table a lot of it can be captured by new products the institutions of this marketplace i think are very important to the extent that they allow an innovator to capture a significant share of the social value associated with their invention new drugs are really expensive uh that means that the innovator is is capturing a lot of the the social value at least until follow-on competitor molecules arrive or they lose market exclusivity and their generics start to start to eat their lunch now that ability to capture value is driven principally by strong and workable intellectual property unlike these areas where ip seems to be controversial and difficult you know for a very long time patents have been ordering in you know property rights in this area that's historically broad consensus on the rules and norms for what can you patent you know what are the processes and standards how do you enforce them and so forth this iep system operates in parallel with very stringent regulation about who's allowed to sell drugs the fda stands you know between commercial operators in the marketplace we have the hatch waxman act and similar infrastructure around this which which operates in parallel and creates a combination of push and pull uh incentives for innovators to to keep moving forward my last lesson here is to pull together some of these sources to think about the value of diversity experimentation and adaptation i mentioned the plethora of new ways of organizing activity new entities like biotechnology companies and university technology licensing offices that sprung up that also needs to be seen in context with this willingness i think of the established players who dominated the industry in the 1970s and 1980s rather than resist or ignore these changes they've adapted accommodated and developed a fruitful way of coexisting so life science is commercialized today large in the context of you know flexible cooperative relationships across a wide variety of institutions and i think it's been the the emergence of a of an industry culture and government and you know they've been a light touch from the government in terms of regulating activity which has allowed these entities to sort out amongst themselves and to organize themselves and to develop the ability to to interact uh which has been such a powerful force so to conclude you know the life sciences are special they're uniquely close to science you know the unique kind of product market but i think there are some general lessons that we draw from thinking about this sector one is you know to focus on the cumulative process of technical change which it builds up on multiple technologies and multiple sources and you know cancer wasn't cured by nixon within you know the hope for three to five years by coming up with a magic bullet in fact it takes three to five decades to make substantive process substantive progress we do think however that looking at this sector points us to you know the value of sustained and stable public investment in early stage general purpose platform type technologies and and secondly you know to to appreciate the value of and to support and encourage diversity experimentation and competition thank you [Applause] [Music] such a masterful presentation there are no questions thank you very much [Applause] we'll now take a 50-minute break when we come back we'll hear about the technologies of information technology computers semiconductors and the internet thank you
