so as background let me start with the observation that all recent u.s presidents have used tariffs lest we forget president obama put a tariff on tires from china that was a special safeguard action and also on solar panels and anti-dumping action president bush just before him put a tariff on steel imports he in fact exempted canada mexico jordan israel in about a hundred developing countries but not the eu interestingly who then took it to the wto won a complaint there and targeted some u.s goods for retaliation such as oranges from florida jeb bush's state uh president bush then withdrew the tariff in 19 months so the uh planned retaliation was effective in that sense so what's different now while president trump has applied tariffs on solar panels and washing machines also a safeguard action perhaps not too different than president obama's tariffs on tires and on solar panels president trump also applied tariffs to steel and aluminum perhaps not unlike the steel tariff of president bush but what is different is neither canada mexico or the eu were exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs they've all retaliated so this is uh not just planned retaliation but actual retaliation and there's no sign that those u.s tariffs will be removed in addition president trump has applied 25 tariffs on 34 billion in chinese imports to the us with another 16 billion planned and who knows what might come after that china itself has retaliated just in the last week with a tariff on various goods in the u.s trump president trump is also investigating a possible tariff on automobile imports this is on national security grounds and that would especially hit canada and europe who plan to retaliate so as compared with past administration there is a difference in the magnitude of trade actions in the current administration and also in the actual not just planned retaliation so in this context we might well ask what are the costs of a trade war and in trying to answer this or suggest an answer i'll do i'll sort of compare canada and china so let me start with canada canada in my view is the prime example of the countries who realize the gains from intra-industry trade and that was in fact the motivation for the canada u.s auto pact of 1965. it was very much the motivation for the canada u.s free trade agreement of 1989 this is one case where economists completely won the day among canadians and uh based on the gains from intra-industry trade and those were quantified by rick harris in canada that totally paved the way for the canada u.s free trade agreement and then the north american free trade agreement followed naturally five years after that now in my view uh there's several alternative sources of gains from trades suggested by the monopolistic competition models and i mean alternative to conventional comparative advantage that includes product variety gains pro competitive gains and also the gains from creative destruction now since i mentioned pro competitive gains many in the audience might be thinking of the recent paper by arcalakus kashino donaldson and rodriguez claire the elusive pro-competitive effects of trade they in fact show the pro-competitive gains are negative in the presence of non-homothetic preferences but with homothetic preferences they find gains from trade that are identical to the formula in arcalocus casino rodriguez claire and in fact those gains are entirely due to creative destruction there are no gains from product variety and no pro competitive gains in that model now why is that i would argue it's an aggregation effect due to the assumption of a pareto distribution with unbounded support that is there is no highest productivity firm they can always be a firm with higher productivity and an aggregation effect of this type is also mentioned in in recent work by mary amity and oleg and joseph in a revision of their paper once we abandon the assumption of unbounded pareto then all three sources of gains for trade can operate i for example have worked out the case of a truncated pareto truncated on the right side so there is some highest productivity firm in that case all three sources of gains from trade operate my calculations for the united states show that creative destruction is about one-quarter of those gains and product variety and pro competitive gains account for the other 75 roughly evenly split between the two of those and that's from recent work with david weinstein but in fact the upper bound to the total gains from trade is still the formula from acr or acdr and uh in other words once we abandon unbounded pareto we consider other distributions of firm productivity these other sources of gains from trade can operate but the gains due to creative destruction are reduced such that the total is no higher than that formula in acr and acdr we can also ask whether any of these sources of gains from trade can be negative i already mentioned one case and that was acdr in the case of non-homopathetic preferences but this can also happen with homothetic preferences recent work by chang tai shay ralfossa and co-authors look carefully at the canada u.s free trade agreement then find they find negative gains from product writing for canada that is there was more exit of domestic firms in canada than entry of new product varieties from the united states and that can certainly occur with a non-pareto distribution but let's not forget that the total gains from canada are still positive and dan treffler for example has documented that very strong evidence of gains from creative destruction there so with that digression if if you like on the gains from trade let's ask the question if we accept that canada has these very strong gains from intra-industry trade with the united states does that make canada particularly vulnerable to losses from u.s tariffs or more generally what are the costs of a u.s uniform tariff and i'll speculate that this might hurt canada particularly so to check that i i go to the model of caliendo feinster taylor romales a quantitative model and i thank lorenzo in particular for doing the calculations that i'm going to show you so let's first look at a u.s optimal tariff this is a uniform tariff on all goods at 7.15 all goods in all countries and you see the united states here and dark green it's the big gainer from its own optimal tariff canada in fact is in dark red it's a big loser sort of confirming my expectation we also see mexico is a big loser uh argentina bolivia chile and south america and china itself is a big loser from this u.s optimal tariff so now let's turn to china we might think that the gains from trade in china are more in accord with conventional comparative advantage but of course we definitely need to extend that theory to allow for the very strong roles of supply chains in china that many people in this room have studied and written about surprisingly the trump administration is actually targeting industrial goods imported from china for the u.s tariffs and not consumer goods i say surprising because that might have particularly high cost to u.s firms perhaps the explanation is the trump administration is trying to avoid the the direct costs to u.s consumers that they might see in the price tag in stores and are willing instead to put it on firms but it's still uh surprising so here we might ask do supply chains make countries particularly vulnerable to large tariffs let me show the the effects on china's total exports here from the u.s optimal tariff i referred to earlier and we see in fact that this leads to particularly large declines of chinese exports and transportation equipment electrical equipment and machinery also textiles and apparel and food that was from the optimal tariff of seven percent here i also show the larger declines from a hypothetical u.s tariff of 20 this is hypothetically across the board not what we've seen so now we might switch and ask what are the costs of a u.s uniform optimal tariff and i'd speculate that this might hurt all countries that rely on china's exports of intermediate inputs i say exports here because i'm thinking of china's optimal tariff as also an export tariff appealing here to learner symmetry so what are the results of this well we see china in this map in the dark green the gainer from its own optimal tariff many countries are in red throughout western europe north america uh a few countries are in light green they gain slightly mexico brazil and bolivia and some of the african countries perhaps they're relying on the same raw material inputs that china relies on and their prices are being depressed finally let me ask what are the costs of a global trade war and in this final map we see many countries in red losing china in particular in dark red a few countries in in green gaining slightly venezuela and colombia and south america many of the stan countries in turkey and also a number of countries in africa perhaps these countries are being gaining from depressed prices from raw material if you calculate what's happened to world trade in here you find that it collapses by 20 percent by coincidence much the same number is out after the global financial crisis so let me quickly conclude i find that the tariffs used by the trump administration are more widespread than other administrations and also they have led to actual and not just planned retaliation theory allows for alternative sources of gains from trade other than comparative advantage but i've raised the the speculative question about whether this can make countries more vulnerable to trade wars and i've also calculated the effects of a global trade war that's uh which assumed five percent uniform tariffs across the board and i find that leads to the same fall in global trade as a great recession thank you thank you very much these are very interesting times for trade economists two years ago i wrote a chapter for the handbook of commercial policy together with nina pouchnick where we took issue with what we consider to be the prevalent view at the time namely that trade was so liberalized that trade policy had become completely irrelevant and unfortunately i don't think i need to try very hard to convince you today that this is not the case so ten minutes is a very short time to comment on the consequences of trade so i will focus given that rob talked about the aggregate gains from trade i will focus my comments on the distributional consequences of trade and the work that has been done on this issue and as a starter i would like to make a point that seems obvious and in fact trivial but we sometimes forget it namely that trade does bring aggregate welfare gains to an economy but it also uh causes disruption it causes redistribution and it it's because of these disruptive effects that we often see opposition to trade it's not that people don't understand that that free trade can have benefits it's because they don't want to be the losers and what this means is that in my view that we actually need to study these distributional consequences and the policies that are appropriate for addressing these potentially adverse distributional effects and perhaps most importantly also address transitional dynamics so that having said that there has been some work on these issues and this work started in the 90s and at the time the main focus was on the increase in the skill premium that had been observed both in developed and developing countries so there was uh there were some papers written on this topic um uh by several people both labor economists and trade economies so golden contributed to this literature i didn't inappropriately and harrison and several others uh and help one and so on and i think it's fair to say that the consensus that emerged from this literature is that um trade had only if at all a secondary effect on the income distribution and on the increase in the skill premium so we were all finding effects that were statistically significant but in terms of economic magnitudes the effects were too small for anyone to argue that trade was the primary driver behind the increase in inequality so that was in the 90s and then i think it's fair to say that in the last five to 10 years the picture changed so all of a sudden academic studies started finding significant effects and when i say significant i don't mean trust in the statistical sense but also in the economic sense and that applies both to studies that were focusing on the us for example the author dorn enhancement paper it also applies to many studies in developing countries uh so the studies that come to mind are the studies by topalov and various authors in india uh kovac on brazil the carnero and kovac and brazil uh the uh pouch and my cake on vietnam so all these studies started finding very large effects on the income distribution so one one question that one may ask is what changed so why did we all start finding effects all of a sudden and i think there there are two answers that come to mind um the first one is that it has to do with china that the reason we find the facts now is that china in the meantime has entered the world trading system and by virtue of its size china has had major effects i think this view is partially true but it's only a partial truth and the reason is it may apply to the u.s it certainly explains to a certain extent what author don and hansen have documented or pierced and shot but it does not quite explain what people have observed in developing countries for example it doesn't explain the results for vietnam it doesn't explain the results for brazil or for india for all these liberalizations that occurred in the late 80s and early 90s so much before china became an export super super power um the other explanation um that i think is quite interesting both from an intellectual and a practical point of view is that all the studies tend to employ a different approach and they tend to focus on a different dimension of inequality namely regional inequalities so differences across regions with the differential exposure to trade and uh these studies systematically find that those regions that were exposed more to trade had a very different experience from regions that were exposed less so that raises in turn the question is that there is something inherent in this regional approach that leads people to find large effects and again i can come up with two answers to potential answers here the first one is that this studies may not be quite identified this is what the critics would say so the usual argument is that there may be something else driving these developments and it's not really trade or trade liberalization that's behind them for example there could be pre-existing trends that were intensified by trade liberalization or there could be something else i have to say while i was editor at the aer i received numerous comments that we're making at this point i think in the end my view is that the results of this paper survive so maybe they're a little weaker if one takes this criticism into account but i think it's fair to say that the results stand that the evidence was not overturned by this criticism so it seems even though there are some identification concerns we don't have randomized control trials here there are there are there are identification concerns but in the end it seems the results are there um so what's the other explanation the the other explanation is that that what these studies actually capture is general equilibrium effects and when i say general equilibrium i mean within the regions uh that they're applied to so it's still the case that all these studies document only relative effects so when i say relative i mean they document effects that apply to some regions relative to others within a country they don't document absolute effects absolute welfare effects for the country but one could argue that if we're interested in inequality inequality is a relative concept by definition so this relative focus is well justified here and this studies as i said do document very large effects so um with that in mind uh i think the focus on general equilibrium is actually what may be driving these very large effects that that people find so for example when the the dependent variable is poverty or even wages for the region or unemployment they don't take into account only the effects on the tradable sector but also the effects on the non-tradeable sector and it turns out if you take these effects this the general equilibrium effects the aggregate effects could be quite large um that said one caveat is important here even though their effects on regional inequality it is not the case that trade increases inequality so in many cases actually even though many studies find that the the areas that were exposed more to trade did actually worse in relative terms in the sense that unemployment increased or wages went down again in relative terms even though that's the case in many cases these were the regions that were better off to start with for example this is the case in brazil and this is the case in india the areas that were exposed to more liberalization were the areas that were better off uh so in fact this uh inc these uh relative effects that trade had at the regional level uh went in the direction of reducing regional inequality uh that said this is not a comforting message because inequality was reduced in a way that we don't particularly like it is not the case that those regions that were worse off came up it's the opposite that those regions that were doing relatively well did relatively worse after trade liberalization um i should also say that the effect tend to be very mixed across regions so in in vietnam for example people find that uh you know trade benefited the areas that were exposed more to trade liberalization the opposite is true in brazil and vietnam so uh my time is up so let me conclude with two observations the first is that um when it comes to distributional consequences and this should perhaps not come as no surprise the effects tend to be very context specific they depend on the country that implemented the reforms it depends on the nature of the particular liberalization and on the initial conditions so it's very hard to draw general conclusions as to whether trade increases or decreases inequality but it seems that the evidence does suggest that trade has large effects on regional inequality uh the second observation is that often what we observed in the data what this study is documented is very hard to explain within traditional models and this is very exciting from a research point of view because it opens new areas for research so i very much hope that in the future there will be more research in this area so that we have a better understanding of these mechanisms so i'll stop here what i'd like to talk about are what we've learned about the disruptive effects of trade and also what we've learned about learning about the effects of trade uh because there's been i think through the course of this literature uh this very interesting interaction between reduced formwork and structural modeling um that has become symbiotic in a way that they were camps quite separate from each other maybe 10 years ago and much less so now um so you think back uh you know a dozen years ago or a little bit more um the the the view that we had that that penny just summarized of not thinking trade as uh have as having been all that important the effects are certainly there um uh worked at a number of us in the 1990s work that rob and i did included were finding impacts it just looked like the impacts of technological change were more important uh part of the um uh the challenge we faced in that research is we were kind of uh we were burdened by um perspectives of the past and one of those perspectives was the actual lean model which told us that the construct we wanted to be working with was national labor markets that are segmented by skill and so when we looked within those contexts we weren't um finding a lot and in that context you're not going to expect to see um uh big you're you're not going to expect to see impacts happening at a regional level or at an industry level it's going to be happening by skill group mobility is going to erase those other margins of adjustment so the china shock gave us an opportunity to invest this so just always have to show this picture just to remind you how big it was uh following deng xiaoping's reforms china's share of of world manufacturing exports went from two percent in 1990 to 15 uh in 2010 um and from the point of view of empirical research uh this was both uh a blessing uh and a curse uh it was a blessing because of the extraordinary opportunity this provided to observe what happens when a very big economy that has is highly specialized in a particular set of industries opens itself very quickly uh the curse is that this will never happen again uh and so the external validity of this exercise has lots of uh of question marks uh uh around it uh and i'll come back to that at the end um so what did we learn as we as we uh dive into this um the first china shock paper was by uh bernard jensen and uh uh shot looking uh and they started looking where you would you would uh naturally expect to begin which is what happens at the plant level and what happens at the industry level and we observed not surprisingly plants that were more exposed to import competition from low-wage countries in the united states being more likely to shot the subsequent literature that uh that added on to this then all in a reduced form approach uh looked for uh i began to document other margins of a of adjustment and as penny said all of this work is looking at differences in outcomes between more versus less exposed groups so you're capturing relative impacts the gefx are loaded either into uh time dummies uh other controls or somewhere in the air term that you hope aren't confounding uh the estimation um but as a first pass you don't know anything other than the fact that you're if you're doing it right that you're getting these uh these relative effects what we did learn was that we were able to validate these effects both by looking at more versus less exposed industries more versus less exposed regions and more versus less exposed uh workers and so what this taught us is that there are a set of margins of adjustment that are operative that we hadn't really been looking at before when we saw declines in manufacturing employment in a region what happened was not those workers relocating to other regions but we saw excess exits from the labor force increases in long-run unemployment and so this took a margin of adjustment off the table this inter-regional adjustment mechanism which we had just kind of assumed um and uh and and and uh trade economists had already been pretty sanguine about uh in the past you can find lots of evidence if you look back in the labor literature um that this was not a great assumption to start with go back to the work by john bown and harry holzer uh in 1990 looking at the uh what happens to local labor supply of less educated men when you get adverse labor demand shocks and what you saw was no regional labor mobility or very weak labor mobility in response so it just kind of took the rest of us a couple of decades to catch up to some of those insights and i don't want to take away from a lot the lots of interesting stuff we've learned from the monte reading and rossi uh hansberg work on on uh on migration that happens inside some of these larger markets so just put to put some numbers on the table to understand uh this uh differential impacts um uh and exposure um this is uh uh uh taken from uh my paper with uh otterdorn and jsong uh from using social security administration data we're gonna follow workers over time from 1991 to 2007 compare workers who in 1991 are identical in every observable respect they earn the same wages they've seen the same wage growth uh they entered they have the same tenure with their employers their employers are the same size pay the same average wages one happens to work in an industry that gets hit by the china shock and what doesn't and one doesn't so what happens well if we look at low wage workers what we see is that over the next uh 16 years that more exposed low-wage worker in here looking at the worker at the 75th percentile of exposure relative to the 25th percentile of exposure sees about 18 less earnings uh when normalized by the uh initial earnings um now where does uh and i if i look at a high wage worker what do i see no differential effect in lifetime earnings between the more and less exposed worker so now we've learned a second thing about the margin of adjustment in that that stickiness is not uniform throughout the wage distribution it's concentrated on low-income workers so hector lean was telling us to look at low-wage workers because we thought shocks were being transmitted across skill groups but that's not the issue the issue is that immobility is specific uh to skill groups um and one of the things we also learned about uh where those um that stickiness comes from is it's the ability to take up jobs outside of manufacturing those high-wage workers are making up for all the lost earnings they lose at their declining firm by moving outside of manufacturing the low-wage workers in manufacturing are not uh and so that's kind of a key clue for for pushing this forward now why are these impacts so big so here again we can turn to the uh to the labor literature for insights and this is uh building on the landmark work of jacobson lalonde and sullivan using mass layoffs as an experiment to understand the scarring effects of job loss and here i'm showing work by davis and von wachter that updates that work in which they look at the consequences in the near term and the long term from job loss and what matters crucially is are you losing your job in the middle of a recession if you are then those short run and long run impacts are much more severe now what's happening to these workers who are losing their job as a result of the china shock they're losing their job in the middle of a local recession because many of these are small labor markets and so uh the uh the plant closures amount to a negative aggregate uh demand shock um second thing we've learned is that the policy adjustment mechanisms uh were were quite imperfect uh we thought we had things like trade adjustment assistance in a place uh unemployment and uh uh insurance and kind of some other um uh other uh means-tested entitlement programs turns out that much more than any of those programs was social social security disability insurance uh as in terms of responsiveness to uh workers hit by the by the china shock so this is something that was really missing from uh from uh our research and trade is understanding how existing policy distorts distortions can exacerbate these impacts and i'll come back to this uh in just a second in terms of where uh research is going so that first uh wave of research um was was reduced form helping us understand these uh relative impacts and then what happened after that is a bunch of uh a very good general equilibrium analyses that have come along and built um uh structural models to help us get a sense of what's going on so shea and osa we're kind of first to the table with this and then we have the very nice papers by caliendo de vorque namparo and um kali rodriguez claire and yi which help us understand uh in the context of trade having disruptive effects what do the aggregate gains look like over time those aggregate gains are still positive there's they're just more um unevenly distributed than we uh appreciated now what's missing in those uh analyses well what's missing is when you get a negative shock of this magnitude it begins to unravel the social fabric when you remove high-wage jobs for less educated males what happens marriage rates falls single parenthood rises the fraction of kids living in poverty rises and the um the incidence of males engaging in risky behaviors drug and alcohol abuse increases and you get increases in in mortality well that unraveling of the social fabric can have very persistent effects even if some of these labor market effects begin to wash out so that's one thing that's missing in the research the other thing is that's missing is understanding the way in which the existing policy to buy environment especially when it comes to social policy uh shades uh uh uh uh what that looks like over the uh the longer term so finally i want to close um just two very brief comments on what we've learned about methodology uh first trade economists have been using bartik for 25 years but it took trade economists to come along and start using bartok to we figure out how to use it responsibly so what we've learned is that friends don't let friends use bartek unless you validate orthogonality conditions and cluster your standard errors uh appropriately now how exactly we cluster we're still figuring out but it's a very interesting uh conversation but finally what we've also learned is the way in which reduced form work and structural work can interact and which they this can be part of an iterative process that reduced form stage of analysis tells us what the relative impacts are it doesn't tell us about the ge effects because that's lost into the other stuff the ge models are then gonna then build themselves around understanding which adjustment mechanisms are operative and then once you have those models in place you can go back and figure out what did those relative impacts actually mean and it turns out the relative impacts were pretty close to the absolute impacts and that's now led us to where we are now which is an updated prior of what these local economies look like and they look a lot like small open economies with limited labor mobility and that's a really useful insight as we move forward to try and understand the longer term ramifications of these very big shocks my main message is that we are entering into a target rich environment for the study of applied trade policy that is for the past couple decades we sort of shied away from looking at actual trade policies to looking at the quantitative models of hypothetical trade policies um and we're there's the promise of a new era in which um our counter factual policy experiments will become factual policy experiences and we cannot take advantage of this and this is a great opportunity for all of us now i come at things through the lens of economic history and uh one of the reasons i focused on economic history is i've looked for big trade policy shocks in the past to try to identify things and uh uh see what happens if we look at just trade to gdp uh ratios uh from the past and try to think think about um where are the big changes that we've seen um you know if we look at the late 19th century into the early 20th century uh trade to gdp ratios are very stable we see this globalization era after 1970 where trade to gdp ratios rise and of course a lot of work has gone into understanding that but it's really thanks to nbr researchers such as doug north robert gallman robert lipsey that we can push this diagram further into the past and what we see is that trade has been a played a very large role in a very volatile role very early on in american history and a lot of this volatility was trade policy induced and the uh perhaps the greatest trade policy experiment i think in u.s uh history is the jeffersonian embargo of 1808 uh where uh president jefferson uh declared an end to overseas shipping for a little over a year now what possible relevance would an embargo aimed at a major trading partner that's also a potential uh geopolitical rival conducted 210 years ago at a time when the trade share was about 15 of gdp what possible relevance would that have to today after all don't we live in the world of the wto rules and low tariffs in general well i'm sure you're all aware of this president trump tweet where he talked about how trade wars are good and easy to win but what it got when overlooked and a lot of the coverage of this tweet is later on he says uh if a certain country gets cute with us don't trade anymore um we can win a big it's uh it's easy uh this sounds not so much like an embargo but the trump administration has floated the ideas of imposing tariffs greater than the value of u.s imports on china which might come close to an embargo so what would we so maybe it's not so far fetched this idea now we can't make policy recommendations of course at an nbr event but i will say there's one study of the jeffersonian embargo which says that it shaved about five percent of us gdp off within six months and i'll let you decide whether it was a good policy or not and of course we can't make that determination until we know what was the objective of that policy but at any rate since we are here in boston uh the the embargo had a big impact of course on the local economy here in cambridge and boston it was very hard hit it was a major seaport a major commercial hub for the new england region and of course the way you would protest trade policy back then is you'd have to write the president a letter um and so there is one such letter from someone in boston written to uh mr jefferson uh only a month after the embargo was imposed and the first line of this letter says you uh mr jefferson you are a friend to the disturber of the peace and the greatest enemy of the whole world and uh the letter goes downhill from there so if you think that uh you know we're in a poisonous political environment today uh please take a look at american history and you might get a different perspective on how we've evolved over time but let's look at trade policy measures so one reason why uh trade policy as penny pointed out um hasn't been thought to be all that important in recent years is we've had this period of about 60 years where tariffs are pretty low pretty flat there's not too much uh action there but of course once you push things back you see there's been a lot of action in terms of tariff movement and this gives us lots of opportunities for identification uh interesting policy experiments and what have you um and so there's a lot to be mined there in terms of the past now you might notice that there's a big uh tariff reduction there uh between say 1932 and 1952 um and interestingly that's not all due to policy in fact relatively a small amount of it was due to policy a lot of it was due to the fact that we had specific duties in place we had higher inflation and that eroded the value of those duties so it was a policy decision not to do anything about this erosion but it wasn't a deliberate policy to actually take the tear from 60 down to 10 within the span of less than two decades so tariffs historically uh have been pretty high and uh oftentimes volatile the past 60 years they've been fairly low and stable but now about a year ago president trump said apparently in the oval office bring me some tariffs i want some tariffs and finding the appropriate legal provisions to allow the president unilateral to raise tariffs mainly section 301 of the trade act of 1974 and section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 his advisors delivered and now we have some tariffs in place this is a chart from the economy that shows uh basically what rob was talking about some of the tariffs that have been imposed uh recently it's only two weeks old but it's already obsolete and we have to move this line down from threatened to actually imposed in terms of some of the uh extra steel tariffs and the the the china tariffs um and uh you know the numbers here are fairly large uh the big one of course is the very bottom there which is automobiles and i'd remind you that penny and rob sort of started their careers by looking at trade policy regarding the automobile industry i think maybe it's time to dust off some of those things not impose vers but potentially a 25 tariff if the trump administration is moving forward with tariffs on automobiles of course one big difference from trade policy in the past as opposed to trade policy today is that uh yes tariffs are back uh but now we have the rise of intermediate goods global value chains and uh things of that sort that changes the calculation of course in terms of the economic impacts particularly when we're talking about the steel tariffs and the aluminum tariffs and perhaps some of the ones to come so uh secretary of commerce wilbur ross famously showed a can of chicken noodle soup from campbell's which now i have feel obligated to bring with me wherever i go so i can explain the possible downstream impacts of steel and aluminum tariffs and yes he's probably right the price will only go up by a center to who could possibly feel that maybe it's not such a big impact but if you are uh producing say the dodge ram uh truck the uh f uh 1500 uh there's a lot of steel and aluminum in that in fact there's another product that has even more steel and aluminum than even a dodge ram uh pickup truck and that is of course the beer keg um and uh there are only one to two uh domestic beer keg producers in the united states and they're teetering now on the brink of bankruptcy because their input costs have risen so my question which is a political economy question is where are the consumers that is why aren't our college campuses in uproar over the fact that these uh beer keg prices could be going up um now this is a particularly sensitive issue on my campus at dartmouth because a beer accounts for a large part of the caloric intake i think of the average undergraduate in a given week in fact the unofficial mascot of the dartmouth undergraduate is called keggy well i'd like to say that the reason why the consumers are not more upset is because the dartmouth economics department and business school which are filled with many fine trade economists have met personally with all the fraternities and sororities and assured them that chinese retaliation against u.s agricultural exports has actually reduced the price of those goods domestically particularly in terms of hops and barley and therefore the impact on the price of beer is mitigated because even though the price of kegs is going up the input price on the agricultural farm products that go in has gone down that's not the story however dartmouth banned kegs uh a number of years ago but uh it does raise the issue of political economy so i went out i want to get to some of the research implications for what's different in the environment today as opposed to the past well the one that's i think is very clear and stands out that's different today from the past is the rise of global value change and the downstream user effects it's very interesting when you look at the trade policy in the 1980s and the reagan administration is very hard i i believe to get the downstream user industries to uh vocally oppose a lot of the measures that were being imposed now it's very common uh to see downstream industries uh uh uh make their voices heard and i'd point to uh work down at dartmouth by emily blanchard rob johnson and chad bound in terms of the implications for trade policy of these global value chains second issue of course is trade policy uncertainty and that certainly describes the environment we're in um this has been an area that kyle handley is taking a lead role in with nuno lamau but also deborah svenson meredith crowley and others have done some work on identifying the trade policy impacts of well the impacts of uncertainty uh on investment decisions trade decisions and things of that sort i think that will continue to be a fruitful line of research third when does retaliation work so this has not been the subject of so much research because we've had the dispute settlement system very orally in pr process to adjudicate trade disputes about now we're in a world where uh retaliation may happen quite quickly bypassing even the wto so that that uh makes us want to investigate the question when does retaliation work or achieve its objective or when does it not lastly i think there are a bunch of political economy questions that are very interesting here now of course our workhorse model for political economy is the grossman helpman model which is premised on the idea that trade policy is driven by uh people in the government who are first of all industry demands for trade protection and politicians who are driven by campaign contributions well the challenges here that we have a u.s president who was elected outside the system is not really dependent on campaign contributions and who seems to be imposing import tariffs even when there's no industry demand such as in the auto industry where the auto industry actually doesn't want many changes because they're already globally integrated so what does this say about our political economy models related to that is uh trying to assess the politics or uh of import uh the the response of domestic firms to import competition in terms of political demands so uh gordon's done of course some pioneering work on the china shock here's some three recent import shocks to the u.s so it's looking at imports as a share of gdp from three particular countries the first one the blue one is japan now of course you can see that surge in imports coming from japan in the early 1980s and we know absolutely what happened there in terms of the trade policy response many demands for voluntary export restraints anti-dumping duties and the like huge demands for trade protection the second line there is the yellow one from mexico that's an indigenous response to nafta of course the fact that imports are going up there hasn't been many demands to stop those imports coming in from mexico now the china shock is obviously one of the largest ones there it's particularly enormous in terms of its impact on imports as a share of gdp but what's ironic here is despite the fact that uh gordon and his colleagues have been able to identify big labor market effects there wasn't so much of a political economy reaction against those imports as one might expect so just to take one measure anti-dumping petitions filed a big run-up in anti-dumping petitions fell in the early 1980s strong dollar growing trade deficit a lot of imports from japan anti-dumping petitions sort of have dropped right off uh from the early 1980s mid-1980s um and so right as where the china shock is sort of most intense from say 2000 to 2010 there's an almost uh a major drop in the number of petitions filed by import competing firms complaining about foreign competition so i think this is interesting too uh is it the rise of foreign investment in china is it global value chains or what have you the last point i would make is that i think there's opportunities for symbiotic research between members of the programs iti and ifm which have been segregated i think for some time even though when international studies started the bureau was on the leadership of bill branson and it was a macro in the trade economist all together and the reason for this is that a lot of the issues trade policy issues of course are bound up with the macroeconomic phenomena and as well as the trade imbalances for example there's a piece of legislation that's circulating uh been circulated apparently within the white house and it's premised on the idea that trade imbalances are being driven by trade barriers now this is a i think a questionable premise to say the least but it's one that's gaining some currency i think in policy discussions and i think it's something that ifm and iti could join forces and try to look more into i should note that the title of this legislation as the u.s fair and reciprocal tariff act um which goes by the unfortunate acronym of fart and of course it's uh given uh rise to many jokes that i won't get into such as will congress pass fart uh and things of that sort but i think there's some serious issues that here uh that deserve examination last point of course is your if you're interested in more of the history of some of these things in comparison over time uh if you are a mbr program member you can get a free copy of this book clashing over commerce by contacting helena fitzgerald thank you thank you
