this work was funded by the nia at the national institutes for health and by the hilton foundation i want to acknowledge my co-authors virat agarwal from usc jonathan cantor and chris bailey from the ram corporation so uh why look at shelter and place policies and excess mortality uh so if you if you can remember a year you know when the pandemic just started shelter-in-place policies uh were were sold on the premise that they can flatten the curve so if you reduce social interactions you can reduce the number of covet cases in the population and you can bring them down below health system capacity and in that process prevent make sure everyone gets the health care they need and and prevent uh covet deaths uh so that was kind of the uh the original idea behind shelter in place and some early research did show that shelter in place uh did exactly that that it was associated with a decline in in co with cases or or debts but more recent research by economists shows that shelter in place might not work as well as we think because in the face of a pandemic people don't do do nothing they actually respond to the pandemic and they might change their behavior prior to implementation of a policy and in that case the effect of the policy would be dampened because people decided to stay at home or not go to bars and restaurants even before the policy uh was implemented so that's that's one reason why it's important to look at the effects of this policy in real life and not just in a mathematical model where we are comparing these policies to uh doing nothing or assuming no change in behavior the other thing that can happen is when you relax shelter in place people will respond by resuming their their social interactions uh so instead of just preventing cases what you might be doing is is just delaying cases uh so for example in los angeles where i'm from uh there was a huge second surge in cases in november and and that might be just people kind of you know getting tired of the shelter-in-place policies resuming social interactions and pieces going up so it's important to kind of look at the long-term effects not just what happens in a few weeks after these policies but maybe a few months after these policies are are implemented uh the other thing that can happen is that these policies can have effects on your health not just on covet risk but through a variety of other mechanisms so this is actually the cover of the british medical journal which is one of the oldest peer-reviewed journals and you can see that the small kind of blue box on the left corner is the mortality directly attributable to covet which is you get coveted you end up in the hospital and you might die but all the other kind of things in orange are mortality coming from other causes so they could be because of non-covet care being displaced so if you have chest pain and you don't go see your doctor you might die of a heart attack at home it could be because of social isolation you could have depression uh it could be because of social disorder if you're at home and you have nothing to do you might go outside uh and do social disorder it could be because of physical inactivity uh abuse and so on so it's important not just to look at covet mortality but to look at mortality from all causes because there could be a variety of different channels through which shelter-in-place policies could be affecting your health so just to kind of give you some example we did find you know the first cause which is displacing non-covet care we did another paper uh and we found there were big reductions in screening for cancer like colonoscopies and mammograms uh big reductions in monitoring your hp a1c which is a you know monitoring your diabetes big reductions in in vaccinations and what we showed in another nbr working paper is some of these reductions were related to shelter in place policies so so so basically the point is look in theory these policies could work by reducing covet cases and covert debts but in theory you know there could be many other consequences of these policies like displacing non-covert related care mental health and so on and so we really need to bring data to this to see what was going on and and that's what we did so we basically uh looked at the experience of different countries when they implemented shelter-in-place policies as well as different states within the us when they implemented shelter-in-place policies and we use data from the oxford university covet 19 government response tracker which tracked shelter-in-place policies when they were implemented in each state and country and then we used uh data from our world and data which you know goes to the human mortality database to track excess debts and by excess debts we basically mean debts during the pandemic or 2020 compared to the average debts in the previous five years when we didn't have the pandemic and these are all cause uh mortality so we started with like simple descriptive analysis so each dot here is a country and for each country we figured out the date of the first covet death that was the start of the pandemic in that country we looked at the next six months after the first govern death and said for how many of those how what duration of this time did you have a shelter in place policy at work that's on the x-axis and on the y-axis is during this duration what does excess mortality look like and what we find in this simple cross-sectional analysis is that the longer the duration of shelter and place policies are the higher the excess mortality so there's no evidence here that you know shelter-in-place policies reduce excess mortality uh you could argue that maybe it's not the duration that matters it's the speed so if you implement these policies early on that's when you save lives and this this graph basically shows uh that that's that's not the case we still find that same positive association where uh countries who implemented the policy earlier uh we don't see uh a huge uh you know gain from from implementing that and we find the same experience when we look at u.s states that duration or speed of shelter-in-place policies doesn't seem to matter much but all of this is descriptive analysis and you could argue that you know these states not only differ in terms of when they implemented or how long they implemented shelter in place policies they differ around many other dimensions similarly countries differ among many other dimensions so this simple cross-sectional analysis might have omitted variable bias or might be missing some of those factors so to address that what we did was an event study where we look at within a u.s state or within a country and then and then basically track excess mortality after the implementation of shelter-in-place policies and and prior to implementation of shelter-in-place policies so the graph on the left-hand side shows the event study results from the cross-country comparison and what you find is after so time period zero is when shelter and place policies are implemented and the in the weeks after shelter-in-place policies are implemented there is a trend towards rising excess debts uh we find a similar pattern in in u.s states even though in the u.s states towards week 20 excess debt starts uh start declining and the positive coefficient for u.s states are not statistically significant as you can see the 95 confidence interval overlaps with zero uh but for the international comparison the positive coefficients are actually statistically uh different from zero that the confidence intervals are are higher than zero uh so so these data show that even when we kind of look within states which can account for this omitted variable or within countries we still find this pattern that uh shelter-in-place policies led to higher excess debts rather than lower excess debts but then you can say okay nurse that's great but what about the fact that stringency of policies might vary across countries so what we're getting is the average effect maybe these policies really work when uh you implement a strict version of the policies or or what if uh you know you're kind of grouping all these countries together uh maybe some countries that implemented policies early in the pandemic uh you know these policies might work then or what economists call that the timing of these policies might be endorsements so you might have implemented these policies when there was already a trend towards rising debts and and that's why you kind of find it's a continuation of the trend rather than a break in that trend so we try to you know address uh some of these possibilities uh so the first thing is that the event study actually tells us what what the trend in excess debts were prior to implementation of these policies and what you find is that in the international comparison actually there was a trend towards declining excess mortality in countries that implemented shelter-in-place policies so in some sense if that trend had continued you should find your bias towards finding that ex you know excess mortality reduces when you implement shelter-in-place policies and in fact what we find is that the trend is reversed so the dots were kind of going down until zero and now the dots kind of start going up after sheltering place is implemented in jewish states we really don't see any kind of big trend that looks flat and then it starts going up after shelter in place is implemented we also try to kind of split this into uh countries where there was higher than median covet debts prior to implementation of the policies versus below median and again you can see there's no pre-existing trend but after the policies are implemented there's a trend towards uh increasing mortality and then finally what we did was we said you know let's just look at this same chart for each country and for each state and let's see do we find any evidence for a particular country that these policies work that they actually reduced excess mortality after the policy was implemented and the only evidence we find is in australia new zealand and malta where these policies seem to have a protective effect and all of these countries happen to be islands so maybe there is some some link there and similarly when we look at across u.s states the only state where we find an effect is in hawaii which also happens to be an island uh so maybe there is something to do with you know islands this works in islands but maybe not in in other places uh so in conclusion what we find is even though in theory shelter and place policies seem like a good idea uh we don't find any any evidence that they have reduced excess debts so given that maybe going forward a better strategy might be to focus on vaccinations and therapeutics for controlling the pandemic rather than trying to shut down the economy or asking people to stay at home and and more general the lesson from you know this kind of economic research is any policy we should be evaluating what the long-term consequences of the policy are and thinking both about kind of the intended as well as unintended consequences of the policy thank you
