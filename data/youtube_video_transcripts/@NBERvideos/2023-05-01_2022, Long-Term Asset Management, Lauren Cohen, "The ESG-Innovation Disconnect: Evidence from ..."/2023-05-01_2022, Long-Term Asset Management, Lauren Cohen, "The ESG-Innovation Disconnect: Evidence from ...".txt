um [Music] these are some of the kind of asset managers that are doing this some of the raters that are doing this and even the ratings firms so any comments and all the comments you give are going to be super helpful for us and just thinking through this and how to tackle these issues some that have imagined kind of going forward so realistic board is getting those what i'm planning to do is just to prevent what we've gotten so far so far and then hopefully we get that done so where have we gotten so far so i don't think this needs much of a motivation but esg is it's a thing right and not only is it a thing but it's a thing being used by lots of asset managers and that's what management worldwide and so how much well look it has grown to be about 33 of the 50 trillion dollar u.s aun and incrementally so marginally over 50 percent of assets worldwide that that's estimate from last year had some kind of impact tag to it right esp or impact tax now how have they done this well there's really been kind of two ways that these assets have been allocated there have been these esd ratings which i'm going to talk about a little bit here and also these divestiture campaigns but the best year campaigns they have this feel for hey look we don't like x whatever x is these could be syn stocks the alcohol tobacco we're going to talk about energy here and so we're just going to prevent our portfolio from investing in those types of stocks now what's the motivation for these types of investment rules well look we could have a preference based motivation so that is just we don't like something about this and we want our investment dollars to represent this and we're totally cool if that means we get a lower risk adjusted return right if for you to do that and that's either because you have to minimize this kind of search space or it just takes longer such costs are higher so we'll pay higher fees for that or there could be some kind of beliefs based approach here and that is even if i don't care about esg if i think others care about esp other important factors in production here you can think about labor employees or consumers and that would drive them to certain types of firms and not to other types of firms and i don't think that the market is fully impounding that then i might want to invest this way even if i don't care about it in particular so what's the evidence on this well it's kind of mixed it kind of goes both ways so there's not great evidence not really super surprising given that there hasn't been that much time where these have been going on and so keep this date in mind the term esg actually didn't come about until 2004. we just don't have that big of a time series to establish these things some tests show that there's a little bit out performance with the under performance and it reels kind of the middle and the same on the corporate side people who've applied these so some kind of good some kind of bad but we're sitting some in some kind of kind of a certain space as far as that's concerned so what do we do in the paper okay what we do in this paper is we say hey look on this environmental piece right the e of the esg what everyone's going to agree on kind of worldwide that wants to solve this problem is we're not there yet whatever solutions we need the most recent reports tested by primary factors we need future technology right and you can think about them apart but also with innovation production distribution storage like that we continue more innovation and so innovation is gonna be a key component of whatever the solution space is gonna be moving ahead and given that in the paper we're just gonna investigate gosh who is it that got this innovation he's done over time is and one component that is quite important especially in this environmental piece so here's what we find we find that a large fraction of green patenting isn't driven by highly rated e firm so this is e in the esg space um and these are firms that are commonly favored by esg funds um and the firms that are kind of pushed into by those those divestiture campaigns the ones that are brought away from but instead it's the energy sector so the traditional energy sector that has been a large and growing percentage of these esg and well so they allocate significantly more of their innovation efforts toward green innovation than other firms that are also active in this green innovating space so significantly more than other highly rated e firms right the esg space and more than other sectors who again are also active how much more well on average about three times more so the average firm in these industries that does green patenting for energy firms that's about three times as high it's about 22 now not only do they produce these patterns but our next question was that they needed for these times but they made for doing kind of like easy layouts like crappy time right so they want to make it look like they're pandering we're not going to spend as much time with the numbers to explore the quality of these packs and it turns out that the quality of these patents by the markers of quality that we have in this space looks like they're actually higher quality but there are issues with this given the skewness of the distribution so this other measure that's often used are these things called blockbuster patents and that just means a patent that gets the most citations within extended vintage and technology class in that year and those have been shown [Music] and it turns out they both have significantly higher cited patents right per patent and they also have more of these blockbuster patents coming from these traditional energy centers but even given that we were thinking well gosh maybe they're still trying to be strategic in the way that they patent these in the sense that they are restricting others from commercializing the space so what is a patent well by construction a patent is actually a defensive legal contract so what it hasn't done where i can block any other is quantity itself that make it super hard to cut through that density and the patent even near this idea so we measure this in the space and their patents themselves we then look at who's citing them right because this could be one of these issues right where you'll get someone up on screen right like an author discuss it and they'll say ah and that's what we were worried about here is that maybe all those citations are coming from the firms themselves right like royals and challenges finding their own patents and that's what generates this and this turns out about four to oh percent of the citations for other alternative energy firms are coming from outside their industries okay so comparatively speaking these are actually more impactful outside the industries than other alternatives and other green energy patents and we do find some evidence that i mean in terms of incremental esg score and espor in particular even given that they're producing these more and what seem like to have markers of higher quality but are they packs their money where their mouths are right so are they still just producing these ideas but not putting money behind they were some of them earliest and foundational innovators in this space that they are the producers of the most alternative energy wattage worldwide and that's not only in a total amount sense but also in these big large projects that are done about the private level and private public partnerships and the thought process behind that is going to be something that's not at all going to be surprising to everyone in this room but the idea is these firms don't want to be your oil provider right what is [Music] but we think of that very much as that kind of adam smithy invisible hand moving them to that and not something else that's going on all right okay and so so here's how we do this the nice thing is the data we use is data that that you can and i know so within those categories they give us sub categories of each of those water and these other types of subcategories and by using this data we then match the publicly traded firms and that allows us to then ask these questions okay and i'll show you kind of one example of one of the three patents this is a patent that was filed in 1978 by the exxon research team and this is one of the foundational patents in solar cell technology okay this is what green patenting has looked like over the past now 40 years going back to 1980 okay so we see it's been rising probably not surprisingly and i'll show you what percentage this these oil majors have done and so i don't think anyone can reach this table the things with yellow are these are the top 50 firms public security firms that patent here the firms in yellow are traditional oil firms okay so these are your bps in your shell and as an industry sector there's the second most green patent intensive producers behind manufacturing manufacturing here some include things like car companies right or dupont who are also big producers and this is really our headline result so again i'm just going to kind of talk you through it at the industry level but just so you can understand what we're putting on the left hand side here is the green pattern ratio so that's the intensity of all the patents you produce what percentage are green here right so if you are producing 100 patents and 40 of them are green that's going to be 40 and so what we can see here is when we include all the controls industry level controls things for like scale things for age other things it might matter here doesn't really make a difference these energy industry firms just produce significantly more of their intensity of their idea space they're dedicating more time and effort and will show in terms of dollars to green patches and how much more like i mentioned before about three times more they're putting about three times more of their efforts into this and i want to show you one other uh result with this and that is when we focus specifically on some of these frontier technologies that were brought up in these recent icpp reports and some of these others things like carbon capture it turns out some of these magnitudes get even larger okay so they're they're not investing three times as much but it can be three to five times as much in these types of alternative energy and kind of carbon capture technologies and so when we jump now to look at impact right the quality of this patents we find something that i mentioned before which is we were a little surprised by it turns out on average these are higher quality patents that are being produced so it doesn't look like they're just running up the numbers here but higher quality how much higher quality will they get about 10 percent more patent citations per patent on their green patents and they're about three times more likely to be blockbuster patents okay so that moves it from about that five-ish percent up to about 15 and the last thing i want to talk about is the actual amount that they're invested okay so this still brings up this question right we talked a little bit about is hey is this just cheap talk are they investing real dollars behind us and so it turns out we find evidence that it's a ladder that in fact they are some of the largest producers of alternative energy blockage in the world right they're incented to do exactly this but we see this being measured by just an amount of lobbies they're doing and the number of low-carbon projects right and kind of carbon capture projects and carbon abatement products you can measure either that equal weighted terms number of projects the amount of capex that they're putting in here capex dollars and also in wattage right so all those three measures of kind of money where your mouth is um and so we see that in other measures of these two that try to measure so this is uh something that came out that was estimated by raymond james we see it across all of these different measures of kind of real money that we put in so the takeaway that are producing this factor this innovation that we're gonna need to solve this problem so we think that's an intriguing and maybe a little bit of of an odd relationship that we want to dig into more okay so they seem to be not only investing more into this but investing in the higher quality outputs and so given this over here
