i'm alberto cavallo in in this newspaper's joint work with kolecsky kristoff and um we're gonna try to understand what has been happening uh during a recovery crisis with inflation and as this chart shows uh for various countries i'm plotting here the annual inflation rates uh during the covet crisis you can see that inflation did not fall by much at the beginning and then it has rebounded quite quickly leading to a big debate about the potential causes and one of the hypotheses that has been widely discussed but for which we have relatively little data so far is the fact that shortages and supply disruptions have been playing an important role and that's what we're going to try to answer with this paper um now the data we use is data collected online part of my work with the billion prices project over the years has been to try to leverage information that is available on the websites of large retailers that sell both online and offline and i'm gonna extend that work here today to try to measure shortages the data collection process is relatively straightforward behind every website we see there's a very structured language and you can teach a software to identify pieces of information that you're interested in storing into a database for the purposes of this paper we focus on basically 70 large retailers in seven countries that actually show out of stock information that we can use to uh measure the shortages in a wide range of consumer goods to give you an idea of the how representative the sample is on the last column of this table we're showing you here the coverage of the goods cpi uh weights in the cpi baskets and it's roughly between 52 to 80 percent depending on the country for an average of 65 percent of the weights of goods in the cpi so it's a fairly large sample of goods covering a important part of the cpi basket now how do are we going to measure stockouts from this information well when you go to any website you can actually see that the retailers sometimes they put these banners or signs and say i'm sorry this product is currently unavailable i'm sure many of you have experienced this over the past year and a half we're gonna count those products as a share of the total available each day for sale and introduce a measure of temporary stockholders we call them temporary because in a way the retailer is suggesting that they're hoping to bring these goods back now as the pandemic progressed um many of these goods actually started disappearing from the stores completely and and we're gonna call those permanent stock outs and measure just a fraction of items relative to pre-pandemic levels that have completely disappeared and these are you can think of them as discontinued goats and and we're going to aggregate up we're going to measure these in different categories at disaggregated levels but we're going to aggregate them up using cpi weights to get a measures of stock outs that are comparable to the cpi uh statistics that we can also use to measure the impact on inflation so this chart here on figure 2 is showing you in particular the stockhouse dynamics in the u.s i'm going to focus on the u.s first and then at the end tell you about other countries you can see so-called levels on the left rising from an average level in 2019 that was roughly between 14 13 14 increasing very quickly in march of 2020 as the covet pandemic struck reaching 35 there's a period during the summer of 2020 when things seem to improve and the stockouts fail but since then we have experienced several spikes in stockouts the first one in september of 2020 again in january and yet another one in may where our sample stops or the chart on the right shows you in fact that the characteristics of the stockouts have changed so the temporary stockouts are very visible because when you go to these websites or to a physical store this would be goats that have a sign that says this is out of stock and those temporary stock outs as you can see on the on the graph here on the on the red line increased a lot at the beginning of pandemic but then seemed to fall back down to normal level or even below normal levels by september of 2020 in the us now what has been increasing consistently during the crisis are what we're calling the permanent stockouts and these are less visible they're not so obvious simply because the goods are no longer on display at all on the websites um we may all feel it to some extent that there's less variety but as you can see in the blue line here there was an increase a dramatic increase in this permanent so-called discontinuous goods at the beginning of the pandemic again things seemed to improve towards the middle of the of uh of the summer of 2020 some retailers were bringing the goods back but then there's been a gradual increase in worsening of the situation and in fact by may of 2020 the u.s are experiencing a very large share of uh these discontinued goats and shortages um as well so these are um not just changing in their nature but also the sectors that are being affected exchanging here i'm plotting a normalized set of stock out measures relative to initial levels in each sector you can see that at the beginning the stockouts affected nearly every second sector by different magnitudes but then over time some sectors recovered in particular for example a sector such as other goods which include personal care products healthcare goods and furnishing and household goods have tended to improve while sectors like food and electronics have experienced persistent shortages that continued quite strongly towards the end of our sample in may we we then move on to the analysis of what is the impact on inflation we have stockouts information but we also have detailed information about the prices of each one of these goods so we can build our own inflation metrics are very desegregated sectors and see first if there's any correlation between sectors that we're experiencing higher stock outs in sectors that were experiencing higher inflation and that's basically what you're looking at here just a simple correlation table that shows that is some sectors like electronics where the stockholders have been particularly persistent we can detect the very high correlation between the level of stockouts and the annual inflation rates in those sectors if you look overall the all the sample of goods um this coefficient is basically telling you that the increase we're observing of of base roughly 10 to 30 percent in the stockhold level would be associated with an increase in the year-on-year inflation rate the annual inflation rate of about a 0.6 percent in the u.s but as i said it's mostly affecting categories where these uh stockholders have been more persistent now we obviously these are just contemporaneous rates and the effects of the stockholders may take a while to actually impact the the prices of some of these codes so what we do in this paper we have several specifications that try to capture uh these with lag regression coefficients and you can see here basically an estimated input response on how the monthly inflation rate at a very disaggregated sectoral level is affected by a shock to a stock out that we initially consider to be exogenous and you can see a very gradual increase for the first couple of weeks nothing is observable but then there's a rapid increase that reaches a a peak on on week number six and then the effect disappears roughly after uh three weeks we sorry three months we stopped seeing any inflation effect so it's a trend it's transitory by nature after the shock happens now you may be thinking these are uh you know a strong assumption to assume the stockouts are exogenous obviously the firms are deciding when they're facing these cost pressures both the stockouts and the in the and their prices so we do have a an attempt to estimate the underlying replacement cost which is not observable we do so by uh introducing some structure through a model of a monopolistic firm with inventories that has to decide um how much to hold over time depending on the expectations of what will cost and the month will be in the future now the model predicts a relationship that we can estimate in the data between the firm's price the cost and the probability of a stock out and we use that relationship to create an estimate of costs at the sector level now i'm going to focus in here on the last column in this table to highlight the estimated cost for all stockholders when we put temporary impermanent together and you can see that our estimates suggest that the costs the underlying costs for example in electronics has increased between january 2020 and april 2021 by about four percent uh followed by uh roughly half of an effect of of that magnitude sorry in household goods and also uh food and beverages relatively very little estimate for a cost increase in health care and other goods which where we have not seen much of a stock now if we instead of measuring the the impulse response to the stock out shock we do it with respect to this estimated underlying cost we get a similar picture although the the effect is actually um happening faster and uh even more transitory um so but but qualitatively the the the conclusion is the same there's a significant effect that is transitory in nature now in other countries we have similar stock dynamics on a broad basis there are interesting differences as well that are discussed in the paper and i won't go in detail but i will point out the countries where we find the stockholders to be more persistent are the us canada and germany and those turn out also to be the countries where we find more of an effect on inflation so there's clearly a correlation between those two uh barriers so just to summarize the key results we document the widespread increase in shortages during the pandemic the composition and perhaps visibility of these shortages has changed over time we moved from temporary stockouts affecting nearly all cathedrals of goods to permanently discontinued goods concentrated in fewer sectors now the inflation impact that we estimate is significant in peaks after about a couple of months it's actually quite quick in that sense uh it's concentrated in sectors and countries where the stockholders have been more persistent which suggests that retailers have realized after a while that the costs are uh here to stay to some extent and uh they have decided to pass that on into their prices the effects are transitory and they disappear after three months but that doesn't mean that the that the stock outs have to be a transitory in fact we we find them to be quite high still uh at the end of our sample so we believe the inflation outlook for covet will greatly depend on how quickly the shortages disappear thank you very much
