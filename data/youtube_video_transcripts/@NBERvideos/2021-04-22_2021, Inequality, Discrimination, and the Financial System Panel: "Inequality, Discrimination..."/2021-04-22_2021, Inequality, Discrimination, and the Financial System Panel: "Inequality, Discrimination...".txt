in the opening remarks if each of you could talk a little bit about how you have thought about the topic of the conference which is inequality and discrimination in the financial system as you know the participants here are interested in thinking about these issues from the context of financial system obviously you have thought about this more broadly but each of you could potentially talk for a few minutes about how you've thought about these things and then i'll channel back whatever issues come up uh to each of you so sean this this topic um uh for me is israeli i would describe it as a labor of love and rather than looking at it from the perspective of inequality um and discrimination i think of it from the perspective of equality and fairness so when you think about um what we do as hr practitioners and particularly those of us that are working in financial services it is all about how first of all our first mission as hr practitioners is to ensure that we are creating opportunities and engendering an environment for um employees colleagues associates to um reach their their best to excel at their respective endeavors because when you think about the workforce the more engaged you you the more engaged the workforce the better opportunity your company has for achieving its business objectives so so we think a lot about this subject um and what has occurred especially i would say um following the events of last summer in minneapolis and we're all very much aware of the prevailing court case a lot of companies have really uh taken up the mantle to ensure that the practices within that company within those companies are practices that um encourage fairness and diversity and not discourage it so to speak and there are a number of things that we do as a company at tiaa we we focus on um is there fairness around how we recruit and attract talent ensuring that there is a diverse slate of candidates once a person comes to the company we think about mobility how are people seeking and achieving career development opportunities do we have a fear in performance management rating system are one class of employees disproportionately rated lower than another class of of employees so a lot of our processes are geared around this subject of equality um and and fairness so i think that's our sum it up with uh with that of meat thanks thanks sean uh yeah usually if mba students that i'm teaching come late i cold call them so it says this is this was consistent then remind me not to take your class yeah that's what my students also say uh raphael did you want to uh say a few words as well from your perspective on this issue thank you sure sure ahmed and and thank you and good morning everyone it's really good to be here a couple things first i also wanted to start by saying in thinking about this space you know one of the overarching themes that that i have in my mind i keep in my mind is that financial systems inherently are not benign they have a history and that history uh does impact people differentially uh depending on what their backgrounds are and and where they are relative to um to where where the systems development started um there are three things i wanted to just uh put a flag down on for this the first is really how we think about uh discrimination from a theoretical perspective and um you know in in you know much of the mainstream treatment of discrimination assumes that the discriminating party is willing to incur less in terms of returns to satisfy the utility they get from discriminating what that ignores i think is the reality that in many instances the discriminating party actually is better off by discriminating and that there is a lot of profit that occurs through this discriminating action now what that means is that the equilibrium that is achieved i think is less than a global equilibrium uh but there is an equilibrium nonetheless and there's actually a lot of history on this uh if you think about blockbusting or predatory lending or at least to own mortgages or how municipal bond markets have worked there's a good historian in chicago dustin jenkins who's written on this all showing that there are biases inherent in this such that um the people who are affected are much worse off but the people who are and who are doing the biases are actually better off they're doing better and so we do get an equilibrium and it's a stable one it's just not the global equilibria and so theories that that approach that i think can be helpful uh in getting us to think hard about what it is where we're facing what we're dealing with uh a second thing i would i would point to is very much where sean was and this idea about policies and processes and what their role is in facilitating or inhibiting discrimination discriminatory act action i actually was thinking about this in the context of the trial in minneapolis because in many is actually a conversation i was having last week in many instances when we see uh practices of discrimination people want to call it it's a bad actor or a bad apple uh and and it's not about the system and the question i have is like if there's one bad apple that's one thing but if you have 5 000 of them you really have to start to ask is it that we have just a lot of bad actors or do we have a system that enables those bad actors to be bad actors and and that there may be some benefit from inhibition so i guess the question i had was is there a tipping point where you can tell whether the system is enabling or inhibiting and what would that look like in terms of an identification scheme or or that kind of practice which i think is is it's something that's come to mind a lot in terms of think about how we talk about this then the third area i would just point to um as another thing i've been thinking about is that particularly in finance i did a lot of my early work in underwriting and um and credit allocation in mortgages and other things um you used to be if you did the aggregate average numbers you would see disparities minorities are denied more um they get fewer loans all that kind of stuff and then you start applying control so it can go like income like wealth uh education of the family the the challenge we have is that each of those controls actually has race embedded in it uh and so because there is a is my my predecessors were not allowed to buy houses uh for many many years we weren't allowed to participate in social security so the ability of people in their their their older years to save money that can be passed on is just less and so the controls that we have actually are endogenous to the problem that we're looking at uh and it's and and the way i've been thinking about it in more colloquial terms is that uh today's people are penalized because of things that their ancestors were not allowed to do and how we how we execute uh and this is something i think we need to think very fundamentally about history matters and the the the arc of time uh and the patterns really affect what is actually accessible to people uh and i think it's something we need to really have conversations about uh and and see if there are alternative ways to approach it first to quantify it and then then think about how do we get around it to new solutions so i was supposed to be five minutes i think i was a little longer than that but uh marianne i think i'll turn it to you right thank you so much and rafael to be honest where i wanted to start is exactly uh kind of where you where you ended up um and this is not what i was planning when i when i first thought about joining this panel i thought it was going to talk me about what has been most of my research focus recently which has been more related to gender but um you know hearing chris palmer kind of really um you know wonderful discussion of the last paper and um stressing i think this really important point as economists we've been focused on two models of discrimination statistical and taste based and we've uh we've made an industry of trying to separate between these two models and one publication in top journals if we manage to say something about one versus the other and i think we kind of got lost you know somewhat into that because these two models you know at some point become very very similar to one another um you know as chris you know articulated you know you can think about you know models of self-fulfilling prophecy is you know something that starts space-based you know ends up you know kind of looking statistical and i think we are spending too much time thinking about the difference between those two models but furthermore and that's really kind of going back to you know kind of rougher last points um over the last you know since the summer i think you know we've learned we've heard a lot about systemic racism and certainly i as an economist have struggled with what exactly does that mean and how do i think about that that's not part of my models that's not that's nowhere but i think what rafael said you know to me is is is really truly important and one way i've learned to think about systemic racism and i'll give you an example and i think it's particularly relevant when you think about you know think about financial markets um not so long ago i was i was on a call with um the ceo of an organization that used to be uh accion accent chicago but it's a non-profit that makes um that makes loans to uh to small business and you know kind of the ceo of this company is not a racist and i'm sure that if he were to kind of go have his data and try to see whether or not when you run you know kind of put a raised on me in his decision about making loans the raise dummy would not show up like he's not a racist but yet he made the following realization which is that because he puts weight on collateral in the decision of whether or not to make a loan that is going to end up being used and why i mean i think you had a very good way of like saying this because of a history of like racial segregation because of the history of slavery we have big wealth differences historical wealth differences between black and poor being between black and white and so by putting weight on collateral i end up making decisions that are racist even though you know kind of if i were to run the models and i feel like as an economist i've been running forever there would be no race dummy that would emerge from you know my analysis of this of his lending decision and i think that you know i think that's a really really powerful point especially when you think about finance if we think about where you know a history of racism in this country is going to be particularly long-lasting it is when it comes to wealth accumulation and this is where i think we need to kind of really draw much more attention and think about uh the implications the implications of so sorry i feel like it's a repeat of what rafael said but that was really kind of top of mind and um kind of especially because of chris kind of really great discussion so i'll stop there and i'm happy to talk about gender i'm happy to talk about diversity and inclusion and all that stuff but maybe i'll stop here for a moment all right great uh set of uh remarks and uh things for us to uh talk about a bit more uh maybe i can uh start a little bit with sean first sean uh you you mentioned uh how you you spend time thinking about both screening and when once you hire thinking about career progression mobility and so on as economists we spend a lot of time thinking that we can collect data do analysis and come up with ways in which you know we can make the system better so in your experience which has been vast and you spend a lot of time in finance sector are there things that matter when you do these things in terms of data uh was any rating uh that you did inside the firm uh useful both for hiring as well as for mobility and career progression uh from from those perspectives um yes i would say i mean more so than the strength of the data it what what makes the biggest difference in my view view is the strength of the character of the leadership of of of the enterprise this um sort of relentless uh pursuit of ensuring that there is fairness in in in the workplace and the data in a lot of instances is very telling i i recall an an instance where we um were analyzing uh the performance ratings across the across the company and what we observed in some instances in some parts of the business particularly on the operations side we saw some statistical anomalies where one class of employees was seemingly rated lower than another class of employees and when we sort of dug into it we realized part of the problem was not so much the ratings but part of the problem where the performance objectives that drove the the rating we had made a mistake by creating the same performance objectives for people who are new in a row as as versus those that have had some experience in that role and we recognize if when you create performance objectives those objectives apart from being measurable they should also be achievable and think of a sports player we don't judge a rookie nba player or nfl player with the same statistics that we judge someone who has had a lot more experience and much more of a journeyman or a woman in in that field and we need to apply that same principle if you're going to be if you are new in a role your performance subjective should correlate to that to that experience and it should be achievable so when you when you rely on the data um you do have an opportunity to sort of discover anomalies and then obviously correct them uh thanks sean uh raphael uh you know sean has talked a lot a lot about uh data and leadership and so on and you and marianne talked about things which are basically prescribed as rules out there and some of these rules if we follow we are implicitly doing discrimination uh if we don't take into account that the endowments of whoever is out there matters clearly and that changes the way we think about an equilibrium now inside the fed uh how are you thinking about this because you know fed has an issue like the rest of the profession in terms of the composition uh of uh its employees as well as the rules it sets up so obviously it's a major change if you want to do something about it leadership like sean said is important so how are you tackling this and thinking about this well let me just uh echo what sean said at the beginning of his second remark which is that leadership does matter and intentionality is important uh and you you actually if you want to make progress you have to look and you have to know what the data are and you have to to look deeply into that so at our bank we've been doing that for a long time um throughout the staff so so we know exactly where there are disparities we do it by race we do it by gender we do it by experience we we actually try to know the what's going on in our institution at a very deep level and then once once we understand sort of the what uh then we can sort of dive into the why and these things become very very complicated some of what sean was talking about is actually true and there's been a lot of discussion that we've had about you know how are we writing our job descriptions uh are we falling back on uh simple heuristics that may have biases and embedded in them are we tying much more to pedigree than skill for example um in making assessments about whether people can do things and what they can do and so so we're looking at all those sorts of things i would also say that um we are um really trying to understand where the pool is and where our potential employees are going to come from and they're finding that that's a challenge so in economics in particular um they're just so there's just so many people that are out there that have the diverse profile and so that's that's why i like doing these sorts of things to um to help people who are not from traditional backgrounds see that the field cares about this is thinking about this and trying to do right by this i think that's an important signal that we have to send collectively the other thing i would also say on this is that i've become increasingly sensitive to the reality that um experiences drive staff expectations and those expectations will then drive staff behavior so if you're a staff member and you believe for whatever reason that african-american women are only going to be promoted to a certain level then if you're an african-american woman you're going to be less less willing to apply for things because you're going to see in your mind that that's just going to be a waste of your time and waste your effort you're not going to get that anyway so some of what we're also trying to do is um really deal with expectations and i would just say this expectations issue shows up in many places in finance so if you think about our people applying for refinancing we know that african americans apply less frequently i think part of that is because many of them are lucky feel that they're lucky they got the first mortgage and aren't going to even bother trying for the second one because you know to what ex what's the likelihood of lightning striking twice and so so thinking about those sorts of things and how the system and people's perceptions of the system drives behavior is something that we're really trying to unpack both internally to our institution but also more broadly in terms of how these markets function i mean there um the two two things um everything you said raphael resonate but two in particular for me was your discussion on the on the job descriptions um we actually went through a process of really taking a more rigorous and more clinical approach to job descriptions because we found that we had job descriptions that had sort of these arbitrary requirements must have eight years of this well why is it eight as opposed to six as opposed as opposed to ten and then that led us to an uh another discovery which is the a person's experience and um suite of skills should help inform that person's ability or that person's propensity to learn and and to grow so when we find ourselves caught in this trap of well this person doesn't have this exact experience i'm looking for well have they demonstrated that they are a continuous nerd have they demonstrated that they have a work ethic if they have demonstrated that that means they have potential and why are we not providing that opportunity because it's pretty hard to have um to to have a skill without getting experience and that experience had to start at a a point in time thanks thanks sean and rafael um may i ask like you you've looked at obviously not just racial and gender discrimination but spent a lot of time thinking about governance and so on as well and is this notion of leadership or governance something that you've seen in your research mattering and in particular i'm thinking like is there something special about finance that stands out when you when you think about the kind of work you've done or is this something that is you know it's true everywhere and uh you know finance we just think that finance is special but these kind of things happen everywhere so if you might be able to comment a little bit on this i know um i mean i can provide a very incomplete answer to this question again i think about you know this matters more from a from a label market context so i can try to think about answering this question in terms of like what it means you know but if there's something special about working in finance versus working in all the sectors of the economy and and and again even more narrowly answering this question i you know kind of think about gender and working in finance i think there are a few things that are special i mean we know that these are you know these are occupations where you know kind of there's a lot of inflexibility where there is a lot of you know kind of fairly long hours where there are sometimes expectations about you know kind of aggressivity and lots of risk taking and all of these kind of colleagues of working in finance have had you know kind of negative um implications for women's representation in uh in those sectors i think when it comes to like the the structure of the work the long hours the inflexibility we have you know really really good evidence that those are job characteristics that make it very difficult for women that are trying to combine their career with you know other responsibilities that they have that they have in the home so the financial sector because of the way the jobs can remain structured um as uh creates particular uh particular hurdles uh for women when it comes to you know all the future of these jobs such as you know kind of um kind of more aggressivity maybe more risk-taking there i think it's it's a longer conversation one could have but it is true that there are stereotypes that you know kind of people have about women that you know and the stereotypes that women you know should not you know be as aggressive should be nicer and you know if women are endogenizing those stereotypes if these certain apps become prescriptive then women start kind of you know presenting traits at work that then may hurt the ability to progress uh further uh further in the workplace but that's also my chance to kind of say another bit which i really wanted to you know kind of bring in this in the context of this panel and again thinking about you know kind of the role of research um there is a cottage industry and i'm going to focus on gender here but there's a college industry of papers i get very well published that you know kind of tell us that there are systematic differences you know between you know between the genders competition risk aversion the ability to negotiate etc etc and i i really worry very much about you know publication bias and the fact that it's easier to get you know papers i find you know kind of gender differences to get published like papers that do not find such gender differences while when what looks at more meta-analysis on these questions the key hypothesis that seem to emerge is that across a wide range of traits you find way more similarities among the genders and differences or another way to put it is that there might be sometimes small differences in means between men and women on a certain traits but those difference in means and minimal given the within gender variation and i think it's a really important point because i think the more we repeat those narratives you know in our research it's more likely to get picked up in the media the more difficult we make it to progress and move away from um these stereotypes which you know kind of keep on enabling often inaccurate beliefs and have um kind of ricochet effects for a woman's career so i totally agree with that and and i would also say um some of these differences are also endogenous like i feel like society uh drives some of these differences in creating expectations about how people are supposed to behave and interact and you see this in gender but you also see this across a lot of ethnicities so i had a discussion with some of my asian employees and they were telling me that you know when they were growing up there this asian culture says the the the nail that's sticking out gets hammered down right as opposed to instead of a more western you know the squeaky wheel gets the oil type of approach and so those sorts of issues um are not actually inherent to the person it's sort of what the person has learned through through many many years and um and they are potentially penalized by that another thing i would ask is you know do are the things that we see as fundamental parts of our culture say the aggressiveness and finance or whatever it is are they essential for being excellent in the field or are they just things that a place we've evolved to this place um and so that's just how it is and we've now assumed that you have to be that way to be great is that actually true and um to what extent should we be challenging that notion to say there are many ways to get the pathway to success and and and the positive outcome uh and that we should be challenging our culture i think the field of economics in general uh needs to be thinking about this in terms of you know how we do our seminars and how we interact with each other at a basic level um it has worked for some but for others who could have been potentially outstanding it's been off-putting and then we lose them from the field and that's a loss for all of us so thanks marian and rafael sean maybe because you've spent such a long time uh from uh hr and you've thought about some of these issues uh and being in finance you you're probably getting the same selection that we in finance study when we study the financial sector in terms of who is applying for jobs and who's then moving across in the firm or their career how do you manage like do you find that folks who work in finance are different in the way they behave is there more stereotype in such individuals and what can an organization do like pia in terms of trying to de-bias or get the stereotype out in terms of how decisions are getting taken and so on because the the reason i'm asking i'll just preempt it is because uh one of the objectives i'm hoping of this panel is that i throw out for the audience and whoever is listening uh the kind of things that we can do uh as academics in terms of our research so anything that you can tell us that has worked in your experience is very useful because uh you know we only look at data we don't know exactly inside the firm what has been working and what is not yeah having worked in six companies so i was at i've been at um super large companies mid-sized companies small companies i was at i was at merrill lynch um i was at a small bond you mentioned um the municipal bond market earlier raphael i was at fijic as the chro there i worked in vermont i was in tokyo for two years and london for three uh legos for one and i say that only to say and this is gonna appear to be very unscientific and i i recognize and appreciate i'm among a very scientific cohort here it is my experience that the biggest driver that determines behavior is the culture of the company um so it's it's less of a case of finance versus the airline industry hospitality industry it's more of um what is the culture of that company is that culture collaborative or is that is that culture contentious or is it constructively in engaging and one of the um virtues i feel of of working at tiaa and why roger ferguson was so perfectly um compatible to to who we are and we feel the same about deshawn the brown duck its arrival is that the ensuring that it's a culture of respect and dignity where people have an opportunity to express um difference of opinions without fear of reprisals that that people can challenge each other respectfully that we can provide feedback to each other on an ongoing basis and both good as well as developmental feedback that those are the attributes that really drive the behavior of an organization i mean one thing you would add here is that you know obviously as a researcher what we we're missing is is access to data and access to company data inability to try to evaluate what's happening and what has been successful what's not successful so if i think about you know again since the summer it is very clear that lots of companies are rolling out you know antibiotics training program and um my guess is that that's what most of them have been doing um i don't think we have you know kind of systematic evidence that it that works most likely it doesn't work but we need to document you know an ability to document that and absence access to any kind of company data this makes it really impossible this is a call to whoever is on this panel has access to like corporate partners that are really serious not just paying lip service to the issue but really want to be agents of change to say that we can you know we can help that's kind of we're good with data so we can we can try to think about you know kind of really ways to evaluate and assess what's what's working and what's not and marianne have you have you explored getting access to the company's um engagement results data the the sort of you know companies that do all of these i think no so i've not and i'd love to talk to you about this offline i think the main issue that we face as researchers and i'm guessing many of the people in this you know in this panel have tried many times to you know kind of engage with companies on issues related to gender and racial you know racial gaps is you know very often you find some very willing people inside of the company but then the the legal council shows up and that's kind of basically the end of the affair so um they i think though that if we want to make progress rather than just having a year of like antibiotics training program that don't do anything happening and we feel like we've solved the problem we need to find ways to engage with uh with corporations and maybe the solution is that no corporations want to be the one you know kind of um being the you know the the demonstration case of like no impact or bad results but maybe we need the coalitions of corporations that are willing to share you know to share the data and it's easier to do it as a group than than single the other thing that i wanted to say on on this point is that just you know it's it's a straightforward thing but like people talk about diversity and and um and you know people talk a lot about diversity i think we should talk much more about inclusion diversity is quite you know it's quite easy to do we can find people and put them in cooperation inclusion is much much harder and we have you know as far as i know so many as an economist you know kind of no good ways to think about how we make organizations more inclusive and this is another area when i think about future research we should team up with psychologists social psychologists people that know much more than we do about how we uh foster uh inclusivity so yeah that was a lot and i i wanted to respond to like all of it so i'm gonna just go and i may forget some things you know first on the data point um we are wrestling with that in atlanta right now so i would say this more generally corporations across the country are all recognized that this is much more of an issue than they were taking uh as the point i think and they're willing to do things but then the question is what are the things that you should do and one of these questions the issues is how much are you going to track how much are you going to report and how much are you going to share and there's a tension uh the general counsels i have a general counsel as well so they don't want no no general counsel's view is no is the best answer because then it just keeps you from being in trouble like there's no risk and no um but i actually think there is risk in the sense that by if you don't really know that the the data and the reality it's hard to fix something like you can't fix something you don't know is broken so we have to do that um chambers of commerce across the country are all engaging with their membership to find ways to engage and there's a debate going on among many of them to what extent are they going to ask the members that have taken pledges and things to report data and to what extent is that data going to be allowed to be made public uh and those are things that are are very important questions i think if it's a collective it's more likely to succeed so going to the u.s chamber or maybe if you see chambers in particular areas and engaging in conversations to say would you share your information with us as a collective de-identified you know all that kind of stuff um i think there is some possibility of that happening uh marianne you also talked about andy bias training i actually think some of them work and some of them don't but but whether that happens i think is tied to where sean was talking about about the leadership and the commitment of the institution to take the learnings and then institutionalize them some do it as a check the box yeah i got to have buyers training so we're just going to do it and i can say we did it others are like well now this buyer's fan is actually giving me information that i can really use on a day-to-day basis and what would be interesting from a research perspective this may be where engagement could be helpful is trying to distinguish between those two types of firms like is there a way to identify them and then potentially link that to outcomes because you know one of my um underlying tenants and sort of approaches to everything is if people see something successful they'll run and do it so if we can demonstrate that's that inclusion and that success and that attention to anti-bias actually makes your organization work better people will then start running to it so if there are ways to show that if there's an evidence base that's a that's a body of research that could be a whole lot bigger um just to understand sort of how that plays out another the last thing is you talked about inclusion we changed the name of our organization uh internally focused on this to the office of diversity equity and inclusion and those are actually three different things and they need to be treated differently and acknowledge that you know diversity is nice you need to understand that but if you have diversity but don't have equity because people are all coming to your organization in different places um the outcomes are not going to play out you're not going to get the most out of your staff and then inclusion is like what are the the more um institutional cultural structural things that are preventing everyone from participating to their fullest extent and how and that's a whole different issue um so so the solutions for the various things uh i think are are um are needed to be distinct and so so a field sort of how should we think about inclusion what how do we define it what does it look like from an observational perspective what measures i think that that's a rich rich area where um where we don't have as much as we should so i totally agree with what you're saying all right there is one more theme that i wanted to uh touch on before i open the floor for questions and that that's related to lots of papers that were in the conference and if you look more broadly in the nbr working paper series that comes out every week you see this flavor that you know with with advent of uh tech and lots of big data and ai uh there's a perception that maybe this is something that will help us address some of the challenges we have certainly data allows us to be able to maybe better disclose things and maybe disclosure is a interesting thing to put in front of everyone because at least it gets diversity up you talked about challenges in inclusion and equity that's not going to change with just data and disclosure but do you all have any views on whether tech is going to be useful or is going to be creating its own set of problems because certainly lots of people talk about biases that come in algorithms and other things too which is another pandora's box i i feel but do you all have any views on on this probably raphael this affects you the most directly because uh you have your supervisors going inside banks and trying to use their their models and so on and but anyone please rafael you want to start i'm having to start i mean i think yeah i do personally see you know kind of some um you know some hope that you know kind of technology could be used you know for the better especially when it comes to you know addressing um you know implicit bias in you know think about again hr you know hr decision uh or you know we've done you know we've seen some work on you know how judges could be equipped with you know kind of algorithmic models to make the decision um so i think there's it's definitely i think an area of of hope as you said yourself i mean i think it's it's tricky because you know kind of we need data to train you know to find this algorithm and to the extent that the data they can be trained on was data that you know kind of was based on decisions that were made by you know people that had those biases it's going to be hard to you know kind of end up you know with the algorithms that if you know that taking the bias away so but but i do think this is obviously an area of great interest for the future and and i think there's a talking to a lot of people that are on the computer science of all of these things it's actually quite interesting to me that what they seem to be most interested on is how humans you know kind of would use the algorithm right so there's a model where we're going to replace the human with the algorithm the other models where we're going to leave you know discretion to the human to make decisions but we'll also you know give him or her the result of the algorithm and how that combination of human decision you know supported by you know kind of my data will change or change outcome is interesting but um the other thing that the final thing that i would say is that you know algorithm as a as i said in my first intervention in thinking about finance think about you know kind of environment where you know wealth accumulation is going to be a big factor you know algorithm i'm not going to solve you know issues i have to do more with the history of racism that means that there are systematic differences between the gender in terms of how much wealth between the race in terms of wealth um and and collateral so we need something else to address you know to address that so marianne that was well said i i would just i'd say when i think about technology i really think about really the very the varying sources of bias um and um so we know that there are biases just observationally so every human when they look at and they see someone biases are going to happen that we are hardwired for that technology can take those sorts of biases out because the assessor doesn't actually look at things so you know they won't know what the race of people's pictures on mantels will be in appraisals for example and so that will become less of an issue so that can be helpful the other thing that things technology can do is it can narrow the gray area to some extent so i think about some of my earliest research was on automated underwriting and um its ability to um reduce bias in wider bands of sort of mortgage lending now what that was not able to do was eliminate gray areas altogether so that so even in that context there were still places where discretion was going to come into play but the technology caused that that those circumstances be far fewer than what we saw in the past and so that you can you can make benefits in those regard but anytime there's discretion you're going to have this issue and technology in and of itself won't eliminate that more broadly so we have to be mindful of that and then one thing that i agree with marianne on if the in the data putting it going in has bias embedded then the system's gonna have bias embedded but one other thing i worry about is in these um ai type systems where they're the systems learn through experience like how do we track what the learning is to make sure that they're not learning biases and keying on things that would lead us to uh results and bias and how would you monitor that and how and and you know how would you go about uh in overseeing governing regulating that kind of system i think that is a that's a real challenge that we have to face because as far as i know understand these systems there aren't constraints on what the system can learn uh and the learning begins with a human being yeah and so exactly so there is um there's some risk there that we're going to have to think about principles and practices to try to avoid the the worst outcomes sean did you want to add to this like no no i i think it was very well captured by raphael and mary and the point i was just making is that to raphael's point with with the ai uh is that the stuff a human being is the one that starts to starts the um ai to begin to learn so it starts with a human all right why don't i uh open the floor to the uh folks attending if you want to ask a question to the panelists please please raise your hand and uh i'll i'll ask you to uh you can uh all right so i already see manju i see taran so so manju did you want to start yeah sure thanks amit this was a fascinating panel discussion so we want to thank all the panelists and a couple of questions so so one was you know there was talk about how big data can reduce bias because the human bias is seeing someone and the reaction isn't there but there's also the other point that you raised earlier that it's not just using race and gender variables explicitly there are all these other variables with the history and some of them we know about and some of them maybe we don't even know about but big data can unearth them right and so that seems like like a huge challenge um you know and how do you monitor it and and how do you how do you figure that out that was one question the second question i had was you know i thought a very interesting point that you made on culture and how important culture is in an organization and marianne made the point of you know sharing the data which of course his research is we we we think would be a fabulous thing but i'm also interested in knowing just internally how do you measure if your culture has actually improved or changed typically you you see just tipping points right when there's this huge complaint of this huge scandal but suppose you do have this culture where you know the african-american lady doesn't apply for a job these are very subtle and and you know you may not you have to be very perceptive to know these things are happening so how do you even measure these in order to improve something it has to be measurable right so that you can quantify it and and so i'd be interested in hearing some thoughts there thank you so i'll speak to the second one and i'll speak on behalf of sean because he mentioned it you know one of the things that we do a lot of is engagement surveys uh to really assess the extent to which our our staff feels engaged with the institution and his mission and we use that as a proxy for the success of the culture in um in empowering people and getting them to to really um bring their whole self to work and then use all of their skills in that regard and one thing that we've seen is that there is a correlation between levels of engagement and feeling of bias and feeling that the system is not really engaged or structured to help them and changes in engagement are also signs that something different has happened in terms of how people are experiencing their institution and so you know when when sean mentioned like trying to get data on engagement surveys i think that he's exactly right as one vehicle for for capturing culture so um so that but but it's a hard thing and one thing that we do is because we know that different people come with different um backgrounds and and and affinities toward various tools we try at our bank to provide multiple channels for people to provide that feedback whether it be through an engagement survey or through our hr function or through our equal employment opportunity function or through me so i've basically told every staff member if you feel like the culture you're experiencing the bank differently than how we've talked about in terms of integrity excellence and respect you have license to send me an email and we can talk about it um and just trying to say any way possible for you to to voice that so we can be aware and try to fix it is important and then on your first point you're exactly right i think that big data can help us i hadn't really thought of it like that but can help us identify items that we may not have been aware of that we should be thinking more intensely about so that's actually a very very interesting observation thank you raphael imagine one thing i would i would add to uh raphael's great comments is as follows in terms of a real life example we we conduct engagement surveys multiple times during the year in in 2019 and when we when we do the survey it's important to appreciate that it's cut in all different ways it's cut by age it's cut by gender it's cut by ethnicity it's cut by rule it's cut by city um it's cut in the home in a myriad of of variables we discovered in 2019 that generally speaking colleagues of color at a particular level of the organization and below raise abject concerns around mobility career development my opportunity to move through the organization in in 2020 um even despite the challenges of the pandemic we recommitted ourselves to mobility we we looked at the data and we discovered that disproportionately we tended to place people in roles as opposed to relying on a posting system um we established um clear governance around that we will we will post more roles and place less roles and as a consequence of that we can see how we have made traction on on career development and mobility and in 2020 when we looked at our engagement results it reflected that so so we had two data points one data point is we could actually see the progress that we're making around career development the other data point is the people that are filling out the survey are expressing a greater level of satisfaction than they did before so i agree with everything that rafael um articulated just just super quickly i agree with all that was said i mean a variable that on the issue of um the the measurement of the culture i mean there's one variable that very often people kind of mentioned to me which is like a sense of belonging and that's you know and one of the key variable you may want to look at on your other questions about you know about the about the models i i really think it's it's going to be exciting so once we have access to this data and say that we can agree again think about finance and access to loans you know let's say that we could agree on a list of variables that we think are really reflecting our history of racism i think would be fantastic to go and like run some algorithms to try to predict whatever we care about which is like likelihood of default or repayment running some of these algorithms with and without you know those features that we know are most likely to be reflecting a history of racism so that would give us a sense of like what are we leaving on the table financially by ignoring from all decisions especially those features where we know that you know black and white are going to be at very different places because of where this country comes from so i think the frontiers of research questions are you know are really super super exciting
