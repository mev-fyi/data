[Music] there's a refrain in the theme song for the 1960s movie to serve with love that includes the words how do you thank someone who's taken you from crayons to perfume and while i was a bit beyond crayons when i met you as a college sophomore and i've never as nancy will tell you but much on perfume the words capture exactly the sentiment that i want to express today marty when i walked through your door at 1737 cambridge street i was a student looking for a summer job and planning to go to law school and walking through that door was a portal into a totally different life experience within a few months you had taught me the excitement of economic research and the power that it can have i met a collection of fantastic graduate students and i discovered that the world of economic research was a place where i could actually imagine spending uh the rest of my life and that's all something i owe to you and it's an incredible day in the spring of my sophomore year i mustered the courage to write to marty and to ask him if he had a need for a summer research assistant a few weeks later after a meeting of american economic policy one of his graduate students neda asa tapped me on the shoulder and said that marty would like to speak to me after class in the short walk to my next class he changed the course of my life he offered me a summer research assistantship at the nber alongside andrew samwick one of his proteges i kept my desk at nber for the next two and a half years and i experienced all the nber had to offer including summer institute program meetings seeing graduate students work late hours into the night i read newspapers alongside claudia goldin and larry katz i shared research ideas with graduate students and faculty passing through marty created a community of researchers of mentors of friends that have lasted my entire lifetime and i hope will last for many years to come he inspired me to become an academic economist working with marty to found the economics of education program at the nber and working with him more generally as a program director has probably been the most formative experience of my career i was able to see the nbr's incredible growth and change under marty's leadership while the nber was a special place before marty it became a remarkably special place with him at the helm he put in place it's marvelous loose tight structure and insisted on its vigorous discussion for us and let's never forget what a personal interest marty took in the working papers and program meetings we're all grateful for your leadership your stewardship of the nber you made it what it is today your presence in the classroom in the room in the op-ed corner in seats with policy makers all brought economics to life for so many of us marty you had more influence on my career than you realize in fact you may have had more influence than any other economist so you invited me to join the national bureau of economic research in 1978 when you became president and then in 79 you asked me to co-direct the pension study program and that kind of changed my career and i was all of 32 years old when you gave me that opportunity and so i became a pensions and social security and retirement expert because of the opportunity that you gave me and that really defined the second half of my career so you had an enormous influence on me i taught your your papers in class you had a range of uh interest that was better than anybody bigger than anybody's i observed you as an administrator and you were the best you added new programs at the bureau very imaginative programs you continued to offer opportunities to young people you led your staff in a great way you even kept notes in your pocket on a piece of paper or things to do and i just thought you were incredibly well organized i followed in your footsteps i modeled myself after you you taught me that teaching is an honor and an investment in our future which requires hard work patience and an open-mindedness to be done well as a scholar you have encouraged me to be driven by my own natural curiosity as opposed to external validation and that the greatest joy of research is the lifelong process of learning and discovery as a public servant you have demonstrated that service to one's country is more noble than adhering narrowly to a particular political perspective and that listening to others is the only way to achieve your goals i took two of your classes over the years i was your research assistant and the example you set not only as a teacher but also as an economist who reshaped so many literatures and also made such a contribution to public policy i think has made an enormous impact not only on me becoming an economist but also the particular types of questions i've chosen to study i don't think i would have landed in public economics and quite the way i did without your example working with you i picked up a sense of how exciting research could be and how important and influential it could be and challenge it you taught me with great patience and insight how to learn from data at the beginning of the age of tax administration data and you taught me not to take my eye off the ball as to how research could inform policy through the years you led groups of intrepid economists to many places that hadn't seen people like us before we were probably very different from the normal run of patrons at the breakers for example where we went many times during your early years as president of the nber i think it was a great experience whether it was moscow or beijing or nimrana and through the years i thank you for your guidance and your friendship marty has always been a model for me of how to be an engaged economist he cared about economic research not just for his intellectual excitement but for the difference it could make in how our economy performed he treated it very seriously he built relationships trust on issues that he cared about but he never did it by engaging in ad hominem argument or by moving to a tone that was anything other than completely civil he respected perspectives very different from his own and was equally happy to work with students who shared aspects of his ideology and who had rather different values marty became over the years a trusted advisor to president president reagan both presidents bush president obama all relied on his counsel and one thing that i know they all valued though sometimes their staffs were less enthused was that marty told them what he thought they needed to hear not what he thought they wanted to hear barney never lost sight of his obligation as an economist to call it like he saw it we understand better and we had better policy debates because of marty feldstein's contributions i think back to our long friendship and the fun we've had actually traveling all over the world what fun but then i read your pieces and i learned something all the time and of course i always feel when i read one of your pieces that i'm learning something about economics you're a teacher but then i remember a time when we were in berlin together and the euro was in the wings that hadn't been put into effect but it was coming and we were discussing it and you took it apart at the seams and every problem that has arisen since then with the euro you nailed before it came into effect so i say to myself i have a motto now pay attention to marty he gets it right i've always been impressed by the fact that when you talk about economics you talk so clearly many people can do equations and run regressions and you've done both but to talk clearly about an economic issue whether it's theory or practice is the hallmark of a great teacher and also in my view a great economist you have been an incredible friend a mentor a source of intellectual inspiration for 42 years it's been really fun and i'm incredibly grateful marty for all the time we've had together and all the incredible ways which you have influenced my life uh for this time i wanted to thank you for your friendship for your mentorship it's been an amazing experience to know you thank you marty so thank you for all those conversations and help and advice over the years i've treasured them they've been immensely valuable to me your success led to my success so i want to thank you for everything you did for me through the years i thank you for your guidance uh and your friendship thanks marty thank you mark thank you pal you
