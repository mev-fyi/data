great so I'm I'm very happy to have had a chance to read this interesting paper and to discuss it the paper does a very nice job of describing the contributions of of some of the earlier early nber work to the development of the national accounts and picking up where Hugh left off I guess I would say you know that work has held up really well I think the foundations laid by the nber researchers working in the 20s and 30s have proven to be really robust and adaptable the concepts that underlie the those initial national income and product accounts measuring current production for final demand measured where possible at market prices that's it's proven to be a very valuable piece of information to have the use of Double Entry bookkeeping so that you actually have a check on your numbers has has proven to be extremely valuable another thing that I think is proven to be valuable and it sort of comes from kuznets at the very beginning is that the rec the recognition that the accounts have limitations and that they're going to need to evolve as the economy changes I think has has proven to be important as well it's not just the sort of conceptual foundations that I think have held up well it's the model for how these numbers were going to be developed and disseminated that I think has held up well as in in addition kuznets was very clear that it was important to be clear when releasing these numbers about exactly where your data had come from and what their limitations were and I think that has served that's carried through and has served us well and and a second thing in terms of the way that the estimates are developed and disseminated is from the beginning they have been very much the result of a collaboration between the academic community on the one hand and government statisticians who are responsible for actually putting this into practice on the other hand so there's a lot to be thankful for in the work of those early nber economists Jim mentioned briefly already the the way in which the National Bureau has continued this work over the past not quite hundred years but 80 plus years and that has been through the the conference on research and income and and wealth uh the conference there's been a little bit of a disagreement about the exact dating of this but by my reading the the conference on research and income and wealth was organized in 1935 and held its first meeting in 1936 and it's continued to be a very active organization since that time there are currently 322 conference on research and income and wealth members the conference includes both academic and government researchers as well as government officials who are responsible for putting together the statistics that we we rely on the craw holds an annual conference that's a more or less annual conference on a particular topic that's a very nice forum for interaction between the research community and the the government statistician Community more recently the criw has sponsored a workshop at the nber summer Institute that's again a forum for interaction between those two groups as of late 2019 there have been 75 criw volumes published the recent ones contain or cover a wide range of topics including the measurement of prices how you measure service sector output how you measure intangible Capital Income equality has been a continuing emphasis there's been papers on non-market production and a lot of the ideas in these volumes over the last um however many years have eventually found their way into the national income and product accounts so I think this continuing collaboration has been productive that said and you know I think the the national income and product accounts are certainly more reliable today than that first initial set I don't think we'd be very happy today to discover that the um the income side estimates in the product side estimates only disagreed by seven percent I think we would find that a little alarming um but despite that process I was really struck in reading the paper by how relevant the issues that kuznets in the early other early nber researchers were wrestling with you know how timely they still seem today so they were wrestling with conceptual challenges regarding how the national income accounts should be constructed what we should be counting and how we should be counting it they were wrestling with practical challenges how were they going to compile the information necessary to put the accounts together on a timely basis and they were wrestling with producing information that would be viewed as credible and as kuznes was very clear The credibility of statistical information is absolutely essential to its having value if people don't believe it you might as well not have it so I wanted to say if a few things about each of those in terms of conceptual challenges one of the things that that kuznets was concerned about was where you draw the boundary between what's in and what's out and he commented you know that he realized that they were leaving home production out one of the things that's a conceptual challenge today is how we deal with environmental and natural resources they're not in the national income and product accounts but we know that they're extremely important to the Future well-being of our society and so accounting for that non-market activity in some sort of satellite account is something people are wrestling with there's been a lot of discussion of how we account for the information economy it used to be that Capital was plant and Equipment increasingly capital in our modern society is an information products and how do we account for that how do we account for the value of free Goods you know at Facebook using Waze on your phone and that's sort of thing so there's a lot of interesting conceptual challenges there's also some significant practical challenges putting together measures of a lot of the things that we're interested in is not that straightforward it's actually you know extremely interesting and intellectually challenging area of an Endeavor one of the things that there has been a lot of discussion about recently just to illustrate some of the Practical challenges is how we actually measure the distribution of income and the distribution of wealth accurately and there I I would have to say this isn't the forum for getting into that in detail but the debate over the EXT the extent to which resources are concentrated among those at the top of the distribution is let's just say as Lively today as it was a hundred years ago thinking about practical challenges there's there's also challenges today with regard to putting together the information that we need to produce the national income and product accounts kuznets and his colleagues were working in a very different environment they were pulling together information from multiple sources and and trying to piece things together we've evolved to a situation in which we now have a set of custom surveys that have been designed to feed the national accounts surveys that the Census Bureau does that produce information on nominal output surveys that the Bureau of Labor Statistics does that produce information on prices that let us convert nominals to reals surveys on employment and so on and so on but as I suspect many of you are aware obtaining survey responses has become more and more difficult it so that is a big challenge that the statistical agencies are wrestling with at the same time there's a lot of other data out there and figuring out ways to use big data to better support economic statistics is both I think an opportunity but also really an imperative and then finally there's the issue of maintaining The credibility of economic statistics as I already commented economic statistics really are only of value to the extent that people have confidence in them the fact that the statistical agencies you know sort of building on the initial foundations laid by kuznets and others have always attempted to be very open about their methods I think historically has bolstered confidence in the data you know even if people recognize that the measures are imperfect they are objective um but I think it's also important that there be adequate investments in maintaining and improving data quality um if if things if if that doesn't happen you know ultimately people are going to feel that the data aren't measuring what they should be measuring and will lose confidence in them for that reason so I I guess I would just like to take this opportunity to express my hope that officials who government officials who may have very different perspectives on policy will continue to agree that it's important to have sound data to inform the choices that we're making and there are I think reasons for optimism I recently had the opportunity to chair the commission on evidence-based policy making which was a very bipartisan effort um spearheaded and initiated by a former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray who were you know very much in agreement that data to inform and evidence to inform policy was important but I I hope that that will hold sway so let me conclude and say thank you for the opportunity to discuss this very interesting paper great thank you very much
