so welcome to this panel on leveraging new data to measure and breast racial disparities we have uh three wonderful speakers with us today marissa shrek from mathematica michael stepner from the university of toronto and michael collins from the university of wisconsin-madison so marissa will be kicking this off floor is yours great thank you james all right can you see my slides uh great um so my name is marissa shank i'm presenting work today on racial disparities and coping 19 experiences among older adults with disabling conditions this is joint work with my co-authors amel haradi bernadette hicks and anna quinones my thanks to ssa for funding this important work and the rdrc for inviting us to share our findings um and here's our usual disclaimer um so more than two years into the common 19 pandemic we're still learning about the impacts it has had on different communities older adults have experienced particularly high rates of covet 19 hospitalizations and fatalities racial and ethnic minorities as well as people living in communities with low incomes were exposed to the virus earlier in case negative health and economic effects early research has shown that people at the intersection of one or more of these identities may be more susceptible to negative effects as well for example people with disabilities who are non-white or with household incomes below the poverty level are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher covet 19 incidents compared to other people with disabilities however we know little about the covet-19 related experiences of people with disabilities this group is more likely to have an underlying health problem delay or forego needed medical care live in a congregate care setting and rely on assistance with personal care and practicing routine preventative measures and even less is known about how social factors may compound individual health to result in unequal burdens of this pandemic so in light of this emerging evidence we sought to understand the effects of coping 19 on people with disabilities the varying intersectional identities our work documents the negative health work and financial experiences of older adults due to the pandemic it explores the intersectionality of race and ethnicity with disability we also examine the role of contextual county level factors in driving these disparities our primary source of data is the health and retirement study in 2020 the hrs added a covid19 module asking respondents about health financial and work impacts of the pandemic all of the outcomes we examine were measured in about the first year of the pandemic between may 2020 and may 2021 we also examined data from previous waves of the survey from 1992 to 2018 we used this data to examine demographic information about our sample from prior to the pandemic such as disabling conditions and work status the hrs is also geocoded at the county level which we've used for the second major component of our analysis we gathered county level data from various public sources which you'll note when we turn to that analysis so our sample includes adults aged 50 and older who we're calling older adults we counted respondents as having a disabling condition if they had ever required assistance with an activity of daily living and adl or an instrumental activity of daily living or iadl these include things like bathing dressing walking across a room using a telephone shopping and preparing meals in our fall manuscripts we also examined results by whether respondents had a self-reported work limiting condition or had ever received supplemental security income or disability insurance benefits um we used the adl or iadl definition to be consistent in how we measured disability and include all ages over 50 in our sample and we included four mutually exclusive subgroups of race and ethnicity including non-hispanic white non-hispanic black a non-hispanic person of another race and hispanic or latino now i'm going to share our findings um our results today are adjusted for individual characteristics including age gender and prior health conditions so i'll start with our health impacts the survey measured some outcomes related to covet self-reported covet diagnosis or hospitalizations given the timing of the survey we did not find those outcomes particularly meaningful um since some respondents were surveyed early in the pandemic so they are less likely to have been tested or to answer questions about covert health outcomes respondents were asked whether there were any times since march 2020 that they needed medical or dental care but delayed getting it or did not get it at all so we are going to be focusing on delays in health care received older adults with disabilities were more likely to delay to delay uh needed health care compared to those without disabilities and some of those differences persisted across race as well about a third of older adults reported delaying health care non-hispanic older adults of another race had a higher rate while hispanic older adults had a lower rate more older adults with disabilities delayed healthcare compared to those without a disability and the differences across those with and without disabilities and the distribution across greece were statistically significant respondents were asked why they delayed or did not get health care and they could indicate multiple responses more than half of older adults who delayed health care reported that the clinic hospital or doctor's office canceled closed or had suggested rescheduling older adults with disabilities were more likely to report that they delayed health care because they could not afford it compared to those without disabilities and they were less likely to report that the doctor's office canceled or that they had just decided to wait within each race and ethnicity subgroup we examined the differences between people with and without disabilities there were significant differences within each recent ethnicity group and the largest of these differences was within non-hispanic older adults of another race those who delayed healthcare were asked what type of care they delayed and they could answer with multiple responses many older adults delayed dental care and doctor visits and a sizable group delayed surgery or prescriptions there were no significant differences between those with and without disabling conditions when it came to doctor or dental care but there were differences in the other responses and there were also differences in all of the responses by race now we're going to turn to financial outcomes more older adults with disabling conditions reported financial hardships compared to those without a disability there are differences across race both overall and within those with disabling conditions and the differences were largest among those who were hispanic or black buying or accessing food were common hardships we also examined whether income increased or decreased because of the pandemic but we did not find any differences by disability about a third of older adults reported any financial hardships during the pandemic forty percent of those uh with the disabling condition reported hardships compared to about a quarter of those without a disabling condition uh and there were statistically significant differences across greece as well white older adults were the least likely to experience financial hardships within race and ethnicity subgroups the differences between those with and without disabilities were large across all of the groups they were largest among black and hispanic older adults um indicating an intersectional disparity there respondents reported many types of financial hardships sixteen percent of older adults reported that they had trouble buying food even though they had the money and nine percent of older adults reported that that they did not have enough money to buy food there were significant differences by disability and by race and we found an intersectional effect where black and hispanic older adults with disabilities were the most likely to report most of these hardships uh and the final domain we examined was work outcomes uh fewer older adults with disabilities were working compared to those without disabilities and we found fewer impacts on this domain among working older adults about 40 reported effects on work due to the coronavirus pandemic and more older adults with disabilities who reported work effects so that they stopped working compared to those without disabilities we found some intersectional effects here as well for example fewer black older adults with disabilities moved to remote work compared to those without disabilities well the reverse was true for hispanic older adults those with disabilities were more likely to move to remote work so i'm going to turn now to the role of contextual factors in explaining some of these outcomes we examined eight measures of county level data related to coveted risk socioeconomic characteristics health care access and employment our measures include for example coveted cases per capita racial segregation hospital bed capacity and percent of people receiving government assistance by county we gathered all this data at the county level from sources including the american community survey and the county health rankings we found that older adults with disabilities were more likely to live in counties with higher coveted case counts higher pandemic and social vulnerability and higher unemployment rates compared to those without disabilities these differences also persisted across race in our models we did not see a consistent pattern of association between contextual factors and individual experiences with delayed health care or work being affected one of the contextual factors the examined did have a statistically significant relationship with experiencing a financial hardship in our multi-level models we found that individual level race and disability remained highly significant even after accounting for the contextual factors so we think this research leads to three policy implications first our work highlights the importance of a robust disability inclusive public health response we found that the covid19 pandemic had disparate impacts on the healthcare financial and work experiences of older adults by disability and recent ethnicity the vulnerability of this community suggests that they may be similarly impacted by future public health events such as future pandemics or natural disasters and that the response needs to focus on the well-being of people with disabilities we also found evidence that suggests that the intersectionality lens is really important as older adults with intersecting identities of disability and marginalized race or ethnicity were more likely to have been negatively impacted by the pandemic and finally because financial impacts were so widespread and there were intersectional disparate effects on many types of financial hardships policies mitigating financial impacts may be universally beneficial to older adults regardless of their other identities and that's it i look forward to our discussion thank you thank you marissa is michael collins great thanks everybody thanks for uh sticking with us today so uh now we're going to talk not necessarily about the pandemic necessarily but about some unique data that we have in wisconsin to try to understand the effect of ssa programs on particularly families that are we define as being three generation or grandparent families so the standard disclaimer applies i also say in these data we're working with data from the state of wisconsin so all of this is on the backs of the authors and not the funder nor the agencies with the data all right so the data we're talking about is from the institute for research on poverty irp works with state agencies across wisconsin and there's a data base that it's actually administrative data that pulls in from different parts of state agencies and programs called cares the client assistance for re-employment and economic support systems so the cares data draw in from we're going to look at primarily three different agencies the department health services children and families and workforce development so that's going to get us things like food share or snap it's going to get us tanf and or w2 and the caretaker subsidy for caretaker supplement for people on ssi as well as child support and child care subsidies um and then from workforce development we're going to get things like unemployment insurance but importantly we're going to get the wage records too so any payroll income that people have that's reported to the system we'll get to see that plus we'll get to see all the benefits that they have um so our our study is really on these cares uh populations uh it's not all people in wisconsin but really we're starting with the premise of people who are in the care system um so the care system data we're gonna look at is from 2010 to 2019 uh so about 10 years worth of data and we're pulling people so we're calling them primary persons you can think about these as sort of households who are at the same address and um you know we're identifying um those where there is a minor in the house somebody under age 18 um so you have a primary person at least a primary person and a minor uh in the house and that's sort of what you can think about as being the all population so these are people who have applied for food assistance or they're in some some program or they've applied for a program or they're in some way engaged with one of these state agencies but from that we can construct a household and then tell in the household if someone in the household is designated as a grandparent and then they have a minor child that they're taking care of there's no uh in between adults right it's just the grandparent and the child um so that's only about two percent one point eight percent of our all sample but we're calling these grandparent households um and then we also have these three generation households so that means that you have a minor child a primary person and then their parents so we have three generations of one household and that's about 7.3 percent of our all households um so these are all very low income people it's about 40 000 400 000 um households you can think about it that way um we're looking at these case year pairs so it's like a repeated cross section each year from 2011 through 2019 um there are some cases where we have people who are in multiple households in a year and we kind of split them um you know based on uh which household they're in they'll might get split between two or three different houses there's definitely a lot of mobility within these groups um but still we have a pretty good uh cross-section in each year of of um where people are at now the thing we're going to focus most on is the income so what is the income being reported into this household so for any of these means tested programs people have to report all their income levels and those income levels are then verified by the state oftentimes with other administrative data so we have pretty uh accurate at least in terms of the administrative data data on what's available so we have wages so everybody who reports the ui system with child support we have the unemployment compensation if they get unemployment we have the caretaker supplements this is a supplement to ssi for parents um we have snap or food assistance we have medicaid child care subsidies tanf and importantly we have ssa payments so we have the old asian survivors we have ssdi and we have ssi and so this is really the important piece is that we get these data now these are initially self-reported by anybody the primary person who comes through the care system but then they're later verified the state has a data exchange um with the social security administration to be able to verify these so i think we think we have pretty accurate data on all of these um all right so the first thing we do is just say all right who who gets any of these kinds of support so um the blue here are all of these cares households so again cares are low-income people who are involved in some state agency program um who have a kid uh and then the grandparent household it's a grandparent and a kid and a three generation as a grandparent an adult etiquette so we have um you know multiple generations there so um many of these households have wages not surprisingly the grandparent households about one-third of them do not have wages but still two-thirds do so everybody else is some form of wage income during the course of the year and again this is just a dichotomous zero one did they get any of this in income in a given year and during our study period if you look at all ssa sources of income combined about two-thirds of grandparent households have some form of ssa income it could be old agent survivors it could be ssdi it could be ssi um and for three generations it's about 42 percent that's still about twice the rate in the cares children over the cares households overall so you know relative to this larger group so you think about a venn diagram of all cares families with kids we have this subset of grandparent and a subset of three gen um the three gen are more likely to have some ssa income than the all group um not surprisingly the grandparent households are the most likely to have oas to have old age and survivors many of them are probably qualified they're at ages where they be qualified for old asian survivors or old age at least and somewhat higher for three gen for ssdi it's it's much more common among the grandparent households but also relatively common about you know one in five of the three gen households um ssis pretty common we'll see more of that in a bit but about one in five have ssi means this is means tested so these are pretty low income folks and then finally in terms of food share um which is the we looked at a lot of different non-ssa support programs but food chain was by far the largest probably the main reason that people would be enter entered into the care system initially is because they were looking for for food share or snap support so it's about half the sample who has some sort of food support um so the next thing we want to do is look at the poverty threshold so we have these uh you know these federal thresholds that does that designate what the poverty level is and then we can say what percent of the sample were people who were above or below that poverty threshold so the overall poverty rate in this care sample is about 50 so quite high right these are these are low income people they are entering the care system because they're seeking out some safety net program um so overall property right about 50 for the grandparent households it's slightly lower forty eight percent for the three gen it's about the same about fifty percent so um this gives you a sense of the overall sample of what the poverty rate looks like for these households um if we look just at where the primary person is white the property rate is only 43 percent um when the prime person is black it's about 61 percent and if the primary person is latina it's about 67 so slightly higher apart much higher property rates for black and latino primary person households relative to white households so the primary exercise we've done here is it's fairly reductive in a sense all we say is let's look at what those property rates would be if we were to subtract out social security programs what if they had no income from social security no oas no ssdi no ssi and let's see how that would change the relative poverty rate for the particular group of people that we're looking at so if we start on the left side the all child households you can see the yellow is all ssi ssi programs reduce the property rate to about by about five percent so i told you the overall poverty rate was about 50 um so without ssa programs it would be 55 so you can sort of think about these relative reductions again it's totally reductive uh just excluding one category what would that threshold what would the share of people meeting that threshold of the poverty rate be if we look at grandparent households it's a much larger reduction ssa programs across the board are reducing the property rate about 18 so property rates would be that much higher if not for that ss inc i mean obviously we're not holding anything constant here people would probably have different behaviors if ssc didn't exist but in terms of budget share this is an important part of of their support old age is a big part of what's supporting grandparents um oleg survivors um ssdi to slightly lesser extent and then ssi um about three percentage points um for the three-gen household it's not quite as large as what we see for the grandparent households it's about eight percent reduction in poverty rates um with the all ssa programs much of that's coming actually from ssdi so these three generation households look a little different you have a um perhaps it's that parent uh that middle-aged person who's not an older age who has a disability and might be an ssdi so we have a slightly different pattern in terms of what we see from income supports in these families then if we turn to by race so again these are all cair's families with minors we have an overall reduction from ssa programs among where the primary person is white of about five percent four point seven percent um where the primary person is black it's about seven percentage points and then primary person latinas about two and a half percentage points so pretty big differences by race uh with particularly larger uh reductions in the overall rates of poverty uh among a primary person being black um ssi plays a really important role for the primary person black households it's about four percentage points reduction in the poverty rate um so these means tested benefits are particularly important for that group and we don't quite see we see a similar pattern in terms of the latino group but it's just a much smaller magnitude um and it's actually the opposite for the primary person white household the smallest contribution is from ssi versus oas or ssdi now all this it does is combine the two together so if we look at grandparents and race and three gen and race and you can kind of see pretty similar i mean kind of just it is literally just putting together the two patterns that we just shared um so a pretty big effect of ssa programs among grandparents who are white fairly similar size but a little bit smaller for grandparents who are black um and quite a bit smaller for latinas grandparents who are latina among the three gen group we see larger effects actually among the three gen black primary person households um a bit smaller for latina and then for white um sort of in between um again the ssi the gray bar is particularly large for an immune tested program is particularly large for the three 3gen black we didn't quite see the same pattern with the grandparent black that tended to be more the oas so lots of interesting patterns here that we can talk more about in discussion as well um so overall what are we seeing in these data so this is definitely descriptive exercise but what we find we given this population we think is pretty interesting about two-thirds of grandparent households are getting some social security port support and about half of three generation households in these data are getting social security support the poverty rates are lower when we count in these ssa programs not a surprise but by 18 points for the grandparent household it's about eight points for the three generation households so it's a pretty significant reduction in poverty um we see a big effect of ssi especially for black households and latino households in the very beginning i said they have one of the highest poverty rates and also some of the smaller reductions in poverty from the ssa programs so this probably has some implications for how we think about program coordination across different kinds of uh so that's child support or foster care um when somebody thinks about these unusual household structures of grandparents and 3gen they're relatively small but when we think about the deeming roles or redetermination and ssi these various household structures might be particularly important for households of color to think about um so just overall you know this is a relatively small but pretty financially vulnerable population so we think the grandparent and three generation households continue to be an area of important to study you know i think we could probably do more to understand these multiple programs the state supplements snap and just try to understand how these different programs work and then we see some key differences between the means tested versus the more work based programs and then finally just i think this is an example of how you can use administrative data to look at some focal populations that are hard to study in other surveys so at least this can be an example in that regard i'll stop there thank you thank you um so uh please feel free to type questions into the q a box and i'll kind of uh select among those that are set there is one uh question from before for marissa can you think of explanations why the disparities between people with and without disabilities were highest among people of other race when it came to delays in medical care but highest among black older adults when it comes to financial hardship yeah thanks for that question um i think that you know this is this is pure speculation um but i think that there are different kinds of um disparities that we have experienced in this country for historical reasons that could lead to different different types of outcomes so for particularly black older adults i think that there's a history of poverty there's a history of um policy implications from from housing and and many other domains that could contribute to that and i think that that is some of what we're seeing in that disparity whereas for other populations oh my light's just turned off um for other populations it could be um coming from from different um types of uh policy implications thank you question for uh michael collins i think uh question is can you clarify again who is in the cares population by who is in the denominator of these stats yeah so the denominator are all uh households so again a primary person plus a minor child um who in a given year sought out a one of the public programs so they were in snap they are they applied for they were in snap they were in one of the child care support programs they were in um you know one of these other populations so it skews lower income um you know we we think it's about two-thirds of the uh total population of households with kids um but obviously much more skewed towards the it's the lower income chunk of that because they're involved the social safety net so i i have a question for michael stepner um so you you know that convergence of black white mortality condition on income was quite striking and you kind of hinted that you guys were going to be looking at the mechanisms behind that convergence any any kind of preliminary speculations as to what the leading mechanisms for that might be so i i do not have preliminary results that i'm withholding from all of you so my guess is is an informed guess and i'm sure other people have guesses that are just as informed um i would say that you know the two big buckets that often come to mind are access to healthcare and differences in health behaviors and um what we and other research have historically seen is that access to health care explains a very small part of um of these disparities and in particular you would think that like access to healthcare is you know differential access to healthcare uh in the united states is often mediated by income and i don't think that the story we are going to see is that like you know black americans suddenly had access to healthcare in 2019 that they didn't have access to 2001 in a way that like other um other income other racial groups did not uh in terms of health behaviors i don't know what the story might be and i think that's something worth unpacking i think your question relates to a really interesting question that came from vincent paul in the chat about how should we interpret the difference between these two lines where you if you look at the uh line without conditioning on income and you look at the line conditional on income and you see convergence on one and massive disparities if you don't condition on income and i think perhaps more broadly like taking a step back what i'm excited about about these descriptive facts is that they point to um i think they can help inform what sets of policies might be effective in reducing the gaps i wouldn't declare victory and saying oh look it's all income like the gaps are done right that is a form of included variable bias where if all the disparities are from income that's where where you need to look to address these disparities um it's not about you know that you know a story where two people with the same income have very different outcomes the the sorts of policy mechanisms need to focus on those disparities in income and what they uh what they imply for health thank you uh there's a question from michael collins uh in the q a box uh will you be able to add in the effects of the 2021 defundable federal ctc next year uh that's a really good question um we don't really obs we don't really observe the payments that would come through the ctc however we could certainly as we could sort of back door we could back whatever envelope figure out what it might be based on what their uh household type is um so that's a good question i think we could probably look into that thanks and just to keep you on the hot seat for a moment uh your data are from wisconsin which is a wonderful state do you think that if we were to look outside wisconsin these patterns is there any particular reason to think that these patterns might be different outside of wisconsin versus in wisconsin of course they're not going to be exactly the same but yeah you know it is um if you were let's say for example you're looking at a different state and and also look at people who have some engagement with the social safety net um would we see the same patterns with grandparents and three-generation households i think we probably would i think where what might set wisconsin about apart is that it's a relatively lower uh cost of living housing cost place and so i think if you were to look at a place where you had higher cost of living higher housing costs you might see even more of these three generation households which is simply economies of scale trying to take advantage of shared housing um so we might see even more cases of these three generation households or even grandparent households which are driven by those cost concerns and my i don't know this but my guess is that they would probably even show even more signs of financial vulnerability with higher poverty rates and potentially even larger relative effects from the social security programs that they benefit from so you guys have been very efficient in answering questions uh typing i'm wondering if there are any questions that you thought were kind of uh you wish you could elaborate more on the typing and and you have more expansive answer uh orally or maybe just questions that you think should be brought to kind of more salience for our audience i would add that we'd welcome more questions if anyone has been sitting on one feeling shy please be our guest so there's a question for uh michael i think stefan or not steiner i think that's a autocorrect uh type so could the differential covet impacts by race you really the likelihood of work from home slash not have you given thought to proxy measures in this regard for the gap among younger folks yeah so this is something that we we did study i did not include this slide in in this deck but the gaps are largely are you know predominantly among the elderly and retired population and so i do not think that you know you see these gaps among at every age but the just in terms of mechanisms is much larger among retired uh people and so the story you would need to tell for this to be driven by differences in work from home is one about multi-generational families where you have older black adults living with younger black workers who are going to work in person and catching coven and bringing them home and infecting their parents or their grandparents is that plausible i think it is plausible i do not think that our data is the data that's best placed to study it but i think one general question about some of these stories um you know this sort of toxic contract where the story was like oh well the people who have kept their jobs are perhaps worse off because they're not their jobs have gotten worse they're not making that much more money and now they're being exposed to additional uh covered risk i think that is not the primary story that is explaining this increased disparity here it needs to be something um that is going to hit retired households it's following up on some of this um heterogeneity uh you hinted michael stepner uh about uh interesting stories involving other races too that you didn't have time to to get into but we have a little bit of time here uh are you prepared to give a quick summary of what might be going on with other races yeah so let me highlight one group that i think is particularly interesting to study that our data is able to speak to in a in a fairly novel way which is the um american indian or native american population where in typical survey data you just do the the population is too small to pick up a reliable estimate we know that they are um that native americans are disadvantaged on every dimension we can measure but kind of like zooming in on these sort of um precise pictures of how that disadvantage plays out at different income levels is uh difficult in survey data and so the admin data lets us actually study the native american population what we see is that the disadvantage is if you scroll back uh 20 years to the turn of the 21st century um disadvantages of the similar magnitude to black americans and we do not see this improvement over the last 20 years so i think that raises a question where certain disadvantaged groups in the united states have you know black americans have seen tremendous growth in life expectancy over the last 20 years and that growth has left behind native americans and i do not have a mechanism at this point to tell you as to why that would be but i think that is a super important question that merits future study there's a question uh from ellen mirra uh michael uh i think stefan again in light of improvements in life expectancy uh the cove results are quite striking what do you know about the cause of death in the pre-coveted period driving the narrowing for higher income black versus white individuals i i hope to answer that question perhaps at an rdrc in a year or two we are working on linking in cause of death data so right now we're working purely with the ssa mortality records which for which we know the date that someone dies um but uh we do not know what they died of um whereas cms has really excellent cause of death data and we're trying to bring that into this linkage environment so that we can answer precisely that sort of question question for michael collins could you clarify again how the ssa data are linked to the cares database yeah and she says uh i think you said those data are self-reported right so uh when somebody comes in and say they're gonna apply for um snap food assistance they they complete their benefits application form and they would include all their income sources and they would put down the amount of ssi or oasi or ssdi that they get and then we don't know exactly the cadence of the matching process but the state agency then has a data exchange the social security administration matches that person's identifying information to verify that uh income data so for all the periods that we're examining that that examination would have already occurred so if the person's self-report was off it would be corrected and what we would be observing is what the actual benefit amount was um so it's all part of the administrative exchange as part of the the income verification and means testing process the state does is there anything else that any of the panelists want to kind of chime in on uh elaborate on and oh excuse me there's there's another question that's come through uh curious about the role of congregate care settings in the 2020 shift towards wider life expectancy disparities for older adults is that something that you've considered oh i i'm gonna guess that's that's for me and um it's something we consider and something we've tried to measure directly using uh the geographic data where you know there's certain if you can get small enough in geography there's certain areas where there's a high concentration of concrete of older adults living in congregate care settings and other just geographic areas where most older adults are living independently i don't have any um i don't have any results yet on that regard our back of the envelope calculations say suggest that that is at most a partial story so you know i don't think that explains the majority of this growing disparity that we see um but i think for the sort of decisive answer that i would want to give you and that you would probably want to receive uh it's a it's more of a stay tuned okay well i guess one more time is there any uh anything else that the panelists want to elaborate on before we uh maybe uh wrap up the session well if not then um and turn it back to nicole to see if there are any final announcements for today well thank you everyone um that was just uh just terrific and um this is the end of day one of our program i really hope you enjoyed it as much as i did please join us right at noon eastern time tomorrow we have an amazing keynote speaker dr marcela alson she's a physician and an economist and a 2021 macarthur fellow she's done pioneering work on health disparities at the intersection of medicine and economics i'm really excited i think you're really going to learn a lot from her from her lecture please use the same zoom and live stream links that you use today to access the conference tomorrow and as always if you have any technical questions or concerns about the materials posted or otherwise please reach out to konza mahum she's putting her email in the chat right now and that's it have a nice afternoon
