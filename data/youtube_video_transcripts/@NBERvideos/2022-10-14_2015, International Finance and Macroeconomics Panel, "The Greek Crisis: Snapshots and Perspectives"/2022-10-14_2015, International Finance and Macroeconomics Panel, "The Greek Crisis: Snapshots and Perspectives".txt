oh without further Ado Let's uh Plunge in and Richard will be leading off right thank you Jeff uh I'm going to do this for me an exceptional thing of that is to read some notes because I want to avoid saying anything that might be a policy recommendation at this stage uh and uh and I'm even going to avoid those perspectives because I thought that might get me into policy territory I want to start with some facts uh and uh the um there's a range of facts that I think are really important and perhaps not as well known on this side of the Atlantic as they are on the side where I live the Greek crisis was definitely different from Portugal Spain Ireland there's a clear case of exceptional fiscal profligacy which stemmed from a populist and Client List political system and a very weakly institutionalized State there was a common feature big Capital inflows financing Big current account deficits those inflows were in good part a consequence for Greece of its entry into monetary Union but not of any particular structural flaw in monetary Union after the crisis broke the pace of fiscal consolidation in Greece until the end of 2014 was exceptional the 15 16 deficit uh primary deficit of 12 in 2009 came to a prime down to a small primary Surplus at this in the second half of 2014. also exceptional however was the drop in GDP 27 and the rise in unemployment to 28 youth unemployment over 60 percent the initial bailout in May 2010 and involved no debt forgiveness nor any restructuring it was a bailout of the banks that had lent to Greece mainly French and German and as in Ireland Spain and Portugal the foreign lenders were in effect bailed out by domestic taxpayers who took on the burden of repayment to the official sector lenders from this comes the dominant narrative in Germany and elsewhere the Greece is solely responsible for its problems and is morally obliged to repay its debts in full there's a big with the big Fallen outfit and the continuing fiscal deficits despite the default and debt restructuring in March 2012 with 75 haircuts for the private creditors nominal debt to GDP has risen substantially since 2010. but extend and pretend has given an important reduction in that present value uh the debt is significantly lower because of reductions in interest rates and a sizable extension of maturities uh since March 2012 all the debt virtually is held by the official sector the ECB has 130 billion euros worth of of it the European stability mechanism is another 130 billion worth of it and the rest is with national governments elsewhere in Europe and the IMF there's been a huge internal devaluation real wages are down 30 percent yet very little gain and competitiveness when measured by final good prices that's not just because of priced rigidities because also during the same period there have been substantial increases in taxes electricity charges Social Security contributions and so forth result internal devaluation has had very little effect on exports the balance of trade has improved but its import compression because of the Fallen GDP export Supply is constrained by a wide range of product Market imperfections and financial constraints and a structure an industrial structure that is very unfavorable to export growth because it's mainly small firms the main export is tourism and Peak period Supply capacity is actually pretty well exhausted before the recent fall in bookings but normally and second the second major export is shipping of which for which the domestic costs are very small so that suggests that membership in the currency Union as such is not responsible for the current situation and that brexit with an effective large nominal devaluation is unlikely to have a substantial effect on net exports and hence on aggregate demand instead because of balance sheet effects it's likely to be contractionary if it happens unlike Argentina in 2002 Greece would not be selling primary Commodities into a global boom also unlike Argentina it's not self-sufficient in food in fact it Imports basic Goods such as grain rice paper as well as energy actually in Pharmaceuticals immediately eliminating the trade deficit would just add to the pain Greece would be chaotic brexit rather would be chaotic in the short run and highly in in egalitarian because the oligarchs and much of the upper middle classes have already moved their funds abroad others a little with lower incomes will suffer a further big drop in those incomes series program for the January elections included increases in some government expenditures rehiring Personnel various government departments and so forth while seeking debt forgiveness and reversing some labor market and pension reforms but their political program also included some an attack on the oligarchy on clientalism and on tax evasion well they delivered on taxes taxes in the sense of reducing some and expenditure in a sense of increasing some but they didn't deliver on the reforms the Deep structural reforms that were necessary and we are we have now a semi-failed state the environment in which business really can't function uh investment has collapsed tax payments have actually collapsed in the spring long before the bank closures the European Central Bank is the lender of Last Resort for the Greek Banks acting through the Greek banks by extending what's called an emergency lending assistance the ECB cat Ela when the referendum was announced and that led to the bank closures that we've seen limits on cash machine withdrawals and so forth but the ECB has not imposed yet any additional haircuts on the collateral supporting Greek Bank borrowing that collateral is typically Greek government bonds as long as the ECB deems those Banks solvent though in liquid it won't cut the ELA but it's no longer playing the lender of Last Resort role by maintaining their liquidity supposedly on the grounds that it can't rely on any new Greek Government Bond collateral in the absence of a program agreed with the Euro group on the other hand it's also not yet judging them insolvent and invoking what we now have in Europe the single resolution mechanism in order to intervene and restructure and recapitalize the banks but even with liquidity you have to realize of course that the banks would be in deep trouble because of high and Rising non-performing loans they're supposed to be supportive proposing a program to the so we've got a couple of minutes good uh to the euro group uh by 8 30 Central European Time tomorrow and apparently according to news reports they've already put something in the there will be a summit for the first time uh here of old heads of state and government not just the Euro group to consider all this a payment to the European Central Bank of three and a half billion euros is due on the 20th of July a new program requires approval from all Europe area parlance well not all but much and if there is just a short-term program that were financed for example by the European stability mechanism that might not require parliamentary approval but it would probably still in Germany part of the background to all this is a new IMF paper issued three days before the referendum with a Debt Service debt sustainability analysis that showed Greek debt is clearly unsustainable and recommended that relief in exchange for various reforms but you know there is a huge gap and you cannot really I think from here perceive it a huge gap of trust and credibility uh there between Greece and its Euro group Partners the polemical rhetoric has been extreme a lot of it doesn't get reported here a lot of it probably doesn't even get another press but I can assure you it's pretty awful and the Euro group countries simply don't trust Greece to implement reform measures so they're reluctant to promise negotiations and debt relief without seeing some concrete reform measures first and Greece has said Yep they're going to have some soon right away tomorrow yesterday no no uh but at best what you can expect from the Summit is I think a commitment to start discussions about debt restructuring there are major political obstacles to an agreement outside Greece beside the issue of trust and I'm talking about the rest of Europe the Euro group particular almost all Germans as well as important elements in the German political parties oppose any further support for Greece many openly argue for Greg exit from the monetary Union the far right and the far left in both France and Germany c brexit as a step towards the dissolution of the monetary Union which is what they like what they would like so does the main right-wing party in Italy governments challenged by parties on the left like Spain with elections in the Autumn don't wish to give concessions that might make it appear that if those parties came to power they too could negotiate a better deal with the Euro group the prime minister of Italy has recently taken a position of total solidarity with the German Chancellor several small countries especially those that suffered a lot during the crisis and those with per capita incomes below those of Greece see no reason why their taxpayers should put any more money into a bailout in fact only France seems to have broken away and that just within the past couple of days and coming out for with some support for Greece the U.S has intervened orally with uh with the Europeans pushing for a deal that was motivated not only by concerns for economic stability but also uh by geopolitical issues and the fund with dominant U.S influence and a French managing director has also openly supported an agreement now I had some notes about what we might expect to emerge in the early hours of Monday but I've just a little past my time and I'll stop now great thank you our second panelist is Carmen Reinhardt so uh Richard uh dealt with Jim's Jim also sent us an email in several volumes as to what we could not say so I I will resort to sign language so if I if I say something and go like this I'm just kidding I'm just kidding Jim I'm not I'm not going to do that I I I'm not I'm not but at any rate what I'd like to do is divide my comments into three parts I'll try to draw on lessons uh and to deal with Jeff's question I think at least the more reflexive question what have we learned I think the general answer is very little uh we seem to have an ability to regenerate these crises again and again but um in terms of Outlook I will get to the second question you pose so the three areas that I want to cover very briefly have to do with the nature of debt relief that is to say uh what type of debt relief is associated in history with better outcomes in terms of debt resolution uh the second issue that I'd like to address is if and here I'll answer Jeff's second question if things are heading in the direction of brexit which look increasingly to be the case in my reading uh what is next and to that end I'd like to focus on episodes of forcible currency conversions uh we haven't seen we don't have a lot of evidence on exits from currency unions but at least we can make some inferences from countries that not de jure but de facto have been highly dollarized and tried to uh switch their banking system back to the domestic currency and the third issue very briefly that I'd like to touch on is the issue of potential Contagion so let me start first on the issue of the modalities of debt reduction so here we are at the 11th hour and it's only starting to be openly discussed uh by the creditors that debt relief is needed uh this I think has been the the need for debt relief and debt reduction I think has been fairly evident for some time uh but we've we've only just gotten there uh it is not unusual at all if one looks at the timeline of debt negotiations in the past one of the things that emerges from uh the work that I've done with Ken rogoff and the work that I am currently doing also with Christoph Trevis is that the process from beginning to end is a very long one that is to say the initial credit event which sometimes can be a default or it can be a restructuring to the final one that you reach resolution so that you can say debt sustainability has been restored it's a very lengthy process and part of the reason it's a very lengthy process is the demonstration that we have ahead of us which is namely creditors do not want to take a haircut the borrowers ultimately will insist on a haircut and in the end the most common experience in these episodes is a haircut that is to say a write down of principle not just an extension of maturities and a reduction in interest payments and increased uh Grace periods I do not think Greece is going to be an exception to that pattern that has been and if you look for example at the debt crisis in Latin America of the 1980s the baker plan was essentially intent on providing cash flow relief but no write-offs the ultimate closure of the Dead crisis came with not the baker plan with the Brady plan and that involved haircuts that ranged from you know close to 90 percent for Bolivia to very little for chile depending on the country situation which is the other issue that I want to address the fact that it takes so long to get from beginning to end in these processes is actually not just devastating for the borrower if you look at it and step back it is also unwise from the Creditor because if you look at in in ongoing work this is still you know ongoing I I'd be happy to share slides I don't have the paper yet but Kristoff Travis and I have been asking the question of what are the determinants of the size of the haircut and historically three factors come to mind one is the initial stock of debt second the cumulative decline in GDP and third and this is not in in order of importance I'm just listing them uh the duration the time it takes from the initial credit event to its ultimate resolution in other words the longer it takes the more the economy contracts uh the bigger the needed haircut to restore debt sustainability so ultimately it from the vantage point of the Creditor as well uh the idea of extend and pretend is not not uh uh conducive now once one reaches that last restructuring positive things can happen namely from the not just work that I've done but other works for example of paper by a recent paper by Halos and sahai looking at the question of Market access Market access is actually pretty quick once you the the market sense that uh debt has become sustainable so let I know that I'm pushing time so let me move on so the the bottom line of what I've just said is in countries where this situation has been so severe as Greece both in terms of the initial level of debt the magnitude of the collapse in the economy and the time that it's taking it is hard to see resolution without haircuts let me move on to the second issue which is let us uh for a moment assume that the that the negotiations do not get anywhere in the next few days and the situation in Greece right now is untenable that is to say not only do you have the maximum amount of withdrawals from Banks as as this is permitted but the the fact that the pop the population is trying to hoard Euros also manifests itself in other ways namely we we see in this shrinkage of the liability side we see more visibly because we can track deposits but the the hoarding of Euros also manifests itself in the non-payment uh or taxes and the non-payment of existing debts so if if you actually aggregate not just bank loans but credit card debts some estimates that are not not unduly uh uh exotic but fairly conservative Place non-performing loans are roughly three-quarters percent of total assets and rapidly Rising given the economic implosion uh if you track government arrears in tax tax payment arrears they match Russia's in the run-up to the August 98 crisis okay now the last uh issue that I'd like to to make the case why a currency conversion is likely to be sooner rather than later is the government itself the government has been funding Itself by domestic arrears namely non-payment of of suppliers non-payment of rents so far they've been paying wages but it's a matter of time under these extreme economic conditions that you're not going to see script and you're going to see a transition to uh uh to to to the drachma and so how much time do I have I'm done okay well let me just say on on the transition to the drachma I did a box piece today because these were my notes preparing for this looking at five episodes of transitions from de facto dollarized economies uh to the domestic currency let me summarize the experiences of those five countries is not a happy one and this is not a statement of causality here the by the time the countries introduce these measures they were in States not dissimilar from Greece okay so it's not like this generated the problem but it certainly didn't solve it immediately which is the main point and and the main point that I would like to leave since I'm out of time is that the persistence that it that is to say I very much agree uh with Richard's assessment that in this case the idea that one could introduce a currency generate evaluation and that would act as a quick catalyst to Revival it I'm not saying that over the longer Hall that certainly that mechanism isn't there but I think the overwhelming Financial disruptions are going to be the dominant factor and I think uh economic conditions in in in any scenario are going to be very grim and I'll stop there thank you Carmen our third speaker is Gita gopenath prospects for Greece I think I would summarize the Prospectors saying that it will take a miracle for Greece to be in the Eurozone to continue to be in the Eurozone and I say that for two reasons one is that the fiscal targets that are going to be a part of any of these negotiations are just becoming increasingly hard to attain uh and the second reason because I think there's a complete breakdown in trust between the Troika the creditors and uh and Greece so let me elaborate on the on the fiscal front why I think things look particularly dire is because one revenues are drying up uh Greece was at some point running a primary Surplus and now if you look at the projections you know the best case projections say that the primary deficit will be about three percent of GDP you know given the economic contraction that's happening over there giving the recent bank closures given the kind of complete breakdown in economic activity it probably will get a whole lot worse in the primary deficit will get much bigger so just in a very passive sense of trying to meet the fiscal targets the revenue sources are drying up very quickly so then the question is what they can do in an active sense in terms of actually undertaking reform both on the revenue side and on the expenditure side and here uh you know there was a deal on the table uh there was a referendum on it and it was soundly rejected and now anything that they have to come forth with has to be a lot more than what was actually banned on the original deal so the political costs associated with coming up with a far more ambitious plan are very large and so in that sense I just think that it's just in terms of what can be done in terms of the revenue targets it's just just getting more and more diet and then of course there is the question of implementation and here is where we get to the issues of of trust even if they do put a plan forward with numbers that seem to suggest that uh you know they will undertake the reforms that are required I don't know whether there is any Trust on the other side that this will actually happen where this will actually be implemented will this will actually be put into laws uh and so there's I mean there's been you know all kinds of name calling that has happened there's kind of all immense amount of distrust so once this gets taken back to individual countries whether they can actually the creditors can actually believe that this will uh this will play out as as is being said now the one positive to you know a deal working out is the fact that Cyprus is uh you know has changes tone towards the other parties uh in Greece the more pro-eu parties would definitely want to be uh in the in the Eurozone and a part of the EU and so because of that you know it's possible that deals will pass Parliament more easily and you know think and uh you know Miracle might happen and so there's some recent news that comes out that they are putting together a pretty aggressive package but again I mean I I still believe that you know if not in the next few days it will take continuous miracles for Greece to continue to be uh in the Euro area as for the second question about lessons uh that we have learned I think there are two kinds of lessons one lesson is for the Euro area and the second lesson is for our understanding of debt crises so for the first lesson for the Euro area I think that what we've learned is that the costs of having a currency Union without having a banking Union and a fiscal unit I think that this correct this crisis is made abundantly clear uh so on the first one uh about the banking Union uh so there are two things that come up there so for instance one if uh if there was a eui Deposit Insurance scheme uh then we would not have seen a translation of sovereign debt crises into uh into banking crises and then into currency crises the reason that we saw run on banks is because of the fact that there wasn't an eui uh mechanism to put a backstop on on people's fears about the fact that their money would not be in the banks when they show up so you do need to have some sort of eui Deposit Insurance scheme uh the second thing because there is no eu-wide mechanism for Bank restructuring of a bank recapitalization uh this whole thing got caught in What's called the Doom Loop between the Sovereign debtors sovereign debt and the and the banking system it's kind of insolvency and The Sovereign site turns into insolvency in the banking sector and this do Loop just kind of aggravated uh the outcome for uh for Greece so well in terms you know in terms of going forward in terms of what's required for a currency Union to succeed I think it's abundantly clear that you need a banking Union the second thing that they need is a fiscal Union you need to have automatic transfer mechanisms you know Greece has paid a lot it's about the GDP has contracted by 25 percent the unemployment rates uh you know around 25 percent this is a huge hugely costly for the country uh if there were automatic fiscal transfer mechanisms in place if there was an e-wide uh such fun for making these kinds of transfers then again we would not have seen um what we're seeing here so just going back to the point about the banking unions uh you know one possible strategy to have kept Greece or to keep Greece in the Europe uh area is to have shifted the negotiation from one being about bailing out uh governments versus being one about bailing out the banking sector you know by doing that you you know you let governments make their own decisions decide how they want to raise their finances something that they're asking for something the Greeks are voted for and then instead Focus the bailout detention on the banking sector which is more about preserving Greece in the Euro and the last point about the lesson is in terms of what have we learned about debt crisis how does that affect our understanding about how debt crises work and this is where I'm going back and thinking about what we know in the literature and what seems like a gap and I think that the one thing that has come out throughout the whole Europe crisis is the fact that far more than economic efficiency considerations you know political considerations seem to have dominated every part of uh how this crisis has played out and if you go back to the Genesis of the problems if you think of Greece back in 2010 when its debt was clearly unsustainable you know there was one of three things that could have happened one was to let Greece default and let the creditors suffer these wooden to the German banks and the French banks the second option was to bail out uh Barrel bail out the Greek Banks and bail out the French banks directly but let Greece defaulted like Greece default and then you directly bail out your own Banks and the third option was to go and actually bail out the Greek government and then indirectly bail out your own Banks now the choice of the third seems to have been an outcome of not just economic efficiency arguments but about political considerations and I think the mess that stand out in the over the last five years is is a result of this so just going forward from uh in terms of improving our understanding for future debt crises and of how these things work I think we need to have a little more of political economic considerations when we enter into discussions about sovereign debt into discussions about sovereign debt we restructuring in terms of bailouts we've done a good job of trying to understand why political economy considerations can lead to governments building up a lot of debt but we have a lot less in terms of understanding how these considerations play uh in the middle of a dead crisis great our fourth speaker is Paolo pacente applications for Europe I did my homework I checked what many people these days are saying about the subject including many folks in this room and I can report quite conclusively that collectively we have no idea what will happen so I've I didn't think that was a good answer to Jeff's question so I started writing down some thoughts about all these and not surprisingly given the subject matter the thoughts took the shape of something that looks like uh well a Socratic dialogue between Greece and the Troika so probably not too far from what is actually happening behind closed doors in Brussels so here it is I hope it confuses you as much as it confused me uh we'll start with Greece obviously on the left uh Greece here we are how we got here is not the point point is we are on the verge of an economic and social catastrophe and not one of our making our banks are closed there are long lines to get few Euros a day if you're lucky enough to find an ATM which is not yet out of order tourists are canceling give a reservations Traders are not getting letters of credit to finance by Imports uh many young people have no jobs firms have no cash to pay the few lucky ones who have won drugstore stop selling kid medicines pension payments are missed social unrest is creeping in all these and could have been avoided on the right vitroika how we got here is precisely the point you have been built out not once but twice and what exactly happened with all the funds we granted you the only conditions we require were to invest in the future of your country guarantee fiscal sustainability restore confidence in your finances after five years you are back to square one and able to repay your obligation to the fund something that puts you in very glorify the company of Somalia so uh Sudan and Zimbabwe and instead of taking responsibility and begging for forgiveness so you want to dictate the terms of a third meaning third bailout spending even greater financing needs over a greater longer time Horizon Grace you may have heard that we held a small referendum last week and by the way Landslide outcome the message was that the whole country sped up with all these contractually and deflationary in this inflationary policy but you euphemistically call conditionality the Greece of today is paying for the massive mistakes of a political and economic Elites of the past and we're paid enough since 2010 we've been implementing spending cards virtually unprecedented in an advanced economy what is the result hardship misery our GDP Shrine by one quarter and Counting we have nothing against growth oriented policy but we want to stop repeating the mistake or going through bad strategy but shrink output faster but by shrink that reform fatigue only boosts the pill of more populist alternative in the hotel pass it does not help you and also if you don't mind we would like the Greeks to be master of our own destiny Troika nobody likes conditionality and nobody likes to come to us so if you don't want to deal with conditionality just don't put yourself in the condition of needing it our country in similar circumstances they've gone through similar rounds of posterity and then successfully overcome their burden Ireland and Portugal are true success stories Spain and even Italy have been able to pass important reforms there is no reason and not to mention willingness to give you any special treatment it would be unfair would create a bad president if you are serious about structural reforms where are the comprehensive proposals and prior actions in terms of legislative policy to fight bureaucracy inefficiency corruption tax avoidance what about liberalizing product markets category over regulation raising General retirement age because training early retirement what about recruiterizing our banking system wiping out in solving institutions incentivizing them in days show us the progress on reforms and we'll show you money and perhaps that relief and if you don't like it nobody is forcing you to stay in the zone Greece and nobody here wants to leave Europe there are too many unknown unknowns associated with brexit and in spite of all your rhetoric and vegetarians of build you are the ones who prefer modeling through and kicking the can down the road one more time rather than dealing with a potential scenarios of social unrest and political radicalization and if you can spell geopolitical vulnerabilities go and check the map of Europe see what Greece is and what Greece will remain after brexit what we want to be is part of a better Europe possibly more solidarity one but at least a more pragmatic one where pragmatism means accepting that counterproductive conditionalities be revamped and realistic fiscal targets corrected socially cost expanding reconsider at a much shorter time Horizon days pragmatism means started talking seriously about debt relief this weekend a bridge loan by July 20 and an increase in emerging liquidity disease that's above 89 billion Camp as soon as possible Troika last time I checked solidarity requires trust and respect of obligation and an Ela extension what for to feed a massive deposit flight Greece avoiding addressing the last question if not we will have to start introducing and circulate some form of temporary Ru let's call it CH which is a currency Hellenic or drachma without a drama taking some time to digest the latter span Troika CH my funny what you are suggesting is to introduce a parallel currency in dual legal tender and this is a break of treaty I knew you were not here new material let's go back talking about brexit Greeks should I remind you that in 2009 the United States of California issued about 500 550 billion of iOS during its financial crisis and in spite of this the dollar is still the only legal territory in San Francisco these days tri-cap should I remind you that California is part of a full-fledged Refrigeration of 50 states and you are well the Hellenic Republic no federal transfer for you Greece which is precisely the point if Greece were part of the United States of Europe we wouldn't be having this conversation by the way have you seen any good Optimum currency address paper at the MBR summer Institute Troika no we never accept their invitation and this can go on forever but to to try to summarize and answer answer Jeff despite postural rhetorics the two parts are really not that far away from each other an agreement is possible it requires a dual mixture of safe phase uh which is not a nerd of a foreign European standards the deal could involve a bridge loan it will involve some form of funding from European stability mechanisms conditional reform if I'm not mistaken a proposal has been as being a submitted we'll see what is the outcome and what is um my perception what happens in the event of a no agreement by Sunday morning well most likely the Euro leader Summit will discuss it and humanitarian Aid of ACB will suspend Ela financing on Monday morning and the Greek government will issues the CH and maybe eventually leave the Europe um on this I think I pass it to the next podcast so last but not least Anil kashyap thanks um when Merton Miller used to meet somebody new he would say what do you think is going to happen to interest rates so he could get the question out before they they could ask him and I so what do you think is going to happen to Greece um I I think we need political scientists I'm going to just repackage something that's been a theme for all the other panelists um I think you can only understand how he got here by realizing that the Greek Uh current Greek government failed to understand that all their grandstanding that played so well domestically had an equal and opposite magnitude effect internationally and so whatever trust they might have had the day they were elected was was destroyed and so this negotiation has been needlessly complicated if you're addicted to this if you go to the leading Greek newspaper spelled k-a-t-h-i-m-e-r-i-n-i and you uh Google the term Saga of the Greek review you find a very interesting narrative about how the official sector pulled the plug on the last government with optimistic views about uh the cisprus team may be compromising I found that uh very interesting uh because you might ask why did why did they pull the plug on the last government it was actually doing pretty well um so anyway I'll make two more points about politics and I'll try to answer the economics question so um I think at this point too much attention is paid to Germans in in terms of the negotiations something that's been echoed by many of the people is um there's lots of vested interests that have no no interest in seeing a uh substantial compromise being reached Germany doesn't care about Greece they could fund this in a moment they can't fund uh Spain or Italy if they get similar terms so for the the Greeks um if they're rewarded by having sent in this extreme government the Germans understand that the Italians in Spanish will copy that Playbook and at that point they have a real problem that they can't contain uh it's also the case that the incumbent governments that are more or less going along with the preferred route that the Germans favor also have no interest in being kind to Greece because they know that would be signing their own dissolution they'd be defeated in the next election so there's there's plenty of players that don't want to see a substantial concession to the Greeks for having elected this uh government and then held the referendum and seeing the way it went so that that's a constraint that binds anything that's going to happen in the next coming days I think any deal that does happen has to con uh recognize two other constraints so the first is the incumbents can't be seen as rewarding the uh the incumbent governments and Germany can't be seen as rewarding the the Greek government the the two others are the IMF must be paid it's kind of remarkable given that the the decisions that have been made and even the admissions and Mistakes by the IMF but it's still going to have to get paid because the world needs somebody to to clean up these messes and if if Greece is ever forgiven and their IMF that the IMF ceases to be able to go in uh I so I I think the RMF will somehow get paid it may not be in an npv sense there may be stretched out payments and all that but somehow the IMF will get its money and that means the total size of the funds that have to be raised will will be higher than it would have been otherwise and then the the third constraint is that uh cispers has to be able to sell whatever deal he strikes um search Twitter for the following phrase and quotes big if true and you will find a July 7th article from the telegraph uh newspaper in the UK where there's a long article explaining that cispers never intended to win the referendum his plan according this article was that he wanted to have the vote figure it would come out yes he would then resign honorably somebody else would have to come in implement the the reform that would be uh devastating for the economy but eventually would work after much more pain six months from now he's running on a campaign of I told you this was a crazy thing and he's re-elected without ever having to have his finger points on the plan now that sounds like a reasonable forecast as what he might have been thinking because it does not seem like they do have a plan so now think about these three constraints the IMF the creditors who can't be seen as rewarding them and him having to sell something and you could see easily why it would not be possible to um strike a deal according to the latest news feeds it seems like cisprus is going to try to say he's ready to compromise and that the thing they sent in half an hour ago May reflect concessions we'll see when they parse the numbers every other time we've heard this it didn't go there so my best guess is still that there will be a bust up uh even though it's really not in the citizens interest in any of these countries to have that go forward in terms of the economics um something kind of similar to what Gita said there are many plans for what could be done right now uh Pierre Olivier grinches has one William Bauer has one the spirit of these plans are separates saving and recapitalizing the banks from forcing adjustment on the government so these these variations of these plans would say take whatever money you need to to keep the banks open that keeps the country functioning somehow but Force off the government from being able to get any more funding not internationally nor from the banks so they would immediately have to close their primary Surplus they would Bear all the the forced Market discipline that would you know necessitate many changes and see where that goes now the adding up of the cost of all this would be would be pretty high but I think you know that kind of a deal at least satisfies uh my three constraints if you figure out the esm eventually pays the IMF the Greek government is seen as being penalized internationally and the Greeks can say we're still in Europe we're still on the Euro and then after they start implementing the pain that they'll get fired but you know in the short run it looks like it works so my forecast is they will not get there that that won't happen and instead they'll end up issuing script and and going down um going down that route but I I think even now this this would have uh probably be a more appealing option I don't know how you'd implement it in terms of my big lesson I would say um unplugging the banks from the sovereigns is something that uh seems like it's going to come back to us it'd be interesting to convene in five years and see where Japan stands on this front they have deposit insurance and all of that but their banks are chocked full of 200 percent of uh gdp's worth of debt as well uh and and there are many other countries that are uh sitting on banking systems that have so much debt in them that it would be very very hard to to repay if if there are doubts about the the um viability of the debt load so that would be my one takeaway very good so I I like to thank our panelists we're all going to be watching eagerly to see what happens that that completes the panel uh we're now going to turn to the second half of our session which is uh throw it open for discussion
