we're going to start by asking a question about so we're going to be this is going to be a kind of reduced form type of paper we have a kind of companion paper that's a more structural paper about this type of thing but here's in reduced forms we want to ask so from the data is there a way in them from a reduced form type of perspective can we see that there might be this instability this local instability in the in macro data how would you identify that and if there is what kind of kind of endogenous fluctuation was the pi that you know what kind of mics we see and then we're going to come back and towards the end ask why would we care about this would it make much difference if we had these two different view of things so let me start with this first question trying to think a bit about local instability so how can we look for that in kind of this reduced form way and let me try to give some idea of uh how we might want to approach this problem uh so think about x as being some variable kind of uh cyclical measure of activity uh maybe like the unemployment rate these are the things i'll be bringing back hours of work and at first pass you might think okay well we kind of have this variable and what we do usually we might kind of run a normal model on it or an ar model and then we look at you know what are the kind of roots of that system do the roots kind of suggest it's quite stable and suppose if we have roots that are smaller than one suggesting if it's quite stable we don't think there's much of a problem it looks like nice and stable or we kind of say well the roots might be getting close to to one we start worrying about being unique roots in general when we're looking at it in that perspective we don't really think about roots that might be greater than one which would be explosive behavior because we're not seeing the economy kind of explode on this on the flip side what i want you to think about is the following so let me think for a second at a slightly different model which you know has a lot of linear part it might have some somehow linear term in it okay and think about this nonlinear term and i'm normalizing everything here so that i have a zero steady state and um and you might think this non-linear term is not very important in the sense that you know this alpha and front might be very small okay so here uh so this system would still have a zero steady state and the roots of this around the zero steady state would still only depend on kind of the linear parts so if you think about that we're taking a linear approximation you might think it doesn't matter we can kind of forget the non-linear part and we should you know it seems pretty okay and that's what we usually do if we think this is not very important but the first thing i want to kind of kind of illustrate is this idea that if the system happens to be locally unstable that's really a bad way of doing things so let me take an example so let me just take a simple example i'm just going to generate some data here it just turned out we have it an ar3 on this and i'm putting in a small amount of a negative cubic term there okay so this has a zero steady state the local dynamics are still run by the implied eigenvalues of the system and the al and let's just look at what happens as we change that autoregressive part moving from having a stable cell a locally stable system being locally unstable okay but still estimating it whether we include this non-linear term or not so what i want to think is suppose so this is the data generating process i think there's this process there's this ar ar component and there's this slight non-linear term and notice i put it as a negative cubed term so it means when things go far there's something that's going to bring us back okay so on either side it's just kind of bringing us back and it's actually quite small such that if you were actually in the stable system okay so if the roots of your system the biggest root in your system was below one and you estimated it with the right model or the wrong model for the wrong one just forgetting the non-linear term you basically get the root the right route back so there's not much problem but once it kind of becomes where you're met your your kind of biggest root actually goes above one so that this system becomes locally unstable well what's the data going to throw you back if you estimate it looking at it to a linear context it's going to throw you back a route that's the top root is always going to be found below one and it's going to be biased more and more as you get into this range where uh this maximum root is greater than even if this system is you know if this non-linear term could be very very small and not important this kind of can still create this bias and why is it creating the bias is your linear approximations not right because the system is locally unstable so the data is pushing it away so you can't take that linear approximation even if uh to try to evaluate those roots so even if you want to estimate these roots you might have to take care of that point so that gave us it kind of gives us an idea of how we might want to look at things okay so the first thing to kind of look at local instability is just saying suppose you take you start you know running a standard linear model and just start introducing a bit of uh nonlinear term and look at the roots of this system here okay this part and see whether they're starting to kind of say if you include the non-linearity does it want to say locally the roots start being greater than one and wants to say it's locally unstable okay so i do want to evaluate whether we have that that type of instability once you're in this one linear term you have to then watch out there might be multiple steady states so you might have to ask whether multiple ones are stable or not once you find this kind of local instability then you can ask let me just start the system out of steady state where does it go and what kind of dynamics does it kind of generate if i shut off these stochastic parts i'm thinking still this system where there might be a unstable local steady state it's not blowing up which means it'll kind of start kind of either creating uh what will be either limit cycles can't last something else it's going to have to generate if it's not going to be that locally stable it might just be moving to some other steady state further away that's another possibility so this is what we want to know is what what happens if we find this evidence of non-local stability here so so this is what we're going to want to do we're going to want to take for uh different measures of uh macro indicator just try to estimate this kind of system where we're kind of doing standard kind of ar formulation and then including some non-linear terms right now i'm just going to be uh estimating this we also did parts with you know ma parts on this it's not a not a major major difference the big question is okay if you're going to try to implement this well what are you going to take as your variable of x what's you know how much you're going to put into this al part what are these variables that you're going to be including in this non-linear part so that's exactly what we were looking at like i say i'm going to look at this and then kind of ask you know to what extent does this system suggest that you might have local instability along around steady state so there's still steady states in this type of system they might be locally unstable and then second sign that just started off with steady state close off the um the stochastic part and just see what happens and what kind of dynamics within the plot okay so so the first part so there's a set of variables most of the variables we're kind of thinking about our uh labor market variables and we can come back to why uh why is this but for example let me think of hours of work and we do things similar with unemployment rate job finding rates okay so we have so this is your your kind of raw data we are kind of removing from the beginning we're removing this kind of low low frequency trend that we know on that kind of uh that's moved over uh the last 50 60 years which is and this is there are cyclical components we're starting this as our uh very our variable of interest as one example of uh the cyclical component in this hour's work notice we're kind of removing a trend that's quite uh low frequency here trying to keep as much stuff in here as possible okay now that's going to be a kind of x and you could do that for unemployment or job finding rates or other variables and the question is what what are we going to be estimating okay so here what we have is going to be estimating i want to allow at least we know kind of a lot of these variables are well captured by ar2 so i wanted to keep an ar2 at least a structure and what we're also including is something that's accumulating here there's this was in kind of our our structural work was suggesting we wanted to keep something that was kind of telling us something about the long history of what's happening so we have this kind of discount itself this is where we're kind of including all these linear terms and then in here we're including these three terms up to uh a third order polynomial of that and that's kind of the biggest model we have and then we do different things to kind of reduce it down okay what are the type of results we find well what we find is when we take this type of model and we start including these linear terms we often find this exactly this evidence of local instability that means we find that the roots start passing above one suggesting that the steady state is not is not stable the multiple steady state turns out not to happen that often sometimes it does we don't find issues of kind of like you know new basins of attractions that doesn't turn out to be an important part but what we do find is when so we find that the system seems to be locally unstable it doesn't want to go to this uh to the steady state if we start it away from there what does it start kind of generating it seems to generate these kind of limit cycles where the economy wants to if there was no shocks it would still want to kind of have a business cycle type uh type property so let me give you examples from the simplest version so we have kind of models a lot of nonlinearities i'm just going to show to make things really simple the simplest version where all i'm putting in is exactly just one non-linearity here in this system so i'm estimating this again that x should be hours of work for in this example and i'm putting in i'm going to be allowing for one non-linearity i'll show it when i'm not putting this in i'll put it in and we'll see what happens okay so what happens here so this is like the model if i don't put any non-linearity and more or less you can just do the addition of the two coefficients here to figure out whether the system looks stable or not more or less so it's kind of like you know this coefficient being you know this plus this can do something below one kind of close to 0.96 and that's actually what turns out to be the uh the biggest the biggest root of this system so it's kind of getting close to one but it's not above one you put in this non-linearity and what happens is you see these things kind of change here and this becomes bigger than this and this starts indicating local instability okay so we're moving there and just allowing this seems to kind of want to move those routes up which again when i show that initial graph that's kind of the indication that might be you should start worrying about local instability as you just introduce non-linearities if your roots start growing might be might not want to only think that we have unit roots but we might want to think we have this local instability type thing so what happens when we kind of start it so here's the phase diagram so this is equivalent to the phase layer this is my state space of this system and you're just starting somewhere so here's a particular starting point out so there's the steady state here is why my structure is very close to zero okay and we're starting it two times once kind of close to the steady state one far away and what does the system want to do in terms of the the dynamics like the transitional dynamics of this system they converge to this type of this type of movement so you start getting within just start the system and it doesn't want to go to the steady state like i said the roots at the steady state the biggest one is a bit greater than one so it's not going to want to attract there it moves out but these non-linearities stop it from exploding and it converges to this either by starting outside or starting inside now it could have had a chaotic type looking type behavior it could have a different thing what it tends to do is this kind of this type of limit cycle type behavior in there just to give you an idea so there's different models that we're estimating more uh like with all the whole third order um polynomial in there that kind of gives us 15 terms then we get do different things of you know kind of reducing that down the smallest one is what we're calling the minimal one as i just showed you the estimate i'm giving you this kind of limit cycle these are different limit cycles uh jonathan was suggesting we do things choosing these models by using elastic technique it's one of these this one here um but they're kind of all giving the same thing they start giving appearing these type of uh limit cycles type behavior off what we're just estimating all we're doing is just estimating the equation allowing from some non-linear terms and then checking if it's slowly unstable and then starting it out a steady state where it converges and converges to this now how big are these these cycles what kind of cycles are they kind of suggesting so this is back to the data that's been put in here okay and this is just an example of starting it out of a steady state and then just seeing the system in its kind of time path here okay so it's a little bit bigger at the beginning and then it starts converging here and this is the limit cycle that seems to be implied by the model which would be saying if even if you didn't have any shocks here the system might want to continue moving of about this type of amplitude now notice that this type of thinking isn't telling you that there's a deterministic cycle in the system it's not like the system moves around here and just gets shocked around this when you're going to shock the system it's going to affect all this so what happens in this you can think about it as there's different ways of thinking about the uncertainty here as you're going to move over time it's going to be less more less and less predictable where you're going to be going but this is still saying that in your system you have this kind of endogenous nodules forces okay so that's just coming off the deterministic system when we're just shutting it down and looking at what happens okay um now one of the things that this relies on to get all this is non-linearity but we often think these non-millionaires are really not very big in the data that's actually exactly what we're finding we're finding very small non-linearities so here if you think about plotting the what i just was estimating just the non-linearity from h to h3q it's kind of this is the relationship this is the data span the nonlinearity is very small but it's enough to change the way we see the dynamic now what it's doing is because it's kind of allowing a root that's greater than one to appear but it's not a lot bigger than one so it's not moving out very quickly so it doesn't take much force to move things back in but it's giving this kind of a different different view of things okay so robustness so we do a lot of things in the paper and the others we find this sometimes you don't find it other times we find it with quite a few labor market variables uh there's kind of issues that arrive what we find is almost all the time when we include these these nonlinear terms it really tends to increase the roots of the system going off and above one or at least very close to one we actually think we kind of give some monte carlo of what we're doing could we be picking up these things for the wrong reasons actually if anything our monte carlo seems to suggest we have it's a low powered way of doing things if anything we're not picking up as much as as there might be in the data we look at certain other countries and then there's questions we also do some things with quantity variables there's issues there that also support monte carlo why quantity variables might be a bit more difficult to detect this and the easy way to think about it is you might have this force that's kind of like a stationary force you think about the quantity variables it's like throwing off on top of it a tfp process that's non-stationary kind of disentangling those two is just much more difficult okay so why should we care well one of the reasons we might want to care about this is it might mean a different thing about how we think about policy okay so here i'm going to ask i want to think for a moment suppose i took that system and i could just control the variance and i could kind of reduce the variance of shocks and think about how different it would be if i'm in the linear world versus this non-linear world obviously what i'm doing is subject to the lucas critique i'm just taking the model as a you know structural object and changing a variance and these non-linearities might not be uh invariant to that but i'm still going to do this this type of exercise what you can do in this model well first of all you learn that you reduce the variance of shocks it's not even clear it even reduces the variance of the output measure as such okay it's all kind of coming to that but i think the more important thing in terms of quantitatively what we think about what it seems to do is you can reduce the variance of shocks in this system what i'll tend to do is actually reduce the variance a lot less and it changes more the frequency of things so this is what i'm going to try to illustrate yes okay so this is just a plot of the uh the variance of the output x relative to the standard error of x relative to the standard error of the input which is that epsilon okay so we're in the linear model okay so when i don't put any of these on a linear term obviously i have this kind of linear relationship the more i have variants of the shock more i have variance of output in the in this type of the nonlinear model we estimate not surprising it has a non-zero intercept that's not surprising it has a limit cycle so even if there's no shocks you'd still have something what's the interesting thing is how it has a lot less slope so it becomes a system that's a lot less sensitive to a change in the shock so if you change the shocks you change the variance much less seeing it in terms of the spectrum of the data so if i take that data and so this dark line is basically the spectrum of the data that's matched by either the non-linear model i'm estimating or the linear one and here i'm just varying the uh the amount of the shock to the system what we see is in this for example if i'm in a linear model and i increa i decrease the shock variance i really decrease a lot all the variance of the system what happens in the non-linear model by decrease the shocks what happens it just moves over you start you reduce the variance a little bit but not much what you really do is you change the frequency of the cycles you're creating cycles that are a bit longer as you reduce the shock variance and if you were just looking at the business cycle frequency these two examples would tell you would look like a great moderation if you change the shocks to hitting the system everything at business cycle frequency would like look more stable but what's happening is you're pushing frequencies up further and that's exactly what some work has kind of been suggesting that over you know the last uh okay 25 years or so we've kind of seen this change where the kind of short run movements have kind of become more uh more reduced but we're having these longer cycles happening anyways uh so let me conclude with that am i at zero um so what i wanted to suggest by this paper just kind of thinking maybe you want to look at some of these issues and kind of suggested a way of looking at them we think we found intriguing evidence to kind of suggest maybe we should think about this a bit more we have ideas why the economy might be doing this but obviously a lot more work will be needed here
