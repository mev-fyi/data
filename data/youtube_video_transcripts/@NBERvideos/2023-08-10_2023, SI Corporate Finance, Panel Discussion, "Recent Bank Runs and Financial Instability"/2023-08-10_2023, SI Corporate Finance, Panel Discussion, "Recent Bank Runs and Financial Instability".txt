um so I'm delighted that uh we have a panel of uh four people who have worked extensively um on issues of Bank instability and financial Market upsets if you want and we thought uh now is the time that we should really revisit these topics as you probably saw Mike Obama made some enhancement this morning even um so this is our panel on recent bank runs and financial instability and we will have viralacharya regometer in that order um first give 15 minutes um this discussion of their work and how it pertains to these topics and then we're going to go to q a from the audience yeah so with this world we want to get started uh thank you so much uh Antoinette and Amir for giving me the opportunity I'm stepping in for Raghu who unfortunately can't be heard but delighted to get this chance to present some of our joint work it's not this one yet thank you so uh what I wanted to talk about is based on uh some work that Raghu and I have been doing with Rahul Chauhan and Sasha Stefan Sasha is in the audience uh and it's based on the paper I gave at Jackson Hole in August perhaps for the right reasons everyone thought we were barking up the wrong tree that time thinking about banks on in short deposits but thankfully Silicon Valley Bank has helped us out uh okay so uh normally we uh when we think about the stresses of the last three years uh to start with I would say there was a stress in the banking system in the pandemic outbreak there was a very severe dash for cash on Bank lines of credit uh uh the the shock was in Shadow banking that froze and Banks actually underperformed the stock market for quite some time but it wasn't exactly a solvency problem of any significant sort for banks then we embarked on massive stimulus QE low rates fiscal stimulus perhaps the mother of all interventions at least in our lifetimes uh and the recovery has been very sharp and the inflation then turned out to be stubbornly high as well so the question we are after and what I want to spend some time on is whether the pandemic QE perhaps along with the fiscal stimulus set up the stage for the banking stress that we have witnessed now I'm going to talk only about one's deliver of the various problems that these Banks had which is to do with the stock of their uninsured Bank deposits uh of course there have been large Mark to Market losses on banks security Holdings there's this famous picture from FDIC but I want to what I want you to focus on here just to keep in mind is that when in 16 17 18 the rates Rose Banks did actually make losses at that time on their Securities Holdings also it's just that they were not very large you know they were on the order of 75 billion dollars but come 2022 beginning of 2023 and you can see these losses have magnified about 10 times about roughly speaking about that half of that is due to the faster pace of interest rate hikes and about half of that is because the bank balance sheets are actually much much larger and we think that the bank balance sheets being so large this time around their Securities Holdings being so large has something to do with quantitative easing and perhaps fiscal stimulus and that's what we are trying to understand so once the deposit outflow started in Q2 2022 we eventually had Bank runs and I think most people would agree that perhaps what has been most surprising uh has been the large share of uninsured deposits on bank balance sheets uh so normally of course we take these as given then we think about runs uh Allah diamond and other such models uh but the question we are asking is about the stock of these uninsured deposits how does That Vary over time and whether the waxing and waning of the central bank balance sheet has something to do with the stock of uninsured deposits on the bank balance sheet so like I think think of that as the main question I'm going to focus on okay so to just motivate this if you look at Silicon Valley bank once we went into low rates and quantitative easing period uh the Silicon Valley Bank deposits which were mostly uninsured they grew cumulatively by over 100 billion dollars over a very short period of about eight quarters okay this is a very very fast pace of growth uh you can see it's growing anywhere between 10 to 15 billion dollars a quarter and then of course that is first the Slow Burn uh and then the very rapid week of deposit outflows now I would hesitate to conclude that the problems of this type are just problems of Silicon Valley Banks and such aggressively run Banks because actually this is what's been happening to the banking sector as a whole and okay this is an important chart where I'm showing you the uninsured deposits the line is the fraction of uninsured deposits to Total deposits that used to be around 47 percent before the pandemic stimulus and it grew to 50 to 53 percent by the uh by the end of these stimulus and in quantitative numbers this is more than 3.5 trillion dollars increase in uninsured deposits of banks okay so this is very very large uh you can imagine that uh sources of uncertainty about Bank assets be it interest rates be it commercial real estate this could potentially create large runs in the system okay uh so what we did in our paper and we are still trying to understand all pieces of it in in all earnestness is to document these patterns of growth of Bank deposits of demandable deposits which are at the top in the thick uh black line that's the only that's the in short component the dashed line at the top is the uninsured component don't focus on much of the rest what you see here is that come the pandemic you see a very massive increase in Bank Reserves that's one way of capturing quantitative easing which is is the Central Bank flooding the banking system with reserves and what you see here is that there is also a massive coincident rise in the bank deposits at that time okay so that's just sort of Prima facing evidence that there may be something between these two that when central banks expand their balance sheets the stock of deposits in the banking system expands as well okay now you can see here that both insured an uninsured are increasing and of course the natural question to ask is is there something to do with fiscal stimulus because fiscal stimulus is also Distributing checks and that would create also an increase in deposits in the system so to get at this a little bit uh here on the left I'm showing you the change in uninsured deposits of the banking system on a quarterly basis against the changes in the banking systems reserves uh the this is all the post pandemic stimulus period and you see the red line implies a sort of reasonable positive relationship now if you take out the fiscal stimulus quarters if anything the green line suggests that the link between Central Bank Reserves and Banks uninsured liabilities deposits is actually even stronger okay in contrast if you look at the in short deposit changes on the right hand side once again you see that yes when Central Bank Reserves expand in short deposits expand but once you take out the stimulus quarters fiscal stimulus quarters actually there isn't much of a relationship okay so what we conclude from this is that in short deposits in the system on the previous graph primarily increased because of fiscal stimulus the uninsured deposits increase both because of fiscal stimulus but importantly also because of quantitative easing okay now the question is how does this come about okay and that's our key Insight from the Jackson Hole piece which is that we are used to thinking of quantitative easing as an expansion of central bank's balance sheet size okay but that's only the Central Bank side of the story typically when central bank balance sheets expand it's also associated with an expansion of commercial bank balance sheets and this expansion happens on the back of an insured bank deposit okay so I'm going to give you a simple schematic to explain this so this is the fed this is the banking sector and this is the public think of them as non-banks now because the Holdings of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities which the FED purchases in QE are so vast and so widespread typically quantitative easing involves a tendering of Securities by the non-bank system to the FED via the banks as the intermediaries okay so here fed is trying to do quantitative easing of one dollar so it's purchasing one dollars from the market and it's crediting as its liability the Bank Reserves by one dollar so whichever Prime broker is tendering the Securities gets one dollar Reserve in its Commercial Bank checking account with this with the Fed now of course the question is what's happening to the deposits of the banking system they got one dollar of extra asset and it's this non-bank it could be a hedge fund a mutual fund a family office a high net worth individual an insurance company they are tendering their security uh which is now reduced by one dollar via this bank to the fed and what's happened in the process is that we have created a dollar of inside money in the system okay so this non-bank now has a dollar of deposit into the banking system and because of the scale of these transactions the financial or the institutional nature of this deposit this is typically going to be an uninsured bank deposit now there could be second order effects this non-bank could go and take out its deposit and instead Buy corporate bonds now the corporate actually has a deposit into the banking system they will then turn it around and make payments to suppliers and employees But whichever way you cut it the ultimate accounting will have to have created uninsured deposits in the banking system which we empirically measure as I showed you is quite a powerful relationship with the reserves okay so what are the implications of this important insight for the ongoing banking stress um that quantitative easing which was of a very rapid and far and large scale of about four trillion dollars that created Bank onion short deposits and on the left-hand side of bank balance sheet it created reserves now that by itself could sometimes be enough to destabilize the system if then reserves and deposits don't stand one for one in each balance sheet you know there could be an asymmetric distribution but I think to understand what's going on right now we don't even need that because there was fiscal stimulus on top of this so what does fiscal stimulus do the reserves that went into the banking system now get used to purchase government securities so first reserves move from the banks to the government account then the fiscal stimulus brings it brings the reserves back into the banking system and therefore now we are creating another round of amplification of the bank balance sheet size okay which is banks are now going to get some in short deposits but also some uninsured deposits because some of the stimulus is going to PPP and corporates and so on so that's not going to be in short deposits but now banks are also expanding on the left-hand side with Holdings of government bonds okay so the combination of QE and fiscal stimulus creates a huge stock of uninsured deposits first created by QE then some created by fiscal stimulus and then on the left hand side it's created now this interest rate sensitive government government bonds which are now on the bank balance sheets and then if you get inflation and high interest rates because maybe this was a bit too much for the system then you basically get runs because the Securities are not worth what they what you thought they were all uninsured deposits both created by QE as well as by fiscal stimulus think they might be on the hook for the losses and they will start running now okay and so it's the interaction of the two which really makes this problem uh really really bad okay now the the final question uh in the last few minutes is so okay it's true that runs can happen or at least drawdowns of deposits can happen but we injected so much liquidity in the system for first one trillion then four trillion then 8 trillion of reserves where does all this liquidity go why isn't there enough to actually meet the system's demands and the problem is it's not just that when you do QE you are injecting reserves in the system you are also creating demandable claims with immediacy in the system so the net liquidity creation from the system is far lower than what we think it is just based on the notion that we are injecting liquid assets into the system and on top of that Banks could write other claims on liquidity they could write credit lines which can get drawn down upon so the multiplier of demandable claims may even be larger than the stock of reserves that you have injected into the system it's our view that this perhaps is a unified story why we are seeing surprisingly fragile Financial conditions okay you see some government tax outflows so the reserves move into the governments and you get a repo Market rollover problem in September 19. uh pandemic time you get a dash for cash from Shadow Banks and corporations UK you get a fiscal shock and then you have Pension funds who can't find enough collateral because there's just too many demandable claims even though you have too much of a reserve asset which is out there in the system so what's the final implication of all this we think that through the size of the central bank balance sheet we have created a conflict between Financial stability and monetary policy okay which is that it's easy to get in it's easy to expand but it's a little harder to get out of this problem because for monetary policy you want to shrink the central bank balance sheet and now take out the reserves but the entire stock of demandable claims out there is not shrinking at the same pace and even if it shrinks at the same Pace it's a problem because the distribution may not be that large so the system has just become too dependent on the FED it just keeps ratcheting up its balance sheet size so if you if you see what happened with the bank of England problem they had to rewind on their quantitative tightening and start injecting money back into the bond market what's happening with the FED right now one armor fed for monetary policy is doing quantitative tightening but the other arm through lender of Last Resort is effectively doing quantitative easing it's pumping money back into the system so we think that the benefits of QE need to be caveat with these downsides on financial fragility front uh and at the very extreme perhaps therefore maybe when QE is undertaken if there was an explicit role for financial stability in federal reserves objective function maybe at least going forward with the hindsight of this knowledge that we have we would perhaps not do stimulus which is as large as we undertook this time thank you foreign thank you for having me uh talk about it so I I have two goals today or two topics to cover uh first I want to talk to you about solvency runs which are runs that happen with people think that a banking solvent will become insolvent but if uninsured repositors believe that a bank is solvent it will in fact remain solvent and profitable and happily live after Ever After I'll link this to a monetary policy and talk about how tightening monetary policy exposes Banks to the possibility of a solvency run that doesn't mean Iran will occur but the chance of such runs increases uh the second thing I want to talk about is Bank uninsured leverage a concept that I Erica Ahmed and tomek have been Banning around for now two years um that is a much more interesting concept than Bank leverage which we've all thought about and then what I'm going to want to talk about a little bit is measurement so I'm going to talk a little bit about the evidence of how run uninsured depositors are which clearly reads the uninsured depositor runs and did monetary tightening exposed Banks to solvency runs in 2023 which is why we're here okay um so the first paper I want to talk about is the paper with Erica Zhang Ahmed Ahmed Cerro and Thomas uh which we put out three days after uh svb software to run and the goal of that paper was sort of twofold one was um estimate Bank losses uh on the asset side uh due to interest rate increases since q1 2022. in other words how much did Banks lose in unreported assets because interest rates went up that was pretty straightforward uh the more complicated piece is we were trying to draw implications for Bank health and we settled on trying to think about Banks exposure to the possibility of solvency runs and I'm going to tell you how we try to make that connection of the theory of solvency runs to the data that we actually observed so let's talk about the easy one which is how do we measure uh Bank losses that were experienced because interest rates went up and Banks didn't sort of keep track of that under balance sheet so we pretty much marked to Mark Mark to Market uh Bank Securities uh including rmbs treasuries and other non-air MBS Securities bank loans in the and other loans in that for example we differ from the stuff that the FDIC that the barrel showing you before and what did we find when interest rates increased since q1 2022 the total unreported losses losses in the banking sector on the asset side were about 2.2 trillion dollars in total put things in context that is the entire book Equity of the U.S banking sector okay book come on Market okay what's interesting is the distribution of these loss process which clearly was not uniform across the banking sector okay the average Bank suffered about 10 percent decline right so what we try to do from here on is say okay we saw svb go down we know assets were losses were suffered can we pinpoint which other Banks might be fragile from the Monday after svb laws given what we see in the data and the first thing we noticed in the data is if you just look on the asset time what share of asset losses did you suffer svb did not look particularly special in fact about 10 percent of banks about 450 banks in the US suffered percentage-wise worse losses on the asset side than svb so if you want to pinpoint your finger to what's driving the svb run eh asset losses maybe is part of the story but clearly not the whole story okay then svb was one down because they were well insolvent so your second thing might be uh well it's capital um it's not really capital okay um svb was a poorly capitalized bank but 10 of banks were worse capitalized than svb prior to interest rate increases and about 10 of banks were worse capitalized than SUV post interest rate increases so again svb bad but particular outlier not at all okay where was svb an outlier in the data in uninsured leverage okay uninsured Leverage is a concept we sort of defined when we talked about Shadow Bank leverage uh and it's really your uninsured leverage relative to assets rather than overall leverage counting and short deposits okay and there you see svb was a big outlier in the data but again there are some banks in the U.S banking system that have a higher uninsured leverage than svb now step back and just tell yourself okay so we've pointed our finger to uninsured deposits we've all talked about this how do we go from uninsured leverage to trying to figure out well which other possible Banks could be prone to runs okay and our first intuition I would say is Diamond okay Diamond the vixor says look runs occur because banks have E-liquid assets so they have to liquidate assets at a discount it's either chopping down three so let's call it selling E-liquid loans okay but that's cannot be the central problem for banks in 2023 and I think Doug would agree svb did not suffer a diamond I'll run because banks have lots of liquidity the average Bank in the US has about 40 percent of their balance sheet being super duper liquid okay um on Monday there were huge regulatory intervention after MVP went down flooding with system with liquidity but Banks kept failing and deposits kept running so it's not liquid so that what that means is we need a model of uninsured depositor runs in banks that have super liquid assets okay and why do we need that because if you have a wrong model you end up with misguided policy for example the a Fed report on the svb reports on liquidity 318 times that's after svb goes down and mentions solvency once okay because all eyes are because Doug was so successful on liquidity but we fixed the liquidity problem okay um so the question is do we have us a way to think about runs in liquid Banks and luckily uh for me we do and it's uh the work I have with Mark Egan who's right there and the Ali hortatsu in the AR in 2017. so how does the Run work in a bank when assets are fully liquid what you need is Bank Market power in the deposit Mark okay you need really a deposit franchise value model to deal with that and you can get a bad run equilibrium simply in the following way um if depositors think the bank will go down they either withdraw deposits or demand a compensation for the register bearing either way banks are less profitable in this model withdrawals and increasing interest rates on deposits are about the same thing okay Banks become less profitable so Bank Equity declines banks are more likely to fail voila depositors were actually right to run we have a bad equilibrium you can also have a good equilibrium just like in Diamond divik if we all think banks are profitable we don't have to withdraw deposits Banks make a boatload of money off of deposit like JPMorgan is still paying zero are very profitable and they're very stable okay so that's what we did in that paper what we did not do in that paper is think about monetary policy okay so in the paper that was then trying to analyze stability we thought hmm how do we think about possible interaction of monetary policy insolvency runs well it's pretty clear interest rates go up asset values decline that exposes you to the possibility of a solvency run even though in the good equilibrium Banks might still be super profitable and in fact their asset values might go up like in Philip Philips work okay so good equilibria can remain equally good but bad equilibrium become more and more and more plausible okay so the question then is how do you take this idea and map it into Data to evaluate whether there's in fact a possibility of a self-fulfilling solvent serum okay you can do it two ways in the 2017 paper we apply this to the Great Recession we measured first in the data how responsible are uninsured depositors to bank risk of default elasticity about is about minus 0.6 that doesn't tell you much okay they walk but not run for exits but during the Great Recession deposits uninsured deposits LED weak Banks to strong Banks also and then you can do what we did in 2017 you plug it in a structural model you compute all the possible equilibria and you can do fun things like what would happen with the worst equilibrium if you cranked up Capital requirements obviously that was not practical if we were going to do this in three days for the whole US banking system to evaluate things forward so we did something simpler but I actually think quite sensible as a back of the envelope we said the following suppose a certain share of depositors wakes up and freaks out beat ten percent twenty percent thirty percent and so on how many of how many depositor runs could a bank survive from a perspective of not impairing insured deposits okay and if it can survive it then these depositors were right to run and we have a self-fulfilling run possibility that doesn't mean Iran's gonna happen but if depositors were to freak out it could okay so what did we find if about 10 of depositors wake up and freak out about 66 66 banks in the US are vulnerable to solvency run if the number that was then later really made the headlines if about half of the depositors are wake up and freak out about 190 banks in the US could be possibly subject to a solvency run okay so this is sort of the central way we were trying to evaluate whether Banks could be subject to solvency runs of course if we guarantee all deposits then you know the positive say well there is no freak out and you know Banks could remain solvent and extract uh rents from uninsured depositors okay uh what we did and I think this is I'll call it an R sample test because we put this out on Monday after svb we computed this bank by bank and where I think we got a little bit of exposed validation is you know we did not name Banks because well that sounded like a bad idea um but we did compute for every Bank the possibility of Iran and for example First Republic which looked very much wrong prone in our data and according to our calculation went down so did a bunch of other banks that were in trouble in fact if you look at the stats the regional banks are the ones that kind of start looking pretty bad on uninsured leverage and asset declines and so on okay so I'll argue um the data bore us out exposed this was the one time where we actually like you know at least somewhat were able to um predict things okay so where do I want to wrap up um this was this main article on CNBC yesterday uh the American banking landscape is on the cusp of a seismic shift and pretty much saying look the U.S banking system is uh somewhat under capitalized we're gonna have to have mergers oh for me what stands out is hopefully now several months after svb a weekend put to to bed the idea that this is that runs are just driven by liquidity uh because the liquidity does not fix solvency issues okay and we have to start thinking a bit more broadly about what does it mean for a bank to be unstable um we did put out a couple of complementary papers to the first one one was on hedging um deadbanks hedge um hopefully you all looked at that one no um the second one was uh in fact some of them like as we wound down their head just as the interest rates were going up uh the second one which uh was how about commercial real estate distrust okay and pretty much if you look at that paper what we said was look commercial real estate is a big share of Bank portfolios if we get the commercial real estate losses of about the Great Recession not a big deal at all for a healthy banking sector okay but for a banking sector that's lost about 2.2 trillion dollars in asset values yep you can move about 30 other Banks into the possibility of a solvency run and that could be a problem okay so thank you very much okay I'd like to thank internet and Amir for inviting me to talk in this panel and so my comments are going to be based on three papers which are empirically oriented and it's examined Bank runs in two different countries India and the US in three different time periods using micro level data and so you know while we have uh award-winning Nobel prize winning uh papers on Bank runs we have relatively little empirical evidence on how on depositors responses and how they behave and so that's where these papers are going to Center so in the first paper in the interest of time I'm going to continue as this is happening so in the first paper which I did with rajair we looked at a bank in India that failed it's not working anymore yeah so we had detailed deposit uh Micro Data from a small Cooperative Bank in India which faced a shock and survived and so we asked which classes of depositors run now in India also there is Deposit Insurance they're not quite as seamless as FDIC Deposit Insurance so think of it as somewhat imperfect Deposit Insurance and we said does it matter does Deposit Insurance even when it's imperfect make a difference we asked what about social networks does that make a difference and then we ask what deposits are actually stable so Basel III talks a lot about stable deposits and we ask our stable deposits always stable or are they conditionally stable to give an example one of the results we found in this paper was that depositors who had loan linkages were more likely to run now what does that mean is it that they're just sorry less likely to run so is it that they never run they're just stable or is it that they have better information nation which means if there's actually a big shock they are more likely to run right and in order to answer that we decided we needed a bank which faces a run and survives and then later on faces a run and failed we identified and got data from the back and so that is the second paper and we asked what is the differential run behavior when a bank has a low versus high solvency shock in order to see unstable the others actually stable deposits as Basel 3 would say or are they conditionally stable where you have this underlying information and the answer is some are stable it depends on the kind of relationship and others are actually conditionally stable more on that later and then finally I worked at the FDIC and who does the resolution of fail Banks to encourage them to you know get all the wonderful data they have to actually look at film Bank behavior in the U.S so using Micro Data there there we are now Deposit Insurance in the US which has historically been remarkably effective the bank closes on Friday Monday you get your money back seamless doesn't you know how effective is it and we look at both outflows as well as inflows now during the Great Recession in 2008 temporary Deposit Insurance was introduced Tagged so in order to protect you know payroll and business accounts not interest bearing transaction accounts had unlimited Deposit Insurance did people understand it did it work and so that's what we address and the third paper and so put together these three papers these are the questions I'll talk about and I'll give at least partial answers does Deposit Insurance matter do temporary measures such as tag because we have a law in today's crisis about well what about the small guy what about payrolls what do we do about that is there an alternative to unlimited Deposit Insurance well tag was an alternative did it work s and then how often do uninsured depositors actually lose money in failed Banks everyone says they lose all the time turns out it's not true they rarely lose their money and more on that what about insured depositor Behavior a lot of the focus is on uninsured deposit is running do insured deposit is run turn out they do with a different level of intensity but they do what about the role of relationships and relationships you you should be careful to Define in many different ways because different relationships in different ways actually do matter and then what about the role of social networks even before social media likely Amplified by social media but what what effect does social networks have for runs the general belief is Deposit Insurance matters and hence the deposit Insurance limit has steadily been going up to what it currently is which is a quarter million okay so first does Deposit Insurance matter so let's look what these three papers say looking at three different banks two different countries three different time periods the answer is a resounding yes even when Deposit Insurance is imperfect it is the case uninsured depositors do run more they are quicker to run so not only do they pull out more money they are quicker to run often they will run even before Bank specific bad information is out there so if you look in the US when the formal enforcement action is announced by that time all the uninsured time deposits have already fled these are sophisticated depositors they're moving well before well before these public signals are are coming in okay does Deposit Insurance matter well what's different between historically and today as my fellow panelists have pointed out the sheer size of uninsured deposits between 2009 to 2022 it's grown three times from 2.3 trillion to 7.7 trillion these are disproportionately concentrated in large Banks so the banks and the top one percent have 66 percent of uninsured deposits now another thing that we have seen historically right especially in the U.S is that when Banks weren't in trouble there was a substitution of uninsured deposits with insured deposits what was the mechanism the bank was in trouble they would heighten they would raise their interest rates and they would get time deposits right under that 250 000 limit right and so the banks that we study and then we looked at you know more broadly a call reports if you look at the total you know total outflows they're losing one-third but aggregate deposits are the same because they're making it up through these through this uh inflow now this typically takes place over weeks now in Silicon Valley Bank you lost 25 of the deposits in one day it was predicted to be 40 the next day obviously there just isn't enough time for many of the standard mechanisms to work now what about temporary Deposit Insurance right and I think this is particularly relevant in today's policy discussion because people are saying okay what do we have do we keep Deposit Insurance the way it is do we have unlimited Deposit Insurance with all the moral hazard issues that we know we're likely to have do we have something in between well we had an in-between experiment and that was tag right and that was introduced in 2008 it was there for two years first then it was replaced by the Dodd-Frank Act which sort of extended something similar for another two years and essentially you have unlimited insurance for checking accounts so it covers the payment and operation of payroll and business accounts and our research suggests tag worked brilliantly it worked as well as regular Deposit Insurance people understood it and it reduced deposit outflows now how much do uninsured depositors lose a common assumption made theoretically and almost everywhere that I've seen in academic papers is uninsured depositors lose all their money this is simply not true if you look at the failed Banks right that in the Great Recession in only six percent of those failed Banks did uninsured depositors actually lose their money why when you put the bank on the Block the acquiring Bank wants these valuable depositors they want that franchise these are the guys with money so they make them whole so most of the time nobody loses any money occasionally they do but only six percent of the time as this as these numbers show which which are sourced from FDIC what about insured depositor Behavior a common assumption is ensure depositors do not run this is not true in all three banks that we study two different countries three different time periods ensure the departures do run now they run with less intensity so in the U.S if you look at how much do they pull so it's either you're not paying attention you don't pull out your money or you pay attention you pull out all your money or you pay attention and you pull out half your money that that's typically sort of the behavior that we we see now it gets less attention now obviously the magnitude of uninsured depositors is much more but this is not something to be ignored now what about the role of relationships there's a huge literature in banking that so many of you have contributed to that suggests relationships are important we all believe this but typically what do relationships do they give information to the bank about the client right there's a signal now in Bank runs think of the reverse happening and that is now the depositor is getting a signal about the bank help through the relationship right and what we find is relationships are important and importantly I'm going to point to only one and that is depositors with loan linkages now when you have a shark and you survive you're fundamentally healthy these guys don't run but if it's a really bad shock and the bank goes under they're the first to run so thinking that stable deposits you have stable and unstable deposits it's just not the right way to think about it these are conditionally stable deposits which fundamentally depend on the underlying health of the bank next let's think of social networks right everyone talks about it very hard to measure right how do you know if someone is actually in your network so we have the standard problems if you use geography the monsie reflection problem Etc so what we were able to do because of the Indian institutional framework in India if you need to open a bank account you have to get someone who already has a bank account to introduce you so we use this as the introducer network the great Advantage is we know you know each other right you you introduced each other and what we find in the there we actually have time stamped Bank withdrawals so what we find is that people within the introduction and the same network they have a much higher transmission probability of running so you know we're all colleagues we work at the same place you run I'm much more likely to run not only that we're colleagues we're in the same institution we we had lunch we said this bank is going under we all get up transmission probability is highest at lunch time and when you actually look at the line of the timestamps where are the people standing behind each other you actually see this on the day so this is what a Traditional Bank Run looks like you go to FDIC these these pictures are everywhere but this is not what a bank room looks like anymore we know right thanks to Electronic Banking you don't have to get up and queue up outside that right your arm doesn't have to drive all the way to some God forsaken place to to draw her deposits right and so what is so accordingly the speed of transfer of funds has increased enormously right and so speed because you don't have to stand in the line and you can do these electronic transfers now think of Silicon Valley Bank where you had VCS and portfolio from a lot of common ownership a lot of cross ownership very strong social networks this is very much in line with our evidence that social networks matter the social strong social networks led to coordinated withdrawals with VCS telling their portfolio companies to draw down their deposits so let me sort of conclude and just put this all together right and because there's a lot of empirical work but hopefully it'll make sense does it Deposit Insurance matter the answer is yes uninsured depositors run more they run quicker this is across countries across time what about new temporary measures of Deposit Insurance that just cover business and payroll these non-interest bearing checking accounts do they what yes they were effective and you you actually saw less withdrawals when tag was introduced what about insured depositive behaviors insured depositors also run it's a it is a misogyny you to think that they don't they run but with less intensity often it's about half the limit and what about the role of relationships relationships are important now if you look at the current age it behaves in a completely different manner if you bank with that man forever chances are you're never gonna run but if you have a loan linked account then it tends to be a conditional you know it's based on the underlying information if it's really bad you run otherwise you don't and then what about social networks it's important the transmission probability is very high and we measure this you know looking at virus spreading in biology using those methodologies if you run I mean you know if if you have a viral disease am I more likely to get it same way if you run am I more likely to get it in the same network yes the transmission probability is Sky High and so when we're doing these coordination games or Bank runs where do the signals come from these are saying these are two potential sources of the signals social networks and relationships now what are new developments that can affect the Dynamics one the sheer scale of uninsured deposits and the speed of withdrawals right I mean we're talking of typically in the in in the banks I studied if you had four five percent withdrawing that is terrible news here you had 25 I mean it's just ridiculous amount of withdrawal and then social media interacting with social networks and amplifying you know this coordination I think there's something else to think about thank you last but not least Philip uh well thanks a lot for having me here it's a big pleasure to be part of this panel what I thought would be most useful for the discussion today is to just give you a sense uh of what happened over the last couple of months so I will try to put them into a framework at least the way I understand it so I think any discussion of the last few months has to sort of you know start with the rise in interest rates um and you know since 2021 the FED is raised to short-term rates by now more than five percent and so as a result of that long-term rates which reflect future expected future short rates uh increased by about 2.5 percent and so you know if you want to get a back of the envelope estimate of how that affect the bank assets well you just look at the size of tall Bank assets so total long-term loans and securities they have an average duration across all asset class of around four years and you can use Simple Bond math to say well a rise of 2.5 percent time iteration of you know four years size of the balance sheet 17 trillion and you get a number of around 1.7 trillion uh and that's sort of roughly in the same ballpark of us Gregor had as well uh and you know I want to point out it's it's not hard to calculate that's a contrary to credit risk you know we know how to calculate interest rate risk um very easily and it's large uh as Craig also pointed out this large relative to bank Equity itself the same order of magnitude so if they're all there is to Banks if all they have is the bank assets effectively this would suggest that Banks should be bankrupt there should be insolvent now if you look at the stock market during that time this is not exactly what the stock Wing was telling us so here I'm plotting the S P 500 and there was a bank stock index from mid to 2001 to you know most recently uh June 23 and I want to make two observations so first of all even during the time when the Fed was raising rates so these losses have just been talking about have been piling up it didn't seem to affect Bank stocks so Bank stocks actually were holding up they were just doing as well as the market of all up to the SVP failure now clearly svb was sort of watershed moment Bank stock declined but roughly 30 percent to this data somewhat depressed but you know by no means you know the stock market told us that the toll banking sector is insolvent so there must be something else which is holding up Bank well you and if you're familiar with the work I have with Alexis Sabo who is he Anita madrexa will not be surprised to hear that I think you know what's holding up Bank value to large extent is to deposit franchise so I would argue one thing uh maybe D thing which makes Bank special is that the issue deposits we know depositors has been discussed to Value them for the convenience the safety the liquidity and so they're willing to accept low deposit rates and effectively that gives Banks pricing power you could even call it Market power when interest rates go up in fact when interest rates go up Banks become much more profitably positive becomes much more profitable for banks so one way to measure that uh is with what we call the deposit beta um if I was a beta is just sort of a measure of how much the deposit rates increase when uh defense fund rate increase so uh historically the average deposit beta is about 0.4 so that means if there's 100 basis points increase in the FED funds rate you would see on average of 40 basis points increasing deposit rates that also means that Banks actually capture the remainder for themselves so effectively they capture sixty percent of the rise in the FED funds rate now how did that work out during the current hiking cycle so here I'm just plotting average National deposit rates from the FDIC so you can see the FED funds rate now going to five percent but deposit rates just as they've done uh previous Cycles have not uh held up they have not uh repriced uh at the same speed so you can see interest checking in green is still paying zero savings deposits it's the main form of deposits is paying somewhere around 50 basis points and time deposits be a bit more 1.5 percent response but clearly much lower than uh the feds contract now to be clear there are a lot of banks out there online banks you know money market funds which offer more attractive returns so there are higher deposit rates out there but this is these are the deposit rates which the average deposits are actually earning primarily at the large Banks now what does that mean when you compare historically so here I'm just plotting the distribution of deposit betas this is estimated um of over previous hiking cycle so this is from my chef paper with Alexa nirmer we actually posted this uh data on our website that's for the number 0.4 is coming from you see there's some distributions some banks have a very strong deposit franchise they have a lower beta some have a less strong deposit friendships with a higher beta so but it's around 0.4 now if you look at what happens with betas in this rate cycle you can compare them to what there was in history now one caveat the latest data we have the latest call reports we have to end in March so clearly we haven't all priced in yet but still I think it's interesting to compare with what the beta is doing this hiking cycle looked like and so far the beta is actually much lower consistent with the previous graph I've showed you so that means banks have been actually capturing a large share of the increase in the FED funds rate so so what I expect these payers to increase over time um you know probably get much closer to the historical betas in fact if you listen to Banks now some of them are starting to release their own estimates of the betas will be they're sort of more closer with the historical betas are but in some senses historical beta I think are still a good guide to think about what's happening to this deposits during this hiking cycle so if you take the historical number of 0.4 which I just Target is reasonable say well what does that mean for deposit French is to be a hedge to these losses on the asset side well Banks roughly have 17 trillion deposits um you know to basically earn this spread of 60 with a beta of 0.4 so if the FED fundra is around five percent that means they earn five percent times sixty percent a deposit spread of three percent so that's the benefit of having financing yourself if deposits relative to borrowing at the competitive should rate now three percent of 17 trillion of deposits well that means they actually increase the income by a little bit more than 500 billion per year so you know if they're able to earn this for three and a half year in some sense they can earn back these asset losses uh they have suffered so a different way to say the same thing I would argue that deposits went from being highly unprofitable to highly profitable and Alexa and I reposted sort of a present value estimate of this now it depends really on what beta you put in there um but if you use something like the historical Pages it's a Chester could even be a full offset now one way to evaluate whether this is actually working with a deposit friendship is a good hedge is to look at the net interest margin so we already talked about the net interest margin earlier in this context it's useful in the following sense if you get your hedge right basically your assets reprice you pick the right duration of your assets the assets repriced at the same speed as the deposits which means that your net interest margin doesn't change as interest rate change now I would argue that is the business model of banks well at least has been for the last few decades so this is from my GF paper of like Sunita ma if you back in time yes net interest margin moves around a bit for regulatory reasons for technological reasons you know potentially because of the decline in interest rates but what's important if you look at the red line it doesn't move in response to changes in interest rates even if they went very high during the Walker period you know that just as much of banks barely changed as they came down it didn't change either so that suggests that banks are actually very good at doing this hedging of the asset side with the deposit franches and you can also zoom in if you zoom in this is from the FDIC they have a quality report um this is sort of like more recently what happened to the net interest margin you actually see that it was declining during covet that's coming from the fact that they had all to hold all this reserves because of QE is Ural had discussed but if anything net interest margins have actually improved and that's the reason that when we started raising you know you would see a lot of newspaper articles saying well this is going to be good for banks because you know finally you know after a long time at this your lower bound they're actually gonna earn some money on their deposits now this is sort of a Rosy picture but obviously we ended up with like giant banking terminal so the question is what went wrong so what I'd argue there's sort of two separate points so first of all it's clear that some banks didn't really follow this model I would argue the banking sector of all based on these statistics did but that doesn't mean every single Bank did and you know some banks simply went too long on the interest rate risk relative to deposit French as they had now we can talk all day about the SVP but one thing which I think is very telling which came out of the FED report which was released is that they actually increased interest proof in really 2022 and so as a result they ended up way too long an interest rate risk and I think you know I was something similar for First Republic but what I think is actually in some sense a little bit more interesting is even if you're completely hedged to interest rate risk that doesn't mean you had to run risk so diamond divock is sort of coming back well if banks suffer run well then this hedge not going to work the Hedge is going to disappear at you know all the aces to Value the assets and so what I think is interesting and actually Alexa is also here I've written a paper on this now uh what happens is if the interest rate goes up just as I showed the deposited franchise becomes a larger share of Bank value but arguably the deposit franchise is the runnable asset we could say it's a liquid it's an intangible so that means you know if there's a run it's going to be destroyed and so what can happen is that you have a diamond difficult even if all the loans and all the Securities are perfectly liquid so one takeaway from this is that it really was causing us trouble seeing I think something we have to sort of think more about going forward is the ownership deposit franchise the one coming from the low beta on initial deposits the ones where you charge your spread so checking accounts savings accounts of this Friday deposits is a source of risk in our paper we discuss various ways how Banks and maybe Regulators may want to deal with that now in terms of outfalls what we have seen over the last few months maybe just make two observations so first of all clear the body outflows from Regional Banks a lot of it went to the large Banks him just plotting deposit growth on Regional and smaller banks that was very much concentrated around svb you know roughly 240 billion we estimate went out of the regional Banks a lot of it to the large Banks now it looks like this outflows stopped but unextotally we know that some of the regional Banks seem to be much higher deposit rates either to the existing deposits order to replace other deposits borrowing from the federal home loan Banks or maybe from the broker deposit market so I think it will be interesting to see us the results for the second quarter gonna come out we may discover that some Regional banks are actually in bigger trouble than what we think right now and all you need to do is to look at the net interest margin it's going to tell you basically where the deposits repriced faster than the assets for some of these Banks so that's probably sort of confined to the regional Banks but that's something we're still going to learn over the next weeks or months but another observation I want to make is we always had outposts from the banking system overall and some deposits clearly left because of the svb failure but separately from that conceptually separately from that many deposits was left because what I would call the deposit channel of monetary policy spills on my paper with item analyx in the qg the logic is US deposits rates stay low as I showed you some deposit this independent of Runza SVP you know a previous hiking Cycles we have seen that they moved to higher paying Alternatives like money market funds so would we estimate in the qg paper is to deposits core deposits the ones where charges spread shrink by roughly three percent for each 100 basis points fed funds rate increase but importantly that's the intended effect of monetary policy I would argue that's what the FED is trying to do when it tightens and wants to affect financial conditions and if you look at tall deposits so I would argue that this deposit channel is very much at work so here I'm plotting total deposits I'm focus on core deposits it's the main form of deposits so I'm indexing that to 100 um at the beginning of the hiking cycle and what you see is even before SVP five percent of core deposits left the banking sector because yes banks at this low deposit betas and some deposits left now during SVP you know maybe another three percent based on this uh left the banking sector what's very interesting is you might say well we had svb everybody would read about this in the newspaper you know even not worry about the health of my bank now I really learn that I'm paying a lot for my deposits maybe I want to leave so I don't think it was obvious what do we expect but if anything you know the lease and data suggests that this is sort of flattened out again so I would argue if you were at the beginning of 2022 and you have to predict what deposit Outpost is going to be and you just sort of Applied the framework of a deposit Channel you would have ended up very much at the same place so one way to interpret that is the svb run in some sense brought some outflows forward which might have happened anyway um but just to put in perspective basically these outfalls of about eight percent of core deposits you know relative to an increase in the FED funds of five percent such as deposit outflows so far and I'm sure there's more to comma around Point 1.6 percent so that's actually a little less than what we have seen historically based on the deposit channel so let me just leave you with two takeaways so first of all Bank hedge the interest rate risk with the deposit franchise would argue but I think going forward we have to think hard about the low beta uninsured deposits and second yes Banks experience you know banking sector all large deposit outflows some of it because of svb but also deposit channel of monetary policies back at work and I think it's important to conceptually distinguish between these two reasons for outflows thank you
