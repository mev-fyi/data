the uh all right well thank you scott and thank you all for coming uh i you know i want to say two things by way of of background one is that when we we realized that we were approaching the 20 000 working paper mark on the 20 000th working paper was distributed in march uh the the question was how to mark this occasion and what we should do uh we had a little party and celebration and a cake at 1050 mass ave uh in the week when the that working paper was distributed uh but we thought that it would be appropriate to to be more reflective and to use this as an opportunity to think about the the issues around the science of innovation and dissemination of research and how the nber working papers fit into that so uh with the innovation group and the digitization group uh gathered here today this seemed like the perfect moment to try to reflect on that and i before i make some some remarks and my task this afternoon will actually be to tell the creation story of the the nbr working paper series but i do want to thank and acknowledge the the folks who currently make the working paper series possible uh tim page and uh and laura bathard at the at the nber uh and the folks who helped very much in pulling together some of the analytical data uh alex amanov and dan feinberg who've been working with me uh on this and uh marty feldstein unfortunately couldn't be with us here this afternoon he would have loved to be part of this panel uh and to talk about the growth and evolution of the nbr working paper series in which he played a a critical role so so that in some sense is where i want to jump off because the question is who invented the nber working paper series uh many would say that it might be marty feldstein uh or wesley claire mitchell or arthur burns or someone else in the in the nbr pantheon it turns out that in fact uh the the the correct answer to that question is bob michael uh bob michael was a relatively new phd in 1972 uh directing uh co-directing part of something called the center for the economic analysis of human behavior and social institutions this was a a research program which was organized into a number of subparts focused loosely on many things gary becker had been interested in uh when gary and gary's days at the nber and uh bob was seeking a way to call attention to the work that was being done by that research program and uh essentially he proposed to then nber president john meyer and a number of the other nber vice presidents to create a and i've quoted here because it's so it's so so descriptive of what they were after a simple new heavy paper cover for manuscripts like that used by departments of economics and that was really what they were going to do and then pull these things together in a way that enabled them to be distributed the key one of the key design features that was very important was that these working papers would not have to undergo the full review that was associated with nbr publications now most of you don't know the full review but it is it is long and slow and was designed to handle manuscripts that were book length which could be reviewed by the 51 person nber board of directors any one of whom could choose to object and slow the process down it was kind of like passing legislation in the senate uh so it was not designed for speedy dissemination of the latest economic research findings and critically in the in the bob michael plan uh working papers were not going to undergo this critical review the idea was to have these able to be disseminated within uh within a few weeks of the creation of the research and in fact bob michael has remarkable records which is how we were able to get things like this quotation he even has the prototype design for the cover of the nver working paper series now i have to stop here and with a brief footnote because h irving foreman is the person who designed this page does anyone in the audience know who irving foreman was irving foreman was the irving foreman began his career working for simon kuznets as a research assistant but was so good at doing graphs and charts that he was quickly turned into the nver chart maker he is the person who figured out how to put six different pieces of information onto one chart in the days before you had very fancy graphics he is also the person who did design the shading of the chronology for nber business cycles and i did not know that until a conversation with vic fuchs last night who in his early 90s is a key part of our institutional memory on some of these things so irving foreman was asked in 1972 to create a prototype for what a working paper series would look like and that's what he came up with including the cut out on the front on the front cover working paper series working paper number one was issued by finest welch in june of 1973 it's called education information and efficiency uh and it launched the series uh to give you some sense of what these look like uh in the first month there were three working papers uh finances paper on education barry chiswick on medical care and hospital utilization uh and sworn auroras on on an econometrics topic two of these three papers interestingly were published ultimately in nber in-house journals uh explorations in economic research and annals uh which were both published by the nbr so this was at a time when the nber had a much smaller coterie of researchers and the research was being disseminated but was often then ultimately uh being reviewed and published through the nber itself three working papers in the first month it took 26 months to reach working paper number 100 there'd been about 175 papers papers distributed before marty feldstein became the nber president in uh in april of 1977. and that's in some sense an important watershed moment because it launches the expansion of the nber and also the expansion of the working paper series in a way which enables uh the the dissemination of broader parts of economic research to start happening so uh in 1978 the first year under marty's tenure there were 55 papers distributed by 1981 the nber family had grown uh there were 221 papers distributed and then i've just marked off a few of the milestones uh beyond that so you can do your own calculations of about how quickly things were growing and it was still a couple of hundred papers a year in the early 1980s uh you can see that we reached milestone working paper 5000 which happened to be one of marty's papers uh in january of 1995. it took 22 years to get there it took only another eight years to do the next five thousand working papers and then another nine another uh another ten or so years after that to do the next ten thousand working papers so the you know we're on a rapidly growing trajectory in terms of the amount of of research disseminated through the working paper series uh to give you some sense of what the picture looks like today we distributed a little bit over 1100 working papers in calendar 2013. these are descripted by subscription to academic and non-academic institutions we have a little over a thousand total subscribers at the moment 25 000 people received that new this week email that those of you with sharp eyes will have noticed last week just to test you all uh we had two errors in the working paper new this week first it didn't come on monday it came on friday and then when this week's friday this week's came and had a date which was july 7th and not the 14th just to add a little confusion things but about 25 000 people do get this email and a surprising fraction of them notice things like what i just described in email and email me when they see them uh the um there's a feature on the working papers page uh that if you download a working paper uh like the the amazon type feature uh we also tell you users who downloaded this paper also downloaded it actually turned out and i suspect here we had to do some reinventing things which which data scientists uh in the in the e-commerce world know well when we first started programming the people who downloaded this also downloaded what we kept getting back were all of the adjacent working paper numbers because many people just basically seem to or many robots just download all of the things in sequence so it took a fair amount of thought to decide what kind of a filter we needed to use so that we got away from the things that weren't downloaded in the first couple of weeks and got to something which is more informative by the way one of the reasons that i see people like susan in the audience nodding her head one of the reasons i wanted to raise this set of issues with this audience was because i know that there's a great deal of wisdom that we can be we can learn and i hope people will will talk to us afterwards about some of those issues there are roughly five and a half million downloads of nber working papers per year at this point and interestingly about 1.8 million of those are from outside the oecd we can tell from google analytics where where these folks are coming from uh and about 40 for papers that are more than three years old so there's a long tale of continued interest in these papers uh that that we find you know intriguing as we as we look at this but 75 percent of the visitors come to our page from google as opposed to coming to the nber and then coming to a paper so it's telling you how to some degree the the way the the information is being accessed uh out there this is just a chart that shows you the the if you look at downloads within the first year after a working paper has been released this is just the the the distribution of the fraction of those downloads that take place by day after the release of the paper so what you see is that the day zero uh actually about six percent of the of the year's downloads will take place that's not the highest likelihood of download though it's actually two days later so it's the wednesday uh when we get to about 10 of the downloads during the first year and then it tails off quickly but the but the tail continues along and uh and there are downloads you know well well after that period uh the distribution function shows you that by the time you're basically two weeks after the new this week you're to the point where close to half of the year's downloads uh will have have taken place uh i i want to give you a little bit more in the way of background here and looking back historically if you're interested in the which programs represent the bulk of the nber working papers uh this is the bottom lines are a little bit hard to read but the economic fluctuations and growth program is the leader in this group with a little bit less than four thousand working papers public economics and labor studies are two and three and they actually are within about 25 papers of each other uh after uh after 32 years of working paper production so this is a race that's too close to call if we were going for number 25 000 uh at this stage and the international finance and macro trade and uh then the the finance programs productivity health economics and monetary economics and of course this is you know this is in part related to the age of the programs the size of the programs but it's just designed to give you a glimpse of what the content of the working paper series uh contains uh i couldn't resist showing the top working paper authors of the of the the full uh series the 1973 on series marty feldstein holds the top spot with 161 working papers uh joshua azam and closing in closely with 157 and you can see the remainder of the of the group if you if you cut to look at the most recent 10 years the ranking not surprisingly is somewhat different dironasimoglu takes the top spot uh aizenman continues to hang in in second uh with heckman lift and glazer bringing up the next three in the in the list and of course this does shift across different time periods uh the most downloaded working papers now we don't show you the numbers of downloads because frankly we're not a hundred percent sure that we have a great way of sorting out the robots and the whatevers that might be downloading but we can show you the papers that be since say 2005 have been downloaded most frequently uh the the top download is by john taylor on the financial crisis and policy response there is a certain theme to these most downloaded papers uh and as you can see uh a lot of uh there's a there's a certain repeat player uh character to this as well which is the work by uh by carmen reinhart and ken rogoff with four different papers all in the top ten uh is uh is clearly i think a testimony to the interest in questions around debt crises and related aspects of sovereign debt during the last few years so that gives you some idea of you know roughly the composition of what's been happening in the working paper series and what it looks like today i think i'm going to stop at that juncture and turn over to claudia who will say a little bit about the the analytics that one can bring to bear on the history of of these papers
