let me uh just introduce this panel we what we wanted to do is have a panel and we've done this in the past on on an important uh and ongoing events and and topics uh that are very much in the news and applied and and uh dig deeper and talk about the research agenda what we know about uh the relationship between inflation and household finance and and what we still need to know and so we've asked four people to join us uh Jonathan Parker is here uh Corolla binder is on Zoom Jim peterba is here and Martin Schneider is on is on Zoom what I want to do with my 45 minutes um let me let me start with a quick analogy though before we really get to the topic which is sort of when I want to say when think about the stock market when the price of Tesla goes down the stock market might go down a little bit overall because Tesla's big but really um when the stock market moves it's because something big happens all over in the stock market and the media will talk about oh Tesla or Tech and it's driven by a bunch of selling but in fact the volume is sort of irrelevant for every sale there's a purchase what actually happened was the value of the claims that the stock market represents went down relative to something else and so for our discussion for inflation I'm hoping to push us all to think about the broad level of the price index and not think about the movement in relative or individual prices which is not really what inflation is about and that's not what drives inflation that's not what inflation is inflation is the decline in the value of the dollar today relative to Dollars uh in the refination rate is relative to dollars in the future of course the backward looking one is relative to dollars in the past um and then I also think we probably don't need to get into the reasons why inflation's high but I think it's pretty obvious that we've had a some Traction in macro Supply a massive increase in macro demand significantly fiscally driven in conjunction with the fact that the FED is running a real interest rate that's almost historically unprecedented so negative four or five percent so what I'm going to do very quickly in actually talking about what I was assigned to talk about consumption I'm going to talk about consumption in three different dimensions I'm going to try and make a few comments about what I think I take from the literature and what we might think about of the effects of inflation through each of these channels and then end with some questions because it's supposed to be a discussion and I'm not sure how much we know about a lot of these different things given that a lot of the era of big data and the household Finance world that we've worked in and this this group for example probably has not been through a higher inflation period at least in the United States and much of the developed world where we have our best Big Data so let me first use decompose consumption um so doing a sort of a life cycle logic as you could think about the average where it has to be able to consume out of total household worth which will be the current value of the net wealth that you have and the expected present discounted value of Labor income um and what we've seen lately there are lots of pressures on different dimensions of this um oops that's going to mess it up for the sorry um we've got the zoom people here too um so real assets they've come down quite a bit there's no Direct effects of inflation for example on stocks they are claims to real dividends in the future or real profits in the future but there does seem to be some correlation with the fact that other things have caused stock markets and the like to come down housing prices are still quite a bit uh high and indeed that's part of the inflation measurement that we have today is the cost of living of the cost of housing nominal assets on the other hand have absolutely lost a lot of value so people who are invested in long-term bonds that were not inflation-adjusted as the massive most or not have lost a lot of value nominal debt is also down 72 percent of mortgages are still fixed rate mortgages and so that's a very nice thing to have some of the real value of your mortgage inflated away government debt is now down so debt to GDP has actually been lowered in the past year despite large deficits which is a very nice the real value of government debt is down that's good for households very indirectly um and then labor income has not kept place with inflation on average and there's some different distributional things that we might talk about on that but what this overall makes me think is for the very high net worth households there's been a significant decline at least in paper wealth um very high net worth households or the top 10 percent say of the consumption distribution have little response to consumption fluctuations particularly when related to discount rates and so I don't expect much change in consumption there in the next segment of sort of upper middle class there might be substantial changes here because they're looking at retirement account values which have come down they're holding nominal bonds they're not heavily mortgaged and um and they they see the net worth changes coming down so um and for for households below that I think we'll talk about other factors so you might think about consumption demand as affected mainly by the upper middle class here and it's being slightly lowered by inflation in our temporal substitution is the second big Channel um I've just clipped a chart here from the Ft that gives the the federal funds rate in actuality and what it would be predicted by a simple Taylor rule that was related to inflation we have inflation over the last 12 months of somewhere between six and nine percent depending on which metric you look at and a nominal interest rate which been raised all the way to one percent so that we have a negative five percent real rate which is really uh the FED sticking it to inflation um and so you have really significant erosion in the ass in the purchasing power of short-term liquid assets which for the bottom half of the the income and wealth distribution is most of their assets so if your savings not in financial markets but in in checking and savings accounts um you're losing a lot of money every year and that is going to actually stimulate demand from these households right so that's the negative that's a that's a story way of saying there's a very high there's an inter-temporal substitution strategy here which is to buy today consumption today looks really cheap relative to the Future um and so that should should increase the demand for consumption again from probably all but really the most wealthy households um and then the final piece of the consumption puzzle as our consumption broad decomposition would be liquidity which um I guess Steve and I started with as young people um focused very heavily on um and there's a lot of different directions on liquidity but again I think most of them are going to um start I mean the liquidity constraints are going to start binding from our households and and be a little tighter for those households largely because of the way we structure debt contracts because they're based on an interest payment that's that's our payments that are pretty much constant through time so when the nominal interest rates rise the flow payments rise initially the real values decline more quickly but it becomes a little more difficult to handle that debt burden at the beginning due to debt to payment income requirements and so um so on the one hand fixed interest payments are being lowered in real terms by inflation so that's good if you have a mortgage on the other hand all the new interest rates and new purchases going forward as interest rates rise in response to the high inflation rate are going to be require higher flow payments and that's going to read and if especially if income doesn't keep track with inflation that's going to really squeeze the flow payment ability of households to make payments and buy new goods and fund consumption particularly so I would say that liquidity constraints are going to be lowering consumption and construction will start binding for more households primarily at the bottom end of the distribution so given those factors there's a bunch of interesting research questions one is what I've kind of just sketched through is some hypotheses about how the rise in inflation might differentially affect consumption demand of households at different levels of the consumption distribution we have now a bunch of variation a bunch of different X anti-asset Holdings in a environment that households were pretty close to ignoring inflation in and might have taken rather different positions for rather idiosyncratic or not very important reasons and therefore have rather different ex-post outcomes financially and maybe some of that variation will be quite interesting or informative the way for example our pet Gupta looked at you know what your mortgage rates did in the financial crisis depending on whether your floating rate was indexed to the treasury rate or to Libor which did which did different things um uh is the behavior that we're going to observe as inflation Rises related to nominal illusion and are the asset prices movement related to wealth illusion so the idea that the cash flow value of the wealth has not changed very much so the consumption it will actually support in the future hasn't changed very much but the way we price those cash flows have changed quite a bit and so that that's those two sources of Illusion may be very interesting to look at and then as the FED tightens we're going to have a whole different change in the funding structure of a lot of the institutions that lend and provide Financial Services to households in a way that we haven't seen recently and with incredibly low funding rates has come even I would say some silly crazy lots of fintech experimentation it will be very interesting to hear how that shakes out and how actually that experimentation may work to alleviate some of the new types of liquidity constraints that we will see again if we enter a more High inflation environment so part of what I've done is assuming we get a higher inflation environment it may be quite transitory so the last piece I'll talk at and then I'll turn it over to one of my co-panelists Corolla who will talk more about it is um what does this mean for household expectations so we know lots of interesting evidence lately that individual inflation expectations or experiences excuse me individual level experiences affect individual household expectations about future inflation the FED seems so far to have allowed inflation to run up against six to nine percent without driving changes in long-term inflation rates so the household sector households in general still seem to believe according to the Michigan consumer of surveys Michigan consumer confidence survey and other projections still seem to believe that longer term inflation is very well anchored and so that's a very interesting thing that's a very important part of household finances what how those expectations are determined and and whether and when the FED might actually lose track control of those so with that let me turn it over thanks for having me it's great to be on this panel um now as you probably noticed and as um Jonathan alluded to lately data releases from the Michigan survey of consumers and other surveys like the New York feds survey of consumer expectations have been considered highly newsworthy because of the assumption that they will affect fed policy decisions chairman Powell has indicated that Rising consumer inflation expectations were one of the major factors behind the fed's 75 basis point rate hike in June he said quote we're absolutely determined to keep the mankirt at two percent now of course the FED um does not have a mandate to keep consumer inflation expectations anchored its mandate is to promote stable prices and maximum employment so when fed officials talk about the importance of credibility and anchoring inflation expectations that is because they believe that in good expectations can help them fulfill their mandate the part that's a little less talked about is that this has to work through some household Finance channels household inflation expectations matter for Price stability and employment only to the extent that they change households Behavior inflation itself affects household finances in a variety of ways as Jonathan discussed but separate from realized inflation expected inflation may also be relevant if it affects consumer spending investment and wage negotiations so for example in theory consumption depend decisions depend on consumers subjective ex-anti real interest rates but then that's approximately the difference between the nominal interest rate and expected inflation a big challenge for studying household Finance is that we don't actually observe these subjective hex anti-real interest rates but we have a growing supply of surveys of consumer inflation expectations which provide a proxy for this inflation expectations term now to the extent that the FED takes these survey measures seriously which they've clearly indicated that they do we also need to take seriously what has been established in the literature about these measures um so here's just a list of what I think we can take away from the literature about reported inflation expectations on consumer surveys a big point is that the variation in the cross-section in reported inflation expectations is much greater than variation over time so Jonathan showed you a graph that showed this like small upward movement in consumers inflation expectations since 2020 that's totally dwarfed by any movement that you see if you just look at the distribution at one point in time across households um he also alluded to you know relative inflation being about the change in the level of price is not about any movement in relative prices but relative prices matter a lot for what consumers report on this survey and in particular consumers reported inflation expectations are strongly correlated with the level of gas prices and that's either nominal or real gas prices also the expected price changes of components of the pce don't add up to expected aggregate inflation and some people reported that those findings at the monetary economics summer Institute last week um some surveys ask for Point forecasts or density forecasts or both and there's a major discrepancy between what consumers report as their point forecasts and then any measure of the central tendency of their density forecasts the way you ask the question matters so if you ask about inflation or about price changes that that matters um kind of more than you might want it to reported inflation expectations uh respond to information treatments with publicly available information so telling people about the fed's inflation Target leads them to revise their reported expectations or telling them about past inflation or any number of other things leads them to revise the reported expectations um I have a paper showing that there's really large uh panel conditioning effects so for the New York fed survey people take it 12 times and after the first couple of times that they take the survey there's large and significant changes in the inflation expectations they report their expectations go down by several percentage points and become much more accurate so they seem to be um you know because they're prompted by the survey to go out and acquire more information about inflation there's also a large and growing partisan divide in inflation expectations reported on surveys so basically when you don't like the party in power you report higher inflation expectations that again it that's a variation in the cross section that totally dwarfs any kind of time variation that you see and a lot of consumers seem to use a good news bad news heuristic when they're reporting their inflation expectations so um I have a paper with Jeff Campbell and Jane Weingart and we use high frequency data to study the drivers of consumers reported inflation expectations and it's mainly political news and coven news that change people's inflation expectations and essentially if they think the news is bad their inflation expectations um get higher okay so in light of all of that evidence I want to turn to a question that was asked a lot during the period beginning in the Great Recession when interest rates were at the zero lower bound and the question was can a central bank use inflation expectations as a policy tool the idea was with short-term nominal interest rates at zero you increase expected inflation to reduce real interest rates and shift consumption forward in time so there's really two lines of research that came out of this question the first is can central banks fine-tuned consumer inflation expectations through communication and the second is you know if they can does it have the intended effect on consumption into the first question um my opinion is not very well if at all and that's again based on everything I told you on the last slide and to the second there's very um mixed evidence it depends again a lot on what kind of data you use what kinds of inflation expectations measures what kinds of consumption measures I have a big table in a paper with Jillian brunette that summarizes all the all the research we could find on this um so if you're interested you can you can look there so my takeaway is that the only foolproof way for central banks to stabilize household inflation expectations is to stabilize inflation itself and ultimately I think this will also be the most helpful for household finances and then my last minute or two I'd say the most promising research avenues that I see in this general area are like how can we solicit consumers true expectations of real interest rate real income and changes in real wealth because I think these surveys of consumer inflation expectations are at best a really noisy proxy of what what consumers are actually using for making their their decisions about their household finances um can we maybe find um behavior-based measures of inflation expectations uh like for example I recently saw a paper by Nagal and Yan where they're using retail tips flows to to say something about you know based on Behavior what people actually expect about inflation and I'm not sure if Martin is going next but I will hand over um to the next panelist thank you it's a pleasure to be invited to talk on this topic because the last time the United States experienced a sustained period of high inflation which was 25 years before John Campbell's Landmark AFA presidential address that was just called household Finance there wasn't really a field of household Finance within economics research but there was a field of Public Finance and Public Finance was very very interested in the interaction between the tax system inflation and a set of questions which are today in the core of household Finance in particular asset allocation asset location and the after-tax rate of return linking up with Jonathan's comments about the inter-temporal rate of substitution that households were facing as they thought about their their saving and investment decisions uh I mentioned before I start this discussion that in addition to my NBR and my MIT ties I'm also a trustee at Tia Cref anytime I'm going to talk about retirement saving and defer that the value of tax deferral I want to make sure that you know that I have that additional affiliation because of course that is connected to some of the things I will say all right so what I want to focus on in many ways pivots off what you've heard in the last two presentations it's just to say that instead of writing down the real rate of return the nominal interest rate minus inflation or expected inflation I'm going to focus on writing down one minus the tax rate times the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate right which for a tax taxable investor that's the relevant rate of return that they actually face and asking the question how is that rate of return going to change it's a borrowing rate it's a lending rate how's that going to change as we move the the inflation rate around or as we move expected inflation around and what are the implications of that for thinking about the returns that that Savers are getting on their Investments uh and the cost that borrowers are effectively facing and I'll connect this also uh with the question of tax deferral linking Buck back to some of the things in taha's presentation this morning to underscore that that incentive to be saving through the IRA 401K channel is actually also quite sensitive to the level of of nominal interest rates or nominal rates of return before I start if I asked you how does inflation affect the tax system in the U.S okay many of you would probably say I thought that we'd index the tax brackets for inflation you know the the that changes every year so we got that under control true we've indexed the tax brackets and the break points but we haven't indexed the definition of taxable income and in particular nominal interest income is still taxed and nominal capital gains are still taxed and therein lies the core of what I want to talk about so let me just start by thinking about taxable nominal bonds okay consider for example a tax-exempt investor I put MIT in the slide I should have said the Sloan foundation with Adam here uh but you know the real after the real return there's no taxes to think about so the real return is just I minus pi as we saw in for example Corolla slides a couple of minutes ago well now if we want to know what happens to the real return When inflation goes up the critical question is well you know if we can do the derivative and the the key question is now just what's happening to did Pi okay and if if it's one the old Irving Fisher relationship which says that nominal rates rise one for one with expected inflation uh then the real interest rate is not changing at all and we can cause cross-inflation off the the table is something that Adam needs to worry about as he thinks about this if you're a taxable household like like you or me uh what we now need to think about is putting the one minus tax term there in front of the nominal interest payments we receive and now uh even just carrying through the same analysis right The crucial question is that uh the real after tax rate of return is going to depend on one minus Tau times did Pi minus one okay if we're in an Irving Fisher world if the ID pi equal one this means that the real after tax interest rate is falling as the inflation rate Rises and the amount by which is falling is minus Tau okay so the taxable household is going to face a larger wedge between uh the pre-tax return and the after-tax return as inflation goes up all else equal it's going to drive down for a constant real rate of return it's going to drive down the after tax real return to the household that could discourage saving of course if you're on the other side of that transaction as Jonathan pointed out if you're a borrower and you're able to deduct your interest payments and back in the 1970s and 80s almost everybody could deduct their interest payments and today a much smaller fraction of the US households can deduct interest payments but if you can most people in this room probably can it makes it a better time to borrow because your after tax rate rate of of borrowing has now just gone down okay so that's that's kind of the debt case to think about what happens if we make this you know a little more I'm going to in a second make it a little bit more complicated but I do want to you know one of the research agenda issues here is that the didpi question right how much how do we what do we know about that and uh unfortunately this is actually a somewhat challenging question to to work on uh nit student Eric Gann and I have been been doing some of some some simple empirical work this summer and you know this is Complicated by the fact that the interest rate these are both series that are very close to to stochastic processes that look like random walks right so it looks like the interest rate series is kind of an integrated one process inflation not quite but it depends on the sample period so you know this is not easy to pin down uh in some post-war sample periods uh did Pi is is actually greater than one if you do simple regressions uh in others it's a little bit less than one this depends on whether you're using quarterly or or annual data monthly data it also depends on whether you use inflation expectation or actual inflation realized inflation to do it so I don't think we have a huge amount of confidence right now on where did Pi is but the didpi relationship is very important to understanding the incentives that are created as we push up nominal inflation and nominal expected inflation what about Tau you know we all face different tax rates potentially uh if you just want to get a sense of the aggregate for this uh you know the weighted average tax rate on interest income reported in the U.S household sector today so this is just take all the tax returns calculate the marginal tax returns of people add a little bit of interest income to everybody radial expand all the interest income that's out there the weighted average marginal tax rates around 28 okay so that's just giving you a sense of how to think about on average uh where this is for many of the high income households in this room you should be putting in a 0.4 as you think about that calculation uh what's that mean well you know if you went back and did this a year ago if we had a panel on inflation a year ago when the nominal one-year interest rate on Treasury bonds was 10 basis points right multiplying 10 basis points by 0.72 or 0.6 you didn't change things very much right today that the one-year treasury rates about three one okay well now if you're getting sixty percent of that instead of of a full value of that right you're giving up some something on the order right 0.4 times times three you're giving up 1.2 percentage points of return and that's where suddenly the Public Finance issues around these tax rates come back to become important right so the key message of my presentation is just we have to start thinking about taxes again because inflation is pushing these rates of return away from zero and then we have to ask what we're taxing all right without getting into the nuts and bolts of the of the taxation of capital gains The crucial point to make in a similar Spirit about the nominal tax base is that when when assets appreciate in part because of just inflation raising oil prices and you're asking what's the real after tax return that you earn by holding that asset a larger and larger part as inflation Rises of your return as measured by the tax code is coming from inflation right think about you know you were successful GameStop investor two years ago you made a hundred thousand dollars in your GameStop you know you play and you didn't sell it okay too bad for you but you just didn't sell it so uh you've got your hundred thousand dollars imagine it was just you know Frozen in time and you weren't going to sell that for 20 years okay when inflation is zero right what you get is a deferral of 20 years but the deferral is actually not worth all that much because the price level is not going up and the real return was really low okay however if the inflation rate is substantially higher the deferral of not having to pay the capital gains tax until the choose to sell is more valuable that pushes the effective rate down okay but now if the assets along the way are actually Rising because of inflation you're now going to be taxed at the end on those inflationary gains and those are not real returns to you right so the larger the inflation component relative the real return the higher the effective tax rate that you get because you have a basic nominal capital gain system in place okay what that basically means is that the value of deferral in this case uh is actually going to be sensitive to what the the tax rate will be and what I've done here are just a couple of examples to show you what is the I've effectively worked out the effect of accrual tax burden on your investment over a horizon of say uh you know 10 years at the bottom of this slide and just tried to answer the question well what is it that you're effectively paying so if you took an example with a real return of two percent an inflation rate of two percent a 10-year holding period okay what that essentially says is that your your rate of return I did this with a tax rate I think of of 28 percent as before okay if you did that your real return right remember the the true real return is two percent before tax if you had a capital gain uh that was just generating an asset that was generating capital gains no dividends no interest you pay tax at the end of the period it effectively have earned 1.3 percent net when the tax rate when the inflation rate was two percent you bumped the inflation rate up to four percent your net return goes down to 1.1 percent okay so that's just giving you a little bit of the Delta here on how as you as you play around with the the inflation rate the nominal capital gains tax system is going to matter why does why do I mention this because it now affects not just the rate of return it affects your asset your your asset allocation decision because capital gains producing assets like stocks or houses are going to be taxed in different ways than inflation of the nominal interest rate bearing assets like bonds so the the level of these things is going to change where the household might be all right last point the asset location decision inside the 401K inside the IRA versus taxable account okay when again when the inflation rate and real rates of return are very low the the benefits of being inside the 401K type structure are relatively small how do you think about what those benefits are I've just reminded you at the top of the slide of how do you write down what the value of a taxable account is you know this is of course taha's presentation from this morning you know you're you're paying tax on the money today putting it into a you're you're paying tax in a taxable account like you're putting in a bank account you're paying tax today and then you're being taxed all the way along in the future on the interest income you generate if you're using a traditional IRA or or 401K you don't pay tax today but your Tau two the tax rate when you're retired is going to tell you what you pay on the full accumulated value of those assets e to the i t if you're using a Roth IRA you're paying tax upfront instead of on the back end tax rate's the same today and then you're in same place as you would be okay what's the ratio of the IRA or taxes to the taxable account well it just depends on the tax rate the nominal rate of return I and the holding period okay etow I.T how's that depend on the inflation rate which pushes up I well this exponential is going to be larger when I is larger okay so uh you know nothing nothing mysterious going on it's just that the value of the inside buildup of the Assets in one of those tax deferred accounts is greater when the inflation rate gets higher because now there's more tax to be collected on the nominal interest along the way right so you know I've done this with various inflation rates and a horizon of 40 years with a very low real rate of return one percent uh and at a 40-year horizon when the inflation rate six percent the ratio is actually two for investors who have that long a run okay the ratio uh at an inflation rate of two percent is only is only 1.35 so the benefit you get from being in the in the tax deferred vehicle is now larger as you look out over that longer time period I've done the same thing at the bottom for something that may be you know more interesting to some part of this audience I basically picked the top marginal tax rate 40 and stuck that into the calculation and of course all of these things are more important there so to any of you who are not fully maximizing out your 401K right the you know in a high inflation environment the value of doing that's going to be higher and just to give you a sense of what's happened even over the last year uh you know if you think that inflation expectations now are in the range of four percent for the long term and last year they were closer to two and a half or three uh this ratio of what you get one versus the other has moved up from around 1.6 to around 2.2 just over what we've seen uh in the last the last 12 months so I think this raises a whole set of issues around the you know the elements here of asset location which are going to be more important going forward than they they have been in the last decade or so closing thought in terms of the research agenda you know we like to at least when I teach a lot of times I sort of focus on the nominal asset the nominal Bond the simple capital gains here but in fact the household balance sheet is much more complicated real estate is taxed in different ways than what I've just described uh different types of of equity assets are likely to be realizable in different ways and this is much more complicated in fact so all of some of the the complexity of tax planning issues now comes back in with a Vengeance as we start to face these higher nominal rates due to inflation and that's a place I think that's a lot of of interesting research at this Public Finance and household Finance margin so thank you very much uh hi everyone uh thanks for having me on this panel and sorry I can't be there in person um I'm going to talk about uh redistribution effects of inflation in particular I want to talk about the kind of an earlier literature that the did this and the role of measurement and modeling that the router and then make some suggestion for what I think is important for studying this new inflation episode that's that's quite exciting if you've worked on this during the times of low inflation um so uh the starting point is uh has already come up in modern economies uh we've arranged things so that money is the dominant unit of account which means that inflation changes the real value of all normal debt positions uh and that has wealth effects that are good for borrower is it bad for lenders and um I find it useful for for thinking about periods like no to distinguish two types of redistribution or revaluation shocks the first one is the most obvious which is if there is an unanticipated increase in the normal price level like Fisher talked about then you're gonna get the same percentage drops in the real value for all positions and that was a substantial one uh for last year or more than five percent um more subtle is that if you have unanticipated news broadly speaking about future price level increases then uh and so that means inflation expectations change and this means the normal yield curve is going to shift up uh bond prices and more generally the value of future number of promises going to fall and this means that long-term fixed rate positions are going to be devalued relatively more in percentage terms than short-term positions so as an example uh The Five-Year rate increased by two percentage points over the last year and this means that positions with a five-year duration dropped by about 10 percent but of course this had this effect did nothing to short positions so studies of Retribution effects of inflation have uh measured the revaluation shocks and how they play out at the sector level and at for groups of households using flow funds data and household survey data and so you have to integrate these two sources to see through the financial system and so on and it's been done for the US and Canada and the Eurozone um and I I for the fun of it I ran the code using 2019 so pre-coded positions where there is a server consumer finances and I did just a one-time 10 Fisher effects okay and uh there is action so if you think about the sexual retribution in percent of GDP you get a household sector net loss of six percent uh rest of the world loss of five percent and then the the beneficiaries are the government uh major borrower and also businesses and then of course now you have to reassign the business games uh to the household and rest of the world who owns these um which can also be done uh and the uh other major debt uh issuer here is is the household sector itself which has already been netted out but I want to point out that uh household growth positions are really big they're kind of five times larger than these net positions and so you see from this that there's also a lot of within household sector distribution um so uh the other thing that these studies did was to think about the welfare effects and the aggregate effects of these retribution shocks from inflation episodes in a General Degree model and I want to talk about how this is also an important part of the uh the message um so there's two points here one is uh it can be made just in a choice context and this is that just welfare depends on more than just tradable wealth okay so let's think about just a standard micro problem for an individual uh maximizes utility subject to a budget constraint and I want to take a broad interpretation of consumption as date and state dependent and think of PES State prices okay and this is very general because say there's incomplete markets then we can think of these P's as individual State prices and then add some constraints that describe in what sense the markets are incomplete um now uh in this setting the easily measured distribution effects are what's the effect of market prices um on the uh and how those revalue the tradable component of the endowment okay so these these uh points that they had on the previous slide fall into this category importantly here uh this P twiddle that I used to talk about market prices those are the state prices of the marginal investors that are possibly different from the individual's piece um now what's also relevant for consumption and Welfare generally is any differences between individual State prices and uh and modern investor prices um as well as changes in the value of the non-tradable endowment say human capital and government transfers um and then on top of that you have income and substitution effects of changes in prices uh holding fixed income or the value of the endowment um just as an example of this there's some confusion sometimes in a little bit about this this issue of you know the paper gains on housing so let's say uh you have uh higher rent growth that's expected by the marginal investor that increases house prices uh then you can have if there's a very strong income effect so people always want to live in the same house regardless of what whatever the prices then this can offset the wealth effect um but uh this is uh requires some assumptional preferences which is kind of embodied in this uh State prices here the individual's day prices um and so this is not something that calls for measuring wealth effects differently but rather it's for recognizing that there are both wealth and income effects okay and so the point is then that for all of these additional uh effects that matter for welfare we need model structure in order to clarify broadly speaking what the difference between p and p drill okay the second uh kind of more obvious point is that uh there are uh or for any resolution shock uh General equilibrium effects uh if you shift wealth between people with different NPCs and different tastes for risk and so on that has 10 effects on on prices um and uh also important this this was a big theme in the early literature is that there is endogenous government policy response because under any inflation episode um the government is a big winner and so then the actual distribution effects depend on uh what does the government do with money um okay so that's the uh thing we want to do measurement but in addition we want to model uh the responses and so now specifically for the for the episode that that we have uh now uh if I were to start a project now I I kind of do uh three things that were not featured prominently either one is that and this came up in in corolla's presentation uh we want to think harder about inflation expectations and uncertainty I mean we sort of did but we never really knew how to measure it um in the old days uh now uh heterogeneous forecasts as well as measures of subjective uncertainty are in many household surveys and I think central banks around the world have done a terrific properties so we can really ask uh how safe do people perceive uh nominal bonds to be and how does it differ in a cross-section and so on and this is for for these individual State prizes this is an important ingredient and so we want to think about that um on the modeling side I think it's important to study these inflation episodes in models with explicit portfolio choice and aggregate risk and this is because a fixed income generally which has grown a lot as asset positions say relative to GDP since the last inflation episode 15 years ago um it is something that that is held as a safe asset and not simply as a liquid asset and you see that because kind of the duration of normal positions is quite uh large it's like five years or so um and now we have these interest rate movements that are starting to reflect expected inflation again uh as we mentioned earlier so so then what what comes up is what if nowadays all these households sitting around and that they were doing this risk-free savings or relatively risk-free savings and these terms more risky and this is bound to have then also interesting effects on stocks and housing just from the risk properties in addition to the to the uh very interesting tax effects that Jim talked about um okay and now the final point is that I think to us to appreciate uh these retribution effects we want to think hard about unobserved heterogeneity what I mean here is that so we have large growth positions in the household sector which suggests that there is a lot of distribution if you uh if inflation changes real value of positions um at the same time any kind of regressions uh on portfolio rates on observables uh as as many crosstalk regrets do yield kind of low explanatory power okay and so if we go with a standard model in which variation in uh positions comes from kind of income and demographics uh we're going to get patterns and then that's going to lead to retribution Effects by group of say Rich versus poor I mean in the old literally we have this kind of uh there is reistribution from the rich old people who hold bonds to the middle class of mortgages and so on and so that's that's certainly there but it's not going to get uh the right amount of heterogeneity that's in the data because on top of all these demographics uh people differ in all sorts of ways uh that I mean as a soak up we can think of it as taste for that and taste for risk and all of these things have real distribution effects that change inequality and something that that is good to take into account to really assess how much retribution takes place good that's what I have thank you great thank you
