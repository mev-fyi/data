thanks a lot so i'm very much looking forward to this uh to this hour it's a little bit challenging when people ask you something that you've done quite a bit of research on you've been teaching for a while as well but usually when you teach this you teach this over five weeks and you spend two hours every week and now you have to compress it in one hour so let's see let's see how i will do time management wise i have 20 slides of 10 backup slides let's see how far i get in one hour so let me start motivating what i'm going to do here by first saying that the advances we've made in social insurance literature in the past 20 years are just spectacular i would say and i think there are two important drivers uh uh that are underlying like this tired integration between theory and empirics that i think we've incorporated so so successfully in social insurance research so first one is like people have not come up with new theory but people have been revisiting all theories that existed for a long time that have made them empirically implementable okay and the second thing is that we've been implementing these theories now that they're implementable leveraging just fantastic new uh data sources and in particular data sources okay so i think those two takes together have made that we understand so much more about social insurance than i think we did 20 or 25 years ago at the same time though there is like this growing body of research that shows that there are important behavior frictions also in the domain of social insurance okay and what is particularly challenging is that the existence of these behavioral frictions makes the implementations of these theories which we've liked so much a bit more problematic because they realize so much the implementations of the fact that ages are optimized so we're constantly using envelope conditions we're constantly reusing reveal preference and that's exactly things that we cannot really do or we have to revisit when they're behavioral agents the second thing is that these fantastic new data sources the admin data they're beautifully revealing individuals choices that they make across many many dimensions but they don't necessarily tell us much about the presence of behavioral frictions underlying these choices okay so what i'm going to try to do in the next hour well i'll try to provide the simplest possible conceptual framework that i could think of to think about social insurance that both allows us to think about moral hazard issues and think about adverse election issues which are usually the two main sources of inefficiency that we try to deal with when thinking about the design of social insurance and then i'll use this framework to identify some strengths and weaknesses of it once we start incorporating behavioral agents i built a lot on i think uh if you wanted like more of an introduction on this to the extent that you hadn't had it before there is this had a group chapter by chatting on filters time and i think it's an amazing resource i'll build a little bit of my own research both in the context of moral hazard and adverse election and then i'll advertise this uh annual review piece that i've done together with nate and hendren and camille on there that we're building on here as well then along the way i'll uh give some illustrations uh or some empirical evidence of behavioral frictions that have been relevant in social insurance domains and i'll focus uh specifically on unemployment insurance and health insurance and also along the way i'll try to identify like issues where i feel like this is where we need more work try to think about where to go or to go next okay so simple framework so i was happily surprised yesterday when i arrived in the afternoon to see that our notation uh like with dimitri and uh this is just so just so similar so everything you've learned yesterday will be repeated today but rather than thinking about changing t we're going to change b which is the coverage that the insurance program provides and b is the price that people pay if they want to have access to that coverage okay so the social value of providing insurance to an individual of type theta is going to be uh described by this w here it has two components the first component is the value to the agent of having the coverage b for which he pays a price fee we're putting a welfare weight in front and then we're accounting for the fiscal cost of providing this program as well the fiscal cost of providing this program is very easy it's the coverage you're providing multiplied by the risk that the social insurance is offered okay so pi in the context of unemployment will be the probability of being unemployed five in the context of health insurance is the probability of an health shock that triggers health expenses that trigger the coverage that you receive okay so the expected coverage that you're getting is b multiplied by the probability that the risk will realize okay so i'm going to write everything using this indirect utility function you won't see any expected utility here and it allows me to keep notation uh quite quite simple and and i think we don't gain much by by uh micro finding where the direct utility is coming from for the insights that i try to review but this indirect utility and that's important to realize of course um asks a lot of behavioral decisions that individuals have to make so individuals make decisions across various dimensions and the assumption for now is that they do so to maximize their utility so they choose the access given the policy that is in place to maximize the utility okay for instance in the context of unemployment insurance individuals decide how hard to work and avoid losing their job once they lose their job they decide how hard to search how to set their facial wages they make all these kind of decisions on top of that once when they're still employed they think about how much savings to set aside for the potential uh situation that they become unemployed once they're unemployed they think about how much how rapidly they deplete their assets they think about other sources of self insurance shoot their partner start working more if they lose their job and sometimes they may make explicit insurance plan choices as well if they have the option uh to do so yes i think i'm just being slow but it might be helpful to repeat those fathers too so will it be is also expected yes so you're integrating over everything the stuff in the bracket we're subtracting because that's what the government pays except for the program exactly okay got it okay so i i i wanted to make this explicit so i won't make things more complicated than this so it's super easy to work it's super important that we're all on the same page on on this expression right here in fact i'm going to simplify that just a little bit further and assume quasi-linear preferences and assume that the welfare weights are equal to one for all of the titus and so the welfare we get from insurance is really this value that it generates to the agent minus the cost that entails for the government to provide okay good so then and you've seen these kind of examples using tax variation now we're going to use variation in the coverage that we're going to provide and we're going to think about the welfare effect for instance increasing the generosity of an unemployment insurance scheme okay so the impact of increasing the benefits on welfare bag has can be decomposed in four different effects okay so there is a direct welfare effect how much the individual gains from having more coverage there is a behavioral welfare effect the agent may change all these behaviors that i just mentioned earlier on and then what is the effect of that under utility there is a direct physical effect or the mechanical effect if you want that is if i increase the generosity of the social insurance then i increase my costs depending on how likely the risk is that i'm trying to insure here and then there's a behavioral physical effect which is individuals may change their behavior as a consequence of the policy and that will have an impact on the expected expenditures in the government history yes you seem to be implicitly assuming complete failure of the private insurance markets since we don't have private insurance in here so so it could be in the background like there could be private insurance in the background so it will be the v function it may make you less responsive to changes in the public coverage here they may make you less coverage here it may also also affect like how much risk you're taking because you're already covered by private insurance so it can be ever looked like so so it's in the access the private insurance okay so before we take down the envelope theorem let's praise it for a second here like it's just so incredibly useful okay because trying to estimate this effect trying to see how much unemployed individuals are changing their service efforts are setting their reservation wage different or changing their savings and so on in response to changes in the unemployment benefits is just dramatically difficult okay the envelope condition tells us we don't need to worry okay because it's only second order effects the only thing we need to worry about is how these behavioral effects are going to affect the fiscal expenditures of the government which the agent is not internalized okay again super useful because it means that we don't need to know the separate responses of all of these things we just need to know if we change the policy what are the fiscal consequences like it's a reduced form estimate that is super easy for us to get it okay so these envelope conditions like are extremely powerful to know what we need to focus on and here i'm showing this in a very stylized model but we can make our model dynamic because for instance unemployment benefits are inherently dynamic we have to determine how much we pay to short-term to long-term employed if we think about pension policies that's inherently dynamic using envelope conditions to figure out what is first order and what is second order is just extremely useful okay but we're going to introduce behavioral agents in a second before i'm doing that let me use the framework to really focus on moral hazards and the way we think of moral hazard is the fact that if we provide more insurance if we protect individuals more against the consequences of an adverse event happening that individuals have lower incentives to try to avoid that of adversities okay insurance reduces incentives to avoid risk so at this clunky term here where i said like oh if people change their x's this may affect the expanded expenditures for the government if we focus on moral hazard and not the fact that people may change the coverage they get if they have the option to choose between different plans then we can simplify this as just thinking about how does their behavior change the risk or the probability of the risk that we're that we're trying to cover okay so this behavioral physical effect we can then write as an elasticity which we like in public finance so the only thing we need to know from the fiscal side is how this risk that we're insuring is increasing if we make the unemployment uh if we make sorry if we make the social insurance more chance okay so this is the elasticity of the risk with respect to a change in the social insurance coverage okay so once we have that we can plug it in our for in the expression that i just had just before we apply the envelope condition and then we see that for an increase in the benefit to have zero impact on welfare which is a necessary condition for uh the benefit level that you have in place to be optimal what we need is that the insurance value the value of giving an extra dollar of coverage is equal to the moral hazard cost okay and the insurance value the value of giving an extra hour of coverage just depends on how much does the agent like the extra dollar of coverage relative to how much it costs in mechanical terms which is just determined by the probability of uh facing the risk okay so for instance if this elasticity is 0.5 that is our say in the context of unemployment employment rate increases by uh by 0.5 if we increase the employment benefits by one percent it means that for each door we transfer to the unemployed we have to pay an extra 50 cent just from the fact that more people become okay so for unemployment insurance the the generosity we start from to be optimal that it needs to be that the insurance value is also equal to 0.5 meaning that to get a door transferred when being unemployed i am willing to pay a premium of 50 cents okay so that's what we need okay so these things we can in principle estimate so on the right hand side thinking about how labor supply changes in response to social insurance there has been done a lot a lot of work okay so we have a good sense for different social insurance programs how big these elasticities are of course they're very different depending on the context we're looking at and depending on the program in place but that is relatively easy this thing of course is a little bit more tricky to estimate although conceptually it's not different from just thinking about a risk premium in an insurance context okay so how we've resolved like how we're mostly trying to get estimates of this is using this consumption-based approach and then we're starting to use expected utility for instance in the context of unemployment the value of unemployment insurance depends on how high your marginal utilities were employed versus how high your marginal utility is of consumption when unemployed the difference between marginal utilities depends on the difference in underlying consumption levels so we need to know how big is the difference in your consumption when employed versus unemployed and we scale everything up with some curvature of your preferences we scale everything up with your with some risk factors okay so that's how we tend to get a sense of how big the insurance are and going back to those questions if there is a lot of private insurance available then that allows you to reduce that watch in consumption between when you're employed and unemployed and that's going to be captured by this thing if we implement it okay so that's the social insurance moral hazard framework let me now introduce the information so when you implement it mean insurance is not responding so the private insurance may respond or you may respond in how much private insurance you're going to get but the impact of your welfare of that is going to be a second order that's again another dimension that's there okay that's fine good so now we introduce behavior frictions an individual maximizes some behavioral utility that differs from the welfare relevant utility so i'm writing the behavior utility with some v-hut and it's different from the v that we think we should potentially care about and then different behavioral frictions may drive a wedge between this v and this v hat i often think about people's buyers beliefs about the risk that they're facing it may also be simply misinformation and then we have a wedge between what is the perceived expected utility and what i would call the true expected utility but you can have different biases you can have different notions of oh we have the decision utility versus the experience utility or we have preferences or choices made on a frictionless environment and choices made on our environment with frictions and and there is a different decisions that you would make under the two regimes just to make my life simple and pragmatic for now i'm going to say that we can do social welfare with behavioral agents trying to take away that some in the welfare that we care about of for instance this true utility which is your expected utility if you're perfectly informed and we may care a little bit about your procedure because we worry about the anxiety that people may go through if they have particular advice beliefs or in other contexts it may make sense like if you're switching costs for instance then we account for these switching costs as well so we take away the sum that's for now would make it too complicated and let's say alpha is equal to one uh and we put no weight on the behavioral utility and on the weight of this on this true legitimate term okay so what happens what happens well there are three things that are going to happen and one thing has been repeated over and over i think in the past first thing is that the envelope condition no longer holds people are optimizing this i'll call it for now perceived utility they're not optimizing their true interest if we care about the impact of the policy chain when we're truly utility then we have to take into account this new first order term okay of course that first order term is only first order if individuals are responding to the policy and that's a point that has been made before as well okay so the angle of condition does no longer hold so we have to worry about individuals changing their behavior and how that corrects the distortion in the behavior that they initially had very similar to uh the syntax formula that you've seen just before but there are two other things that i think have received less attention that have become important in this context which is that the behavioral biases may have a big impact on how much you value an extra dollar of social insurance okay i think for instance of an individual who is subject to present bias and therefore doesn't set aside a lot of savings so the moment that he becomes unemployed he has less savings to smooth its consumption so he will value an extra dollar of public insurance money so that's going into his insurance value moreover the behavioral frictions may affect the moral hazard costs of providing higher incentives for instance say that people are control passivistic they underestimate the returns in their search efforts then they will put in less effort but they are also likely to be less responsive to changes in the social insurance if they're less responsive to changes in the social insurance that means that the moral hazard cost is going to be lower okay so what are the policy implications from this well it's hard to know in which direction if we introduce a behavioral bias or we eliminate and be every bias we want to change our social insurance program okay because we have to think about these envelope conditions that no longer hold these changes in insurance value and this changes in the moral hazard cost okay so it's hard to come with clean comparative statics with respect to advice as i write right here but we can think about naive policies that is what is the social insurance that a naive policy maker would introduce not being aware of behavioral frictions underlying individuals behavior okay a naive policy maker would still implement this very chatty formula that i've shown you before so we would capture the extent to which biases affect insurance value it would capture to which which extent biases affect the moral hazard cause but he's just missing out on this first term okay so signing the way that a naive policy maker is distorting the policy is something we can do because for that what we need to know is the behavioral distortions and then again how response cpr to changes okay let me pause there to see what are your questions yes i just want to come back to the issue about kind of like this one final time yes i promise i will let it go uh because i'm trying to trace where i'm heading yeah um there is an older literature on social insurance that basically shows that when the government provides insurance it changes the nature of the the private market equilibrium yeah the nature of the separating actually so at which people purchase insurance can change and that's not accounted for right so the envelope condition is just taking a private if the private sector holds prices fixed uh and people adjust their um uh their you know quantities uh it takes that into account but if you're changing the nature of the private equilibrium which which is you know what goes on in that literature it's insurance companies offer commodity that fixed crisis to induce separation if that changes the envelope it's not going to take that time no but the the question is to what extent do we need to know what's happening there and i'm arguing but there that the level goes like into the details and then we're hiding often in like i think that's a critique to doing sufficient statistics approaches so so how we then need to know to the extent that there are no other inefficiencies that that can interact with whatever is happening in the private market is what the fiscal externality does okay and so for instance if private insurers respond by setting different prices and that may change individuals decisions then we just want to know the fiscal consequences of that so this elasticity that we're trying to measure should be an elasticity not just partially to the change in the benefit policy but accounting for all the responses that are going on and then knowing how then the unemployment risk say changes is is again sufficient for capturing that disconnect i don't think that's quite the issue if what's going on in private markets is that insurers are offering quantity constrained contracts yes that works yeah then people are not the marginal condition okay for varying quantity of their insurance it doesn't have the property that the envelope is assuming so because of the discreteness of the choice because the quantity fixed can i because i introduced choice in a second so i have just one representation with choice so so you wanted to commit not to ask more questions but i ask you to just defer your question for uh for two slides because i think it's related to that and i think it's again an envelope condition that we then we can use um uh but i mean okay so when did i start or like how much time you have 33 minutes okay not bad not too bad so now we can go to the empirical evidence and we have a little bit of a road but what we need to do with each of these biases that we find apparently and that try to think about how they affect social insurance design ideally and that goes back to what dog was uh teaching us yesterday was we do this as comprehensively as possible we just don't look at one bias at a time and we think about implications of all these biases existing together so my work has been quite a bit um trying to see to what extent people perceive their chances of becoming unemployed or once they're unemployed filing a job to what extent they perceive that background okay and the evidence suggests that people are very optimistic about their baseline probability to become employed again okay at the same time and for that the evidence is much much weaker at the same time it seems that they underestimate the returns to putting in more effort okay moreover we find that unemployed individuals as they remain unemployed they're basically not reviving their expectations we would always expect that they revise their expectations downwards either because we think that there is some true duration dependence that the longer you are unemployed the more difficult it is to find a job or they learn from the fact that they're remaining unemployed that they may not be the most employable types in the world and we think they would infer something about their their employment prospects based on that so we find that they're not revising their expectations downward and in fact this optimistic bias that we find on average seems to be driven mostly by the long-term employees okay in this paper with uh omni mother we're even arguing that it's partly because of their optimistic bias that they're too selective and selected to long-term unemployment okay so that's that thunder is work on reference dependence by stephanie vega yonashmira and carter's and they look at this piece of evidence that people have argued is the most convincing evidence that moral hazard is really an issue with unemployment insurance which is the fact that if people exhaust their unemployment benefits then we see a spike in the extra great side of an employment okay so we look at the probability of leaving unemployment that spikes up the moment that people lose their employment benefits okay that's very suggestive of a moral hazard the surprising thing is that it jumps up but then jumps down again even though benefits remain low we see that exit rates come down again very quickly so people have worried what is going on here and cephalon coders have been doing a lot of work on this first showing that a model with reference depends can kind of can fit the data very well and then going further and trying to see whether the spike we see in exit rates is also also shows up if we look at search efforts itself okay and they argue that it jumps up a little bit and goes down but there is some uh uh evidence that conflicts a little bit that uh we got from this marianas come there these papers so these are very recent papers that i invite you to have a look at this one yes in listening on this slide under behavioral friction so the implicit assumption here is that reference dependence and loss of virgin is a mistake rather than a preference that we can just you know a little bit nonstandard where we can take seriously so so what what like what we should like what i invited to is that we think about the policy consequences then we have to think indeed about we have to make a stance on the welfaristic consequences of reference dependence and so on and then we could use the machinery that i've just that i've just introduced no but then i see okay i think i don't know immediately it gets all smoothed out because of the uncertainty no but then what is still relevant is like for instance to understand how the elasticity with respect to changes in the benefits changes dynamically over the unemployment span and with reference dependence we may understand that there is nothing different we would need to do from what the situation statistics approach would tell us but it allows us to to get these patterns a little bit i don't think by the way you can just say that the reference to kind of preferences of legitimacy stopped there the thing is somebody's records in this reference point is going to be changing yeah right which i think is yeah so exciting topic something that i don't think will resolve in uh uh here here on the spots uh right now another exciting literature that i want to do like very recent work uh uh that i want to draw your attention to is uh the evidence for hand-to-mouth consumption that we're seeing so there's this paper by caramel by the way it is also like for advertising this they're using fantastic new data resources to be able to show these these kind of products so what they're showing is that your consumption expenditures drop the moment that you become unemployed there could be a lot of explanations for that there could be work-related expenditures complementarities between consumption and leisure that are affecting how much you want to consume but then they show that consumption expenditures drop as discontinuously when individuals exhaust their unemployment benefits okay so why don't i show you that just for a second so it's all in the slides so here this is so let me look at the show the resources first so this shows for an individual becoming unemployed at time zero and then we have months relative to unemployment how their resources are chaining changing combining labor income and ui benefits okay we have a rather discontinuous drop this is based on bank accounts data and seeing the income coming in we have a drop when people become unemployed and then for the people who remain unemployed for long enough we see another drop in their resources after six months of unemployment okay because benefits ui benefits in the u.s exhaust out here after six months of employment so then they look at expenditures we see a very discreet drop in spending we've known this for a while people have always rationalized economists including like oh there could be some work-related expenditures or some complementarities between consumption and leisure and so on so we can only infer much about that but then you look at this the moment that you're going to exhaust your benefits it's completely predictable it's after six months okay and what happens is people's consumption expenditures drop exactly the moment that they exhaust their benefits so there is no consumption smoothing okay so our standard models of intertemporal consumption are clearly missing something here let me add students to the puzzling facts and it's this paper by uh they're looking at the ui in brazil and you are in brazil work quite differently because their individuals are forced to save into unemployment accounts and become accessible the moment that someone becomes unemployed okay so the moment that you become unemployed you suddenly have access to a lot of liquidity this is doing the exact same chart showing how consumption expenditure change relative to the moment that you become an employee and what we see in brazil the moment that people become an employee they go on a spending switch they increase their expenditures the moment that they become an employer despite the fact that as they remain unemployed for longer they have to substantially cut their consumption expenditures okay so that's for ui let's go to health insurance while most evidence in health insurance or behavioral frictions uh uh and health insurance is is is what are the behavioral frictions underlying the choices itself okay but i think there is a big concern about people's health behaviors more generally being distorted and it's just very hard to provide very clean evidence that uh and and dimitri and hunt have given us exceptions but it's very hard to come with clean evidence that their behavior frictions underlying your health behaviors one exam one exception to this is this under use of high value health care for instance the fact that people adhere or not to the prescription drugs they have and and so you can interpret all of this in the same in the same context that i've just been uh talking about earlier so if people under use healthcare then the fact that they would increase their healthcare consumption if we increase health insurance coverage what people have called behavioral hazards yeah that increases the welfare of our health insurance scheme so because by providing more generous coverage people are going to spend more on health care where they were spending too little before so we're going to increase the welfare impact because they expanding the coverage of insurance okay and so there is nice evidence by uh uh bro again showing indeed that if we increase deductibles for a health insurance contract that people are lowering their health expenditures but they're doing this across the board like they are cutting low value care and they're cutting high value cure and they're arguing that deductibles are too blunted instruments for individuals to start in internalized or like like to try to tackle the moral uh inefficiency it's not just behavioral friction that may lead to distorted behavior but uh for instance in the context of the under use of high value occur or prescription drugs people have shown that liquidity constraints are extremely important as well and accounting for this liquidity constraint increases the value of providing more more generous coverage so on these kind of things and let me then conclude the first part and go to dimitri's question like one thing we could do is how should we take this into account when we decide how much coverage to provide for instance to different type of health expenditures in many countries we have much more generous coverage for instance for primary care that for non-primary care and that may be related to all of this or we have the alternative to not just think about how to change the insurance coverage but try to target these biases directly and that relates to the discussion on non-standards policy interventions that you've see yes is your sense that there is um kind of direct empirical evidence for behavioral hazard i mean i understand there were kind of some calibrational arguments about isn't it weird taking on this care that seems to be a high value but is there so let me defer so so i think i think this is the one example where we know that there's low and high value care for a given individual and they're responding in very similar ways to changes in the financial incentives that suggest that they don't they don't perceive this as such so but i think uh uh yeah our advances in this are let me come back to it all the way in yeah because there i'll show an example of our own work where i think the application is not important like but it's it scores so well on internal validity uh uh that identity oh we can think about these things for more importantly here okay good i need to go to upward selection yes question so in the baseline [Music] for the reference point is there any work on like optimal quality bundle which became relationships but like going to choose what is political yeah so i think it relates to the discussion you've had yesterday as well like uh one critique to the so sufficient statistics approach is how local it is uh [Music] but we can take the behavioral frictions as they are unless we think there will be endogenous to how much benefits we provide which would relate to the fact that behavior frictions depend on how high the taxes are as well but to some extent i think it's fine to keep the behavioral frictions as given and then think about what is the marginal impact of changes in benefits then we can also think given the benefits in place what is the impact of reducing the behavioral frictions then doing them together like yeah the sufficient statistics machinery is it's like like we need to expand on that to think about the joint the joint optimal decision on these two things i have a little bit to say on that in the context of that selection because there are people have worried more about it because their the behavior frictions can counteract the inefficiency that is coming from coming from the market so then we have to worry about that as well let me introduce that so i'm going to use the same framework some clunky notation like i'm not super precise but i have this pair of benefits and prices before let's assume that you have a menu of contracts that you can choose from and the value you get depends on the plan that you end up choosing okay let's make that menu as simple as possible still let's assume that people have the choice between getting insurance or remaining uninsured okay so then the social value of insurance for individual type if he gets the insurance will be exactly what i've written before if he doesn't get the insurance it will just be the value of not being insured and there are no physical consequences from the government's perspective okay so i'm going to denote the insured individuals by i would have denoted the uninsured by you but we don't need them in my specification here but the people who are at the margin or right in between like we're different between buying insurance or not i'm going to denote by amp so now i can do the exact same exercise i can do it with changes in benefits as well let me illustrate it for changes in prices and just think what is the welfare consequence of changing one of these policy tools at the mars okay i'm going to show not just the effect on an agent of titan because that i would have to take into account what if he doesn't whatever it's the only thing that i'm going to aggregate i'm looking at average welfare for all individuals in my economy what's the impact of a change in prices well there is going to be direct effects again if i increase the price that of course hurts everyone who is buying insurance so we take the expectation over the insured individuals of what the margin of this utility is for increasing the price of course if i increase the price then that means that i gain extra dollars from everyone who's buying insurance okay so this is direct effect from doing this then there is a behavioral welfare effect if i change the price i'm going to change the share of individuals buying the insurance if individuals change their decision to buy insurance that means that they don't just get the value of the insurance or sorry if they if more people start buying insurance then they don't have the value of being uninsured anymore suddenly they get the value of being insured okay if i change the price i change the share of individuals being insured that has a physical consequence as well for each individual who suddenly becomes insured i will receive a price p but then i also have the expected expenditures for that individual the expected expenditures are being multiplied by the probability that those individuals face a risk well it's not just for any individual that i care about this and care about this for the individuals at the march the people who are responding to my change in the prices okay so this is going to be my behavior with physical effects okay so this term we know very well from another and fingerstyles work but i'm batting it here in my broader model and we see one complicated term here which is this term as well we have envelope conditions okay the fact that people may change their plan choices depending on the instruments that we're going to use the impact on their own utility is going to be your second one because they're optimized okay so let me briefly use a framework to think about adverse selection here with adverse selection the market inefficiency comes from the fact that an individual's risk determines both how much he values a product and how much it costs to the insurer of providing that product okay but insurer cannot price the cost of that individual cannot charge a different price based on the individual specific risk okay so what we then can have for instance in a competitive market we expect prices to reflect average costs and if on top of that we have adverse election meaning that people who are more risky are more likely to buy the insurance than in the market without a selection we would have under insurance under insurance when prices reflect average goals so how does that show up in my little mode here think about this physical externality term here think about the physical externality from reducing the price of the insurance and therefore inducing more people to buy the insurance products what's the fiscal externality from that it's just the price that we get minus the expected cost which was the risk for these marginal individuals who respond to the price change if the price reflects average cost then this fiscal externality is just simply going to depend on the difference in risk between the infra-marginal buyers of insurance those who decided already to be a balance shirt minus the risk of these marginal individuals who needed the price reduction to be convinced to buy insurance adverse election means that people with higher risk are more willing to buy insurance so the infra marginal individuals will have a higher risk than the margin of individuals adverse election makes its turn therefore positive so it suggests that there is a positive fiscal externality from inducing more individuals to buy the insurance okay so in the presence of adverse election or risk-based selection we will have these extra fiscal externalities in place but those we can in principle account for we can set prices to neutralize these kind of things okay of course we need to account for redistributive consequences as well because if we subsidize insurance it means we're taking away money from people not buying insurance and we're giving it to people who are buying insurance okay so that we need to account for but adverse selection per se doesn't affect the value of a free choice in social insurance because in principle we can tackle it with price insurance what is more fundamental when we think about oh do we want to differentiate the plans that individuals can choose from is to what extent are individuals selecting based on the surplus they get from those plants and the surplus will depend on this insurance value term that i introduced before and is the selection on those turns more important than the selection for instance a moral asset okay so that was super quick but that's something we tried to conceptualize a little bit more being very confused about everything like how what it means to have selection more or more hazard things like that i will try to like build a simple framework to make that a little bit more precise okay i had no questions we talked about for 10 minutes not having any behavioral agents so we need to introduce behavioral agents again no i'm doing the same individuals choose a plan that maximize their behavior utility not necessarily the one for relevant so what are the welfare implications again we assume that the envelope condition holds with behavioral agent it no longer holds correcting the choice of an individual who's buying too much or too little insurance will have first order effects so we need to account for it now okay behavioral frictions may also reduce the extent to which individuals are selecting on insurance value if i don't really know or i don't understand the plans then i'm less likely to go and buy a plan that is valuable for me so it may reduce the value of our choice on the other hand behavioral frictions may also reduce the selection of risk the problem in an adversely selected market or without first election is that people use their own risk to decide whether to buy insurance or not and that cannot be priced but if i don't know my risk if i misperceive my risk then i'm going i'm not going to select based on my true risk so the adverse selection consequences are not happening so behavioral frictions may reduce selection of risk and therefore reduce the scope for every selection okay and so relating back to an earlier comment one worry that we have is that we we have policies that eliminate the behavioral frictions we may increase the scope for adverse selection and there has been quite some work trying to think about the interaction between these market inefficiencies and these behavioral fractions and then finally if the incidence of behavioral friction is differently among the uninsured and the insurer then yeah we may want to think about the redistributive concerns as well so what are the challenges so how am i doing okay so if i had more hours do i have more hours though i would have spent a lot of time on this thing just to qualify it how useful it has been it's a little bit like using the envelope condition but also how problematic it is to some extent so i think for years the literature in adverse election has been purely focused on heterogeneity in risk and has been one dimensional in that sense okay and i think a lot of credit is owed to amy finkelstein and lyra enough to move from that one-dimensional world to a multi-dimensional world and still come with like like like things that are workable and implementable okay so when we took our predictions on adverse election first to the data like if there's only heterogeneity and risk then we expect the people who are more risky to buy more insurance we call this like positive correlations and we have done this kind of positive correlation tests empirically and we've seen that in many applications they failed so something that has been seen as a robust prediction of these adverse election modes with just heterogeneity risks seem to fail when we test them okay so what we've done then is oh we observe two things for an individual we observe their riskiness and we observe the choices they make and so then we've assumed to the extent that there is variation in the choices that individuals make that is not explained by differences in their risk it must be because they have different preferences okay so all the residual variation that has been observed be loaded into differences in preferences okay so it's been super useful to do this to overcome just the one dimensionality so now we're bi-dimensional at least but we fully ignored the potential problem of behavioral friction standard times for the ignore these are two literatures that have evolved way too much in parallel like still using just rational agents and doing like all the analysis versus a lot of work documenting behavioral frictions and relying insurance choices but the problem is how to do better which is how to estimate the utility that is that is actually relevant for welfare if we cannot rely on that on the reveal preference paradigm here let me give some quick examples first on unemployment insurance we can be very brief because unemployment insurance in most countries is mandated there is no choice involved and perhaps for the back okay there is one exception or there are few exceptions there are some scandinavian countries that in fact allow people to buy more unemployment insurance they choose between a basic plan or a more comprehensive plan and it's something that we uh analyze so this is together with my colleague at the university california and try to use to really test for adverse selection in our closet on a production contract also get estimates of how much people value and employ insurance using revealed preference paradigms and using alternative methods so so i have a i like these papers are in the reference list that you have access to one lowest thing so if i would have another hour i would spend an hour on this as well in many social insurance contexts we don't observe individuals choice so we cannot use the reveal preference paradigm because people don't reveal their preferences because they're not making any choices so how do we make progress down on trying to get a sense of how much individuals value insurance so there's quite a bit of work on that and raj had like i think like like a first very important contribution here trying to use how people's unemployment response difference to different differently to different sources of variation how people respond to liquidity versus changes in the benefits allows him to do inference on how different their marginal utilities are of consumption when unemployed versus consumption when employees okay it's super clever and there is a lot of fallout work on that so what we have been uh proposing is use the marginal propensity to consume out of an unexpected dollar that you're receiving when you're unemployed relative to what your employees if you're using more of that dollar it must be that you value the value that a loss so if people have a high npc when unemployed compared to when they're employed it must tell us something about how value these unemployment benefits are okay so these are ways to infer the insurance value from observed responses that they crucially rely on agents optimizing okay so in these implementation methods that we've been using we've also often ignored that with behavioral agents these implementation methods may no longer be robust okay so it's another thing we have to make progress on so then there is a large literature and health insurance literature on behavioral friction's distorted insurance choices um uh i'm good at it i could have added a lot of papers um but these these are the ones that i've listed on the reading list as well and then there's this interaction between behavioral frictions uh with adverse selection as well people have paid quite some quite some attention okay so in the last three minutes let me summarize some challenges ahead and let me try to make a little bit progress on the one one last challenge so one challenge we still have i think we've made a lot of progress but we're not there completely is to provide both characterizations and implementations of the welfare impact of changes in a policy that are behavior robust okay that are robust to the behavioral frictions we we deem relevant in specific context the second challenge is that we have very much a bottom-up uh approach where we focus on a specific bias and then we think about what is the implication of that specific bias on the policy and not thinking about how different biases can come back okay so it's the overall distortion in people's behavior that we want to capture combining all of these behavioral frictions underlying it and that goes back to the comprehensive welfare analysis that was proposing as well but the nice thing is we've made so much progress like using the sufficient statistics design thinking about this in a sufficient statistic sense like like yeah there must be ways to to to make progresses and provision this and it would be exactly the spirit that allowed us to make make big advances on that that was not super clear but let me uh let me move on because the third thing that is i think very surprising and i know that raj is going to do a lecture on inequality and there are authors of one paper that are the exception to the rule in this room as well but we've been focusing so much on the efficiency consequences of these behavioral frictions and i think too little attention is paid to the equity consequences of exactly this and so we have so much evidence that individuals are having difficulty in making choices and a big concern we have is that the choice quality the quality of the choices that individuals are making are very related to social economic sales okay but the challenge is to have data and a complex that allows you to separate bias from preferences that's first thing and the second thing is to do in addition document hypertension in these balances and do that for a representative population that is just very difficult okay and so yeah i'm stating the same thing here again public economics is all about efficiency versus equity it's weird that that trade-off has been like maybe a little bit too much more than now in the behavioral public economics sphere let me end it's horrible now to go into uh i think i need two can i use two minutes or three minutes to yeah okay uh uh i think i have three slides on this let me end uh uh uh showing you some evidence from this work that i've done with ben handler john colsta and thomas vincent like trying to get at the inequality and choice quality so we go and look at a very specific context which is dutch health insurance where all dutch individuals have the option to increase their deductible by another 500 euros for which they get a premium reduction of 250 euros okay 18 million dutch people like i don't know the dutch population buy heart and i know that this is recorded but i think it's nice i was [Music] are making the choice whether or not to increase their deductible at this premium reduction so what we're going to do we feel that we have a setting here where we can really think about choice quality we're going to compare the deductible choices that individuals are making with our predicted probability that their expenses remain below the dividend defaulted okay so if the probability that your expenses are going to be low is high then you should take the deductible if not you should be taking the number and now we're going to link this with administrative registers so we have information on the deductible choice we have information on health records that allows us to do these predictions but then we also have also information for the entire dutch population so we have a representative sample of the dutch population we have the universe we have information on social economics under education on econ on their financial we know the decision that their neighbors are making we know the decisions that your family is making as well and so we exploit that in the paper as well so three charts what i'm showing you here is the distribution of the predictive probability of having low expenses so these guys are predictably healthy having low expenses these guys are predicting the unhealthy and see we can we can really separate them quite well these are people who for sure will make high expenses and should not take the extra deduction these are people who quite certainly are not going to make high health expenses and should be taking this inductor they have only a 10 chance of making high level expenses so if they don't get the deductible it means that they paid 250 250 euros to cover an expense of 500 euros that they only face with a probability of 10 so they pay 250 euros to get expected coverage for 50 euros okay so someone who is risk neutral should be here should be buying the getting the deductible here and not getting the deductible here someone with extreme risk aversion 10 to the power minus three extreme risk of variance should be here so because stakes are small and risk preferences have little light which is a limitation of this but it also allows us let's ignore risk preferences here so now we're going to look at the take-up of the deductible here on the right as a function of this probability of having no costs okay and so this step function is where a frictionless consumer would change from not having the deductible look at the take-up rate of the deductible it's extremely low it's monotonically increasing as people become more predictably healthier and more likely to take it up so in average they do awful which is probably driven by a default effect people are defaulted in to this compulsory deductible and have the option to take the extra investment okay so let me add on a depressing note which is not that they're doing on average often the people are doing the worst are the people who have low socioeconomic status low income lower education okay so let me just flag that in three slides and then i conclude okay so this is showing the take-up rate by education so let's look at these predictably healthy individuals people who are high school dropouts even if you make them like close to 100 percent predictably like having low health expenses take a break remains up to 10 people with the highest education take a break is more than 3 times a time okay so this is just by not like by degree that you have not by the fields that you've specialized so let's look at the field that you've specialized in so the blue ones here are the statisticians okay and the x's here are the philosophers so even within similar degrees of education someone with a quantitative background is just making better choices than someone with a known quantity okay similar looking at professional sector the ones making the best decisions are people working in business services people working in insurance working in house insurance so we have like pushed this research to the parliamentary debates and then people always say oh but we cannot exclude that people with lower income really have different preferences they have lower income they have access to less liquidity and so on but in the data we have information on income we have information on liquidity so we can see once we take out the effect of education how predictive is or how related is your choice still to income or liquidity and there is no relationship so it's really about human capital that is driving people's choices here okay but then if you put things together all of this is very correlated so it's still the people who are average of much lower income for making much worse choices so this is not a very pedagogical chart it's just the showing off chart that we have a lot of observers that we can use here so we have like people's firms mixed effects their zip code fixed effects what their parents are doing and what we're doing here is ranking people based on the quality of the decisions they're making all the way from the top decision makers to the bottom decision makers and they're some important demographic differences so the the worst decision makers are older on average uh compared to the best decision makers but i just wanted to end with these numbers here just comparing the average income of the people at the very top of the distribution versus the very bottom of the distribution are looking at networks like 250 000 euros for the best decision makers and 5 000 euros for the worst decision maker so not taking into account the redistributive consequences from allowing people this choice to take a deductible or not would be a big mistake this is about small stakes this is a deductible of time magnitudes but we're making a lot of these mistakes and all of this may come down to really huge wealth regulations that we that we should take into account and then i hope future research can shed more light thanks a lot
