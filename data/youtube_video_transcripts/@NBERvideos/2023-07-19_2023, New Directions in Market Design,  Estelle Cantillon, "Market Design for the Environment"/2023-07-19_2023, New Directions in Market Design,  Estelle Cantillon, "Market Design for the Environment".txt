great uh thank you very much for the invitation delighted to be here to see so many known faces and uh and and looking forward to all of the discussion across uh different fields so I'm going to talk about uh Market design for the environment and um unlike uh Mark who did a very systematic um uh overview of every Market design area for electricity I may actually I will actually be a little bit more uh selective uh so I'm going to basically uh say you know first describe what are we talking about when we talk about Market design for the environment second question I'm going to select uh a one specific application which is uh cap and trade for carbon um and then I I'm going to talk about voluntary carbon markets because in today's world we cannot avoid them I mean they are happening and they are in need of uh good Market design uh okay so what are we talking about I think it's important to realize that environmental markets are not only about climate change I mean climate change obviously is a big uh thing but uh nature provides a lot of uh services to us I mean it's about regulating Services you know the car the carbon cycle the water cycle it's about providing food uh it's about uh different supporting services like you know soil formation that's all of these the things that nature uh provides they all uh subject to large externalities which is the reason why we may have an issue again we may need to think about correcting for these um uh for these uh issues I think it's useful I mean at least that's when I was trying to prepare this talk how to organize my thoughts around there are two types um two big sets of problems one are common pool resources so these are um you know goods and services that are non-excludable but subject to congestion okay and then they are uh privately owned natural resources so they do provide service but there are in private hands okay and so the issue here is that some of the services they provide are positive externality and as a result the private owner may not have the right incentives to maintain them okay so the type of issues we have on the common pool resources we are going to have two types of problems or sub problems one is uh when we talk about natural resources we are interested in making sure that there's an sustainable exploitation of them so think about Fisheries Water Resources we want to you know the typical incentive is to over exploit them given that no one owns them and we want to make sure that uh we are you know exploiting in the sustainable manner then there are all of the the other type of problems sub problems here are pollution so we want to limit the pollution that impacts the quality of these common pool resources and here we can there are many many pollutants uh and a different scale so knocks sulfur dioxide carbon of course for climate uh but other uh toxic efforts also in water so there's a long list of uh pollutants here and then on the the right hand side if I think about the privately owned natural resources here the what we really care about is to make sure that the private owner um maintain uh these natural resources in terms of protecting biodiversity may actually uh one of the services dude it's it's uh it's carbon sequestration or other uh ecosystemic uh Services okay and so the the primary concern for the the market design of course there are going to be many concerns but the primary concern is going to be different across this different problems here the on the first on the first one the primary concern is making sure that the total Caps or the how many fish we can fish is the right amount so that we don't cross the boundary where it becomes unsustainable so that's and uh so it's that's the primary concern if I think about pollution here the the the the new aspect is the fact that different people may have different uh access to different abatement opportunities with different costs and so there the primary concern as a result is going to be cost Effectiveness I'll make sure that we can you know of course the Gap is important but just making sure that those who evade are those with the lowest abatement gusts is going to be important and uh of course for the last one is also cost Effectiveness is important what's interesting is that in practice in some some in some places you have both private and public governance mechanisms whereas of course for when we talk about pollution typically it's the public it's already regulated uh markets okay all of these matter so that's what we're talking about and of course what kind of markets we see then is going to depend on the nature of these problems if I think about uh ensuring a sustainable exploitation we can actually auction uh drawing rights to those who value it the most so we can allocate them for lottery and then allow them to trade these drawing rights okay that's one way and you see this you know for water rights and and for fish for example uh if I think about uh cap and trade uh for a mechanism to limit the pollution uh we can allocate or sign tradable allowances to allowances to pollute or we can say here's a Baseline and again allow people uh or and credit basically people who pollute less than what they were allowed for okay and and there's a list of markets and a variety of markets very uh big the most you're not the most interesting but the emerging types of markets on the right hand side here that there will be two types of issues one is probably you know you can think of about them as project Finance so you want to make sure uh to match those that seek uh to compensate their pollution somewhere uh with uh those who are capturing carbon or you would just want to pay have payments for ecosystem services so all of the voluntary carbon markets uh that on that side okay so that's the big picture about what you know the really big thing what we're talking about uh and I'm going to zoom in on uh carbon markets and and uh and more specifically on on the EU emission trading scheme because I have most experience with that one but you know I'm going to touch upon the other markets as well big picture on carbon markets by the way today so in 2022 they were covering 70 17.5 of global greenhouse gases emissions that's the coverage and here's a picture this comes from a report from the World Bank that gives you on the x-axis you've got the fraction of the greenhouse the domestic greenhouse gases that are covered by these markets on the y-axis you've got the average price per ton of carbon okay and the the size of the bubble is the turns this the size of the the the greenhouse gases and obviously China is the biggest today okay it's just big country big larger missions uh and uh the you know one of those with the highest price is the EU emission trading scheme it's actually the largest market still today in terms of value in in terms of uh but in terms of uh size number of tons of carbon China by now yeah is the largest okay and you see some markets are really covering essentially if you think about Korea almost all of the greenhouse the domestic greenhouse gas emission but with a very low price so that gives you a picture of the the diversity of markets that are existing uh there look it is uh so now that we've set the stage it's just a range of uh Market design considerations you have to decide the market scope so which cover which sectors are you going to cover many uh admission trading schemes are only covering electricity markets but others are also covering you know uh in energy intensive Industries how many get are you going to cover CO2 but also the other uh greenhouse gases um are you covering all of the companies that are emitting carbon or only those above a certain threshold which jurisdictions how many countries um are you allowing people to trade across time can they borrow allowances can they Bank allowances so these are already a long list of uh decisions then you have to decide on the gap and of course greenhouse gas emissions are very directly linked with economic activities so whenever there's an economic recession the Baseline level of intermissions is going to go down and if you don't want the price to go down you might as well just think about how does the cap adjust to uh business as usual uh emissions so there are many other jurisdictions of Cost Containment reserves or Market stability reserves in in Europe um there's a question of how do you allocate the allowances you give them for freed you auction them if you give them for for free how do you do this you grandfather them or do you somehow allocate them based on our needs compliance how frequently you have penalties can they use offsets can they buy offsets in the voluntary carbon market and count them uh to cover cover their own Admissions and then you know one thing is which I care most about because it's more closer to my resources how do you organize this Market who can trade it's actually not obvious some some markets are limited to only the comp the firms the regulated firms others not where centralized Market decentralized Market over the counter what can you trade into futures are there limits on trading and so on okay so it's a long list of of of uh of decisions and of course again the primary objective is cost Effectiveness uh sorry yeah cost efficiency and so what what this requires is to make sure that the price that's generated by this Market is informative of the the distribution of abatement opportunities and sufficiently stable and why do I say sufficiently stable because a lot of these abatement Technologies are bulky so they are long-term Investments okay that takes 20 years or 25 years so in electricity markets it's easy to reduce emissions because you shift from code to gas and then you've just you can do this very fast you know you reshuffle the portfolio and that you've reduced your emissions you are in steel or in cement you have to think about in different technology and re you know it's a it's a these are really long-term Investments and then of course there's a bunch of other considerations because if cost efficiency was the only one it would be easy but people make them to be concerned about the geographical dispersion uh the the employment impacts uh uh the implementation costs and so on so forth okay so I'm going to give you a sense of all of these things mattering and you know I think the European carbon Market is a very nice uh case study here because at the beginning they felt that market design was not that important and they had to fix things so it's back to Al's introduction they see a problem and they fix they try they've tried to fix markets they work in phases so every phase is the same rules and it's important of course to announce the rules of the game so these are uh and then they do this before the phase and then they see what happens and then fix uh things so a few things I want to highlight of course the scope scope has been changing over time it's very uh usual that in many markets you know you start small you experiment and then you expend this has been happening more countries more gases more sectors okay let's see how did they set the cap so there is more political economy lesson initially they said that they would let every country decide on their cap for the firms in their country okay now if you think about the game that's being played here am I in Germany I don't want to have too strict a cap okay so that led to overall locations in the meantime now the cap is set at the European level and there's a you know stop down and it's just more systematic uh they now they've increased the climate and vision of Europe and as a result the cap is actually going down much faster now here for the lessons and the little uh you know crisis that you've got so um the very first phase was a test an experimental phase so they they allowed they they gave allowances for free but then said there's no Bank Ability Beyond the face so you know whatever is not used in Phase One you cannot use it later on okay and later on now today you can borrow one the equivalent of one year of allowances but you can bank anytime uh your uh your lenses but as you remember in 2007's age we had a big economic crisis you know so um uh industrial activity went down and also uh emissions so that created a big economic uh a big Market blood too many allowances but if you look here nothing nothing is made for this right you could there was an excess allowances and they just stayed in the system and as you can reduce the uh um the uh the price this led to the adoption of what's called a non-market stability reserve and come back to this stage one initially the we you know we the issue was to make sure this scheme was socially accepted or accepted by the industry and so you know what you do is you grandfather the alliances you give the allowances for free according to past uh admissions uh in the in the meantime so starting 2013 this they started to auction uh these allowances and some sectors are subject to uh competition from uh outside of the EU are still given the allowances for free but based on a uh a benchmarking uh uh based on benchmarking so essentially we look at the 10 most efficient firms and we allocate everyone the allowances uh that's you know that that corresponds to the top 10 so if you less efficient than those then you still have to cover some of your uh emissions um and last thing in terms of even the infrastructure of these markets matter initially everything was done at the national level there was a few hacking events there were some big vit Carousel that I think cost France about 5 billion euros at the time so it was a big a really big deal and so in the meantime now everything's also centralized centralized registry and it's regulated uh under miffit which is the financial markets directive Financial Market regulation in in Europe so before it was not even regulated at the financial Market okay so I'll give you a sense that the evolutions of these things uh and so let me now talk about the prices because the prices is what really matters um there are Market fundamentals that drive prices uh of course the abatement technology how easy it is for me to reduce my emissions it depends on the Technologies it depends on the sectors of course um the second driver second fundamental driver is the businesses you as business as usual level of emissions that depend on the economic activity it depends also and importantly on overlapping policies that impacts the emissions of these sectors and then finally a third uh fundamental driver is the gap how many allowances you let in the system the timing of the allocation for these allowances and constraints on uh Banking and borrowing okay if you play if you use this and you you have a very simple way of modeling this Market okay uh the equilibrium prediction about the prices is that prices should be very stable why because in some ways there is going to be some Arbitrage where people are thinking you know you're arbitrary like we are trying to sell each other the the the these allowances to make sure that at every point of time it's a cheap the guy who has the cheapest abatement goes that does it but I'm also trading up and arbitraging across time if I know that it's going to be cheaper in the future uh to uh to Abate I'm going to Abate not so much today and then you know do it uh later okay and so it also means that if you have an economic shock to the system it's not in principle not going to have a big effect on prices because people are just going to smooth out the effect you're going to equalize marginal costs within time and across time up to uh a discount factor and of course that's really essential if you want to drive long-term investment right if you want to make sure that cement and steel and all of these guys who have bulk investment invest they want to the the more stable price you can produce the easier it is for them to make the case to invest in these uh in these Technologies so what um uh is the EU TS actually delivering these stable prices so this is the uh uh these are the historical prices from the very beginning okay uh and today we are around 100 euros per ton but uh what you see here so the first phase is the the obvious one you had some prices that collapsed to zero because remember there was too many allowances and you couldn't Bank them so price you know that's really like equilibrium behavior is uh is is is is uh is happening and then starting from phase uh two you you see prices going down quite a bit this is the economic blood for in the global financial crisis where there was no adjustment mechanism to change the cap so you just said all of these alliances all being banked uh prices at some point were around three Euros they were calls in the Press of saying like it just doesn't work at three Euros a ton there's no incentive to a bait right there's just nothing um and then recently so this is the when the the Market's ability Reserve kicked in and there's a bunch of other stuff you know of course the cap is being strengthened but priced that much higher uh there are also um quite variable and quite volatile so this is actually if I focus on it uh two on the one year window I think it's one year just about here yes just a bus here window prices have gone from 60 to 100 euros over the past year so if you are the CFO of a company trying to make the case for an investment that this is just very volatile I I did so I haven't repeated this I did this um before the financial crisis before the the uh the energy crisis but I had compared the price volatility of EU allowances with the price volatility of other Commodities like gas and uh you know oil and others where storage costs are pretty high okay whereas for allowances there's no scar scores you can really easily Bank them and so you you should expect much less volatility and that was the opposite so it's much more volatile than what we think so even though when I see this graph it looks you know economic you could explain the directionality of these prices yeah right you know for the cap is being tighter so it makes sense it goes up and so on the level of volatility that we observe is just not uh compatible with equilibrium model okay and I think it's it's it's a surprise and it's also a concern again for for driving investment so they have been luckily there have been some people you know people have been thinking about this I think we're still a lot of questions that uh an open uh open questions but here are some of the conjectures that people have been uh put forward so the first one is that these firms have much shorter time Horizon than what we're thinking okay they are um they have some risk management practices in place that requires them to hedge their positions in Carbon on on a much shorter basis than arbitraging over time and so on so forth so that's that's that's one one explanations and it's very nice paper I recommend by command and talk to you on this thing that's it cancel okay um and so I think that in terms of Market design question that it it raises is like should we actually support long-term markets for hedging so today you cannot hedge here the price of carbon Beyond two or three years your investment in abatement Technologies are 20 years 30 years we don't have markets to hedge uh for this uh uh is that does that have an impact on the way we we adjust cap second uh conjecture is that uh they've been overlapped the overlapping uh policies uh have led to large shocks in uh businesses usual uh emissions so it's very famous that in in the U.S the sulfur dioxide the the federal sulfur dioxide markets disappeared because essentially uh stage level policies were strong enough that we didn't need the the the the federal one but there's also a very nice paper uh by Bornstein and others uh uh uh and uh in 2019 um so there I think it begs the question of how should we adjust the cap for these overlapping code policies a third explanations that have been that hasn't been put forward in that context but it's it's obvious from it's been a portfolio in other context it's the fact that um today people are using the emission trading scheme to head against inflation to Green their financial portfolios and so the market is being used for other purposes then it was designed for okay and so there's this paper by Chang and Zhong uh who are suggesting that some of these Commodities are facing excess volatility because people you know they are um the victim somehow of uh the risk diversity fake diversification in financialized markets okay and I think and so then that that really uh raises the question of who should be participating in some uh in in in uh you know in some jurisdiction everyone can participate even you and I in some others it's only only compliance firms okay um these are very thin markets because typically people um have to comply comply only once a year and so that may also create accessible agility so that also the question that the design question here is should we lower the frequency of the market uh people have been also suggesting that we should have staggered compliance markets just to make sure things are you know there's liquidity at all times um it's a highly fragmented Market at least in Europe but it is you know it's both decentralized they are they're centralized exchanges so it's very opaque um and uh you know in some papers uh with uh with Australia we've shown that this actually increases you know it it it um there's no Level Playing Field for participants there are some participants who are less connected to the market who are just paying much higher prices uh to uh to buy these advances and that's also uh of course uh uh creating excess variety so there the question is should we centralize trading should we have market makers again different jurisdictions have um uh taken different uh I've taken different steps here so stats on the volatility I think there's um some of the the ways in which these markets have tried to address this price volatility is by putting price uh stabilization uh stabilization mechanisms in place and there really two types of those one is having Price Cutters like in California so you've got a price floor and then you have a a um a top uh a price ceiling and of course the problem here is that so now you have a hybrid Michael so it's no longer a market like a quantity Market it's it's uh now you have a hybrid mechanism and so you lose either the quantity Target or the cost efficiency because if you have two Russian price uh quantities uh then you don't have the price anymore to to do to ensure gross efficiency uh the second type of of answers is is having a dynamic cap adjustment um that depends on the you know the quantity the balance between quantity uh supply and demand at any point of time so in Europe uh the they started this Market stability reserves in 2019 and it's it is it it is tricky in Europe so I'm going to tell you exactly how to do this what they do is that if the number of allowances in circulation is above a certain threshold they are going to remove some if they are below a certain threshold they are going to inject some okay just to try and make sure there's a enough liquidity now the problem is if you are in a market where you know that the cap is going to go down what you want to do is exert a lot of abatement effort before and Bank if you bang there's going to be a lot of balances on the market and so you can imagine that the way this Market stability Reserve operates creates this feedback loop where people are banking because they are trying to anticipate the tighter cap going forward and then I'm going to remove some of the alliances and so that's going to spear it up okay and so I think that's where you see again like you know careful design and understanding how people are playing this game is important um going to stick skip this one emissions trading and globalized work given uh the time because I want to talk about I think it's important to talk about voluntary markets I it's not I'm not doing research on this but I spend a little bit of time looking at this in preparation of this talk if you haven't please check this uh episode uh by John Oliver I think it's excellent it's an excellent introduction uh to this so what is uh what are voluntary markets essentially you've got projects that reduce carbon emissions relative to business as usual or that remove carbon and on the other side you've got some individual or firm that is eager to compensate for their their emissions again so one is willing to pay for uh for the the project and the other one gives a certificate that shows that indeed uh the emissions have been compensated and of course we want to be careful about which what are these things you know we want to make sure that the project is indeed additional that without the money it would not have happened that it's permanent that the the the emissions predictions are permanent we need to make sure that we can figure out the right counterfactual you know it's a baseline accuracy and that we can trace these things properly and that's already really hard and there's a bunch of intermediaries around this you know there are standards there are third party certifies Registries Market platforms and various intermediaries it's just like there's a lot of startups also on these things so it's just a very uh busy Market it's a busy Market it's growing it so in 2021 it was really interesting the experience of really high growth and it's it's uh it's slowed down in 2022 and essentially it's just a lot of scandals in this market so there are issues about uh green washing so you see this on the left-hand side press but also researchers being active on this so there's a group of researchers at dlseed that have looked at whether carbon offsets are actually offsetting carbon and the answer is that at least 52 of approved carbon offsets were allocated to projects that would very likely have been built anyway so there's no additionality and moreover they estimate that the state of these offsets uh actually increase Global carbon dioxide emissions the group of researchers at Berkeley actually found that uh there's overquidity pervasive over crediting from cook stoves offset methodologies Okay so that gives you your sense of that they are this is a market in need of Market designers probably of of need of fixing this is actually sure I'm going to skip this one but that shows that even one ton of carbon has a different price depending on the source so whether it's a removal whether it's nature based weather and so on of these ones so you see that even this fragmentation at that level um there have been some recent development I mean so this is a market I think in crisis but there have been technological advances satellite image imagery blockchain I'll I have one more site after that one um there's been um this real industry wide efforts to uh revamp and harmonize standards and importantly the demand from the business side is going to be there so that's why we need to fix it it's really important to realize that that there's more and more efforts from the corporate side to go beyond value chain mitigation you know uh what's called uh and and interest also address biodiversity so trust is important here and the the kind of Market design questions that actually leave you with is just I think we need to understand we need to decide what's the primary objective of this Market here is it project Finance is it payment for ecosystem uh Services uh Beyond there's the different accounting rules uh should the design be the same one for everything for cook stoves and biodiversity for example uh should the market be decentralized as it is right now it's not obvious to me okay so this you know that's that's my size slide wide open area for research huge uh potential social uh societal impact for for research on environmental Market design thinkers are both fundamental uh research questions and Market design questions both at the macro level you're like thinking about the cap you know these are macro levels but also in the micro level what kind of microstructures do we should we have more should we have market makers should we have should we allow everybody to trade and so on thank you very much sorry for
