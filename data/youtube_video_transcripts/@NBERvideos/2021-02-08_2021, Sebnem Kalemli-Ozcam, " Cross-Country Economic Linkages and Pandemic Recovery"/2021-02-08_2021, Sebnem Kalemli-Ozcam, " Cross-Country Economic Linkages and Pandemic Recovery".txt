i'm shibnam kalem lioskin and this work is joined with uh jam chuck makla selwa demeral savjanya shiltash and juan matildaram from coach university and in the paper we make the economy case for global vaccinations as we all know code 19 has caused catastrophe across the world sparing no country in 2020. now we have the vaccines these are seen as a game changer and they can stop the pandemic of course in a given country the point we would like to make in this paper is that given the global entire connections between countries even you achieve universal inequality in your own country you are still going to suffer economically if the rest of the world is not vaccinated and the paper is about estimating these costs by focusing on three questions first what is the economic impact of not vaccinating poorer nations on the richer nations and then how much of the global economy cost the rich nations bear even if they achieve universal vaccination in their own countries and then finally the third question is which sectors and rich economies are especially vulnerable so our framework is a data-driven framework and it is very rich in country sector heterogeneity we would like to bring the sectoral heterogeneity in infection dynamics together with the sectoral heterogeneity in global trade and production networks and the way we do that is by combining an epidemiological model a sir model susceptible infected recovered model with an economic framework that uses the global trade and production network data so basically how do we do this on the supply side we model the domestic labor supply shock as a function of infections that allow us to capture this heterogeneity there if you are a worker in an occupation that you have to be on site you cannot remote work and you have to work in close approximately to others then your infection rate is going to be higher we combine this labor supply with domestic and important intermediate inputs in a leonty of production function structure based on the evidence of strong complementarities in the short run so our estimates are going to be very short run in 2021 so on the demand side we follow a similar approach and we make consumption expenditure as also a function of infections through our sr model and this this sir model uh that gives us the infection dynamics is country specific we start end of 2020 country specific r numbers and we let the pandemic evolve in every country in 2021 so we are going to have cases where if severe cases are more than the icu capacity of the country then that country is going to put a lock down and we let the demand normalize only when the cases are very low and these things are going to be calibrated based on what we observed in 2020 in real time data the open economy dimension of course very straightforward because the infection dynamics affect production in each country and demand in each country that's going to fit directly in exports and imports of both final and intermediate goods so to measure all this we are going to use very rich data on global trade and production networks this is oecd icio tables just to give you a glimpse of the complexity of this network on the left ear in blue i plotted the trade relationship between countries both for final and intermediate goods different colors and different arrows represent the strength of those relationships and on the right in the pink orange red color i show you the same complex network for sectors so you can see that this is a sectoral uh input output linkages but this is going to be embedded on the figure on the on the left so it is a hugely complex network of 65 countries and 35 industries that we will be working with that is covering the entire global trade and production network and the color coding here is again uh is about certain sectors can be very linked to other country sectors because these are tradable these are the sectors buying a lot of inputs from other countries but you can also be a light pink sector who don't do that much that directly but you can do that indirectly through another sector so we will use these full-sledge uh io linkages at the local and global level then we are going to ask a very simple question given this rich complex local and global trade and production network how much amplification we can get when there is the health shock in a given country affecting that country's demand and that country's production how much this amplification uh can be given these io linkages so we are going to work three specifications here uh every specification is going to allow a demand shock both domestic and foreign as a function of infection infections so it goes from the best case to worst case scenarios from specification one to three the difference is in the first specification we are not going to allow the full brand of these global value chains so there won't be any shock coming to you through your important intermediate inputs so in the first specification you will only suffer if your own workers are sick but in the second and third specification you will also suffer if workers are sick in certain sectors affecting other sectors domestically so amplification via domestic input output linkages and in the final most general specification we let the amplification through the entire international inter-industry input output linkages so you buy inputs from a sector in another country and that other country is not vaccinated but that is still going to affect you your own sector even you achieve full vaccination so vaccination enters to this scenario exactly like that by eliminating the labor supply shock in the country of vaccination and also normalizing the demand in that country so here are all the costs for advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies uh both in terms of billions on the top panel and in terms of percent of gdp pre-pandemic gdp in the bottom panel i'm not going to go through all these numbers but i would like to make the case that each of these specifications going from uh you know least effect most effect for a vaccinated country can be analyzed under three different scenarios given in these three blocks so the first two blocks are going to be about scenarios where advanced economies achieve full vaccination right away at the beginning of 2021 and emerging market and develop economies get no vaccination whatsoever and they might have no luck downs or endogenous slackdowns in their own countries and the final block here which i'm going to focus on is our benchmark scenario we think this is more realistic where advanced economies achieve full vaccination of their citizens by the mid 2021 and emerging market and developed economies only be able to vaccinate half of their population by early 2022 and because pandemic gets really worse there they are going to have endorsements locked down so if i have to focus on two numbers here this is the share of uh advanced economies in terms of how much burden they have to shoulder in terms of global total economy cost that's 49.3 percent so the economy cost in the world is around 4 trillion and 49.3 percent is going to be borne by advanced economies under this scenario even they achieve full vaccination by mid-year and if they are not affected through this amplification of imported intermediate inputs and they only lose export revenue so say they vaccinate themselves advance economies but the rest of the world is in recession because they are still sick and even in that case advanced economies is going to share the 21 percent of the total global economy cost and these numbers are not that small right they are actually from one percent of advanced economy pre-pandemic gdp to almost three percent 2.72 percent of pre-pandemic gdp so the final figure i would like to show you is about the importance of the global trade and production network in terms of sector heterogeneity and gtp laws so what i plot here on the left is the one digit sector gdp laws plotted as a box plot to show you the country heterogeneity for the vaccinated advanced economy group and the sectors are color-coded where blue are tradable sectors and pink are non-tradable sectors and on the on the right i plot the same sectoral uh gdp laws for unvaccinated emerging market and developing economies so the ranking here is a very typical one that now we are used to see in 2020 where the the bottom sectors here in the unvaccinated countries the highest low sectors are your services sectors right your restaurants are closed your gyms are closed so accommodation and food services arts and entertainment these are the highest law sectors in an unvaccinated country where i plot here with a vertical black line the maximum loss in advanced economies in these services sectors it is very small now right why if you go to the left again because vaccinated advance economies don't suffer these losses in the services sectors anymore in fact now they only suffer because because of tradable sectors and the maximum loss for advanced economies is going to be in the tradable sector shown here with the blue in agriculture and fishing the uh but it doesn't mean that that's going to be the only thing in fact you can see that transport and storage and wholesale retail two non-tradable sectors here still a lot of losses right more than 15 percent of gdp and to give two examples us denotes it with blue diamond and netherlands denoted with uh orange triangle the tradable factor loss of course is going to be correlated with openness netherland is a more open country so suffer more than u.s but u.s is still suffering in these non-tradable sectors uh shown with the buddha diamond why because these sectors either directly uh import intermediate inputs or they are linked to other domestic sectors that imports intermediate inputs from unvaccinated emerging market and developed economies so this can have a true amplification effect on uh vaccinated advanced economies in terms of gdp so basically what we do in the paper is to demonstrate the economy case for global vaccination as so far the debate had to be about the moral morality of this and our results is going to rely on this fact that no economy is an island in this complex globalized world where countries are tied to each other with international linkages in this world the potential loss to advanced economies gdp even they themselves achieve universal vaccination can be larger than the investment needed in global vaccination initiatives such as coax and we calculate the return to this investment that tells you that such investment can be in the best interest of advanced economies in terms of the return they are going to get because this is compared to the losses that they might suffer uh in 2021 when the pandemic is not under control in their unvaccinated trading partners so our bottom line is that given the extent of globalization no economy fully recovers until every economy recovers and that means if we want to solve the pandemic we must adopt a multilateral approach
