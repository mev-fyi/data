okay so I would also like to thank the organizers for putting together this very stimulating event and for inviting me to participate um so and I'd like to thank Ricardo for a very interesting paper he covers a wide array of topics in that paper so I'm just going to pick up on a couple of the principles that he articulates and those are going to have to do with the fed's goals and transparency in its decision processes and I guess my remarks are also going to pick up you know and I will say even I cribbed from some of the the papers earlier in the day and thinking about how these goals have evolved over time so in particular I want to ask whether it's in the fed's power even to achieve all of its goals um and whether whether some of the goals conflict with each other and then ask about you know what we could mean by transparency in in cases where some goals are either unattainable or conflict with other goals all right so here's where I've cribbed from uh earlier papers so it's it's useful to come late in the day so the the it was very interesting for me to see how the fed's goals have evolved over time so when the Fed was first established as a number of uh earlier speakers have noted elastic credit was mentioned as one of its goals and part of this was just you know to take the seasonal out of interest rates which back at that time were a big deal and and also to act as a lender of Last Resort then after World War one and then even more during and after World War II the Fed was under a lot of pressure from the treasury to accommodate you know wartime financing so another another pressure um during the 1930s the bank runs added uh you know another another goal for the FED which would be to prevent uh runs on Commercial Banks um then explicitly that in 1951 the the treasury Fred Accord made price stability another goal and 1978 Humphrey Hawkins added Full Employment and then like there's more stuff too you could add you know you know growth and balance and a lot of other things are mentioned but this is this is a long enough list so I think the FED has suffered from Mission creep so you know you can ask you know as as an economist you know I still count equations and unknowns and and here I'm going to count you know targets and instruments so let's see you know how many targets and how many instruments we've got so you know the the uh the seasonals they seem to be completely taken care of I don't know how they do it but you know in my entire life as an economist I've never there's been plenty of discussion about interest rate seasonals you know never were uh you know the FED has done well with that um preventing runs on Commercial Banks so that was an issue and we just invented the F the Federal Deposit Insurance company to take uh to take care of that so that in the latest crisis runs on Commercial Banks we're not an issue um then there's to prevent or ameliorate Financial crises more broadly and we've heard a lot of talk about that so um and I would like to endorse you know Doug Diamond's comment about how what the fed's you know outstanding response uh during the recent crisis in in being Innovative about uh how to how to fulfill its lender of Last Resort uh function um and and then more recently adding stress tests hopefully to prevent future crises all right so far so good and now we've got price stability well we could use interest rates to try and Target inflation and then we have full employment and we have accommodating the treasury so now I'm going to maybe depart a little bit from um the earlier speakers and pick up on the last part of the subtitle for this conference and and start uh looking at the challenges ahead so uh two important challenges I think are going to be to deal with the sluggish recovery and and then to deal with the large you know outstanding debt and and ongoing deficits so I think you know pressure from the treasury is likely to come back now you can say the the latter is a you know it's a fiscal problem but um I think if we look at the EU area we'll see the you know the central bank's not going to be uh you know they're going to be drawn in so how are these uh challenges going to be reconciled with price stability and how much can the FED really do about full employment so I'm just gonna I'm gonna put out what I think is one scenario for why we have a sluggish recovery and and why I think you know maybe the fed's powers to you know uh increase the speed of the recovery are actually pretty Limited so uh as in any recession investment in the last recession uh fell dramatically investment is always the most volatile component of of spending um and it's it's re it's remained you know remarkably low so that's been where some of the the if you ask about the slow recovery much of it has been there now at the same time a lot of big firms are holding excess cash reserves so it doesn't seem to be an inability to borrow so here I've put a figure this is from a Tom Cooley and Peter Rupert have put together a whole set of figures comparing the current you know downturn with earlier recessions so what they do is for each recession measure from the previous Peak just the percentage gain in you know they have GDP they have various measures so here I've put a private domestic investment so the the blue line is the current episode and the other lines are earlier recessions so we have 1973 83 90 and 2001. so you see compared with the previous Peak the the fall was much steeper and and the recovery has has been much slower so this is just on x axis is uh quarters since the the the the peak all right so that's one fact um another fact is as you all know the U.S has been running large deficits in the debt to GDP ratio has been you know growing by Leaps and Bounds in the last few years and on top of that Social Security and Medicare are going to rise as the Baby Boomers retire uh recent Health Care reforms may add to the bill as well and so you know if you read the newspapers you'll know that you know the US is on an unsustainable fiscal course and and some kind of major reforms are going to be needed in the not too distant future okay so here I have another graph so this is the debt to GDP ratio so this goes from the line starts in 1939 and comes up to the present and with a peak you know right after World War II you see a rapid you see a decline uh the the uh and it got down as low as about 30 percent in 1980 and then it's fluctuated a bit and climbed pretty dramatically in recent years and you know we're not quite back at the post-world War II Peak but we're we're getting there um and there's also there's no consensus on what fiscal reforms should look like oops so how much should come from taxes and how much should come from changes in spending um and if we do it from taxes which one so there's a lot of uncertainty about what that fiscal reform is going to look like when it comes and Baker Bloom and Davis have constructed an uncertainty index there it is and you can see this index you know is kind of uh pretty low in the 90s and odds and then uh jumped way up during the crisis and has remained pretty high since then it's coming down a bit in the last year so I want to so so another hypothesis and again you can read about this in the newspaper is that that fiscal uncertainty is contributing to depressed investment there's a lot of investors have a lot of discretion about the timing of investment spending um and uncertainty of you know sort of large-scale uncertainty about fiscal policy increases the option value of waiting and so part of the decline in investment perhaps is just firms have a lot of projects on the shelf that they don't want to make decisions about until they see the resolution the fiscal uncertainty and this goes back to an early paper of governor bernanke's and you know my only I'm just going to say fiscal policy here's the source of the uncertainty all right so what does this have to do with the FED um much of the public including Congress seems to think that the FED can by itself steer the economy to full employment in Humphrey Hawkins this idea was kind of written into you know the law of the land so what's the what's the evidence on this point can the FED really affect employment um so uh to my mind there's it's it's it's kind of an asymmetric thing so I'll go quickly over over this so there's there's certainly evidence that in uh when central banks tighten rather sharply they can cause recessions so when have they done this it's to my in periods of high inflation the tightening is to bring down the rate of inflation and often if not always you you get a recession often a short one but um that there it is so uh there's evidence from Sergeant there's uh the the polka recession and it's hard to think of examples on the other side where a central bank Has Lifted an economy out of recession during the 70s I guess we tried it and it didn't work very well so can the FED do the job all by itself um you know Central Bankers are fond of analogies so I'll say you know being from the Midwest a good corn crop requires lots of inputs sunshine and fertilizer as well as rain and if you don't have the Sun and you don't have the nitrogen you know more rain doesn't doesn't compensate so you know the the FED can do its part but it can't do everything um so the FED can't do much to compensate for fiscal mismanagement and I would say that the uh the economics profession our contribution could be to you know try and at least inform the public and Congress about the fact that the FED has limited uh powers thank you [Applause]
