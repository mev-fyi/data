okay hello I am Raymond I am assistant professor of economics at the University of Chile and today I will present a paper on gender discrimination in consumer credit markets this is a joint work with Anna Maria Montoya Eric parallel and Alexander Solis so we thank the MBR summer Institute gendering the economic group for this invitation okay if we look at the gender gap in access to credit markets we will see that this is large and systematic especially in the context of developing countries um a natural explanation is the wage gap between men and women indeed the lower wages earned by a woman make them riskier for banks which limit their capacity to obtain loans alternatively gender differences may be driven by discrimination against women either statistical or taste-based and that would be the case for example if let's say two identical loan requests are treated differently by view two of the applicant's gender but gender by itself has no direct effect on the profits Associated to the loan request so the question here is how much of the gender gap in access to credits is explained by discrimination against female Borrowers the question is important not only because of normative implications but also because it can affect efficiency and those welfare for instance um a well-known results in economic theory is that taste-based discrimination generate inefficiency in the allocation of resources in the credit Market since in that case the approval decision of a long request is based on the attributes that are not related to the profitability of the loan request but on other things for example the gender of the individual on the other side statistical discrimination is efficient if this is an optimal response to an asymmetric information problem between the beliefs of the loan officers about the credit risk of the borrowers on the one side and the actual risk profile of those borrowers on the other side but note that statistical discrimination will be efficient only if the beliefs of the loan officers are accurate beliefs that is this follow rational expectations and are not related to gender preferences which may or may not be the case in reality so those are the resources of why it's important to study gender discrimination in great markets now identifying gender discrimination in credit markets is not an easy task you may imagine that there are full of unobservable here they are everywhere and we need a lot of data at the level of applicants officers loans and Banks for instance if we sign an NDA with a bank in order to access to key data we will probably have no problems to get data about the bank data about the long characteristics that were requested by the clients as well as the characteristic of the clients like for example demographics income debt collaterals and credit history which is typically what the banks require to evaluate a long request and of course all this kind of data is quite useful as a starting point but we're far from me in a in the ideal World indeed we will usually do not observe all the characteristics affecting the decision-making process of the loan officers who have a lot of influence in the final outcome um if we are lucky I mean at the most we can observe for example basic demographic characteristics like age education and experience of loan officers but traits like gender preferences gender beliefs are typically unobservable and given that these non-observables are simultaneously correlated with both the applicant gender and the one side and on the probability of approval on the other side then we will have a serious selection problem now the natural solution for this selection problem is to implement an Audi to study pretty much like in papers in Lego economics where people want to identify discrimination uh in accessing jobs by sending false CVS where the name the gender or the race of the individual is randomly manipulated here we could think on randomly manipulate the gender attach to the wrong request however this is quite unfeasible in credit markets since platforms like Experian TransUnion or Equifax typically allows the banks to easily identify false long requests by just looking at your tax identify number which is an attribute that you have to provide in order for the banks to initiate a process of loan evaluation so what's the solution that we Implement in this paper basically what we do is to implement uh a randomized correspondence a study but with male and female real borrowers where you don't have to randomize gender but just randomly design loan requests alone officers to each borrower so we will implement this correspondence to study um in consumer credit markets in the context of Chile we will recreate a number of male and female potential borrowers with similar characteristics who are willing to participate in this experiment and then we will randomly assign them different types of long requests with random amount and random length and then we'll ask them to submit the assign loan request to randomly assign Loan offers officers operating into landmarks so what's going to be novel in this paper first of all in our setting officers will evaluate experimental applications sent by real applicants in real time so this is something that has not been done before at least in the Discrimination literature in credit markets second our sample of loan officers we work in banks that represent more than 95 percent of the consumer credit transactions so that we can costly estimate for example where the efficiency costs at the industry level associated with gender discrimination third we have a battery of subjective measures an experimental tests that will allow us to elicit the gender preferences of loan officers and those for example tests for the presence of taste-based discrimination which is a critical mechanisms that may be explaining gender discrimination finally it's something that is interesting of the Chilean context is that here women have better repayment rates than men um so one hypothesis is that gender gaps against women is produced because of inaccurate beliefs about the repayment capacity of female borrowers so we will examine this hypothesis through an information experiment where some loan officers will randomly be informed about the better repayment rate of women relative to men and some others will not so the experiment will be helpful to disentangle the potential role of inaccurate statistical discrimination on the gender gaps in credit access so one of the key findings we obtained from this experiment first of all we find that there is gender discrimination against female borrowers on average we find that the women are 18 less likely to get approved loans compared to men this is a large effect we estimate that the foregone profits associated with this gender discrimination is on the order of six million dollars a year which is equivalent to the annual cost of hiring four percent of the loan office or flavor Force second we will find that gender discrimination comes mostly from male officers who have stated preferences for male clients suggesting taste-based discrimination we will also find that the information treatment didn't reduce gender discrimination which allow us to discard inaccurate statistical discrimination as a hypothesis now when we disaggregate the treatment effect by gender preferences of loan officers we will find that promale officers counter-reacted to the information treatment and indeed end up discriminating more against women not less and this result would reinforce us to take this the taste-based mechanism now of course this is an unexpected result and we will argue that our potential explanation is overconfidence bias on the part of pro mail offices um finally we will also find some evidence that competition reduced gender discrimination so let me now explain you a little bit how this experiment work in practice and then we can discuss the results so we first recruited roughly 400 potential borrowers willing to participate in a consumer lending experiment Each of which was incentivized with 15 dollars for their participation so these are young men and young women between 25 and 35 years old with very limited experience in the credit market and importantly these are men and women that had similar characteristics in terms of the attributes typically required by Banks to evaluate a loan request like for example demographics income debt collaterals and credit history so we then created roughly 1600 loan requests of random amount and random length and randomly assigned Furlong requests to each participant the loan amounts were between one thousand dollars and fourteen thousand dollars and the loan length was around between 12 and 60 more finally the participant had to send the four loan request via email to four different loan officers that were randomly assigned so our sample our sample of loan officers actually come from a representative survey conducted jointly with the National Authority of banking regulation the sbif we surveyed around two thousand loan officers and randomly selected roughly 600 of them for the experiment for the information experiment half of the loan officers who randomly assign the treatment method at the end of the survey and half of the other ones were not assigned that message so in total we have around 1600 loan applications that were randomly allocated to around 600 loan officers for an average of three loan application per loan officer so just to have an idea of how these operated in practice this is an example of a long request so it says for example Dear Mr or Miss X I am quoting low conditions I got your email I would like to obtain a personal loan in the amount of 5 million trillion pesos I want to reply to repaying 24 months this is my tax identifying number this is my monthly salary see I touch my wage settlements and social security contribution so note that the applicants here were not allowed to negotiate the credit conditions with the loan officers so that we take control of the negotiation capacity of male and female borrowers which may well be heterogeneous across gender so they just asked for a yes no response on the part of loan officers now in case officers required additional information then the applicants were mandated to just provide the required information and wait until the final decision so now let's discuss a little bit the results okay we have two outcomes of Interest here one is whether the loan request was responded by the loan officer or not and the other one is whether the loan request was approved by the loan officer or not so these are extensive margin outcomes we also discuss intensive margin effects in the paper like effects on the interest rate offered or the amount approved but of course all those effects are not Council effects because they are conditional on whether the loan was approved or not and that approval rate as we will see later is going to diverge across male and female applications so we estimate a linear probability model of each outcome against the female dining and we will control for a number of coverts including officer gender Bank fix effects loan amount long-term time fix effects a set of income and demographic characteristic at the applicant level and a set of demographic characteristics at the officer level all of them that is information that was obtained from the Basin survey to loan officers so the parameters of Interest here is beta a negative beta means that there is gender discrimination against women and they will observe is first of all that is 86 of the cases loan officers actually responded to borrowers that means that they evaluated the loan request and informed the borrower if the application was accepted or rejected note that we find no evidence of gender discrimination against female borrowers in response rate this is equal between applications submitted by men and women however on application on approval right sorry the story is quite different here we find that the approval rate is 6.4 percentage points lower among female borrowers so this amounts to around 18 of the approval rate among men so we are talking about a large gender discrimination of it now what are the mechanisms that may be driving the gender discrimination effects so for our first glance we ask loan officers to report the main problem they face when dealing with male and female clients so we offered at least with five types of problems like the clients have low repayment rates they are uninformed about financial products they imply excessive administrative duties they are difficult to communicate or they are too tough and require a quick response there is one problem with a woman that almost half of officers mentioned which is the least which is the last one in this in this table uh that female clients are too tough and require quick responses so this is not a reason that we may associate to statistical discrimination but more likely to take base discrimination now of course this is just the scripted evidence about beliefs and not necessarily implied taste-based discrimination so a more rigorous way to identify discrimination is to elicit the gender preferences of floating officers and that is precisely what we will do in the next step okay so to do so we asked the loan officers to report on the proportion of male and female clients that they would like to have in an optimal portfolio of clients so while the majority of loan officers reported neutral preferences 28 of them prefer more male than female clients in their optimal part five and we will call them Pro mail officers the question here is whether promo officers actually discriminate more against women or not but wait someone may prefer more male than female clients not because they have any sort of animals against women but just because they believe that Financial products that are typically required by female clients are less profitable than those required by male clients so to test whether promo preferences are actually driven by text-based attributes we will Implement a gift experiment were as a reward for participating in the survey each loan officer will gain two tickets to participate in a real Lottery that Raffles five iPads so the loan officers had the chance to use the two tickets or use one and donate the other ticket to a given colleague and we will randomly assign different names of colleagues half of which will be masculine names and the other half would be feminine names so the idea here is to test whether Primal officers actually donate less to female colleagues relative to their not promile counterparts and as we see in this table we will find that being Pro male is very much correlated with less donation to women colleagues but this is mostly the case for male officers as we see in the right panel of this table so the question now is whether male officers who are Pro male discriminate more against female borrowers or not here we have a graph that summarizes the relationship between gender preferences and gender discrimination and as we observe in the left panel most of the effect comes from male officers who have Primal gender preferences suggesting that the bulk of the gender difference in access to credit markets is driven by taste-based discrimination we further examine how the Discrimination effects are distributed across Banks and we find that banks with a larger proportion of male officers in their staff head counts are associated with larger level of discrimination against women so this is a result that reinforces the fact that gender discrimination against female borrowers comes mostly from male officers okay let's discuss now an alternative mechanism which is inaccurate statistical discrimination uh something that is interesting in the Chilean context is that the women have better repayment rates than men so one hypothesis that gender discrimination is produced because of inaccurate beliefs on the part of loan officers so we examine this hypothesis by implementing an information experiment where some loan officers were randomly informed about the better repayment rates of women relative to men and some others were not so the idea here is to test whether correcting the biased beliefs of officers can actually reduce gender discrimination against women so the treatment message was posted at the end of the survey and say the follow did you know that female borrowers pay more for consumer credit than males a recent report released by sbif shows that women pay interest rates that are on average 15 higher relative to those paid payments this is even though the same report also shows that female borrowers exhibit repayment rates that are significantly higher compared to mail Borrowers General discrimination against women may bring negative consequences for women who aim to access their Consumer Credit markets as well as for our economy as it might be inefficient and damaging for productivity here we have the treatment effects in we take the full sample we don't find any effect however when we disaggregate the results by gender preferences we will find that treated officers those who receive the message who are promale increased gender discrimination compared to the control counterparts as we see in the bottom row so of course this result is quite unexpected and one potential explanation is overconfidence bias as suggested by hadus kuzadi and struck in a recent paper the story here is that promale loan officers um have self-serving views about discrimination so they they will overestimate the degree of discrimination against any group whose preference are aligned with in this case for example male applicants but will underestimate discrimination against any group they compete with or are not aligned with like for example female applicants so what what happened here is that our information treatment goes against melbourworth so when Pro male officers received this treatment message they underestimate the message because it went against a group was preferences were aligned with in this case male borrowers and indeed counter reacted to the message and started to discriminate more against the opposite group in this case the female door was our results is not unique uh indeed it is consistent with Bonnet 2016 who shows that explicit Diversity Program in the U.S corporations have made between groups differences more failure which in turn have generated more discrimination against minority groups and not less and here again of course overconfidence bias on the part of discriminators arise as a potential explanation we will finally examine the baker's prediction that market competition decreased discrimination we have data on the number of local offices that banks have in its municipality so we can calculate the HH index on Market concentration for each municipality and then just test how gender discrimination behave across different levels of Market concentration and indeed what we will find is that market concentration increases gender discrimination and this is mostly the case of loan requests submitted to promote officers those who are biased against female borrowers so this is a result that is consistent with Becker's prediction in the sense that Less Market concentration that is higher level of competition will generate lower discrimination against women and this is because discriminators will be competed away from the market so just to conclude in this paper we showed that gender discrimination in access to Consumer Credit markets exist and it's quite large at least for the case of Chile we estimate that the efficiency cost Associated to gender discrimination are on the order of six million dollars per year which means that banks are basically losing money because of gender discrimination and know that our estimation of foreign profits is a lower bound since we're only considering credits from borrowers between 25 and 35 years old so as far as the effects are comparable for other H chords then the efficiency cost at the population level are expected to be much larger we also find that gender gaps and access to credit are likely driven by taste-based discrimination especially on the part of male officers we find that anti-discrimination information treatments are unlikely to be successful maybe we should try with different treatments oriented to directly reduce overconfidence bias also I think it seems important to understand what's the role of culture on the development of this discriminatory Behavior against women and so on finally we also find that in line with Becker's prediction we show that increasing competition appears to be an effective way to reduce gender discrimination against now it is important to say that our evidence is focused mostly on discrimination in face-to-face relationship between Banks and Borrowers well this is the way that most banks work around the world banks are increasingly adopting fintech Technologies and material learning techniques to automate the relationship with clients so the question is whether this new technologies decrease or increase discrimination against women some researchers are already working on this question and the evidence suggests that gender discrimination still persists behind the design of the algorithm so that bad news and this is certainly a very interesting venue for future research on discrimination in great markets and I think the research Community should definitely push more on that direction okay I will stop here many thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed the presentation and of course if you have any question or comment please do not
