um so this is i'm going to talk today about a new research conducted together with rick thompson and ting shu about how covered 19 affected talent flows to startups now the motivation for this paper is coming from a long-standing debate in fact about the role of entrepreneurship in recessions and one view with respect to the role of entrepreneurs in economic downturns go back to the cleansing view all the way to schumpeter arguably arguing that recessions are times of accelerated reallocation where startups are able to come in and disrupt existing incumbents however this view is coming under some pressure given increasing evidence that suggests that startups might be particularly vulnerable to economic downturns um and most of the art most of the evidence that points towards this vulnerability goes back to financing frictions where startup companies may be uh particularly struggling to attract capital and financing that may inhibit them from accelerating reallocation during economic downturns in this paper we are going to explore a labor channel that discusses how startups might be affected by economic downturns in terms of their ability to attract human capital and in particular we are going to focus on the changes that took place at the emergence of covet 19. so this question of how do downturns may affect talent flows to startups is at least theoretically ambiguous on one hand you may think that the emergence of coved may have increased workers risk aversion and that may have led to what we call some sort of a flight safety where job seekers and employees may have shifted their interests and preferences to join safer arguably safer companies in larger and more established firms but of course one could argue the alternative hypothesis here which is it could be the case that once covered emerged um then there might have been lower opportunity costs for employees where some employees may have lost jobs may have faced worse career trajectories and that may have increased their tendency to join uh riskier companies given the lower opportunity cost regardless of the stories the key issue in terms of resolving this ambiguity is an empirical one the key the question is how do we distinguish between labor supply from demand how can we identify whether or not employees preferences have shifted once coveted emerged there are two at this point standard data says that people have used in study labor outcomes uh one is to use employment data the limitation of employment data is that it basically captures an equilibrium outcome for example if startups are hiring less workers um in response to covid it is really hard to disentangle whether this is because the the hiring policies of the startups have changed that is their demand has changed versus the alternative story which we are interested in whether workers uh have shifted their preferences away from joining early stage companies an alternative source of data may rely on job posting data but again joe postings may capture particularly the demand side rather than allowing us to explore changes in preferences of job seekers and employees so in order to identify or explore changes in the supply side of labor to early stage companies we are basically going to rely on the novel data from angelis talent angelist is a platform that connects investors and startups and in particular they have this section that is of talent where it allows tech companies and particularly private companies and entrepreneurial firms to attract employees in tallinn now i should note that on this platform which is arguably the largest platform for private and entrepreneurial firms this platform also attracts um a wide variety of variation across the size distribution of firms so all the way from companies with less than 10 employees to companies like uber and facebook who are recruiting on the platform and the novelty of this data is coming from the fact that we are going to have access to the back-end servers of angeles where we are going to be able to explore the behavior of job seekers on the platform what do i mean by that i mean that we are going to at the emergence of carved 19 we are going to be able to see how job seekers have changed their search behavior what kind of companies they were looking for what kind of filters they applied for the job uh search they conducted and um and at the same time we are going to be able to explore what kind of applications they have what kind of companies these job seekers have actually applied to and therefore characterize how the talent pool um has essentially changed for startups during uh covey so before i get into details let me briefly tell you what we find we find that at the onset of covet 19 job seekers search for larger and more established firms at the same time job seekers seem to broaden their search criteria willing to consider lower wages and wider variety of job types roles industries and locations in order to be affiliated with these bigger and more established companies we find the job seekers shift their applications so it's not just in a search outcome but also the actual uh applications to companies are shifting towards larger and later stage firms and interestingly this effect is driven by higher quality candidates which i will specify later how we define these so all in all we find that relative to larger firm nasa startups are experiencing a decline in the quantity and the quality of job applications that they are that they are having access to even when we are following the same job posting over time so um controlling for any changes um in holding fixed the demand for the particular type of job that these companies are searching for all right so um let me illustrate briefly what this angeles talent platform look like so here's the search outcome kingshu is my co-author searching for a data scientist job in washington dc and one of the job outcomes is oroc technologies this is a basically an analyst job located in washington dc and you see here the the compensation in terms of cash but also the equity component of the compensation importantly the number of jobs on the platforms is more than is tens of thousands of jobs so job candidates or job seekers must filter how they are searching and these filters are quite flexible you can filter based on compensation based on the markets the type of job most importantly for our purpose the job seekers can search based on the size of the company they're interested in we're also going to be interested in this investment stage of the company is this a early stage company or a later stage company so let me show you so so we are basically going to be able to utilize this data to understand what exactly are the searches that job seekers are are employing on the platform in addition we're going to be able to see what kind of companies they actually apply for so the first set of results simply look at the size distribute the size of the companies that job seekers are looking for right after covid and here we're defining kovid as the emergence of covid um at march 13 which is the day in which trump announced um a state of emergency but of course um that's not necessarily the precise day that one would classify that but that's and now we will show this in figures to illustrate the changes as well so what we can see for example in column two in column two we can see that there has been a significant increase in the sizes of companies that job seekers are searching for on the platform i would note that first we're including here uh job seeker fixed effects so we're basically exploring changes in we are exploring changes in the search characteristics of users over time so we are looking within users so um and this reflects a roughly 25 increase in the average size of companies that were searched for once covered emerged in column four you can see that the tendency to search for companies that have um a size of more than 500 employees has jumped by more than 20 percent so here's a graph a figure that illustrates that visually you can see that around mid-march which is when um uh trump announced a state of emergency you can see that the average size of the searches of companies on the platform has increased dramatically now at the same time if while job seekers are shifting their focus on a particular or smaller set of firms on the market we find that job seekers are relaxing other search criteria so we find that in order to be affiliated with uh to identify uh job postings of larger companies job searches um job seekers are willing to engage with these companies um by through an internship they're more likely to agree to take an internship to become contractors and they're in fact willing to lower the minimum salary um that they're looking for and at the same time there are becoming less specific in terms of the numbers of roles dumber of markets and number of locations that they are willing to entertain in order again to be affiliated with larger and more established companies the evidence so far illustrates that significant changes in the searches the job seekers apply capturing their preferences and this measure captures as well as we can the labor supply side of job seekers now the question is whether it translate to actual changes in the nature of applications so and it does so what we find is that the average size of companies that receive job applications on the platform is increasing but interestingly the increase is actually concentrated among the more experienced and the more the higher quality uh candidates so what do i mean by higher quality candidates here we are relying on angelis score so angelis created this algorithm that incorporates the institutions the academic institution of job candidates their experience and the type of companies they work in to generate a score that ranks the quality of uh the job candidate and they're using that for their commercial purposes and what we find is that the increase in the tendency to apply for larger companies as you can see in column three is concentrated among those higher quality so we are partitioning here simply by the median you can see that the higher quality individuals are those that are shifting their applications towards larger companies these results also hold when we are incorporating um candidate fixed effects and then the results could be explained by the fact that maybe higher quality candidates may have more flexibility to apply to a wider variety of roles within larger companies or they may also have higher opportunity costs and therefore they might be more likely to avoid joining companies that are particularly risky when covered emerges the next um uh the next thing that we that i want to share is basically moving towards the startups and the firms themselves how the pool of talent available for these companies has basically shifted the first thing that i want to share is the changes in the volume of job applications and you can see that once covered emerged both early stage companies in red and later stage companies has experienced a decline in the number of applications per job posting however you can see that towards the end of march there is a divergence between late and early stage companies where early stage companies are experiencing a lower number of applications per job posting relative to later stage companies so these divergences coinciding with coffee 19 outbreak around late march now one would wonder you know even if the decline of the pool of talent uh is it takes place the question is how does the quality of the pool available for startups um is changing and what we find is quite striking so on the y-axis we are um plotting the the average quality um of applicants over time and you can see that before covid took place you could see that small firms are able to attract higher quality of job applicants when compared to larger firms however this trend is completely reversing once covered hits meaning that we see that there's a significant decline in the average quality of the applicants that are applying for smaller firms while larger firms find uh experiencing similar decline but this decline is actually quickly reverses and um increases and this is not the case this is not the case when it comes to smaller firms so what's how do we interpret the findings so we find a mechanism of flight to safety that job candidates are shying away from smaller and early stage companies moving toward larger and more established companies now this shift to arguably safer companies is likely to emerge because of changes in the beliefs that took place at the early stage um following the emergence of kavin just as a reminder we are capturing the effects really the first couple of months of coming before economic outcomes or real fundamental shifts has took place with respect to um the the companies themselves so we believe that most likely this shift is driven by beliefs of job candidates about the ability of larger companies to secure financing the ability to maintain product demand and and and remain employed within these companies now whether these beliefs are rational or irrational they're nevertheless represent and potentially uh capture the driving force for the mechanism in which downturns and particularly covet negatively impact the ability of startup companies to attract um um talent and and where we find that startups were facing smaller and lower quality pools of talent following the emergence of kobe so to conclude what we find here we uncover a labor channel that explains um the startups vulnerability to economic downturns so smaller nasa ventures seem to struggle to attract human capital relative to larger established firms once covered hits and we find that both quantity and quality of talent flows deteriorated and importantly the effect is mostly driven by the higher quality candidates and this is particularly damaging given the importance of human capital to new firms
