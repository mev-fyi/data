okay well thank you all for um for uh coming to the third session uh and i'm glad so many of you could uh stick around um so i'm pleased to introduce the panel for the third session on the social cost of unemployment um so let me just introduce the panel uh we have we're very fortunate to have greg ip who is the u.s uh economics editor at the economist moderating um uh for those of you who have not seen it he's the author of the little book of economics which is a great gift i've given it so i highly recommend it um we're also very fortunate to have joe altonji who's a professor of economics at yale he's a distinguished labor economist has worked in a variety of topics he's a project participant um in the cinebr project so he'll spend a few minutes talking about some of his work the next three panelists have something in common which is that they all uh had various roles at the department of labor uh so larry katz uh is at harvard university uh i'm sure you're familiar with his work at the department of labor during the clinton administration he was chief economist and uh uh i spent some time uh in that role uh uh under secretary solis uh and i i just would say that uh i think every chief economist has followed him as tried to emulate his his role in particular his success in bridging policy making with rigorous analysis and empirical uh support next we have ed montgomery who is the dean of the georgetown public policy institute i also know ed from my time at labor he was the executive director of the white house council for auto communities and workers so we just called him the auto recovery czar i'm not sure that's the term that was recommended though but in this role it was a really important role actually he spent um you know i think ed it's really appropriate that he's on this panel because i think he saw in that role uh firsthand um uh some of the uh uh effects of of of unemployment in these distressed auto communities he was just down the hall for me but i never saw him he was always uh you know in flint michigan or uh you know i think he must have spent most of his time uh working with uh officials in those communities and it made a real real difference he also served in the clinton administration as a as deputy secretary and then uh finally uh we have betsy stevenson who were all uh very happy could attend because she was just appointed as you i'm sure know to be a member of the council of economic advisors i think she will probably say this but she's not a member yet so she so clearly she is speaking for herself here but she also served as the chief economist uh so she's an associate professor of economics at the university of michigan and and served as the chief economist uh michigan she followed uh me there um and um i'm sure we'll be hearing a lot more about what she's doing in the next in the next year so uh just to motivate the the session i think one theme that has we've seen in the other sessions is what are the after effects of this recession what are the long run implications we saw that in the first panel to some extent at the level of the economy on the discussion productivity in the second panel we saw that to some extent on the role of government programs and and here the focus will be on people uh so two uh trends which i think are are are fairly uh pronounced in this recession are the weak uh very weak uh labor market for young adults um and uh the elevated rates of long-term unemployment and they both raise a lot of interesting questions as to what this means going forward uh you know in the case of young adults you know will they whether will the job career ladder be disrupted uh are higher rates of of educational attainment something that we should uh you know which could actually you know could that lead to positive effects uh for the economy economy through human capital accumulation and in the case of long-term unemployment um you know do we believe that looking forward this is going to have some you know tangible effects on the economy for years to come or not these are these are some of the questions that we will certainly be discussing in this panel and the topics of the papers that will be presented both by uh joe and larry so with that i'll let the panel begin thanks very much alex um i want to throw a little bit of current affairs context into this just because right now a lot of us including me are wondering what the federal reserve is going to do at its meeting next week because those of you who haven't been following the turmoil in the markets ought to know it's because they wonder whether the fed is going to announce that the benchmark for when they stop pumping money into the economy has been met which they say is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and all the commentary from the uh great eminences at the fed seems to suggest that yes there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook although after going over some of the material from our wonderful panelists here i have to say well it all depends on whose outlook you're talking about because it depends a lot on your age your uh the duration of your unemployment and apparently also your college major so we're going to hear a little bit more on this incredibly rich tapestry that tells us about what the labor market really looks like from our panelists we're going to start with larry katz and then we'll move on from there [Music] there we go okay great thanks so i'm gonna talk about uh what i think is one of the large legacies of the great recession which is um unprecedented at least in the since we've had formal labor market statistics that from world war ii uh rise in long-term unemployment and some of the implications of that what i'm going to talk about today largely draws on uh work um of which um um the old fogey i guess being brought here to present it but the real work was done by three terrific young scholars corey croft at toronto fabian lange and mcgill and matt nodo adigdo at chicago so the points i want to make are first the you know there's been a large increase in long-term unemployment much larger than in the early 80s deep recession and any way you look at the data the long-term unemployment situation looks quite different so what this graph shows you is it goes back as long as we've had you know basically standardized labor force data from the current population survey 1948 to 2012 and it plots um decomposes the unemployment rate the unemployed over the labor force into three groups the short term unemployed those unemployed less than sort of four months the medium term unemployed which are in blue in red which is 15 to 26 weeks and the long term which is greater than 26 weeks and as you can see typically in the u.s most unemployment is short-term unemployment it's people who've been unemployed for less than a few months and that blue line you know moves up in recessions it comes back down it was very high in the early 1980s um it did go up in the great recession but basically if you look where that blue line is if the labor market is the short term unemployed we're pretty much back to normal um you know by 2012 2013 the short-term unemployment rates not too different than it was a decade ago or even you know and sort of the 1970s you know and parts of the 1990s on the other hand if you look at that green line which is long-term unemployment really something different happened in this recession there was a massive increase and in fact you know in the depths of the labor market in 2009 2010 is the first time we've ever actually seen more long-term unemployed than short-term unemployed in the us and while there has been some improvement in the last few years it's still at unprecedented levels the long-term unemployment rate is still higher than it was at the peak in the 1980s recession and medium-term unemployment is still very very high so you know and if you look at the share of the unemployed you know it's basically you know there's been a little bit of climb but 40 percent of the unemployed now and remember uh people who are long-term unemployed and become disconnected um from the workforce drop out of this labor force definition so if we had a broader measure of long-term unemployed counting the marginally you know connected there's been a very big increase in the share of long-term joblessness that's not fully captured here and so the key short-term unemployments back to normal long-term unemployment remains at an unprecedented high since we've been measuring this and this is not some simple you know compositional mismatch sort of story if you it's not that all of a sudden there are more sort of less educated workers who have higher long-term unemployment or that you know um there's been a shift in the age structure of the population in fact every single group you look at you know less educated more educated old versus young men versus women people in manufacturing and construction versus services have shown sharp increases that have persisted in long-term unemployment you can't sort of get this out of some composition thing and it's so widespread that it sort of just looks like a really weak labor market not some simple mismatch story that you can tell so that's sort of point one the second point is um you know the next you know the next few points are why you should care and i think there are several reasons one is the you know there seem to be consequences of being unemployed for a longer period of time in how effective you are in searching and getting another job once you go to the end of the queue um the second is there are a number of puzzles in the labor market and the shift of this of composition of unemployed towards long-term unemployed helps explain it and the third is it's really really costly and i will get there so the first is if you look in the raw data and you plot you know people who are unemployed by how many months they've been unemployed and ask how likely is it that they transition into a job in the next month this is normalized so that the short term unemployed are sort of normalized at one but that number in bad times would be about nine ten percent and good times you know up in 20 25 what you can see is if you don't control for anything there's a very big decline um after you've been unemployed for six eight ten twelve months then sort of flattens out but the longer unemployed are sort of less than half as likely to escape from unemployment to get a job uh than the short-term unemployed even after you control for everything you control for in the current population service there's a bias known as you know negative duration dependence you know heterogeneity bias you can't make this go away very much and on top of that something hillary hoins mentioned just when i walked in at the end of the last session is there's now an some interesting experimental work this is from the work of my collaborators on their own without me uh that's forthcoming the qje corey croft matt nederwingdown finding a long game what they did is they you know sent out thousands of resumes that were identical across different labor markets with the only thing varying in them they had different high skill ones and low skill ones were how long your gaps were from being out of work and they had a large enough sample that they really could estimate this month by month and this really does look like something real not just some hidden heterogeneity you see a very similar thing from the experimental estimates of your likelihood of getting a call back on the first you know nine twelve months of unemployment it falls by about half and then stays there so once you've become long-term unemployed your likelihood of escaping from unemployment is much much lower and this looks like to be a real phenomenon not just some hidden uh heterogeneity on top of that at the same time we've seen this big growth in long-term unemployment we've seen a number of labor market puzzles which is this apparent outward shift in the number of sort of vacancies or job openings relative to the number of unemployed and that shift pretty much goes away if you plot it against the short-term unemployed you can very much and if you just run through any sort of model of how the beverage curve you know sort of evolves and how the composition of unemployment you can explain a lot of that outward shift just by the long-term unemployed seem to be you know quote less less effective or less attached to the labor market in moving into new job openings but there are a couple other puzzles that you know so one way you might look at this graph and sort of those escape rates is to say uh the the short-term unemployment rate's bad now back to sort of normal the long-term unemployed have sort of become disconnected um from the labor market that sort of beverage curve but you might have expected if sort of the market was completely sort of compartmentalized once you become long-term unemployed you don't affect anyone else or people don't think of themselves the other sort of two puzzles which i probably were mentioned earlier is the very low quit rate which suggests that even though short-term unemployment and the escape rate from short-term unemployment don't look that different than normal people are really worried about ending up in this long-term unemployed disconnected group and the second is while the beverage shift out we're not seeing like wages growing like crazy it's not like incumbent workers are not but they're both not quitting and they're not driving up real wages as you might have predicted if the short-term unemployment rate was a measure of slack so we still have a very very weak labor market um it's understated by looking at short-term unemployment because of the huge growth of long-term unemployment people out of the workforce and the likelihood of getting a job you know falls as you've been unemployed longer and the other key thing that we need to really worry about is we don't have the long-term cost of long-term unemployment from the great recession yet we have not been to observe these people 20 years out but we do actually have the long-term costs for much smaller cohort of long-term unemployed from the early 1980s recessions and from earlier and what we have learned is that it has very large and persistent cost work by people such as till von vocter and his colleagues dan sullivan have shown once you become long-term unemployed permanently lose a long-term job your earnings you know fall dramatically in the short run eventually you get back to work although not everybody but even sort of 15 to 20 years later earnings are 20 lower mortality rates um really spike early on when you lose a job in the big earnings and that's a persistent effect it's about a 10 to 15 percent higher mortality rate even after 20 years our best estimate so these are large social costs associated with becoming disconnected a very large share end up going on to the disability system and there appear to be important intergenerational impacts um on school performance of kids whose parents lose jobs and have persistent out you know there's a little bit of debate on how big those effects are and not all the experiments are well done but any even the lowest range estimates given how much higher long-term unemployment is now says these are potentially serious long-term consequences of the great recession finally where i want to conclude um is this is sort of speculative but based on i think a couple interesting uh new research findings which is you know trying to link this information on this you know the fact that the longer you've been unemployed the less likely you are to find a job with another fact that what this experimental study did which is what they do here croft langan noted with digdo is they look at in high and low unemployment markets and periods of time how quickly you escape from unemployment by your duration and what you can see is basically as the economy recovers there's a big jump in the escape rate from unemployment for the short-term unemployed but very little change so those if at people out beyond a year so even when in a lower unemployment economy they get left behind so if you are doing nothing active to deal and whether this came at the end of the session with the long term unemployed we're really looking at a group of people potentially dropping out moving a disability may be the only place ssdi they can go losing connection labor market it takes a very strong labor market so this is in the normal range of the 2000s you know it really takes world war ii late 90s labor markets to start generating job growth that draws in the long-term unemployed and those that get disconnected and i there are two other points so what this sort of suggests the other key recent research finding was not done in the u.s but it was done in france by bruno crippon esther deflow and several co-authors an amazing study they did in france in which they basically got to randomize among 250 different metropolitan areas in france about doing active labor job search assistance and wage subsidies for getting young people hired in some labor markets a hundred percent of the people got access to the services some 75 some 50 some 25 some zero so what you can do that we don't normally do even when we have a randomized control trial is if we find we give service to someone and they find a job faster we don't know whether they just you know beat out someone else for a job and didn't change aggregate employment because they changed the aggregate rate that they were doing that you can look at the aggregate effects of trying to do active labor market policies and what they find is in a deep recession when labor markets are weak it's really musical chairs if firms aren't expanding if you help one person find a job more quickly than another you basically just displace someone else the spillover effects are negative as an economy recovers then the labor market's tight as we're doing it becomes tighter this becomes helping firms expand quicker than they would have otherwise so you can actually you know improve net employment outcomes and so what i think this implies from the recent research as well as research suggesting that unemployment insurance and a deep recession largely keeps people connected to the labor market is income support through unemployment insurance is essential as an economy is in a recession active labor market policies are good things to do build up skills but don't believe it's going to have much aggregate effect as the economy recovers you need to tilt towards getting much more aggressive on active labor market policies the types of things gordon berlin was talking about we don't know for sure things are effective we do know a lot of things from job search assistance to certain training programs seem to have micro benefits that outweigh their sort of costs in raising employment and earnings and we now have sort of aggregate evidence that seemed to be net gain so we ought to be shifting more investment not cutting back as the economy recovers into active labor market policy it looks like they'll have higher social returns is what the new experimental research i think is suggesting and so while we are facing huge costs of long-term unemployment they're going to be much worse if we just passively accept them rather than trying to actively deal with them and i don't know whether that's politically feasible i think it's a huge open an important issue to be looking at going forward thanks very much larry we'll hear from joseph altanji now okay sorry i'm terrible with touch pads i tried f5 it didn't it's a control f5 control l right okay that's right it's not powerpoint thank you okay um uh well as you can tell i i was chosen to present this on the basis of age alone and not not my speaking skills or my expertise or my skill with the computer um but i'm very happy to be here um so uh what i want to do is talk about um uh entry conditions uh uh at the time of college graduation and how that how that affects early careers and again in thinking about the the the cost of recessions clearly people are going to have have a harder time getting a job at a point in time but we also in thinking about them really have to consider the extent to which the effects linger and um so that's what uh that's that's what we uh we talk about in this work um and again it's with lisa khan um who's uh one of my colleagues she's in the school of management and jay midspeer who's a graduate student at yale in the economics department so the questions are what are the long uh what are the labor market consequences of graduating in a recession um uh that's kind of in some sense the main question um but we we focus a lot at how these effects differ by major and in the interest of time i'm going to primarily talk about characterized majors based upon how well-paying they are so that'll be the second question um and the third is are the losses larger in recent years and the answers to that question is yes they seem to be quite a bit larger over the in the last two recessions so just a little bit about the 30 seconds about how we actually do this basically we throw data sets at this problem um uh we essentially uh look at the problem over a number of booms and bus 1976 to 2010 um using data sets that have information on college major as well as uh labor market outcomes um and basically we we estimate regressions of earnings on the national unemployment rate at graduation by college major and experience level and rather than look at individual majors like sort of study engineering or teachers we characterize majors with some continuous variables um uh the one i'm going to highlight is the essentially the the log earnings premium so something like the percentage difference across majors in in earnings and i'll also mention some results with average sat math score um so uh i'm going to turn to the results now and beginning with looking at this long period of time 1976 to 2010 and on first talking about the effects of a four-point rise in graduation unemployment rate so that's the unemployment rate around the time of labor market entry on the earnings pass of college graduates so this graph kind of summarizes our results the uh the blue line is earnings um the uh horizontal axis is years since uh since graduation beginning at you know one and we i'm showing you through 10. and the horizon the vertical axis is the percentage difference in earnings relative to what college graduates would get when the unemployment rate was at its average over this over this whole sample period and um again we're looking at the effect of a big change in unemployment four points is is big the unemployment rates in our sample range from 4.2 to 9.7 so it's within the range of our data and it's something like what you know just happened to the economy um and what you can see is that um looking at the blue line is that um earnings are lower by a little bit more than eight percent and um and then sort of you know kind of recover over the first few years in the labor market um the the the graph shows a downturn and we actually use data out to about 13 years and basically things sort of level out uh with a small loss uh in the in the out years um and uh for wage the red line is pay rates and that's wages and and we show even larger losses there um with again similar recovery um i should emphasize that there's a fair amount of imprecision in these estimates and i thought i just can't really do that in five minutes or maybe in this forum but i want you to keep that in mind um just a couple of things about some of the details um the effects are similar for men and women in terms of the path but they're stronger for men if we use the regional unemployment rate rather than the national unemployment rate we get a little bit smaller coefficient a lot more precision but basically the same pattern of results the effects we thought they were one of the things to look at is whether college graduates just get worse jobs if they graduate in a recession in my heart i still think that but we could not find evidence for it in looking at um the occupations that you know we're looking from the data um the effects are smaller for full-time workers um but those and the probability of being full-time falls a lot early and then recovers quickly um the effects i showed you on earnings are a mix of earnings and appear to be a mix of wage rates and and earnings even though there's some inconsistencies in the individual results for say earnings wage rates employment okay so now what i want to do is turn to kind of the second question we asked which is so what do these losses depend upon um the major there obviously a lot of ways you could look at major and there are a lot of reasons why they might well well differ but let me just show you the results and maybe we'll have a little bit of time in some of the discussion to to talk about the possible theories so basically the green line is a high premium major so what's high premium it's a major that's one standard deviation so we compute earnings differences for all the majors then we compute the standard deviation of those majors and the high the high one is one standard deviation above people in those majors earn about 17 percent more than the average the low premium those are majors where you earn about 17 percent less and what you can see is that again over this long sample period um all uh you know the red line is the average it's basically what i showed you and what you can what you can see here is that the um it's the lower skill majors or at least you know define it as as as lower pain especially with all the journalists in the in the audience um it went right by the table that showed me earnings by by major um and um the uh the the so what you can see basically is that the low premium have bigger losses and and then recover and if you look at the high premium it's somewhat smaller okay um a couple of more results we did the analysis by sat math scores and it kind of echoes what i just showed you and we've actually been looking at other characteristics but i'm going to to not talk about those for lack of time now the results on how college major affects how people do as a function of unemployment rate are different for men and women um uh women the these these effects of being in a high paying major are bigger for women than they are for men and um in fact in this for the whole period women aren't really hurt that much by unemployment at the time of graduation if they're in a high paying major and uh so there are some gender differences that we don't completely understand yet okay so we we have looked at a couple i think reasonably obvious mechanisms um one of them has to do with the occupational specificity of a major so nursing is the most occupational specific major we can that we found in terms of the fraction of of nursing graduates who are nurses accountants is another high one um teachers is another high one um what we found is that this you know sort of matters for some of the things but it doesn't really explain our results we also try to get major specific measures of demand um and um uh so far we can't really account for much of our results uh with those okay so what i want to do now is turn to the recent period and show you um uh earnings and wage effects uh show you that they are larger in uh the recent years so basically what we did is we augmented our models to allow for changes in slopes in 1998 and and and then use those to to evaluate um uh uh earnings and wages for the later cohorts and um the overall results are in this table here and and what you can see is the losses are much bigger early on uh for in this most recent period that that says that if you graduated in a recession in the 2000s again we had the 2001 recession and and the great recession for the same change in unemployment you do worse so here i'm showing an extreme change four points and um earnings are lower by 26 um if you graduated you know that was the uh if you graduate in in this high unemployment time versus say graduating in the in the mid 80s um or the late 90s um and uh for for wages as you see the same pattern wages are are also lower now we only go out seven years because we we really don't really have data on the great recession um far enough to kind of find out what the long-term consequences are going to be so we really don't know what what they'll be but we go out seven years you can see there's mostly a recovery okay my final graph looks at the effects of a shift in in unemployment on the low paying and high paying majors in this 1978 1998 to 2010 um period um so the um there's a reversal here first the main difference thing is that basically the major you're in doesn't really matter that is that basically conditions got worse for if you know in a weak economy all college graduates did worse and it doesn't matter that much what their major is and if anything the low premium majors actually did a little bit better in this more recent period um and um you know again we're currently investigating this we don't you know completely understand it but i guess the again you want to see that though the overall the size of the effect is much larger um in in this later period minus 25 the time of labor market entry okay um so i'm going to speculate a bit um uh but as i said this is really at this point we're still trying to figure out what's going on here um why are the why are the recent recessions different well the recessions differ in the industries and groups that were the most impacted um 1981 1982 1991 there's a lot of effects in manufacturing construction in 1991. college graduates might have been more sheltered 2001 who said dot com boom had big effects on on for example engineers who you know pay or paid well um and uh and and uh people people i t people it may have just been a had a broader effect on college graduates um 2007-2009 was very broad-based unemployment doubled for you know for almost every subgroup including college graduates okay um so again that's we we don't completely understand um the the uh the you know the difference in the periods and what we're looking at so what i think i'll simply do is so what have we found if we found that when you graduate in a high unemployment time you don't just have low earnings for a year these effects persist for a while um secondly over a long over looking at a bunch of recessions they people in high paid majors suffer less in a recession than people in low paid majors the most recent period the consequences of a one-point move in unemployment or a four-point move seem to be bigger in terms of these early labor market outcomes and and now it doesn't seem to matter as much what the major is so let me stop thanks very much those are two really great presentations but they also went on a little bit longer than we had scheduled so betsy and ed uh we'll hear from you uh both next but if you can try and keep to five minutes that would be fantastic those were great papers and i really enjoyed reading both of them um so i what i wanted to do was actually just give a few random comments um on the social cost of the labor market of some of the changes we've seen in the labor market and speak uh hopefully a little bit uh complementary to what's just been presented while staying under five minutes um so um i should also alex said this for me but i'm gonna just reiterate that uh actually what was announced was the intent to appoint me to the cea i am not officially appointed i am not at the ca i'm not speaking for the cea i'm just a lowly associate professor of public policy at the university of michigan telling you my nerdy academic thoughts um so um let me just start by reminding you um and i know you don't really need this reminder but it always helps me to put it in perspective of what really what happened to the job market so we saw a massive increase in both the job-losing rate and a decrease in the job finding rate that seems sort of obvious that's going to result in high unemployment but it is important to keep in mind that when we we saw this massive change in the labor market that came from both things people were losing jobs and they couldn't find jobs unemployment duration is particularly high which is what larry has spoken about um unemployment rose most for men minorities and youth which is typically what happens in a recession and perhaps a little more exaggeratedly so in some ways in this one but pretty typical in that unemployment is higher than what we expect given vacancies that's the plain english way of saying that the beverage curve appears to have shifted outwards and government job loss is unusually high i really want to just emphasize that government job loss is unusually low high so one of the things that i did was just you know you can take a look at different periods i just decided i was going to look at what's happened to the labor market in the last five years um and in the last five years we're still down about two million jobs when we look overall at the labor market and that's 635 000 government jobs so we're substantially we've lost a lot of government jobs and that is not a typical pattern in fact it's an unusual uh unprecedented pattern for so much loss to be happening in the government sector and a recovery so what are the labor market issues that i see are that i you know i think about are as being potentially important it gets harder for workers to find jobs the longer they've been unemployed and that's what larry just spoke at length and eloquently about we've had this rise in long-term unemployment that is uh a reflection of duration dependence and that i i think the most telling slide he showed and is the fact that there is employers don't call you back as frequently if you've been unemployed for a long time and that that for whatever reason is that whether it's discrimination whether it's those people have lost skills whether it's statistical or re or animus it's a problem and it's a fact of our our labor market participation rates are struggling and economists don't have good explanations for why and i think that's because there's a lot of reasons why we've had we've seen labor force participation rates declining and i'm going to show you a few slides and i'm going to do something that i think may have never been done before in a conference which is i am going to show that the speaker from the first session was a little bit wrong and now that's done all the time but it's not usually your domestic partner um and uh the um [Laughter] um so a i thing that i would like to flag um that really concerns me enormously as the churning in our labor market has slowed and that's not about this recession that is a longer-run phenomenon um and i'm going to show you a beautiful graph put together by john haltoanger which has been making this point i think heroically and uh it's i think very concerning and uh and yet we also have workers flowing into unemployment with high durations that are inflating and i put this in quotes are measures of long-term unemployment so what do i mean by that what we see is people disappearing from the unemployment rate so they tell us they're unemployed they've been unemployed for say 28 weeks and then the next month we know they are not in the labor market or even employed sorry the next month in the cps and then just one month later they're back to being unemployed and they um using their individual judgment as people filling out the survey then tell us that they've been unemployed say 29 uh months instead of our 29 weeks instead of telling us that they've just re-entered unemployment from the previous state they were in um that is i think very much their prerogative but it is certainly not what the bls intends them to say if you leave unemployment for any reason whether going into not into the labor force or into employment when you return to unemployment you're sort of starting fresh but we're seeing a lot more churning and i think we don't have a good understanding of whether people what it is that what we're seeing that kind of churning where people are exiting unemployment for very brief periods but it doesn't feel like a real change to them and i don't think we really have a good sense of what they're doing then large cuts and public sector government are reducing investment so i already told you how big the declines in the public sector are i'd just like to highlight that i think that we are going to reap the the returns to that the negative returns to that um in the coming decades because we've seen enormous cuts in public sector that are really investments things like cutting teachers and then the last thing i want to talk about is the fact that high unemployment leads the public to lose trust in institutions so those are sort of my main uh ideas and now i only have a like two minutes left so what i want to do is show you a few graphs uh to bolster some of those uh so larry already showed you the fact that unemployment the duration dependence and i commented on that a bit so let me let me skip straight to talking about participation rates are struggling and economists don't have a good explanation for why so here's the long-term look at labor force participation rates and what you can see is that men have been declining leaving the labor force for a very long time basically as long as we've had this data they've been leaving the labor force and what we typically see in a recession is that it's an acceleration point at which men leave the labor force and then they sort of come back in um and sort of depending on the recession either flatline or decline at a slightly lower rate till we get to the next recession where there might be a little bit of an acceleration in their declines but the uh women on the other hand have been increasing their labor force participation since 1950 when this starts up until about 2000 and then labor force participation flatlined now as you know for both men and women labor force participation has really had a marked decrease in this recession and i think you know there's we really don't have a good handle on that we know there's some age composition stuff going on and that's what justin talked about a little bit earlier um there's some baby boomers who are exiting the labor force but it's certainly not all compositional and uh the uh the thing i wanted so what i want to do and this is to now show you by age labor force participation rates in the very recent period by men and by women and uh what you can see here are 25 to 34 year old white men and women men are the solid line women are the dotted and now their scales are on the right in the left side so these are obviously not the exact same labor force participation rates but i really wanted to blow it up so you could uh look to the scale and read the number if you wanted and what you see here is that you know coming out of that 2001 recession there was some recovery in young women's labor force participation rate and that's been completely eroded and there's no sign of any recovery in their uh labor force participation rate um in the last three years and uh men's what do you want to call that little uptick uh a recovery or not i'm not sure but really you see lower labor force participation for both of them now let's look at 35 to 44 year old white men and women and now you just see something that's just been mostly headed down again for women it seemed to have stopped the decline stopped coming out of the 2001 recession um but that picked up going into 2008 looking at 45 to 50 year old women and men again white men and women uh what you see is uh you know for women not much going on before say 2007 and then this big decline for men the ongoing decline now we flip it and what we see is 55 to 64 year olds and this is why why the compositional effects of labor force participation are getting so confused is because old people do participate at lower rates read off those numbers and you'll see that labor force participation when we were talking about 45 to 54 year olds we were talking about numbers in the 80s and 90s high 80s for men uh mid to high 70s for women and now we get to 55 to 64 year olds and it's uh in the low 70s for men and uh high 50s for women but these numbers have been increasing and what they did in the recession was really to sort of flatline and then here's 65 and older white men and women which has been just been on a straightforward upward trajectory so we know older workers are working more and this has been something that's ongoing so this is not a story that older workers are working more because they lost all their money in their recession i think i hope that this has to do with the fact that we've had the health improvements that allow us to work more as we're a bit older but why is it that this differs once you break it down by gender well let me give you just a little bit of tell you what's been going on more in aggregate in terms of these changes so i told you that we were down two million jobs um since five years ago well that's down 400 000 jobs for women and 1.6 million jobs for men so what that is is a shift in the labor force from from men towards women we we also see that uh that the the shift has really been women lost uh lost jobs in government and men lost jobs in the private goods producing sector and so there are these sort of compositional shifts going on about who's working where uh that i think make it hard for us to make it really hard to get a good handle on what's going on with labor force participation one uh last thing i wanted to i know i to to let me skip because there's one there are two things i wanted to show one is just as i mentioned i think this very important fact that there's less churning uh in the economy overall and this is a graph from john haltwenger which shows job destruction and job creation basically both on downward trends over the last 20 years and this is really worrisome because what it says is if we're not churning if we're not moving about we're not going to have workers allocated in the most efficient way possible so i think that potentially leads to important problems in the economy now the last thing i wanted to tell you is that justin and i did some research um a little bit ago and what we found was that there is an important social cost of high unemployment that often gets forgotten and that's that high unemployment is associated with declining trust in public institutions that's trust in our government so the massive distrust our public has in our government today is not a coincidence with the high unemployment we have but actually caused by the high unemployment so we looked at institutions like congress banks major companies the supreme court the press and you can see that as the unemployment rate rises our trust in congress banks financial institutions major companies declines including our trust in those people so um and let me just say that trust is pro-cyclical around the world and it's uh pro-cyclical across states so this loss and trust is something that uh happens is happening that happens consistently and we should think of as one of the costs of of high unemployment thanks thank you very much um ed you may you may indeed make it quicker um so one i i think uh joe and larry for the the great papers i thought they were very interesting i guess having sat through the the macro session and and and then hearing these guys present i'm struck at the contrast between the macro economists who all claim that there is no mismatch there is no long-term problem uh it's all uh a drop in an output and if we get output up everything will be back in hunky-dory and the perce presentation's here which suggests that there is there are some long-term consequences that we need to worry about uh both in terms of earnings growth uh paths for college graduates and uh for the long-term unemployed uh no those findings can be reconciled but i i worry to degree the the popular dialogue uh seems to treat this as uh no no no need to worry about anything other than waiting for output to come back because i think there's some some serious long-term consequences showed out here um uh i think well one of the interesting things that did come out of the the macro session and as reinforced here with larry's discussion about uh labor market policies is institutions matter uh olivier blanchard uh presented some very interesting findings looking at uh the the countries across countries who experienced the biggest increases in unemployment and it was clear that the countries who had active labor market policies to share jobs were able to keep unemployment from rising so it mattered on the upside and then if i tie that with larry's finding uh suggesting that uh some form of active labor market policies uh on the other side can be positive in terms of reducing unemployment uh i i come back to the conclusion that institutions matter the government is not impotent uh when it comes to intervening out there and so we should keep that in mind as we hear the policy discourse uh coming from the hill uh uh that would suggest that it is and that we really should keep our our hands off uh and i think this both illustrates pretty strongly uh that there are some powerful ways uh i'm struck by two other things uh one um betsy really illustrated the importance of disaggregating things by gender uh and uh when i do that thought experiment on on joe's paper i'm struck by uh tying together the his finding that men typically suffer more in a recession from earnings loss with uh the fact that across recessions uh it appears that currently uh the aggregate effect for college graduates has gone down but we do know that the share of college graduates that are women have gone way up and so we and rather than the aggregate effect going down we should have been expecting it to be rising so why isn't it rising and similarly uh you have the same kind of anomaly when uh you look at uh relative earnings effect where he says all of the relative earning effect uh women have a much bigger relative earning uh power from i mean sorry for being a higher skilled college major uh but again if you increase the composition of women who are college majors you should have uh then expected uh that that uh in recent recessions that that relative uh effect would be bigger and in fact you say there's none in recent recessions so uh uh uh i'm wondering uh what's the interaction on on the composition uh one of the things i've been puzzled maybe you guys who are far more expert than i uh is to what degree is uh our comparisons across recessions really driven by what i think is really the anomalous period the 1990s uh and when you put the the 1990s recovery in the pre does that change all of our our thinking about uh pre versus post uh i i was going back and looking at a nice paper by uh larry and olivier which was done in the early 90s looking at hysteresis and regional labor markets uh and we were worried about this sort of uh content each recession ending with a higher unemployment rate than one before and the 90s the one that got array with it but if you take the 90s out and then you look at 2000 and you look at 2007 we're back to that same kind of pattern so i i i just throw that as a thought experiment how much of our conclusions about nothing happening or the the structure of recessions now versus old is driven by the fact that we count the 90's recession which really uh over the course the last 30 years a very unusual period so uh to try and stick within the time frame uh and make you smile i'll stop there not only did you stick within the time frame you took all the questions away that i was going to ask um i will i will try and come up with a few however just to make myself feel useful um i think the first question i do want to ask is that we are in washington so what does the policymaker do in response to all the information here larry i think you said that um action mark active labor market policies simply are a game of musical chairs during the downturn but they're helpful during the recovery are we now at that stage in the recovery where active market policies can help more specifically what sort of active market policies for example the administration has previously proposed hiring credits and other special treatment for employers who hire people who've been unemployed for a long time or people from groups that have less labor market attachment and italian joe's research is improving college or educational attainment the sort of active labor market policy that would help and i look out for everybody if you have a offer a few thoughts on those okay so you know i think that yeah we are at the time where we ought to be thinking you know about doing more on quote active labor market policy i would sort of make you know i'd want to first sort of try to connect the macro and the and this session and then relate it to that question which is i think the what the macro is saying is you know the big shock is we had a really deep recession financial shock and we're still feeling the aftermath of that you should not think of the build-up of high unemployment and long-term unemployment and the lack of young people being able to get jobs as some new structural problem of mismatch colleges aren't putting out the right type of people the long-term unemployed just don't have any skills that were ever valued in the labor market this has been caused by weak demand from the aftermath of a financial crisis and a great recession that doesn't mean that if you just leave it like that and for 10 years have a weak economy that it won't have some structural consequences of building up long-term unemployed of young workers not getting opportunities for first jobs so there's i don't think there's any contradiction between we have a macro problem that was set off but if it's left you know to fester long enough it will create structural problems so number one on the policy side is we you know and it's a non-sequitur but we should stop self-inflicted wounds from what betsy was showing of cutting back on you know sort of government and sequester and that you know what what the evidence of active labor market policy is saying is it's sort of complementary with macro expansion or if you keep the economy fully depressed it's more like a musical chair game if you get more momentum um through you know on the fiscal side through things potentially like a net employment job creation tax credit you can then combine that with things to sort of more target the long-term unemployed whether it's some direct hiring whether it's job search assistance whether it's some of the training programs we're getting positive estimates some versions of sectoral employment training programs where you work with local employers of what jobs they're having difficulties filling and work with a community group a community college to try to set up training for that where there's both potentially a short-term you know set of skills that are valuable but you're also picking up broader things that have long-run value so i think we have a number of places like mdrc and others have done a number of very well done evaluations suggesting there's some promising aspects and this new work on france and some earlier with the u.s suggests that it's complementary with a stronger expansion but if you continue to have a very weak aggregate labor market it becomes more like musical chairs so i think we should view these things as complementary you shouldn't view we have structural problems therefore we don't need to worry about macro but you also shouldn't think that if you just do macro i think there is a lot of evidence many young people and long-term unemployed will still be scarred from what's happened over the last five years joe um so i guess the the one i wanted and i'll come to ed's comments in a couple minutes but i think the one one policy um is uh policies that perhaps um make graduate education um a better option certainly the opportunity cost goes down when the short-term labor market prospects aren't as good um actually in our work we were looking for that as a response and have didn't haven't found uh we were a little bit surprised not to find stronger evidence that people would we're increasing enrollment rates or increasing educational entertainment in response to recession but that seems to me to be one you know certainly one one policy um and a bit of a problem maybe less for graduate education is that uh for for lower levels is that the funding for community colleges is you know is is uh pro cyclical basically so um uh you know there's a difficulty there did you yeah i wanted i yeah ed ed honed in on a couple of i think in particular on um the uh the gender differences that we find and and also how they relate to changes over time so let me just mention that that in some other work um uh that i've done uh with costas mcgear and erica bloom we've looked at the basically the trends in by by gender in major composition and and women did move uh larry's done a lot of work in this area women did move toward the sort of men's majors um kind of through the kind of mid 80s and then it sort of stopped pretty much so there are still fairly substantial differences in in the majors that men and women are in um we've we have that made some attempt to actually get major specific measures of demand by basically looking at what occupations majors feed into and then looking at changes in employment and unemployment in those we really haven't been that successful in explaining some of the differences that we have that's still kind of one of our working hypotheses but if and and again looking at the difference in over the whole sample and the and the more recent uh period um we want to look in more detail than we have so far at exactly the composition of employment demand and i can say though that if we allow the essentially these regression models allow the break to be almost any time before the great recession we get results that are qualitatively like we what we showed you um i don't think we've ever worked with sort of removing the 90s but it's not the 97-98 break period we get results like that later can i ask a question on this gender aspect when i look at you know the fact that there's differences by major i think well maybe that has something to do with you know what majors are in demand and maybe it has something to do with um how much work people have to do in each major and how much training they actually get in each major and then also who selects into which major based on how much work they're going to have to do so you've got you know really high uh hard workers going into some majors and slackers going into others so even though women may not be going into more of the male majors we know that on actually women do seem to be harder workers in college on average than men so if part of what you're picking up just made economics harder we'd attract more women oh well but if part of what you're picking up with your majors is just how hard working people are as it shifts towards women over time that effect will disappear because it's shifting just towards the harder workers yeah we find it for again i we find it for sat math um but there i actually i i as i think about it i can't quite remember whether we see this big change the i showed the first graph basically the high sat uh math majors don't suffer as much in recessions if you look over the whole period um so wait i would i should say and i think that the paper does say that um we know that it's not just the subject matter it's also the personality attributes and also the the the maybe general cognitive ability of the people who filter into these majors that's underlying uh the the results um uh so that's an interesting hypothesis isn't it possible that's the hardest working women who begin entering into the male dominated professions and as you reach parity the slacker women start to fall come along pull the average down all the women who were top lawyers were ruth bader ginsburg the question is they're replacing even worse slacker guys yeah it's clear that the marginal woman is worse uh today than she wants to pass but it's not clear that she's still not better than the guys so no compositional effects okay just just wondering ed did you want to i won't say anything [Music] um uh we'll start trying to get some questions from the audience if anybody has any questions if they want to uh yes right over there and if you could state your name and uh affiliation i'm uh gary burtless at brookings catherine rand paul had a story in the times earlier this week saying that there has been after a long period of pause an increase in the number of people enrolling but especially completing college and if that is due to the fact that the job market outlook for people who are 18 to 22 has deteriorated so far this would be a partial compensation for the fact that they're entering the job market in a really horrible time now but that would only be true of course if they're enrolling in institutions that are doing a decent job and enrolling in majors that are going to turn out to be ultimately useful so the question is uh we know that there's been an increase in the amount of time that people between 18 and 25 years old spend in paid employment what is the increase in the amount of time that they have been spending in college uh trained post post-secondary training institutions and so forth and and how likely is it that that is actually giving them useful training compensating them for the fact that this is just a horrible time to look for a job and and and find one say very good question i would for say that the growth um you know in the share going to college and right is you know it's a bit of a longer term trend than this recession it really mend out in cohorts born about 1960 i mean there's a real slow down from the sort of late 40s early 50s the early 60s color it's been growing for sort of you know 25 cohorts it's you know a little bit you know if you really look it looks like there's a little bit of an acceleration the great recession of enrollment it's not late enough you know we still don't know the graduation numbers but i think you know the labor market's been pretty lousy for young people for a longer period um the uptake is when the sort of returns to college really sort of you know were had grown in the 1980s and were becoming more visible and apparent so i think some of it is responses to lousy labor market for young people and college returns um much of the that early growth was sort of expanding you know state universities not the elite ones over the last decade a big part of the growth um has actually been the growth of the for-profit sector it's about 20 percent of the growth of bas uh since you know the late 1990s has been the for-profits we don't have great evidence uh we know people come out with a lot more debt who go to those we know that they don't do the same distribution of majors they're more likely in business and vocational things that could be good but they're also in lower quality programs we don't have very good estimates of you know the work i've done with david demi and claudy golden suggests they do seem to have lower earnings and higher debt burdens than people that go to other colleges we're not very good experiments to compare them to what would have happened if they didn't go on to the for-profit i think a big open question we know as as higher education has expanded we've not expanded the number of slots at berkeley and harvard and michigan we've expanded slots at community colleges at lower state universities and for-profits we know people have lower completion rates when they go to those schools they earn less but how much is selection and how much is sort of is a very open question where we don't have very good experiments we do know from some recent experiments you know students of joe's of like if you get into a four-year college the least selective in florida relative to a community college it really seems to have a high return and maybe joe has more to say on that yeah i guess just two just to follow up the angus the paper uh by seth zimmerman that uh um it was just mentioned has i think a pretty good kind of design um you know as progression discontinuity designed for the that that exploits a feature of the admissions rules um and basically these marginal what look like marginal students get about the same return as students who go to florida state university and it's interesting is that their alternative is community college so there does seem to be uh something you know there's just more value added to attending uh florida international um the the other thing i want to just mention very quickly is on the the trend in in in college enrollment we're maybe getting near the tail end of an increase in college enrollment that's coming from changes in in family background um so if you compare the the two the nosy 1979 cohort and the nls y in 1997 the parents of the nls y 1997 cohort are are a lot better educated and um this this you know leads has led to a significant increase in the college college attendance uh rates um maybe and maybe not as big but that increase going back to kind of uh larry's work is just not as large as you might have thought given the way the gap in earnings between college and high school has opened up bob samuels from the washington post two questions on the long term unemployed um a graduate student of bill dickinson's did a similar experiment of sending out um resumes uh that were identical with the exception of how long people have been unemployed and confirmed the result that they get the long-term unemployed get much lower call back rates he talked with a couple of hr people who suggested that one reason for this is that there are software programs that review these resumes and automatically kick out people with uh with longer durations and i'm just wondering whether or not you have any whether you can confirm that whether you have other explanations as to why they don't get call back rates the second question i have on the same group is people have been talking about this this group of people have been unemployed for more than six months but do we know what do we know about it is it is it all men is it all women is it all high school graduates or or or dropouts what is the composition of this group and does that suggest anything about their unemployment or is it simply a function of the fact that they've been unemployed for so long so first one is a great question why do we have this relationship and you know we have i know matt no to a digdo had talked to a nut worked with a number of websites um and employers and talked to a number and you know some of it is there is there with the growth of online applications and stuff you know there is this sort of issue of sort of clutter that places do and there are algorithms out there and it's certainly true that some places have algorithms that you know will kick out people for things ranging from gaps in employment experience and other stuff and there are you know people thinking about ways of changing the way you present your resume and stuff that might you know sort of game and you know getting attention um we have no idea what the aggregate con whether that's salient people at the highest tech firms that do this or this is a big part of the labor market but in general um you know this the sort of long-term unemployed being screened out shows up in u.s studies and swedish studies and israeli sort of resume studies whether you know i think you know looking at what you've been doing recently there are also some other interesting things moving job to job actually in the work sometimes looks worse than if you're cold applying going job to job then being short-term unemployed is actually one finding they have because it sort of looks weird why you're sort of doing it through a sort of general applying i think both being long-term unemployed and looking sort of odd moving why would you want to apply for this job if you have another job both seem to get up employers to think there's something strange and given they currently have so many applications they do do a lot of things to try to reduce that sort of clutter on some of the online labor markets they're attempts now of experimenting with ways to reduce this clutter and improving these labor markets by things like making people jump through some more hoops when they apply to show they're really interested in that job and serious and there's some evidence you know that odesk which is one of these large online that suggests that that may be able to benefit some workers but there is the the reduction in cost of a lot of applications have created issues that might exacerbate the problems of sort of statistically discriminating on things that may not be the most relative concept but we right now have snippets of evidence on that and you know not who are the long-term unemployed as i said you can't explain it by composition it's gone up by every group so basically it looks sort of proportional to groups that have had high unemployment so it's a little more men than women but not more than you would predict from the fact that men have more cyclical unemployment a little more minority than not it's a little more less educated more educated but the the rate has gone up to unprecedented levels in every single group so it's much more widespread than just a group at least on the observables that we see in standard data sets did anybody else um yeah well larry did actually such a great job on that um i but i i did just want to emphasize this you know why employers do this is that i think they're really inundated with applications and you know i it's it's worse because of the fact that there's so many people applying but this is not a new phenomenon that they're just now just like in the long term unemployed it's just that it's a really easy uh sorting way for them to screen people out and you know it's it's not good and it's not um helpful but it is helpful for them and remember finding people search is a really costly thing on the employer's side and we can't forget that that it is costly for them and you know that's why when back to the early questions or what active labor market policies could be helpful trying to reduce the costliness on the employer's side of finding good matches among the long-term unemployed would be the most you know an amazing thing for us to try to do and then just on that some of the most successful you know sort of job training active job search policies that seem to have effects seem to have the role of they provide real skills they help you search but they also are somewhat of an intermediary the intermediary builds up a role with reputation with employers and gets gets you through the clutter they know you have this sort of skill and they know they can sort of be trusted and and given the way employer screen thing that's one of the key roles potentially of active labor market policy is trying to you know be a little more using intermediaries to help people get through that that someone whose application might just not be paid attention to otherwise is the intuition behind the screening process that an employer assumes that if this person hasn't been hired by now that's there's information there but alan kruger yesterday gave a very interesting speech where he was looking at the role of rock and roll in economics i mean it was economics and rock and roll i can't remember but uh songs that are perceived to be less popular even if that is a random thing are less downloaded and maybe something happens to those who are unlucky enough to be unemployed by x months they're more likely to become unemployed for x plus one months and then so it goes so there's this old debate in economics of whether the fact that the long-term unemployed or less likely to find a job in the short-term unemployed is caused structurally by you know you become have less skills or employers won't look at you or it's just heterogeneity the mere fact of heterogeneity that you know any if there's any group that's sort of you know less less you know looks like a less good employee means it's an easy the existence of heterogeneity that some people you know will have not gotten a job because other people passed them up means that you'll create endogenously structural duration dependence because now employers won't pay attention to you because they'll sort of classify you as that type of person even if it was just a random you know you've got three bad draws with other people looking at so there's a we tend to think of this statistically of these two different things but i actually think there's a tight connection interesting between them uh eddie yeah ed lazier stanford uh let me just start by i wanted to agree with you larry and thank you i get promoted to being a macro economist but i also that yeah that was exactly the uh the point of view that i had was was that even if this stuff is cyclical if you stay out for long enough you create long-term problems um i want to follow up uh we're all talking about these labor market policies as if we we all agree and i'm not quite so convinced that i agree and and here's the question for you you guys did a pretty good job of answering at least starting to answer the question that i wanted to pose but if we look at the literature on the performance of labor market programs and you know there's a lot of literature on this stuff that goes back you know 40 years uh certainly you know start some of the stuff by bob lalonde where and most of that literature is not very positive in terms of finding effects of labor market policies on outcomes for uh disadvantaged workers so um i'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the nature of the the kinds of programs that you have in mind that you just did a little bit so thank you for doing that and then the second question would be on cost effectiveness because one of the big problems that you have when any time you do a government program is you buy the base and what i mean by buying the base is the standard thing you know you you get 95 percent of the guys that would have done the same thing anyway in order to get the five percent marginal effect and i i guess the question would be uh in the study that you cited larry uh that the flow and all did was there any estimate of the cost effectiveness of any of these programs right so in a high unemployment labor market because it had no net effect it clearly was not cost effective in a low unemployment labor market it looked like it was you know moving in that direction um you know they're out of accordance here i mean you know mdrc and you know there are a lot of out there so what i would say is if we just did business as usual and expanded your average a program and a state i would be very worried that we'll have very ineffective program if we if and this is a very big if we took the best performing states we took the models that seem to have you know basically look like they cost you know a few thousand bucks and then raise earnings by five thousand bucks you know for four or five years those clearly are gonna you know win benefit cost tests if they're not displacing others so i think we need to pivot towards i know the administration is well aware of this towards the things where we have you know real evidence of effectiveness cost effectiveness and try and the very big difficult thing is how do you shift the existing you know programs where we have really lousy performing a lot of this is in the details of performance evaluation systems what you're rewarding but no i don't think the ideal is just throwing money into the existing system i think we want to target it towards things and developing things that we have pretty good evidence and demand high standards of evidence for stuff to work and there are a lot of lousy programs out there but there is emerging evidence of certain patterns ranging from career academies and sectoral employment programs that look pretty promising with long run results that look pretty good did any of our panelists want to make this this will be our last question so if any panelists have any final thoughts do they want to i think i totally agree with larry that it's not clear that just doubling we as budget gets you where you want to go uh if i think about the the the dutch experience and some of the german experience tying the training with uh active labor market policy simple things like having the person who to which you have to report call in every week or did you really search seems to have a big effect over there on on whether people actually did search if you just do as we do passively you call in uh and nobody follows up it doesn't matter so you know marrying carrot and stick together in a more effective way i think the european experience would say they are able to drive down some of the long-term unemployment problems they have you know one of the things we know is cheap and and actually shows to be cost effective is these job search assistance programs that are combined also checking that people are doing what they're supposed to do to get ui and one of the ways that makes it so cost effective is that you don't get your ui if you're not doing what you're supposed to do and um but i i did just want to say when i think one of the things that's hard with cost-benefit studies is that you know trying to think about where you know adding up all the benefits because usually you know we might just be looking at say what are the long-term wages then for this person who goes through some program but not necessarily looking at is there an impact on crime is there an impact on some of the other social measures i mean you know frankly keeping people out of the disability insurance system um can save a ton of money so just reducing the probability somebody enters one of our other programs so you know needing to take a a broad look at that i i think has actually made it hard for us to have very good information on that cost-benefit calculus in any of the programs but i think everybody here is in agreement that you know doubling we is not the answer but i think that there are definitely things we can do that are cost effective uh before jim johnson jumps in i just want to uh first uh thank uh jim paterba for making this uh possible and it's also uh all of the mbr staff uh particularly rob shannon who uh was uh instrumental in in in the organizational effort and i also want to thank um karen dynan and uh economic studies at brookings for helping tremendously on the uh on on some of the outreach so uh thank you to them and i'll pass on to jim i just want to emphasize rob has joined us in the back of the room uh rob not only is part of the nber conference team which manages to somehow hold 125 meetings in various cities around the world uh during the course of the year but rob is actually the principal person who manages and organizes the nber summer institute uh which in only about three and a half weeks will bring 2100 of our favorite economists to cambridge over a three week period so rob thank you in the in the midst of this very busy time thank you for making time to join us and make this work [Applause] okay i i just want to say i mean this has been a fantastic morning uh thank thank you all for joining us and thank you to all of our moderators and our our panelists uh i i thought you know there are a couple of things that as a non-labor economist i thought i learned this morning first these are unbelievably important first order issues that we're talking about uh and the neat thing is that labor economics is just a really exciting field right there's lots of data the lots of facts we know a lot and when you spend four hours trying to bring the wisdom of what we understand about these things to bear on some of these policy questions you actually conclude that we really do shed some light on how to think about these these these challenges from the very top level of the you know what's the conceptual framework of the labor market to think about and use to think about the last few years uh to the nuts and bolts of which kind of program seemed to be more efficacious and more cost effective as as the last question was was addressing uh of course there's also a lot left to be done and i think that's uh you know an agenda for the future which is thinking about everything from the dynamics of the youth labor market to trying to distinguish the you know temporary temporary blemishes versus the permanent scars that come from periods of long-term unemployment uh to exploiting some of the differences as we move to more online labor market and understanding where where all of that goes and i think that that suggests we've got lots more exciting work to do going forward i want to close by thanking uh david card and alex moss for for organizing and leading this project and uh it and somehow at the end of it all it looks you know comes together beautifully and and it seems it's seamless and it seems like it's easy uh but in fact it's not and you know there were there were two crucial steps along the way in what they did one was to you know conceptualize what the problem area was and what what topics were going to be subject to analysis uh and the other was to line up just an all-star team of of labor economists to come together and address these questions and to knit the synergies across the different papers and different topics together i was struck by something really impressive as i thought about the the empirical work we heard this morning and remember that larry and alex were that david and alex were picking this project the set of project topics about two and a half years ago as this project got started there were questions that today and i think in particular about my discussion with eddie this morning on you know if you were asking the question two years ago about was this you know structural mismatch or was it was it traditional demand side stuff would you have known the answer you couldn't have known the answer then but uh alex and david realized that this was a question where you could tee up to have a paper written about that topic so that by today we might well have the answer and be able to address it and i think that's an incredible compliment to them as organizers and managing to figure out which projects were not just important but which ones were tractable so that we'd be able to actually uh get some real some real answers by the end of the day so i'm incredibly grateful to them for for leading this this has certainly been one of the most exciting and most important projects that we've done in my time in the last five years at the nber and i think it's just a great illustration of the wonderful opportunities for intersection between academic research and the policy world and those of you who hear from the various government agencies that are charged with not only tracking the economy but helping us to to better tee up for both the researchers and the policy makers uh the questions that we have so we are at this point adjourned uh there is a luncheon which is going to be on the far side of the little atrium here on this floor there are no there are no assigned seats so we hope that people will gather in in groups that enable them to talk about the particular issues that you're interested in but thank you all for staying with us for the whole morning this has been terrific have a good day good thank you
