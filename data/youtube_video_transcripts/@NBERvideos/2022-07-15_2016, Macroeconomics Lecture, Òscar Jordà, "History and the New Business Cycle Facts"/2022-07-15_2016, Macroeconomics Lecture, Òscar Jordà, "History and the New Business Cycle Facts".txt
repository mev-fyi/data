thank you thank you jonathan thank you marty for including our paper and the program uh i hope you have enough stamina to withstand another hour or so of uh more paper discussion this is joining work with uh moritz who is here to make sure that i don't screw up and alan who really wanted to be here but because of a family emergency if he isn't able to attend and because i have at least a partial affiliation with the fed you can see there in in really tiny font that i have to uh disclaim that these are my views or the views that maurice allen and i share but not necessarily those of the federal reserve system so the way i think about this paper is a little bit like an episode of law and order except you're just going to get the first half so in the first half of the episodes of law and order you get the cops collecting evidence and then the cops turn the evidence to people like you and you formulate the theory of the crime based on the evidence that we provide you and then off you go and you try your case and then that's how it works and so one of the reasons why we wrote this paper in a sense is because we came across a really nasty type of criminal which was the great recession so you know serial killers are easy because you have data very frequently and so that's that's really easy to prosecute you get a lot of data of similar events you say yeah i can build a case to to prosecute a serial killer but every now and then you have this sort of thing that it's hard to put your finger on and it happens so rarely and so unless you really dig down you really can't collect the data to to make the case and so that's that's really what got us started okay so um this is one of those papers that is really great to present because it's just the data there's no analysis there's a lot of speculation on my part and that's for you to decide whether it's work merits working a little harder in terms of writing models but i hope that you'll find what i'm about to present today somewhat intriguing so here's what what i'm going to basically come down to i'm going to show you a bunch of data on the long run and it's going to basically tell you that yes there's a lot more credit slushing about the economy now than there ever was in any point in history at least in the last 150 years but that's possibly not a wrong statement that's launching a round of credit and that turn of events that we see in the long span of 150 years we believe has important consequences for how we think about the business cycle and that's the part where i hope you'll find the evidence that i'm about to present somewhat stimulating um in particular i think that one of the things that's going to be of most interest is that in the post-world war ii era a lot of things change and they changed right around the time where we start thinking about the great moderation so perhaps you'll think somewhat differently about the great moderation you'll think that perhaps the way you thought about it all these years maybe needs revisiting maybe not we'll see so if i were to summarize uh the takeaway from this paper i i was just talking with moritz and i think hyman minsky has has the perfect take away and that is stability is destabilizing so that's going to be the takeaway of of the paper these run up in credit that we've seen in history seems to provide stability to economies volatility goes down even though growth goes down a little bit but it's also the case that it creates this higher likelihood of really negative events and so that's the sense in which stability is destabilizing is probably the right takeaway i'm going to discuss a little bit uh what are the consequences of this big run-up in credit for let's call it the domestic economy but i'm also going to talk a little bit about international moments as well and the theme there is that despite the fact that you think that credit would allow you to diversify it would allow you to smooth consumption more easily it would allow you to do all those things that we kind of teach in our introductory macro courses the evidence seems to go a little bit against that it seems to be that consumption correlates more highly with output it seems to be that there's less international diversification it seems to be that there's a higher equity premium and those things a little bit i think are hard to puzzle together and so i hope that that's the case that i bring for you to theorize about and formulate the case for the for the judge okay so the big contribution of the paper and i think it's not just for this paper but it has been some effort that has taken a number of years is without a doubt the collection of data the collection of evidence in our episode of law and order and this has involved an army of ras and visits to different countries and calls to colleagues in many of these countries and specialists and almanacs and dusty books that had to be uh open for the first time in many many years and putting all that data and making sure that it was all consistent and so on and so i think that without a doubt is the value added of this paper now so to summarize what are the contents of this big data effort we now have data on 17 advanced economies uh it's in annual frequency since 1870 we have 25 real and nominal variables the ones that are really new because not all of them are new or they're not ones that we put together but these in particular certainly are is measures of bank credit to the non-financial sector we have desegregated that a little bit so we know how much of that was to mortgages and how much of that was to non-mortgages which mostly is unsecured credit is the type of credit you'd think of in the typical model of a bank that that that function of intermediation that banks are assigned in typical textbooks are usually about unsecured credit not about mortgages we also have some data desegregated by households and firms and you'll see that there's a very strong connection most of the credit to households is in the form of mortgages okay so the same [Music] share is going to appear in either mortgages not mortgages or households versus firms data on house prices so we've extended a lot of data series that existed in some form or another but we've expanded it to more countries and we've expanded it further in time and we also have data on equity prices now it's true that a lot of the data that we have in this particular data set existed in one form or another in in other sources what we've done is basically put it under a common umbrella so that you can more easily access it there is a very detailed data appendix that we hope to publish online so that you can know where every point of uh every single variable was collected and what was the source and how was it put together and that will appear along with i hope the data uh at some point in the not too distant future in in in an mbr website okay right so let's go entry by entry on this table uh this is just to show you uh that there's a lot of texture in the data set that we put together so it's not meant for you to start reading the lines and the entries but uh that starts to give you a sense of the monumental task that it took uh to put together this data set and these are sort of the samples available for each variable and there's not even all the variables in the data set in this one table so you can imagine uh how it went and you know you have all the countries and it's fun it's good stuff okay so uh we figured out that the climate scientists had a good term when they defined the financial hockey stick sorry the the hog is stick the climate hockey stick and so we thought well let's let's borrow from people who are very clever and we are going to sell you i hope on the idea that there is something like a financial hockey stick okay so this is going to be the first part of the talk about the long run properties of what has happened in the world in the last few years okay so first off here's a bird's eye view of the main story this is what i'm going to call the great leveraging and on the graph you have three pieces of information the main piece of information is the red line which is a line that depicts the ratio of total loans to the non-financial sector as a ratio to gdp and that's compared with a dashed blue line which is broad money also expressed as a ratio to the gdp and comparing those two the one takeaway uh from that graph already is that if you look at around the 1970s that ratio of total loans to gdp really takes off and it disconnects from brought money in a very significant way there's another piece of information there which is these green bars these green bars tell you year in year out how many countries in our sample were in financial crisis and so what you see starting in 1870 is basically this looks like any data series and then after world war ii and up to the fall of bretton woods absolutely nothing so if you were to do a statistical test in which you used the history after world war ii and you were to ask yourself given the incidence of crisis in any given period what is the likelihood that i would string together 30 years of basically no crisis basically that probability is as close to zero as you'll ever see there was something different in that period uh and i don't think there is a good answer that i found out available in the literature so i think it is an open question i think it has to do probably more with how the regulatory architecture of the great depression was brought into functioning there was a fair amount of financial repression during this year but what broke that string of success uh that is still an open question that probably bears a little bit more study now if you look at some sort of explanation as to where this great leveraging comes from it basically has to be found in what has happened to mortgages okay it's far less related to what has happened in the corporate world although it is true that leverage defined the way i just did in terms of as a ratio to gdp it's more a story about households and mortgages and it's less a story of of firms borrowing and so uh i think in the conclusion i say it's less about bernanke girdler and gilchrist and except for bernanke i think the other two are here so they're going to hate me and it's more about jakobello okay so to me that model is going to be uh perhaps a better story for what we're seeing here in the data than than the financial accelerator uh story parenthetically uh you know if you want to know what the share of non-mortgage to mortgage lending is about one-third to non-mortgages uh two-thirds to mortgages and it's about the same share if you look at corporates and households now what has this increase in mortgages translated into you could think of it as in essence uh expansions in the intensive margin or the extensive margin i'm going to give you evidence for both so here's another finance another hockey stick apparently we're hockey fans now house prices here expressed in real terms using cpi data okay so you have a fair amount of stability almost the 1970s 1980s and then again house prices in real terms take off okay now it's also true that more households own homes than ever before moritz is fond of reading the capital before or sorry das capital before he goes to bed and so he tells me that even karl marx in the 1800s late 1800s has a line in there that says that home ownership in the uk back in the day was in the single digits okay in terms of percent so here what you have is a table of owner occupied share of housing and you can see that for most countries in our sample there is a definitely a very decided increase and there's a fair amount of heterogeneity not every country adopted the types of policies that for example were prevalent in the united states after the great depression and that were continued after world war ii with the gi bill other countries have a very different treatment of taxation of mortgage interest and other reasons why you have quite a bit of dispersion in home ownership rates by and large if you look at the aggregate home ownership rates have never been higher in advanced economies now i've talked about quote-unquote leverage by talking about credit as a ratio to income and you may say well that's not the definition that we typically use in finance we typically look as a ratio to asset price or or asset as a price times as a quantity well that's true but if you thought that way in the eve of the financial crisis you would have thought that leveraging housing markets wasn't that bad at all in fact was declining when in reality if you were looking at the amount of credit relative to income which must be related in some fundamental way given that you have to pay uh out of income your monthly uh mortgage payment then uh then to us that's the more meaningful quantity now it's a lot harder to get data on wealth but here's an example and what you should take away from this picture is no matter how you measure uh leverage whether you like our measure based on a ratio to gdp or whether you look in terms of wealth uh it is the case that over the span of uh the years plotted here which is basically post world war ii that ratio has gone up as well okay so that's the hockey stick that's kind of the uh breaking the data that's the thing that we have to contend with and so how how does that affect the business cycle um very quickly since i have a lot to go through in the limited time that i have um here's a picture on the top line you have the duration in years of typical expansions and recessions broken down by era you look you have the rate of growth per annum for gdp and you have the same thing for credit and the basic thing that you see between one era and the next pre-world war ii and post world war ii is the sort of strong connection that there is between um well first off the lengthening of expansions post world war ii even though we grow at a slower rate and then the much tighter connection that there is between the credit cycle and the business cycle so if you look at the bottom of that table you have a concordance index and that basically tells you how often both credit and gdp are in the same stage of the cycle and that has basically tied much more closely for world war ii than it did in world war one now this table is one that tries to get at the question of is credit always bad and and it's not a welfare calculation by any stretch of the imagination but it is trying to give you a sense and here's the experiment it says suppose that i bend every recession into whether it's its credit grew above above mean or below me and i'm going to do experiments experiment one i'm going to see if you're growing above mean in a given expansion what happens in the following recession and then calculate the difference in gained gdp versus loss gdp and then i'm going to do the opposite i'm going to say suppose that you deliver a lot in this recession what happens in the following expansion and you have a very interesting asymmetry so if you have credit growing very quickly in this expansion that expansion lasts a lot longer and so you accumulate a lot more growth and that is true you have a worse recession but a net you end up gaining quite a lot about three quarters of a percent per year if you do the opposite which is the level a lot in the recession then your following expansion seems to be a lot quicker and a lot longer lasting okay so uh there you have the numbers so three quarters of a percent 1.1 percent those are the numbers that that you can bandy about so at least there's a partial answer to that question that we've had uh over the years okay so business cycle moments let me show you the pictures but basically let's keep these facts in mind lower volatility but higher skew more rare disasters okay both of these figures show you what has happened to gdp growth um in what is called a bin scatter a bench scatter basically is a scatter plot in which you bend by the value in this case of the credit to gdp and what you can see in the first picture is perhaps a story that says it's bad to have too little finance as you move up perhaps that improves and then as you have too much finance maybe things get worse but i don't want to make a story out of that picture it's suggestive the bottom row shows you what happened in post-world war ii and there what you see clearly is more finance lower rates of growth but it's not only that you also have lower volatility you can see it in gdp consumption and investment but you also have more negative skew the more finance measure by credit to gdp the more negative the skew and the bottom row what you see is more extreme is the tenth the bottom tenth percentile more extreme values and that's this is just post-world war ii you also see a higher correlation of real economic activity with credit and you also see something that is at least to me a little bit curious which is what i was talking about the ability to smooth consumption there's a higher degree of correlation between gdp and consumption at higher levels of credit to gdp and that seems a little odd okay i won't go through the international moment since i basically pissed all my time talking about law and order but the basic takeaway is there's also less diversification at the international level there's more correlation of gdp across economies and that seems to go on with higher levels of credit to gdp okay so here are some of the things that i think are important how to fit the data into what we know about macro models and i was talking before about financial accelerator versus focusing on housing it reinforces a lot of the work that a tiff and amir have done it links very well with some of the work that you see there by edgar chen and krugman kornick and simpson it links a lot with some of the work that uh pierre olivier has done with emmanuel which i saw here anyway there's a lot here that i think you can sink your teeth in and it's i think a good first step for us to start rethinking how we think about micro models
