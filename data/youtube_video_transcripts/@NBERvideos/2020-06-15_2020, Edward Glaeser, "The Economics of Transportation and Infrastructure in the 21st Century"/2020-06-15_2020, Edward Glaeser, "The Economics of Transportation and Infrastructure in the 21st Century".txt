this is uh going to be early results on the pandemic it is very much battlefield social science by which i mean many of these things may not hold up in the fullness of time but we're doing what we can in a situation in which the situation on the ground is changing very very quickly i'm going to be talking about three things here just first of all setting the stage with the talking about how the scope of the pandemic shock to our economy and to our transportation system i'm going to first highlight the extent to which our service economy is extraordinarily vulnerable to a shock that makes face-to-face contact a source of peril rather than pleasure secondly i'm going to show just a little bit of facts about how big the shock to the transportation sector has been uh and differentiate between some different parts of the transportation sector and then finally i'm going to talk about the prognosis for businesses reopening when the lockdowns end to what extent do we think that the shutting down of our economy is something that's regulatory that will just end when we flip a switch and to what extent do we think that this will linger with us for months or even years to come then i will focus on two very specific transportation questions the first of which is can we ever make people feel safe again on public transit systems um i'm going to talk a little bit both on the evidence uh on the linkages between public transit and the spread of code 19 and secondly um talk about a little bit of of the ideas that people put forward uh to try and make people feel safe again on buses and trains um and finally i'm gonna end by discussing in some sense the the most you know uh existential issue uh which is to what extent is covet 19 a fundamental threat for our urban world right to what extent uh it does this thing mean that we're going to move to remote working from whatever sylvan space uh makes us feel safe um so before covert 19 people have been predicting the technology would make cities and face-to-face contact obsolete it didn't but maybe it will now okay so starting with the broad arc of our employment history if we think about the past 150 years america has moved from farms to factories to urban service workers right and that movement um has in some sense left us at a place of extraordinary vulnerability to this form of pandemic um the the this movement has been created in part by the role of capital deepening of mechanization which has displaced factory workers many of whom have moved first to low-wage labor low-wage areas across the planet but also just been replaced by machines but the one thing that a less skilled american could do that still remained any place you had a city any place you had wealthy customers was to serve a latte with a smile was to do something in the service economy where people would be willing to pay a little bit extra for a pleasant human experience that is 32 million american workers at this point in time that is one-fifth of the american american labor force in leisure and hospitality and retail trade and that is one-fifth of the american economy for which if we view the presence of a stranger serving us a coffee as a threat rather than as being a desirable thing they can be mechanized fairly easily and most of us have have completely given up on those experiences this just shows employment since 2000 um the blue line shows the manufacturing declines which you know uh you can see is now that the lowest of these five sectors that i show here um yellow is showing the rising employment to legion hospitality uh the mid blue line is retail trade uh the orange line is professional business business services uh which is the sort of higher end stuff that is zooming its way to some form of continuing employment and the top green line is education and health services almost assuredly the most robust of these sectors in part because it's paid for the government so these it's these middle two lines that are the the backbone of employment for many uh less skilled americans and and it's it's the one that's under threat um before uh the pandemic i infected worried more about the joblessness in the eastern heartland joblessness in central america where those urban service jobs were not existing and this shows the prime the probability of not working for prime age males in many parts of this eastern heartland uh you had more than one and a fourth uh of prime age males not working and i had argued that one of the fundamental issues with these jobs they didn't have the demand for these urban service uh that were employing uh mid-skill people in the coastal cities um looking forward does this suggest that you know our urban areas are going to have employment problems like that of appalachia if those service jobs disappear um but of course the service sector workers are on the front line so this is across new york city zip codes this is the share of workers in leisure hospitality and retail trade and it's showing you the per capita deaths at the zip code level across new york city zip code so this is a highly predictive uh variable in terms of explaining which neighborhoods in new york have seen the most deaths from cover 19. um the scale of the shock has been enormous partially because of the vulnerability of these urban services um we've seen a rise in unemployment that's not really been seen since the great depression and um the the sort of twin shocks at this point in time of the health shock and the economic shock are are facing us going forward um this comes from uh the uh survey that michael lucca zoe cullen uh alex bartik marion bertrand uh chris stanton and i have have been doing using the alignable network of small businesses um and this is data from about april 2 2020. um so these are businesses under 500 it's broadly nationally representative um you know our data 53 of uh the uh retailers in our in those businesses were closed 70 in arts and entertainment were closed um overall 45 of those businesses were closed so just an amazing shutting down of the american economy somewhat shockingly uh fairly large numbers expect to remain closed as of december um and that when we when we experimentally varied how long uh we told them that the crisis would last uh their probability of remaining open dropped startly as the the kovic crisis became longer um the data actually does pretty well it does a good job of actually predicting unemployment so this is our share closed as of may 9. uh and we're relating this to the official data um at the county level on unemployment rates in april and as you can see there's a fair amount of signal there in terms of predicting unemployment so the alignable network is surveys actually doing a reasonable job of capturing the extent of economic distress at the local level along with the shutdown of course has been you know a complete shutdown in many parts of passenger traffic so this comes from god and diana thank you for this um this is person throughput at all airports you can see it's just you know uh radically decreasing uh over this time period uh just just our airports have now become wastelands relative to busy thoroughfares um this comes from stephen pofftack the general manager of the mbta uh this is weekday ridership uh by line and mode and you can see you can find uh march 12th is in the middle of there right as we're shutting down jim we're right we're right in that in that middle point over here um and you know this decline that happened incredibly quickly between march 10th and uh march 24th no notice that it occurred before the shutdown of non-essential businesses so one question going forward is the extent to which if we just turn things around will that cause things to be open certainly the shutdown happened before this um freight declines by far less than passengers now that shouldn't surprise us that there were uh our ports have not declined at all at least according to this um local trucks are down a bit rail car loads are down a lot um this is uh again thanks to dot and diana but freight has changed less than passengers and that's that's actually an important message for lockdowns in the developing world where some countries like uganda actually shut down freight as well as passenger travel and saw huge dislocations as a result of that because the food couldn't get through um but so one part of our transportation network has seen a much larger change than another um one of the nice things is we now have an amazing amount of cell phone data which is coming from different sources this actually comes from the bureau of transportation statistics the maryland transportation institute these are changes in trips and trip lengths um as measured by cell phone mobility and there are a variety of different forms that this is coming in safe graph has made their data publicly available and many researchers including us have taken advantage of that which is terrific um you can see in the top left-hand corner the share of the population staying at home uh rose from 20 to 30 percent interestingly that has started to change so you've really seen that start to come back as of late may so people are moving somewhat um right below it uh right to the right of it is the number of short trips um and you can see where these trips are increasing uh that in in the combat you can see first the decline but gradually there's been a comeback particularly of those trips that are less than one mile so people going you know grocery stores people taking care of necessary items long trips which is down in the lower left quarter quarter of this uh they have been slower to come back um and of course in in the last remaining one you can see some of the heterogeneity across metropolitan areas some areas really have have stayed down much lower than other areas have and and we'll come back to some of that later um many researchers associated with this program have done uh have been doing great work on this and in some times it's been work that specifically on covet 19 and transport and sometimes it's using covet 19 to figure out things like can we figure out better how congestion slows down our roads so this this was given to me by gilderontom matthew turner who's going to be speaking shortly um this shows the changes in the speeds uh at two hour intervals pre and po post coven so this shows october april and may not a lot of difference in most of their uh in the three cities they have between april and may miami is starting to show a little bit of more congestion actually in may so you're seeing a little bit more driving in the in florida um but you can see the quite visible changes in terms of speeds that you could actually move around our roads so it turns out pandemic is one way to actually solve the problem of america's congestion uh it's a pretty terrible solution for it and obviously we need to continue working on things like uh better congestion pricing models to actually solve this in a way that's less problematic but you can use this in order to figure out what's the as particularly as as traffic levels continue to rise you can use it to re-estimate the elasticity of speeds with respect to uh the amount of congestion on the road this shows again from jiel and matthew's work the difference between speeds between 2 a.m and 4 to 6 p.m um before the pandemic pre-covered or the block lines post pandemic or the dotted lines you know again these differences become much smaller so previously of course there were huge differences between nighttime speeds and and afternoon speeds now they're really uh there really isn't and again you see some cities la and florida some of that's coming back up um using again the bts data you can get another way of looking at the heterogeneity in the decline of driving um these are all the counties in the u.s and and uh green is micropolitan black is metro core uh blue is suburbs and the dotted lines are non-core interestingly some of those non-core areas have actually seen increases in the number of trips presumably that's relocation to low density area of previously former urbanites but they may just not be changing their driving patterns very often but you can see also that the more educated parts of america been the ones that have had the sharpest declines in the number of trips uh and that's also a message that comes out in the work that victor couture jonathan dingle jesse hanbury and two other co-authors have been doing um this is looking at block groups uh this is in philadelphia this is they're calling this a device exposure measure but again this is a measure of how how much mobility there is in terms of the the cell phones and you can see prior uh to the strike of covid you know much more mobility on the part of the college educated people and of course that's true for many of the people who are on this in this conference if this is a you know education and mobility go together in the u.s in many ways postcovid if anything you can see the it flips that in fact educated people have seen their movement drop most and it's been the the people with less resources who have continued to use our uh our transportation networks and of course many of our public transit has been particularly vital for the the medical professionals so when you when you talk to steve poptak at mbta he talks particularly about the peaks that are associated with people going to the mass general and the other hospitals in boston um this is a new thing that i saw actually today uh on the nbr website you know transportation is constantly going on at the nbr apparently uh this is um uh working paper 27 235 which shows small but not massive impacts on reopening on mobility so uh slight increases but not a massive reopening this uses the state-to-state variation when reopening orders occurred so i think all of these things cast a common message that suggests that the reopening is going to be slow and the view that you're going to flip the switch is very unlikely to be correct now um this finally i'm going to talk a little bit about reopening businesses as well as mobility uh and the first thing when you just look at and this comes again from our our alignable network data is that per capita covered cases predict which areas are closed pretty well so the areas with low covet cases are much more likely to be open uh the areas with high covet cases are much more likely to be closed but it turns out that much of this is driven not by fear of covid per se uh but rather by the lockdowns that people are experiencing so the high covet areas are also those ones that actually had the most regulation and one question is whether or not uh health concerns going forward will slow people from reopening or whether or not there will be other factors that will deter uh reopening of small businesses um so this this is the result we actually we ask people how long they think they will reopen and how long they think it will take until the restrictions on their businesses are fully lifted almost every state in the union has about an average two-week gap on average between expected reopening and uh restrictions being left obviously that's not uniform across businesses there are plenty of businesses who say they're going to be open the day after the restrictions left but there's certainly not a lot of correlation between places with higher levels of covid in that gap so think about the gap as being the extra hesitation that's being explained and really there's not a lot about health differences that explain that gap so it doesn't look like businesses are being particularly wary about reopening because of the health concerns however there's still being somewhat wary about reopening um and it turns out the variable which does a much better job of predicting it is the widespread belief that demand for their business is likely to be radically down so these are the small businesses again from the alignable network we've asked them what share of their demand are they going to get of pre-covered levels of demand at months in the future and so uh 0.37 means on average arts entertainment recreation think that there's 63 percent less demand for their services than there were pre-covered finance insurance they think there's only 34 percent less for their demand uh relative to pre-covet the first calendar shows the share of businesses that think that they're roughly at 90 percent of what their demand was or more now you know normally i would have thought an eight percent drop in demand would be pretty big for a business uh it turns out almost none of them think they'll be at 90 or or higher uh you know anytime soon finance insurance and insurance is the cluster where we think that that's you know their most likely but again even the finance and insurance firms in our sample only 27 of them think that they'll be over 90 by september and many of the other businesses are you know predicting much much lower levels than that so arts entertainment recreation think that 45 of their demand is going to be off uh by september so these are really radical uh expectations about the shock to american demand at least you know for the foreseeable future and of course this correlates fairly strongly with demand reopening so this is just the the correlation in the data uh you know we're just grouping them by the expected share of similar businesses to them that they say will be open and then we're just showing the the level of pre-covered demand uh and so the areas that have sort of very high levels of uh pre-code pre of reopening are those ones that expect high levels of of consumers to reo to return so demand is really driving we also have some more experimental methods to actually tease out what the elasticity is of reopening with respect to future demand and we can find basically all of the delays explained by all the delay post regulation is explained by expected shortfalls uh in demand going forward and that's obviously particularly acute in um those those industries like the arts and entertainment where the the continuing health risks are probably there um okay so let me pivot to the next two questions so the first of which is can we make public transportation safe again so jeff harris had a deeply provocative and absolutely fascinating nbr working paper maybe more than a month ago on the role that public transportation in new york played to spread covet that has elicited sort of a huge amount of back and forth but unquestionably it is a deeply plausible hypothesis uh and one that you know it's it's really going to be crucial to understand the safety of public transportation going forward i'm going to give a little bit of of what i think is the available evidence on this um do we know how to make public transportation safe i think the answer is right now we're not too sure about that and then third because i was asked i'm going to say a little bit of something about dot's role not rule dot's role in certifying public transportation i will i will do my best to avoid saying anything of uh that's a policy recommendation on that but i may i may veer over in which case jim will bleep me out so i don't i don't violate it um so are fears of public transportation uh you know out there uh for sure so this is a suffolk poll this was again given to me by steve pontac the nbta um would you be comfortable riding buses subways and commuter trains when it is allowed this was a poll of of people in in massachusetts um 79.2 percent said no okay so 80 percent of massachusetts residents said they would not be comfortable riding in public transportation how about if you have an effective treatment but not a vaccine for for covet well then only 57 said no okay so that's that's a pretty huge number still of people feeling uncomfortable even if you got a vaccine 25 percent said no um so short of a vaccine uh it looks like this is going to be a huge huge problem with getting people to take public transit going forward and this of course turns not only into a shock for the public transit systems for cities like boston where public transit is a major part of our transportation network if they're not taking public transit then our roads become even more impassable right in the case of new york it's just impossible to imagine how people are going to get around without public transit and if if fear of public transit is that you know widespread then this is going to help fuel and that's what i'm going to talk to in the third section you know a large exodus uh for at least some from um from urban areas um now what do we know about public transit and uh mortality so um this shows across counties there's also a nice nbr working paper uh from klaus desmond and romain works out i'm looking at the cross us prevalence of covert i've got cases on one side deaths on the other k other side the uh elasticity of suspected populations just because i have total cases not deaths not cases per capita so you're looking for a number about one uh over there which is what you see in the cases deaths it's lower um the density measure and the first column just shows this fact that cities do tend to have have tended to have higher levels of uh kovig 19. and that's true this these regressions actually don't include the five boroughs of new york um it's true certainly if you control for proximity to new york as well the next column shows what you get when you throw in share using public transit um and these numbers are really quite large uh you're getting a very big impact so if you want to interpret the elasticity in in pseudo percentage terms a 10 percentage point increase in the share of the population using public transit is associated with a 35 increase in cases per capita now i should say which parts of the us are driving that it's counties around new york so it's parts of uh it's parts of parts of long island it's the areas that are near new york but it's also detroit so there also are cities in the american heartland where public transit uses is high and covic cases are higher you can kill some of it with other with other controls so um it is a it is a fact that share african american is uh strongly positively associated with both cases and deaths from covid um if this is obviously not just about diagnosis because you see in columns three through six you see the same fact in terms of deaths and so in both of them public transit is strongly associated uh with covet deaths and this is this is just what cases per capita and public transit share looks like among larger more populous counties in the u.s that's what the scattergram looks like this is what it looks like in terms of the the deaths for canada but oh uh so but uh another fact which is quite interesting this work is by a phd student of ours at harvard karen shen um the the thing i want you to focus on is this second column which is the uh the tract uh in the uh where the staff of the of nursing homes live the public transit use in those tracks and um this is looking at nursing home deaths and public transit use in the tracks where the uh nursing home attendants live uh is associated with more deaths you can in fact kill this off with enough controls it's not totally totally robust but it is certainly true that if you think sort of from a national policy failure the area in which we've clearly failed most is to protect our nursing homes uh 60 of massachusetts deaths are in nursing homes and sort of paying attention to both you know to the staff and the environments in which they're living and the environments that they're getting to the nursing homes seems like a first thing of first order importance i should say it's not at all obvious if this is because the staff themselves are using public transit we know for example that most of them overwhelmingly are not so um it would have to be something else about the the tracked environments in which they live that are likely to be uh causing this correlation um now second fact and this is joint work with erika muskowski and john thiebs across new york city zip codes there is no positive correlation between public transit usage and covid cases and deaths at all okay uh if anything it often goes the the wrong way as it does in the third column so there's no sense in which zip codes within new york city uh public transit causes causes uh seems to be associated with government so the place where jeff harris started us on started on i didn't see anything in the public transit usage data to support this no now let's and this is just what it looks like so if you don't control for anything else you get a very flat line um but you know it's it's uh it creates a question so why does public transit uh predict code across cities but not within new york city i think there are two possible explanations one of which is that public transit doesn't actually spread code at all it's correlated with other county level attributes like pre-existing health care conditions that generate vulnerability to covet 19 entirely possible two public transit correlation within cities is compromised by the endogenous response of areas where people used to take public transit covert so it's much more the case that you can imagine to see that behavioral response at the neighborhood level where public transit usually may be correlated with lots of other things than you would necessarily across metropolitan areas so if the areas with more public transit shut down more then this can explain the non-correlation so let me just show you some maps of new york and again thank you to caitlyn for putting this together so this is cases per capita within the five boroughs of new york i've cut off a little bit of staten island on the left-hand side uh and it's fraction public transportation use so um in some parts there there is a correlations but it's also related to poverty meaning that sort of the uh if you look at the upper reaches of manhattan those are relatively high uh covert use areas and they're relatively case areas and those are relatively high public transit areas but look at the you know brooklyn queens areas they're the areas that have by far the most public transit usage meaning the areas are close to manhattan have by far the least cases okay that's exactly what and that's what's driving the new york city non-correlation is that all of these sort of core areas of brooklyn you know right around public transit stops have very few numbers of cases now what's happened in terms of the behavioral response well this is again showing you the fraction public transit again so that's on the left hand side over there and there we see the change in trips by residential zip code using safe graph and what you can see is not in manhattan but again focus on focus on brooklyn that the areas that have the heavy public transit uses are the areas in which you see the largest behavioral response now i can't separate here from this data whether or not there are people who are sheltering in place in brooklyn or they've moved off to country homes it's very hard to tell but public transit within at least those boroughs of new york is associated with the ability to reduce your usage whereas the the driving areas are ones in which people have continued to move around and they've continued to to get covered so i'll just show you this in terms of scattergrams so this is showing that the change in trips and cases per person so the place that had the fewest changes and trips are the places that have the highest coveted cases per person it was the adaption it was the shutting down across new york city zip codes that proved to be protective shouldn't surprise you social distancing is actually one thing we know works against contagion um fraction using public transit and the changes in trips it's a negative correlation right so that's that's what turns out that's driving it and and at least that's one explanation for it so it's not that public transportation doesn't prevent present threats all places in which people connect with each other potentially create threats but at least one explanation for why it doesn't correlate in new york is that in fact the high public transit areas are the areas where you had the best ability to engage in behavioral responses and you know i should just say as a sideline the fact that economics is almost always the social science of behavioral responses suggests why economists have such a central role to play in understanding the spread of covet because it really is about how people respond to this threat um this is chicago you see a pattern that's quite similar high public transit areas are also areas where you saw the largest drops in uh trips especially on the north side on the wealthier parts in the lincoln lincoln park parts of these areas this is changing trips on the uh on the left hand side this is uh and uh fraction using public transit the other one is change in trips and cases per capita uh again low change lots of very steep declines and changes in trip means low cases per capita in chicago this is the same two graphs for philadelphia you see the same basic pattern so you saw this large behavioral response for these inner areas where people took public transit a lot and so you saw more of a decline um now can we possibly make people feel safe around public transit again i think the easiest thing is to protect their workers um so there's a fact that i think i learned from diego puga uh on um the difference between barcelona and new york city in terms of the illness of public transit workers which was much higher in barcelona that at least potentially reflects the difference than the plexiglass that protects the barcelona drivers so that's type of thing where you just have a single worker that doesn't really need to personally interact and can be separated is sort of the easiest thing disinfecting the physical spaces new york city did it every three days boston did it daily the mbta did it daily i have no idea if it made a difference uh the cdc has recently downgraded their their views of how threatening it is to fit touch physical spaces as opposed to people um it's something that would be great for us to get some clarity from the epidemiologist on de-crowding public transportation so in the short run this is certainly doable although even on peak even now in peak routes they're having trouble keeping the buses relatively empty turns out bus drivers have a lot of trouble saying no uh and they're trying to sort of make this automatic turn styles in principle can make limits automatic but then what about large families would be clustering together um so i think it's it'd be useful to get more of a sense as we go forward and we can use the visual recognition tools that are out there to actually measure whether or not we actually have a large crowding problem or not whether or not people are actually you know giving each other space um there's a lot of enthusiasm for wearing masks certainly that we've tried to create a norm around face masks but enforcing this has proven to be very difficult i i think many major public transit systems have faced ugly social media backlash particularly when you see uh white officers pulling unmasked african americans off of off of buses or off of trains so you can imagine that that the um the difficulty of infection forcing this means that you know it's always going to have to depend upon sort of community enforcement and community norms um i was asked to specifically uh uh this is not a recommendation just be clear jim i'm not actually saying certainly not i'm just saying that that it might be sub-optimal in the model that i'm writing down uh should dot certify public transit systems for safety from conclusion um i i think it's unlikely that dot itself should take it on right why should why should dot make themselves liable uh why shouldn't it make it political uh keep it in the hands of scientists uh you know especially when the science is so uncertain i think a better alternative is to actually empower private entities uh to bring together recognize public health authorities like hospitals and virologists and then encourage them to create a certain certification program or to create in to encourage independent entities to start rating of a variety of different formats and you can imagine crowdsourcing information on this so i think actually a system that actually gets the information out there um that enables people to learn in real time how crowded uh various buses are for systems to certify how good of a job they're doing at cleaning that's all well and good but i think it would be a mistake for dot to take it on itself doc can do training certainly but not take it on itself to do the the certification so let me move on to the the last the last part of it which is in some sense the largest which is will this boost in remote working become permanent um and i'm going to start with a little bit of recap of the pre-covered discussion of telecommuting and transport uh then i'm going to talk a little bit about cities and plague in the past uh engage in a little bit of evidence on what people are saying about telecommuting during the pandemic and whether or not business economists expect that this will continue and then i'll end with some highly debatable uh prognostication um so over the long course of history uh transportation technology has always shaped uh urban form um and the 20th century was a world of highly centrifugal technologies perhaps above all the automobile but also radios and televisions which are you know a form of transportation technology of their own for moving uh images and voices and this enabled the great flight of americans and of american industry away from the dense urban areas that had enabled 19th century industrialization that had been the nodes of the transportation network that connected uh uh america um so the the rise of cars and automobiles killed off urban industry they led to decentralization uh from urban cores to to suburbs as the work of nate bound snow has taught us and this led the cyber sears and the the techno profits when i was uh you know 25 years ago 30 years ago when i was starting out in this business um to think that that these technologies information technology of the 1980s uh would lead to widespread dispersal of the information workers who remained in cities right would lead to the fact to be to all of us doing exactly what we're doing right now and just zooming it in instead of connecting uh face-to-face but that isn't what happened um for 30 years late afterwards uh finance uh became if anything more uh urban in its in its dominance and technology companies like google and that's an image of of uh google space um you know invested heavily in proximity and far from using their technology to send everyone home they bought the googleplex they bought a million and a half square feet in downtown manhattan they encouraged everyone to be right on top of each other because they thought this led to productivity because in a world in which ideas and knowledge are the most important currency uh then being right on top of each other being is more valuable in a world in which ideas and concepts are more complex than the edge of face-to-face contact becomes more valuable and that seemed to be driving a remarkable urban renaissance in america and you see this in terms of per capita income uh and you see this in terms of population change so american cities came back not despite the new technologies but for many decades it seemed like it was because of the new technologies that we were living in a more collaboratively collaborative more intense more face-to-face world and cities were enabling that um now that's part of the story the other part of the story is that the urban edge in entertainment was valued and i think um that's something for us to keep in mind going forward that cities came back not just as places of productivity but also as places of pleasure that the urban advantages of enabling us to share common infrastructure enabled us to go to art galleries and museums and entertainment venues and of course the same urban competitiveness same urban competition and entrepreneurship that works wonders in the business space also uh enables the creation of new restaurants of new sources of joy and of course the most important advantage of of being face to face is just being around other human beings and that's particularly true for younger uh people for whom you know connecting in cyberspace is never really a perfect substitute for sharing a meal or a kiss or a smile um so uh what does covet do to this now it turns out plagues and cities are long companions right the plague of athens comes in 430 bc right so that's 24 50 years ago uh you know the greatest urban civilization that the western world had seen was laid low by plague because of pericles had the clever idea that they were going to shelter behind their walls and bring in all the attic farmers and then they were going to send their boats out to ravage the the shores of their peloponnesian enemies in sparta right brilliant plan except for the fact that even if the spartans can't get into athens walls plague could and of course the plague of athens killed spartacus and and you know badly damaged that that urban civilization flash forward 900 years uh 5 30 a.d justinian is you know trying to reboot the roman empire trying to create the pax romana across the mediterranean world and you know plague comes the first time the black death shows up in europe it shows up in constantinople and those dreams are pretty much over and the chaos that follows that plague basically leads to a de-urbanizing of europe for close to a millennium um so you know this the you know the impacts of disease can be fairly catastrophic in in uh if they then lead to knock-on effects this is the 19th century map of death rates in new york and you can see that you know sort of plague as a common companion a boy born in new york city in 1900 was expected to live six years less than a boy born in rural america that's about the same gap that existed between london and uh the rest of england during the time of shakespeare and you can see the great urban pandemics of uh the 19th century yellow fever mosquito-borne uh early uh 19th century cholera mid-19th century plague comes out of the ganges delta travels across the glowing global network of the 19th century and hits new york in in 1831 um both of these were somewhat different than the plague that preceded them so it turned out that the tools that were used against the literal black death quarantine tended to be fairly ineffective against yellow fever partially because mosquitoes can travel even if you lock people up cholera of course is waterborne um and it wasn't until america's cities and towns spent you know as much on clean water as they did at the start of the 20th century as the federal government spent on everything except for the post office in the army that cities started getting healthier now i i should stress because this is an economics group that this required not just engineering but also incentives okay because in fact you can see right there the quote aqueduct opened in 1842 um and for 25 years after that new yorkers still died of cholera and the reason for that is that poor people didn't connect there were a thousand free hydrants but it wasn't enough and so poor people continued to use their shallow wells and continued to uh their pit latrines and they continue to die and it's only when you have the board of health that starts imposing what are essentially pigouvian taxes on tenement owners that forces them to adopt that you see the cholera rates going down so that that really is sort of a central message of this going forward that we need to both you know think about massive investments but also the incentives that wrap around those investments but the map also shows you that we've had a century of remarkable health after influenza for almost a century our cities have been remarkably the western cities remarkably plague free the one major um difference from that of course was was aids which was terrible but because it was largely a sexually transmitted disease it didn't pose the same kind of existential threat as a disease that's transmitted by droplets does um because fundamentally if you're afraid of meeting with another person then the whole function of cities eliminating the spaces between other human beings becomes a downside and for everyone who's sheltering in place there is no advantage in being in an urban area really at this point in time now we have had a number of um great nbr papers uh that have come out on uh the rise of remote working um one of the more amazing pieces was by dingle and neyman who used their work on very pre-coveted of how much you could do work remotely across occupations and they use that to predict which sectors would actually see more remote working and this is a paper that's already received 100 citations uh from it and it was purely predictive now the amazing thing is we went out we used our alignable data and we actually measured which sectors were actually doing remote working and it turns out that dingle and naaman got it exactly right that in fact the the places that are doing you know the places that were they were predicting we're going to be doing remote working are the places that are doing remote working so uh you can see here that sort of food accommodation and agriculture or not uh education information finance these are the places that are doing remote working um this comes from our national association of business economist survey uh and here we're asking um you know just a shift in remote working before covet 19 um and what what do the one of them are doing it now and uh this is tending to show just a very large um so this is you know 41 of those firms had less than 20 percent of their uh workers doing remote work before copen 19. that's what the column one shows um sixteen percent could do remote work after it before kobe 19. um how what share businesses have only one-fifth of their workers or less working uh working remotely now only four percent okay so that's what that says by contrast move to you know the 80 to 100 percent um you know only 27 did work remotely before uh cobia 19 had 80 to 100 of their workers doing that um 49 of them said they could work that many could work remotely now 65 of firms are in in that area now um we also asked them how is the productivity of their remote workers fared i think the best we can say that this is probably a rule of thumb kind of thing um but uh what that's telling you is that that you know most of them think there's not much of a difference in terms of their productivity now those of us who are defenders of the you know uh face-to-face contact can still argue that well their work plans were made before covet 19 this isn't asking about the highly creative inventive stuff that goes on but we've all gotten better at zoom right we've all gotten better working remotely and it is certainly a live possibility going forward that many more of our tasks maybe not the sort of most sensitive ones but that many more of our tasks can be done remotely going forward so um this shows that the dingle and name and uh thing also works for predicting across industries in the naves survey as well as the line of oil um this asks what share of the work the firm's workers who did not work remotely before covet 19 would do so when business returns uh to normal um so 36 percent say less than a fifth of them uh will remark will work remotely but um uh so 36 percent of them say that those less than a fifth of the workers who did not work remotely will also not work remotely after after the larger percentages all show that they're expecting a larger you know all the other groups say that they're expecting a larger share of people and the firms you know a fair number of them also think that the firms will be more geographic uh flex geographically flexible going forward so these business economies at least are predicting that they're going to see more remote working going forward um so what does this actually mean for uh for cities so i think first of all everything depends on the duration of the pandemic risk so um if this ends relatively quickly you know 12 months nine months and doesn't happen again then the shock is real but doesn't change urban life massively um still there will be short-term shifts so in terms of when you think about remote working in cities like boston or new york or san francisco the gap between current commercial prices or certainly residential prices and the price at which you start leaving space empty is so large that there's a great deal of movement of price before you see any movement of quantity right so you're unlikely to see large-scale vacancies in greenwich village anytime soon because you know currently the price of a townhouse is seven million dollars even if we're to fall to four and a half million dollars or two and a half million dollars it would still be occupied and that's true for great swaths of coastal america in the middle parts of america in the st louis is in cleveland's there's more of a possibility and there's likely to be more vulnerability in commercial space than there is in residential space um even so even in terms of quantities i would suspect more shuffling and there's every reason to think that the shuffling that will occur would be a reallocation from old to young um so uh one you know certainly in the u.s perhaps a little bit less so in brazil uh vulnerability is strongly associated with age uh i certainly have many uh friends parents who've declared they are certainly never getting on public transit again um that suggests that at least some of the empty nesters who have urbanized over the past 20 years may well think that a low density home is more attractive um certainly some significant work will move either to to homes or to lower density locales and um even in the best of circumstances for cities you'd expect to see some of sort of lower density of mid-density consumer cities places that are sort of deeply pleasant the veils of this world maybe the boulders to do quite well out of this will that make our roads more or less crowded it's not obvious because a greater suburban dispersal actually leads to longer trips when they occur so even some more working at home can actually make some of our road problems more difficult so transportation is likely to be have interesting shifts moving forward and public transit is likely to be challenged for many years and i think we should continue to expect major fiscal problems in our public transit systems for a long period to come um international travel will also surely be depressed for quite some time and and certainly when you think about clusters of the american economy the combination of sort of the the travel sector that the air travel sector and uh the legion hospitalities are one are areas in which we can expect to see sort of huge huge issues there are some bright spots so certainly i i believe the rental cost for mobile homes has soared uh in recent years so there are some transportation and leisure technologies that have done well but they involve a fair amount of social distancing so um what about the bad scenario the bad scenario is the shock doesn't end quickly and if there are more pandemics so this isn't the first time we had of this thing uh you know we had sars we had mers we had an h1n1 issue uh in 209 um then it seems that quite significant changes will occur in both the urban location and the demand for transportation now i am not predicting that in part because this would shatter the urban service industry right 32 million american workers would be devastated by this right and create enormous economic dislocations and uh at least suggest that we should be willing to spend enormous sums to make sure that this doesn't happen again right it does make sense to spend tens of billions to avoid a crisis that is costing uh trillions um what what are the sensible things to be spending on i think we don't know yet but certainly research on transportation and safety is likely to be an important part of that as well as research on biology uh preparing situations so we have rapid vaccine production um and so forth
