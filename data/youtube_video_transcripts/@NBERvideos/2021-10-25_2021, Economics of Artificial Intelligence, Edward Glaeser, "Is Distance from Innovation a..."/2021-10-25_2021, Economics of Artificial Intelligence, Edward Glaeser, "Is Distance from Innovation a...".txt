so the question that i've been given was does a.i complement urban density essentially uh and this is part of an ancient set of questions about which technologies are centripetal meaning they push people uh they bring people towards cities like the aqueduct or the streetcar or the skyscraper and which technologies are centrifugal like the automobile and radios and televisions which dominated in the middle decades of the 20th century and enabled the the spread of uh people away from cities in the spread of factories to uh lower density locales so this is the question that was assigned to me and i thought i would give a little bit of intellectual background on this so um 25 years ago or as uh i joshua gans would say a century ago we heard that earlier uh it's actually a little longer than 25 years i worked on the complementarity between electronic interactions and face-to-face interactions and the cities of course that exist to enable those face-to-face interactions i had a model that emphasized two margins for interaction the number of contacts and the share of time which each contact within each contact that is face to face or electronic so new i.t reduced the face-to-face time within each contact but it increased the overall number of contacts and if the later ladder effect dominates then cities actually expand even if you have an improvement of electronic communications technologies my preferred model now is that new technologies increase complexity and the returns to being smart and that we are social species that get smart by being around other smart people there's a fair amount of evidence supporting this and in my my original paper with jess gaspar on this and it's come out subsequently the history of telephones which were thought to be a substitute for cities when they came out but of course ended up being a highly urban invention uh you know the fact that we call people who are physically close to us the rise of co-authorship in in the electronic era the rise of business travel the geographic concentration of silicon valley right itself which if you think that electronic interactions were a substitute for face-to-face interactions then why was marissa meyer demanding that everyone come come back to yahoo and why did google buy the googleplex and of course we've had 40 years of urban renaissance despite the futurist alvin toffler's claim in uh the new the third wave in 1980 that you know all this new technology would just send us off to electronic cottages now is ai different so you know we can see and this is uh from the from jenny hunt's paper uh that in fact ai is rising even though other forms of i.t seem to be relatively stagnant as a share of the urban workforce so both technologies both ai and communications technology are part of i.t both imply employ highly skilled people and as uh gordon has shown us immigrants from skill-intensive countries immigrants from india and china which you know seems like it's likely to benefit cities of course looking at those numbers and remember we're cruising up towards one percent in the general numbers right will i ai workers ever represent a large share of any significant cities labor force i mean i think that's a hard thing to imagine but despite the fact that smart people work in cities and could conceivably be replaced by uh ai the defining characteristic of the city is interaction not cognition and so while communications technology directly substitutes for a prime urban function ai does not moreover we've just seen from uh jenny's paper the spread of ai seems limited by geography right which continues to suggest the ongoing role of in-person contact is part of that spread so ai could reduce labor demand for a lot of highly skilled urban workers yet this is unlikely to be a china shock type thing right and lead to mass mass unemployment because one human capital is related to adaptation at both the individual and the city level more skilled cities were much better at adjusting to the shocks of the 1970s the de-industrialized cities um and there's an old claim that goes back to t.w schultz and finest welch that in fact there's a lot of evidence suggesting that skilled workers educated workers are much better at adjusting to changing conditions moreover skilled workers wages have space to adjust downward without hitting either minimum wages or some sort of non-work opportunity costs that would lead to the large-scale joblessness that was created by the china shock moreover it should be easier for skilled urbanites to move into more interaction-intensive jobs than for skilled residents of lower density communities right and of course following up on dave deming's comment and both of these last two comments are very deming-esque uh cities have more variability of settings more variability of events and just because people mean chaos and that's going to mean that replacing human decision making with a computer is going to be harder now there are ancillary benefits that are almost more interesting other than these sort of labor market questions right ai could reduce barriers to communication in polyglot cities by you know breaking language barriers could reduce the cost of driving with autonomous vehicles and it could conceivably improve the delivery of urban services so this just shows the geography and this of course comes from the the the paper that was just given right this looks like a pretty urban thing to me when i see these spots it doesn't look to me like this that there's a a huge sense in which this is primarily about low density parts of america at least in terms of current ai employment these are the just the graphs that jenny showed you again this enduring role for distance again suggests that you know ai and face-to-face contact may well be compliments rather than substitutes and of course these highly skilled immigrants that gordon hansen told us about right these are disproportionately urbanites right in terms of where they're coming and that's certainly what bill kerr's work on skilled immigrant entrepreneurs is showing us as well so this again points to complementarity now there are things that i am deeply skeptical in the ai triumphalism view so i am deeply skeptical that in fact you know ai is going to make it easier for low-skilled immigrants to get by without knowing english right the complementarity between skills and technology is enormous this just comes from the use of remote work right which is a very simple form of these technologies during may 2020 which was the acme of remote working in the u.s during this time period 68.9 of americans with advanced degrees were working remotely whereas only five percent of americans were high school dropouts were working remotely the idea that you're going to have a lot of high school dropouts who are going to be using ai to deal with their language problem just seems totally implausible to me um and i think as well there's a huge human capital issue in terms of governments that i'll return to in a second now autonomous vehicles are real right they may well in fact if they ever get through urban regulations it may well end up making urban traffic congestion worse because the primary impact of an autonomous vehicle will be to lower the cost of sitting and traveling which will traffic which will have a huge behavioral response as we know from the work of durant and turner each vehicle mile built increases the the 10 increase in vehicles miles built increase the number of drivers vehicle miles traveled by 10 right behavioral responses in traffic are huge and unless we introduce autonomous uh congestion pricing into autonomous vehicles from the beginning i think this is likely to be a disaster for urban traffic so that's i think the thing that i worry about most in the case of schools and policing maybe something good will come out of it but uh it's likely to be done by something outside of government rather than in government itself so ai and urban governments and here i'm following off on the discussion about targeting in togo a discussions the scope is enormous right fixing potholes targeting welfare as the prediscussion assessing home values i've done some work on this improving bus service but the public sector has effectively tenured workers who have no affinity for new technologies uh you know i wrote a paper once with mike luca where we were looking at you know giving people giving the the restaurant inspectors in boston algorithms to enable them to find out places that were more likely to have have violations this was a this was a terrible mistake the truth of the matter is they weren't even going to implement the simplest of all algorithms which would just go to the place that you had a problem with last year which would have gotten you 90 of the way there and they weren't willing to do that the best case is usually for the government to allow private providers like the fintech story with ppp or when the mbta went when the boston bus and train service just streamed their data and all of a sudden within a week you had a huge number of apps like where's my bus but of course the private entities are not uh benevolent social planners and the the political and regulatory barriers to change are going to be enormous and this is the overwhelming issue with av on roads so i i think about you know we also want to think about what ai is going to do to low density america autonomous vehicles are more likely to be a shock to inter-urban rather than intra-urban transport think buses and trucks on dedicated lanes going at a fast rate state between cities that's very likely to be an easier thing to permit um many of the higher-end logistics or other decision-making work that's done outside of cities seems like it's much easier to replace by ai than the more interactive urban equivalents also these things are far more predictable again following up on deming right other less skilled jobs that predominate low low density areas like call center work that's very likely to be doable by a machine right and if you think about it if skill jobs outside of cities are going to vanish more then the resulting brain drain will cause even more difficulties in lower density america and i just want to end with this picture right i believe very strongly that america's largest unsolved social problem over the last 40 years has been the rise of prime mage male joblessness that's a very non-spatially neutral thing and it is overwhelmingly you know one in four prime age males and are in many of these areas are jobless and in some sense it leads you to ask i i have no doubt that both less skilled and more scaled people in the densities of the coast will find creative ways to to work in the great urban service sectors to work in a combination of decision making and interaction which is after all what cities are all about but i don't know in a world of you know automation in a world of artificial intelligence what that leaves for anyone to do in west virginia or eastern kentucky or even in the less field rust belt cities and so i believe strongly that that ai like the past 40 years of communications technology and other i.t innovations will likely be in urbanizing rather than a de-urbanizing force thank
