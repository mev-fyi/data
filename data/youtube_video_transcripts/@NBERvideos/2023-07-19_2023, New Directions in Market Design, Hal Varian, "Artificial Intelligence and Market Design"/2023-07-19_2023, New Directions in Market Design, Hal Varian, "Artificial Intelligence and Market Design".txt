okay thank you in fact it goes the other way too because you have a lot of plugins to the AI system so for example gtt3 is now using Mathematica which improves its computational ability quite significantly and and I think I think you'll see a lot of these hybrids uh both ways okay so this is uh called artificial intelligence and Market design and uh I decided ah I decided that uh my strategy would be I'd listen to all the comments about AI that are made and then disagree with them all but AI has hardly been mentioned just a few times that the sessions I had to come up with something with a little more content than that before I get to it I do want to say I'd like to emphasize the issues and ideas I'm going to discuss are my thoughts only and do not in any way reflect the views of my employer so I've made the offering there um okay so artificial intelligence when the last 10 years we've seen these incredible breakthrough applications starting with computer vision by uh the Jeff Hinton and his group in Toronto and it's really been quite remarkable how quickly that evolved into these uh more what should I say creative models that have been developed so you see that breakthrough applications in chess and go protein folding which is said to be a 50-year advance on what we could do prior to that weather forecasting has improved dramatically and of course our friends to chat Bots who have entertained 100 million people and uh in the last few few weeks on mechanism design I'd say it's a older in the last 20 years the mechanism design has moved from Theory to practice as we saw today that's the bottom line message I got out of the discussions and we've heard compelling examples there too in a number of things environment education housing spectrum and many many others so it's a great accomplishment but our punishment is now we have to deal with the real world before they were just nice beautiful little economic models but I think a theme that's run through all of these presentations have been well that's the first step but to really make it useful you've got to add flexibility to it you've got to make it work in environments where it doesn't work already and this was a great example of the approximations you had to make it ended up being really good approximations but uh they were not part of the sort of textbook approach um so I said I wanted to talk about primarily about AI almost well very little a little bit about mechanism design since I'm supposed to try to combine the two uh and I'm going to discuss military applications now military applications are very very important uh there's a great deal of interest in this around the globe and I'm including not only the uh conventional Warfare but also terrorism riots gangs all sorts of conflict resolution issues and the question is do we have anything to say about this I would hope so since it is such a large section of the economy uh the things that we've talked about should apply in that context both in the AI as you'll see in a few minutes and on the mechanism mechanism design and we're seeing that of course in the Ukraine with the Drone Wharf Wars I mean it's amazing those were not conceived of as a as a tool that was ready for deployment but it has been of course used quite successfully and we're going to see more of that in the future I'm afraid than uh than we would like but we we will simply have to learn to learn to live with it so what is the role of Game Theory and mechanism design in the military well I want to start out with a little historical look at that there's a paper in the Jep called The Gift of Mars and the premise there is that wartime conflict has been a huge driver for innovation in fact he argues the author argues that that's uh that is why Western Europe became Advanced earlier than other areas because they were in this continual Warfare that but on a continual push on making the uh on Innovation essentially um but if we look at more recent history uh look at Rand many of you have been involved with Rand in one way or another reading working papers journals talking people reading things that were developed there that was established in 1945 just at the very end of World War II because the people had realized how much technology contributed to the success in World War II radar being one common example but also Game Theory and here here's what they said they said at the very end of World War II rand's mission was connecting military planning with research and development decisions uh so the primary goal they'd had so much success working with the technologists during the war that they want to make sure that that would continue in the future as a deterrent to Future Wars which more or less I mean it did to some extent uh and it was only much later that Computing economics policy and so on came became part of rand's portfolio it started out as a way to coordinate academic research and Military needs so if if conflict can be analyzed using Game Theory which is their View and I think many of us would hold exactly the same view um then what is the analog of mechanism design in that context because remember you're applying Game Theory to a to a situation and I think if you look at things like arbitration and treaties and diplomacy and negotiations and contracts all of these ways you coordinate activity those are a kind of mechanism design in my view and they're particularly appropriate in this artificial intelligence context why because one of the things that we know you can do with these generative models is that you can manage large documents you can look things up you can create the documents you make them longer you can make them shorter you can do all sorts of manipulation is going to help in dealing with coming to an agreement or coming to a situation where you can uh use the document to govern future activity and the hope is that the generation of treaties and the generation of the uh arbitration and diplomacy uh context you can end up with something that is helpful in terms of preserving uh the peace so that's the story of World War II what happens subsequently well DARPA which was the defense Advanced research projects agency has continued to work with the research community in a variety of ways most importantly is they deployed the internet so why was the internet deployed there's lots of myths floating around what happened was Japan was making a lot of advances in super Computing the US decided to build super Computing Senators the academics and other researchers could use and they couldn't build one at every University so they built I think about a dozen of them and then put them all in a network the internet and that was the start the backbone of the internet was basically arpanet or darpanet as it was called a little later and there were three search engines that came out of uh DARPA there was a once they did the digital Communications problem once they'd solved that using the internet then there was uh the issue of where do you get the contact that goes on to that Network and that's what prompted DARPA and the NSF to create the digital library program which was created I think in 1995 or 1994. and uh that uh that Innovation that funding is what led to three computer three search engines one namely Google uh ink to me Google from Stanford and to me from Berkeley and lycos which was Carnegie Mellon actually lycos was already going by the time the digital library came around as a commercial Enterprise with the people involved in lycos at CMU also worked with the researchers at uh act who who were funded by the digital library programs so what's the role of AI in international conflicts that was a question I set for myself that said I was supposed to try to relate the two uh to two concepts um closet said a famous quote war is a mere continuation of policy with other means okay now my response is that may be true but Wars ends sooner or later what policy goes on forever so one of the things is that the innovations that come from creating the mechanism design problems that are appropriate and used for for the military also spill over to the civilian sector and I think stimulate research in a way that can that that has been very very fruitful in the past and perhaps the AIS can play a positive role and making the documents the documents I referred to before easier to write easier to translate either should understand and easier to bear compliance and Susan mentioned the point earlier that as you have new Innovations you can observe the functioning of the uh in in the mechanism design problems and see whether people are consistent with the policies that they're supposed to be following and of course that's done a little differently in the private sector in the military sector but the goal is really the same now document management may sound pretty mundane but when you think about the world really runs on Exchange of documents and those are contracts in the private sector and their treaties in the international diplomacy sector so all sorts of uh all sorts of things and there has been I think some quite interesting analysis this emerged in the last uh really few years just four or five years about the role of Technology especially AI technology in the uh military uh in Industries let me recommend a new book book called four Battlegrounds power in the age of artificial intelligence it's a little bit of a glitzy title but it's actually a very good book and I think you would find it interesting if you want to pursue uh some of these some of these topics now one of the themes that shows up in that book is emphasizing the fact that AIS are different from humans in very important ways and so when conflict arises there's going to be not like meeting light but like me unlike so you've got a more complex environment first if you look at ai's they're hyper rational so that means a game theory could apply a better framework to understanding strategic AI behavior and of human behavior because the AI behavior is generally much more predictable than the human behavior and I'll give some examples uh in a few minutes in fact I wrote about this uh this idea way back in 1994 wrote a paper on mechanism designed for computerized agents and what it said is game theory has been justly criticized for its hyper-rational view of human behavior and I think all of us who worked with real data that's supposedly modeling recipients of Grants and housing and all this other stuff that we've heard about over the last two days it's clear that you can't really model the humans as hyper-rational but hyper-rationality may be appropriate for choices made by software agents since they presumably have a much better computational power than human human beings although I guess I can ask what was you wanted four plus four or two plus two and sometimes needed a little work on getting that to function correctly but but the it's working much better now so second point about AI is how they're different than humans they don't make mistakes now they can be mistaken they can be fed information it's not accurate that's certainly possible but they don't uh Make Mistakes by pushing the wrong button because they're too tired to function or they're they haven't had something to eat or all all these sort of little things that can distort uh Behavior and the computers are generally the AIS are generally going to do it uh with uh more accuracy so a more important point is that they can train themselves and this is how deep mine was able to conquer go and chess for example and the application of adversarial AI where you're pitting uh AIS against each other is a really effective way of doing simulation and strategic analysis as demos Demus hazovis has said if you program AI to play chess in the morning by lunch it can beat most players and by evening it's stronger than the world champions uh and I don't think he's really exaggerating I think that's pretty much a day's worth of of this uh learning can give you adversarial AI can give you really truly remarkable uh results and fourth this is a very important difference between the humans and the AIS the AIS don't care if they survive or not whereas humans care quite a bit about this and if you look at the difference you know one human doesn't exactly replace another but one AI can exactly replace another AI so what is the cost or should be taken into account with the calculation of something that risks the existence of the AI well it's just a cost of building a new Ai and that can be really quite small well that gives the AI a huge advantage in the bargaining in almost any kind of bargaining if the bargain is we're bargaining over something and my adversary says I'm going to blow up myself and you well we're at a Nash equilibrium right it's just not some game perfect and the same thing happens you think about the AI choices are all done in a very very different manner than the human choices a nice example from the book I mentioned earlier was a used flight simulators and we're pitting an AI program to human program and AI one all of them I won all of the battles so why was that because the maneuver it was using was forbidden to be used by the human pilot because it was too dangerous and that was not a concern for choosing what strategy to follow for the AI so um yes I call that artificial bravery that's supposed to be funny but maybe not all right so but they're different in lots of ways that was just one example another example where they play chess differently they play Go differently they fly the fighter jets differently and um experts who study alphagos playing style described it as alien that is something that no human would play you know around ago in that manner or from an alternative Dimension which is another term used by the go experts and the chess people said the same way I've never seen a move like that conducted in chess so it's like meeting an alien race that does things differently like playing chess playing go playing poker all of these things could be different and of course fighting Wars and engage in this kind of conflict that's why I said you've got different different approaches because of these distinctions and how AIS compare to humans um most of the not all of these differences I should say between the humans and the AIS operate to the advantage of the eyes just because we're different doesn't it doesn't make it clear who's going to be in the in the Winner's Circle uh in our conflict um the performance of AIS tends to be very brittle okay so what do I mean by brittle well I'll take an AI That's trained on the go board the the standard measure is 19 by 19 cells and you give it that if you give it the 19 by 19 cells what you'll see is a uh my machine do very very well but if you moved it to 13 by 13 or a trainer board they would just be terrible easy to beat by a human being and there was a great example of DARPA Engineers who designed an algorithm that detected soldiers uh and dark and on adverse conditions and so on and he challenged got eight Marines and said I'll give a hundred dollar prize to whoever gets to that pushes the button over there in the traffic circle so what happened was not a single Marine was detected why was that well they disguised themselves one of them put a box cardboard box over his head the other one put branches of trees tree branches around his body so it looked like a tree that was moving um two of them somersaulted for 300 meters to get to the prize machine didn't recognize them in fact I think this is an explanation of why Congress is so concerned about Tick Tock I think they're worried that some North Korean soldiers could learn how to dance by saying Tick Tock and then they could just Waltz right across the DMC you heard it here first all right um let's see I'll say one last word about terrorism so we now know that planes cars tracks tractors all these vehicles are in fact potentially lethal weapons they've been used in that way in the past and they had the unfortunate characteristic that the pilot of the car or the tractor or whatever basically was committing suicide in many of these cases and that deterred a lot of these terrorist acts but if you have autonomous vehicles then that problem goes away it's the same thing that I mentioned earlier so that's going to mean that you really have to design these autonomous vehicles of All Sorts in a way that's highly secure to present them from being hijacked and used for other nefarious purposes so earlier I mentioned the famous quote from classwoods the war is mere continuation of policy through other means the policy is also a way to avoid War these treaties that's their goal is to do that so they can be improved for better rules for detection translation deployment avoidance and so maybe these generative AIS could be useful in both war and In Peace So that's my talk
