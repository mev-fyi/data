since he left mit in the mid 1990s we were we were colleagues for about i don't know maybe 12 13 years and we had probably daily uh discussions conversations not quite the word discussions about economics and they were always uh incredibly exciting and surprising and when you talk to julio you would say something you did not expect it was it was different and it was not different to be different it was different because julio thought about things in in a different way and very often he was completely uh completely right [Music] going to i know i had another sentence here which i've forgotten so i'm going to yeah so what i said about the discussions we had applied applied to his research he was made the distinguished fellow of the american economic association last year and the description said that he was one of a preeminent new keynesian economist and i think that actually not at all the right description in the sense that yeah he did some important work with michael uh whitford on on new keynesian stuff but for he was much broader and than the very dry new keynesian framework uh which uh has made it to to the textbooks and uh and elsewhere and he was willing to go to places where i think very few of us were willing to go for example fairness in pricing something that we think is relevant but we're very scared of touching our altruism in wage determination so all the places where we think these things are important but we don't know how to do it he actually plunged and there's a stream of papers uh which are all as as original as as they can be so i think there was again much more to julio than the description which has been given uh of him in uh in the uh american economic association and there was something different and important about julio that he was a it was his kindness and his smile and uh i had an email from jordy gary who said that he that julio was the only economist he know he knows who always smiled and it's true he had this nice smile which basically was more an invitation for you to talk to him and have a discussion and he kept it consistently in a profession in which sometimes uh egos have a way of going wild he had as far as i can tell no ego he was perfectly happy to be himself and just talk and when you talked to him he listened he android he made you feel smarter and he never made you feel bad even if you said something completely stupid there was something very special about him so for all these reasons uh i'm very sad that he's not with us and i'll continue to think about him so with this i'm going to do something that he probably would not have approved which is to talk about the topic which you saw the title of macro and distortions so udon bush gave me very strong he gave me a lot of advice on many things strong advice and one of his advice is never talk about methodology just do it i think but just do it it's not his but that's what what he meant just do it and if people like it they like it if they don't uh don't so i'm i'm going to do it i'm going to do the methodology i'm going to talk about methodology although i think it might not be very wise i think his advice was good this is a very tough crowd to try things on and my ideas are still quite fuzzy so the combination may not may not lead to a complete success but we'll we'll see so the theme of of a talk is uh in that side which is i think there has been convergence about the way we think about macro uh which is we start with the general equilibrium model and then we think hard about which distortions are relevant and then we look at the effects of sharks with those distortions and the question is do we have at this stage the right distortions now what do i mean by this i mean it's clear that we have large moles which have many many distortions but what are the fundamental distortions which basically we need to explain fluctuations do we have the right ones or not and i'm going to argue that maybe not although i'm not going to give you the list of what we should have i think that's that's too hard but so let me let me go back a bit a bit in history when i took when i took macro in in the early 70s the approach was quite different and you basically had a lot of good partial equilibrium pieces on consumption behavior on investment behavior there was a jargons in the whole paper which was the standard reference on the wage price spiral separately and so on so many of these moles actually had a fairly tight theoretical structure but when it came to actually putting things together then the tight theoretical structure was in the background and the models were a list of behavioral equations which were plausibly derived from theory and then the general equilibrium law was was stimulated there was no i don't remember hearing the word distortions uh as playing an important role in the way people thought we had good behavioral equations and that was it then something happened which is that because of bob lucas in particular there was a focus on abdominal rigidities and then there was a set of moles i think the three moles that uh that i have in mind here the lucas imperfect information you can perfect information more and then the fisher and taylor more on the uh on the fixed price uh or wage decisions uh and these malls did the right thing they said well if we want to understand nominal rigidities why is it that prices don't adjust let's just simplify all the way and these ones were incredibly simple and they are basically the lucas one was a bit more complicated but basically two equations and there was one distortion about price setting of some sort or some some assumption about information and the discussion took place in that much simpler environment rather than the big moles it was exactly the thing to do in order to understand nominal rigidities then the next step was to integrate this with a general equilibrium mall in which you had optimized uh optimizing consumption and investment and the rbc mall was provided by prescott and then there was kind of a symbiosis of the rbc and the nominal rigidities which led to new keynesian law i've always thought that was a strange marriage and not couple the notion of the rbc is very pure normal rigidities is extremely ad a hock but the combination of both gave them all with equations which we could talk about but again it restricted the discussion very much to that environment and i think that although initially it was incredibly productive uh it became uh unproductive so for a while this looked like a winning strategy in terms of research of a great moderation indicated that things you know we understood things much better we knew how to do policy better in terms of mars that we were using this was very much a one distortion and one instrument world so one distortion was the nominal rigidity and the one instrument was the policy rate then you could kind of undo the distortion with the instrument not always exactly depending on the details but it was it was very close so this is the way a lot of monetary policy i think was was fought about which is again very very useful but incredibly reductive uh one distortion one instrument you can see that you're going to be able to do good things with that now what i say is is what is in hypothesis that's a bit of a caricature in the sense that small kind of dominated the central banks there was a lot of work at the margins on stuff which was probably relevant but it was not integrated so you know i have cited a few here ben anki gertler clearly on credit diamond de vega now on backgrounds home strong tier holland liquidity rottenberg woodford on markups which turns out i think to be an important issue but there was never any attempt to kind of integrate this you know more at least in a simple more in dsgs maybe but not in a simple not in a conceptual common conceptual frame but you know you don't argue with success uh great moderation was there the standard deviation of inflation decreased the standard deviation of output decreased so it looked like the mall was very useful uh it was declared a great success now what we know now i think is that it was maybe not not so much of a success i i made two points here the first one is i've been looking for the english word and i'm not sure if it's the right one but it was an insidious success in the sense that the arguments we gave phenomenal rigidities really suggested deviations from standard behavior which were relevant for other parts of the economy we just kept it to price and wage setting but if you thought if you stayed with the calvo specification yes but if you thought a bit more deeply about why it is that prices were not adjusted all the time but wages were not adjusted all the time it clearly had to do with bounded rationality with things that we didn't say but were probably the real reason and as soon as you said that it was not obvious why we should not apply this to consumption to investment to all the other pieces of so there was i always felt that there was a bit of attention but you know i lived with it and then basically the failure came which is the financial crisis showed that that mall just didn't capture something you know as you know until then inflation had been kind of under control mr tricia was extremely happy to basically have it at exactly two percent and there was a great success except that it did not prevent the financial crisis so i think that the financial crisis forced all of us to rethink a bit what we had done uh whether we liked it or we didn't like it it indicated that there were other things at play and rather obviously the financial sector was central that was kind of a minimal conclusion but there were deeper issues i mean when we started thinking about solvency and liquidity we realized that there were imperfections there which were important uh as i say here i was struck by the fact that when i taught you know i would talk i would have one lecture about backgrounds but i saw this as a rather isolated issue yes banks have demand deposit so there is an issue but it's easy to solve you basically just provide liquidity or provide provide deposit insurance and basically you're done i think what we learned is that the issue behind bankruptcy is much more general that liquidity issues affect all kinds of decisions all kinds of financial uh actors it's really something fundamental to the economy so we had dismissed it which said we know how to handle it but it turned out that you know the discussion about lehman today was it liquidity or was it solvency basically was about about issues like this so this made me think okay so what was the role of the distortion we had insisted so much on previously naming nominal rigidities and i don't have the answer to this but i think it's a good question which is how would the financial crisis have looked if there were no nominal rigidities how much of a down uh turn would we have and would we have recovered faster than we did this is a way of saying that maybe that other distortion is really just very very important maybe not important all the time but surely it was absolutely central i think you could probably tell the story of the financial crisis image dominant rigidities were not of the essence they played a role but they did not have essence so so what happened well in the there was a lot of partial equilibrium work on the macro financial linkages which is i think very exciting and then the dsgs were repaired but i think i'm i'm tempted to put repaired in in quotes which is okay so we need a financial sector they just put some kind of something like piano gertler in it and then see whether we can kind of fit the data better but when it came to the core model that we use not the big machines i'm afraid that we never integrated this second of distortions in in the mall and the question is should we should we basically extend a set of distortions again in a big mall there can be many but in a way we uh say we teach uh first-year college students what other distortions that we really think should be there in the mall that we teach and i think that's that's an open issue so one possibility is well we basically have on overemphasized nominal rigidities and really and there are people in this room i think who would say well we probably can explain the world without nominal rigidities i still think this is a preeminent distortion i just do not as much as i've tried to look at the world without nominal rigidities and explain it i've not been successful i mean i give you you know three other standard reasons for why i just cannot do without nominal rigidity the first one is is well known it's the ability of central bank to basically keep the nominal rate of the real weight more or less as they want not forever we know that but for a very long time which presumably they could not do if there were no nominal rigidities the second is the co-movement in investment consumption that we see in response to good news or bad news which again is difficult to explain surprisingly difficult to explain without aggregate demand and nominal rigidities playing a role and then the third is an older line from michael musa which is the amazing difference in the behavior of real exchange rates depending on the exchange rate regime uh whether it's floating or fixed basically enormous differences and again let's say nominal something plays a plays a big war so my sense is we have to keep it as as the main one the question is uh what others as the main one i like most of you i'm extremely unhappy with the calvo specification i mean it works it's marvelous it gives you a simple equation but it's clear that that there's much more uh behind it and so i think we have to go back and and think harder and then draw the conclusions for the rest of the economy if it's bounded rationality then clearly we should apply this to consumption for example something like this are there other distortions which are essential my sense is yes and rather than speculate i thought this is a next to last slide i would show how i can look at a particular macroeconomic event or of fact uh with four different lenses depending on distortion that i look at so one thing we know is that the neutral rate of interest has been coming down and is very low so i think that we will accept that you know i have this picture of not the neutral rate but the actual policy way will go uh the one-year interest rate uh which is the red line and as you can see it's basically expected to be very low for a very long time the blue line i'll come back to it in a second is the gold freight so basically looking forward we expect the growth rate to be super fairly substantially above the real interest rate the real policy rate so the question is what do we do with that fact so if i'm kind of a straight new keynesian unimaginative uh macroeconomics in the sense i take them all as it is and i just don't try to extend it then what is the issue here well the issue is that the rate the neutral rate may be negative we may not be able to achieve it and i focus on the zero lower bound and i spend my time thinking really hard about forward guidance as a way of getting expectations up or i do qe if i'm willing to relax the assumption of perfect substability between the assets but that's that's the focus right that's what you do if normal rigid is is what you care about what you think is the main distortion okay but it seems to me that there are other ways of looking at it and they lead to very different answers the second one is i would say finite lives i don't know if life finite lives can be considered a distortion that's near here that's near that's nearly philosophical but finite horizons for whatever reason so even if we live very long lives we may not look very far in the future is an environment in which strange things can happen in particular there can be dynamic inefficiency and there's a temptation to look at the graph that i showed you and say well maybe what we have is an economy which is dynamically inefficient right so the distortion in this case is very different from nominal rigidities it has to do with basically oversaving by people who are currently alive if this is it then it seems in the policy recommendations are completely different from forward guidance or anything like this right basically there's too much capital in the economy and the government should basically issue that on a diamond in order to reduce uh to it to increase the equilibrium rate now i think unfortunately well fortunately unfortunately this is not the reason why what you saw in the autograph happened because one of the things that we have to introduce i think in any more that we play with is the difference from the marginal product of capital and the policy rate the safe rate and the evidence is overwhelming that the marginal product of capital at least the average product of capital is substantially above the growth rate so we're not in a dynamically inefficient environment so that some of what you would do in that environment you should not do that still still leads you to think quite differently about fiscal policy but not quite in the same way as you would do on the dynamic inefficiency so this is a distortion which if it was relevant you know gives you a completely different way of thinking about policy and then the the third one which i think is very relevant as opposed to the second which could have been but is not is that there's a just a very large liquidity or risk premium between the policy rate and uh and the marginal product of capital so you know there has been some work by people in this room thinking about the demand for safe assets and so on and if this is the case i think what the configuration that we're in is that the marginal product of capital is probably greater than the gulf rate it is greater than the growth rate and the growth rate is greater than r and we have these two inequalities and then the question is what kind of policies you think about and it seems to me again that you think about very different policies from uh the first two you basically ask and you basically go back to the prescott equity premium puzzle and you say well you know why is it so large uh is it so i don't think that and had the answer uh but you know it seems to me it has to do with plumbing of financial markets but that leads you to look there it could be that this is the right premium in which case there's nothing to do in terms of policy or it could be that it is then there are distortions which into a large premium and then you think really hard about how can i decrease the premium which would lead the positive rate to be higher and the marginal product maybe to be a bit a bit lower in that environment also even if you don't solve that you have this possibility that the government can finance itself at rate r and therefore can sustain any level of debt and basically because for the government as opposed to for the government what's relevant is the rate at which it borrows which is r and if it's less than g then that is sustainable no matter how much of a deficit you run now again we have to think about whether this is really the case or there's uncertainty and they cannot hold forever but it leads you in the direction of thinking about whether the government should actually issue that and just roll it over and never pay it back is it good is it bad in that context it's likely to be bad because full employment you're going to basically take something something else is going to decrease and if it's private investment then mpk is greater than our and that's not uh you're basically decreasing the marginal product of capital which is not working but this is just an example of how basically looking at the same fact but extending the set of distortions to include things that we often don't include in our mouth you need you led to very different conclusions in terms of monetary policy or fiscal policy and i think there's a conclusion side which is a non-conclusion sign so i don't know what the answer is uh again maybe this is not the right way to think about maybe we can't have a core model maybe we have to deal with kind of dsg fairly large things which have the distortions we want but i suspect that that's probably not not not the answer what i'm sure of is that we have to move away from basically the new kensington framework because this notion that there's just one distortion it's actually one distortion and a half because there's monopolistic competition but it doesn't play much of a role uh is is just makes things too good for the central banks and basically you know the usual one instrument what target and you get very close to what you want that's clearly not right and so the question is what distortion should we put in the in the law that we teach on the more that we use to think about things it could be that most of the time normal rigidities is really the dominant one and in special times the others coming or it could be that they're all very relevant i don't know i don't have the answer to this i just wanted to to present the case so i'll stop there
