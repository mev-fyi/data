led to unprecedented policy intervention from the Federal Reserve in March 2020 that Allen discussed in his paper yesterday and that helped mitigate significantly the outflows from Mutual Funds as well as the drop in prices and just so we're on the same page I plotted here the change in bond prices during spring 2020. so you can see how the market was sort of unraveling for bonds both IG investment grade and high yield and once the policy announcement happened the bond price dropped sort of uh reversed and at the same time you see significant outflows from mutual funds that were also mitigated by the policy announcement so teasing apart to this uh non-veg fragility is challenging because the flows and asset price movements are jointly determined in equilibrium so in this paper um this in this interaction is a key driver of Market fluctuations particularly in times of crisis so in this paper what we're going to do is ask the question how can we quantify these equilibrium effects disentangle them and think about assessing policy interventions in times of crisis specifically we're going to extend the demand-based asset pricing model that Ralph and Moto have developed and endogenize the distribution of wealth across funds and so we're going to use a household portfolio of choice to do this uh and this is going to create our the key mechanism in our model which is a two-layer demand system which is going to be driven in the first layer by a flow to Performance relationship where households are choosing funds and then an inelastic asset demand when uh institutions and funds are choosing assets so a preview of our key results we're going to find in our model this Dynamic amplification where asset prices when they drop that's going to lead to outflows from certain funds and that's going to amplify price drops further we're also going to show evidence of contagion where even if the shock is initially started only in one asset class it can spread to other asset classes and across institutions our model is also going to yield some fragility measures where we're going to be able to quantify how different assets have a bigger effect on the overall Market given the distribution of What kinds of funds hold them and finally we're going to be able to evaluate different policy responses to crises that affect the corporate bond market such as asset purchases and conventional monetary policy our paper is going to contribute to three strands of the literature we're contributing to this literature on on asset uh demand system asset pricing there are many people in the audience who worked on this so this is ralphamoto's work uh and also Lorenzo and Lucas I think we're in the audience by endogenizing the Dynamics of how the wealth distribution of funds is determined second we're going to contribute to this literature on non-bank intermediaries by thinking more about how institutions demand for the inelastic demand for assets is going to affect their fragility and finally we're going to contribute to this literature on the role of uh Financial intermediaries in crises by focusing on those unlevered uh intermediaries like mutual funds so I'm going to start with a theoretical framework I'll talk about estimation and I'll end with a crisis and policy counterfactuals so the first layer of the theoretical framework starts uh the first layer is essentially going to determine how the fund wealth is distributed starting with households who have some exogenous wealth that choose the institutions to put their money in based on characteristics X that include importantly past returns but also other fun characteristics then I can write down a nice closed form logic expression for the weight of each institution eyes liabilities in the household H's portfolio I can then write down an expression for how much that each household demands in shares of the liability in terms of the quantity of shares by adjusting with the household's wealth and the price per share the second layer is going to look very similar but the second layer is going to determine how funds make their portfolio decisions so institutions are going to choose assets to maximize their indirect utility based on characteristics of the assets including price and other non-price characteristics this is going to again give us a closed form expression for the weight that each asset has in each institution's portfolio which then again Aggregates into the number of Total Bonds that each institution demands based on the wealth of the fund and the price of each asset so these are the two layers and to clear the market we first have to clear institutional liabilities so that the total supply of institutional liabilities have to equal the demand that households have and the markets for the assets also clear where the total supply of given assets are going to equal the demand across all institutions here we're going to have zero net issuance but we can easily extend the model to include issuance if we want so we're going to uh characterize equilibrium Dynamics in a nice closed form Way by making two key Transformations if you're interested the derivations are in the paper but essentially what we're going to do is I think about aggregating up the flows and prices into Matrix form where we have a vector of flows for each fund and then we have a vector of prices for each asset and we're going to look at things in terms of changes so we want to look at Dynamics so we're going to look at how prices change from Team period T minus 1 to T and so this allows us to write down in Matrix form the two key dynamics of an equilibrium of the model which is first how do changes in prices across all assets in the previous period effect flows into and out of institutions in this period and then in turn how do flows in this period affect prices in this period okay so how first how do changes in prices last period affect flows in this period well that's the Matrix Phi which is going to aggregate the flow to Performance sensitivities what we call beta across all funds and it's going to be weighted by how much each asset is in the portfolio of each of the funds and so we're essentially aggregating up how much changes in prices across all assets affect the flows of each individual fund next how do flows affect prices that's going to be this Matrix PSI which is essentially a price impact Matrix and it's going to first aggregate across for each asset uh who holds what funds are holding that asset what are the holding shares of that Bond times the sort of price impact which is the inverse demand elasticity as price impact is always the inverse demand elasticity and you can think of the demand elasticities as being the own price elasticity how much I change my demand for Bond B when Bond B price changes and the cross price elasticity how much do I change my demand for Bond B when Bond a price changes so this is going to be my price impact Matrix and these two equations are going to be the core of how uh shocks and policy changes affect our the prices and fund values in our model so the model is going to yield dynamics of both amplification and contagion so to show this more concretely I can write down an expression for the aggregate amplification and Contagion first by saying suppose there's some exogenous impact in asset prices let's call it V how does it affect things in equilibrium in the long run so if we go back to our equations from before if V is a change in price first it's going to affect flows by Phi then it's going to affect prices in this period by side so I just multiply by Phi and PSI right so I have the second round impact on prices it's just PSI times five times B then I can accumulate all of the effects in next periods into a nice geometric series that has a closed form expression that basically represents the full amplification and contagion effect of a given price stock V what's nice is then that gives us a an expression for what we call Asset fragility so given a price drop to a given asset what's the effect on the overall at the aggregate market so what's a one percent drop in one Bond value going to affect the aggregate Market and so we have this this core expression that I derived here we're going to weight it by the market share of each asset relative to the whole Market so you can think of this as saying if there's no amplification in Contagion in this expression is this this internal expression is one then the acid fragility is just one that's just the normalization so we're going to come back to this once we do the estimation but first let me demonstrate what the model does in Dynamics so we have an initial shock here say it's a 10 shock to high yields bonds only so on the left hand side I plot the Dynamics of bond prices from period one which is when the shock happens to period 10. and so the first thing you can see in pink where I have high yield bond prices is that there is an amplification effect so the initial shock is negative 10 but you can see the price continues to drop why because the mutual funds that hold the high yield bonds they experience a negative return in Period one when there's a fundamental price stock but then because of the negative return and because the households that invest in that institution now see a negative return and they want to take their uh they want to redeem their shares of that mutual fund then the mutual fund has to sell more high-yield bonds and that's going to reduce the price further that's where the amplification comes from moreover there's going to be a contagion effect because these mutual funds don't just hold high yield bonds they also hold an investment grade bond that they like to hold in a fixed proportion so they're going to also sell some investment grade bonds which is going to affect the investment grade bond prices so that's the cross asset contagion and because insurance companies primarily hold investment grade bonds and you also get across institution Contagion so to demonstrate why the first layer of the demand system is important if we shut down that first layer essentially just set the beta to zero then we see that drop in prices and we don't see any Dynamic amplification or contagion effects across assets or across institutions okay so that's the model so let's get to estimation so we're going to layer we're going to do it by two layers so the first layer is we're going to estimate the mutual fund flow sensitivities using crisp and Morningstar data so we can just look at a panel of flows and returns how does the flow in one period uh change relative to the returns from the previous period and then the second layer we're going to estimate demand elasticities using a method similar to what Ralph and Moto do and also Lucas and co-authors do um using Holdings data and instrumenting for Price using the wealth of investors that have that Bond class in their investment Universe in that period okay so a summary of our estimates here from 2010 to 2019 is the price elasticities are and the Order of one insurers have lower elasticities than mutual funds and then the betas we're going to set ensure beta to zero and then the uh the betas for mutual funds are in the sort of 0.5 to 0.9 range okay so we can use these estimates to quantify asset fragility where we have an impact again of one percent drop in bond value on aggregate Market and so you can see if we just look at four different asset classes high yield bonds are more fragile than investment grade and short-term bonds are more fragile than long-term bonds and importantly investment grade short-term bonds are also highly fragile primarily driven by the fact that they have a high share of a sort of flighty mutual funds that hold them great okay so now that we have the model and estimation we can add a crisis so this is the exciting part and then we can think about policy so we're going to calibrate uh for now to the spring 2020 crisis by first feeding in fundamental shocks that are implied by CDs we're just going to look at the first 10 days of CDs shocks and then we're going to use estimates of our elasticities and sensitivities from the end of 2019 as well as the wealth and asset distribution from the end of 2019 we're going to add an additional level of heterogeneity which is that asset demand might be sensitive to flows differentially and so we're going to calibrate the sensitivity to outflows in order to match the data what are we trying to match we're going to match first the total bond price decline in investment grade a pre-policy Intervention which was 20 percent as well as the 10 drop in mutual fund flows pre uh pre-announcement and we're going to match that investment grade bonds are sold first which was documented in chiron's paper with yuming and in Yao we're able to uh very closely match the Dynamics of prices and fund flows during this crisis sort of pre the policy so this is obviously we're not including the policy intervention here but now we can think about different kinds of policy intervention so we can start with say you have conventional monetary policy and you can put in a 100 basis point rate cut and in our model we can sort of test how timing matters so and the left hand side I'm going to look at the Dynamics of asset prices both investment grade and high yield on the right hand side I'm going to look at the Dynamics of fund values assets under management uh both for um insurance companies and for mutual funds the top panel is going to look at intervening at the time that the FED actually intervened which is about 14 days after the on-site of the crisis and the bottom panel looks at intervening really really fast sort of in the second day of when fundamental shocks start happening so you can see here that the rate cut is going to have broad effects it's going to have a stronger effect for longer duration assets just by definition of a rate cut and so because investment grade or longer duration that's going to have a much bigger impact here and you can see in the short term there is some benefit to intervening early but the ultimate steady state values don't change significantly based on the timing of the policy so next we can look at asset purchases so this is closest to what the Federal Reserve actually did so they um here we're looking at buying the Central Bank bot five percent of short-term IG bonds so short-term meaning less than five years and so this is a on the order of magnitude of what they said that they would potentially do and so again these are the same four plots and you can see this is a smaller rebound partially because the short-term IG sector is not that large and you're only targeting them you're not targeting the entire Market and the timing here matters little for the eventual rebound so there's maybe less pain in the short term but in the end you end up with similar prices and fund values so next so this is closest to what the Federal Reserve actually did in in terms of announcement uh next we can look at sort of more counterfactual policies and um the first one we think about is if we if the Central Bank were to open direct lending collateralize lending to the non-bank intermediary sector so the Federal Reserve did not do this but this has been proposed and analyzed at the ECB for example which is suppose the the funds just the mutual funds here are able to borrow from the FED directly to the amount of two percent of their investment grade assets so depending on how much they hold that's how much they can they can borrow and here intervening early is a lot more effective because what happens is the outflows are directly counteracted by The Lending if you do it early you're going to reduce a lot of that painful price drop and fund outflow contagion effect so here the timing actually matters significantly so it's how do we think about comparing these policies so the policies I proposed are also of different magnitudes what's nice about the model is we're able to derive an expression that tells us what is which policy has the biggest bang for its buck so we're able to normalize for the actual dollar spent by the central bank uh and here on the y-axis is our measure of sort of bang for your buck and we can compare the interest rate cut to the asset purchases to direct lending relative to a theoretical maximum impact Benchmark if you were to perfectly Target those assets that are most fragile and here we find that at the purchases are very high impact even though they seem restrictive but part of that is because the short-term IG bonds are the most uh fragile or not the most fragile they're they're more fragile relative to long-term IG the interest rate cut the conventional monetary policy is less effective than directly trying to intervene in the mutual fund sector we have more policy counterfactuals in the paper if you're interested in looking okay but to uh close uh what this paper does is we're developing a two-layer asset demand system to try to analyze fragility in the corporate bond market we are able to generate tractable joint dynamics of asset prices and flows um and and show how crisis Dynamics unfolds the nice thing is that we can use Simple statistics that can be estimated from Micro Data and say something about quantifying fragility in the cross-section of both bonds and funds and hopefully glean some lessons for policy design so thank you so much
