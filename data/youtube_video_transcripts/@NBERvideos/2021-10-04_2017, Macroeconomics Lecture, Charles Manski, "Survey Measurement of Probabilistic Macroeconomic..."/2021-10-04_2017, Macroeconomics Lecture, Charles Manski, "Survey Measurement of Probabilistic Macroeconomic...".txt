survey measurement of probabilistic macroeconomic expectations so uh it's 20 minutes so i gotta decide how to use it um whether you're microeconomist a macroeconomist we all model people's expectations for the future as probabilistic expectations that's pretty much ubiquitous uh through at least applied economics um a distinction of course between microeconomists like myself and most macro people is that microeconomists uh tend to think of people as heterogeneous in uh many respects and preferences and expectations and and i think there's this particular and i'm going to argue strongly the good reasons why macroeconomists should uh think of expectations as being heterogeneous and sort of get away from representative agent type formulations uh there are two particular reasons why one is that people may have different knowledge of the state of the economy uh different private information but i think actually more important is people may have different beliefs about how the economy functions we may have different models in our head just like macroeconomists have different models in their head and when marty was talking about the kind of freshwater saltwater thing with the julio uh so there are people are different models of how the economy functions and so we may have different expectations now if you think that and if expectations are so uh critical to uh i mean if you're going to model decision making under uncertainty which we do all the time you have to think about expectations and expectations formation it might seem natural to have some data on expectations uh however that was ver quite that was rare until about 1990s and i'm going to discuss how that's changed at least for microeconomists uh the reason and i was taught this in graduate school that you know we're taught to be skeptical of subjective uh statements of any kind and uh students are taught that a good economist believes what people do not what they say i grew up with that and through the first half of my career i was a kind of devoted follower of that but then i realized that something was being lost which is that if you don't have data on expectations and if expectations are critical to your modeling then the only alternative is to make assumptions about expectations and then you have to ask about the assumptions and where they come from and whether you believe them and i became quite skeptical of the assumptions that were being made so let me talk just a bit about that um just to take one example income expectations take the literature on precautionary savings let's say grew up during the 1980s you have to think about people's income expectations you don't have any data on their income expectations so you have to form models of income expectations a very typical thing that began was to assume that people look at their past income realizations and then they use the past income realizations to forecast forward uh what their income will be but then the question is well how do they do that and if you look at the different models and i give citations in my paper to various models of the 80s and 90s you go to the literature and people had different models different stochastic processes for income so so we didn't know but we we just had we just made assumptions now for macroeconomist of course uh you know since the uh 1970s uh rational expectations assumptions have loomed uh very large and um i from very early on even uh i remember this back at cmu you know i i had to be somewhat skeptical of rational i understood the mathematical beauty of a rational expectations assumption but i had to be skeptical of its uh realism and and i want to argue you know strongly if if macroeconomists or economists more generally don't have consensus on how the economy functions then why should we expect that ordinary economic agents do so that's that's a kind of uh you know underlying argument if you ask well why don't we have consensus i'm a convertion so to me it's kind of obvious that we face influential problems my own work focuses on identification problems to get in the way of learning how the economy functions and then of course there are mundane problems of uh statistical and precision so uh so i have a lot i've long had a lot of trouble with rational expectations assumptions now given that the name i think well done so this led me about 1990 or so to think uh well maybe we should start measuring expectations and by the way i was mostly reacting to the use of rational expectations in uh micro structural econometric modeling not in macro analysis so i said well let's get some data well you go back and you say well there's a long history to this psychologists of a certain type have elicited subjective probabilities for literally over a century originally first with experts like weather forecasters but then with students in the lab among economists the measurement of expectations although not probabilistic measurements really gets going around 1950 with the consumer confidence surveys uh first at michigan and then the conference board and so on um where the probabilistic measurement begins and this is a paper that is really very unappreciated paper but really in retrospect i think a very important paper was tom juster at michigan and the general american statistical association in 1966 who uh who had been involved with the consumer confidence surveys in the 50s and he said this doesn't do it let's measure these things like consumer buying intentions probabilistically and i have to say for myself even though i knew tom jester earlier on i wasn't aware of his own his 1966 paper until the early 90s when i began working on this and that was actually quite embarrassing well since around that time roughly around 1990 90 there's actually been an explosion of work and i put here in bold by microeconomists to measure expectations uh in probabilistic form and now there's a huge literature and so that's what i want to talk about and its implications for possible implications for macro work so um what's going on by now there are many surveys eliciting probabilistic expectations just very quickly the kinds of topics that have drawn attention uh the risks that a person faces job loss crime victimization mortality future personal income including returns to schooling and pension income and so on uh future choices we ask people to predict their future behavior that's what tom justin originally did with buying uh intentions and also i've done work predicting asking people to predict future voting choices and some of them explicitly in macroeconomic events so uh there's a fair amount of work listening expectations probabilistically of equity returns and inflation the literature is by now big enough that there are multiple review articles i wrote an early one it was my fisher schultz lecture for the econometric society so it's an econometric back in 2004 and then three others mike heard in annual view of the other three in the anna review of economics mike focuses on work in the health and retirement study if you're interested in that adeline de la van focuses on work in developing countries where you may think this is more difficult to elicit probabilistic expectations but uh there's a large literature there and then uh shot andy shawter and trevino in uh the in review in 2014. very large literature that uh sorry was um uh mostly uh that was begun by andy schader in the early 2000s now does this in experimental economics in a lab context so this is a very very uh big literature by now and then in addition this work that's separated actually started earlier we have the survey of professional forecasters and some similar surveys in the uh in europe that have elicited probabilistic expectations for macro forecasters since the early 80s so there's a lot of stuff there's a list of some of the major surveys you can just look at them they don't have time to talk about them in general but these these are tens and tens of thousands of observations i don't think they uh marty and i often have discussions about what constitutes big data i'm not sure this constitutes big data but it's a lot of data okay it's it's it's many many thousands of observations in many circumstances and then there are a lot of one-time surveys for particular research projects where just people do their own surveys okay so that's all background okay now here's what's in this paper it's a big paper and obviously i don't go through it don't have time to go through it so i'm just going to focus in the little time i have on a couple of issues but just so you get a sense and i'll go through this table of contents very quickly just so you get a sense of what's out there this is i first describe what the modern micro econometric literature has been about early on a lot of the concern was just can you do this there was a lot of skepticism about whether you could measure these expectations and uh get sensible answers and uh the answer was yeah it basically did work not 100 but basically it worked so there's a lot of stuff on that descriptive analysis then of course there was interested in the accuracy of uh elicited expectations even you don't want to assume rational expectations but we do care how accurate expectations are in circumstances where you can compare them with realizations so there was a lot of work on that and then in terms of actually using the expectations that are for economic purposes um there's two streams of literature one uses the expectations directly to predict choice behavior you ask someone what's the chance that you will do something and then you use that as a prediction of what they do the more prevalent type of work is to use the expectations as an input into structural econometric modeling to replace the assumptions about expectations that are in structural micro models with uh data and then there's some work on analysis of expectations formation and i'm going to actually in this little time i have i want to really focus on expectations formation because i think it's particularly uh important for macro purposes okay then the paper goes on and talks about three topics that i think are more particularly relevant to a macro work one is expectations of equity returns i'll take a minute on that one is inflation expectations i won't talk about it all except to say that the major survey was begun at the new york fed in 2013 survey of consumer expectations um if you read what i write about it it's it's basically to show how careful they were in the design of this and i'll just emphasize this here if you get into this business you do not want to be sloppy about it paying attention to question wording how people respond and doing it right is very important the psychologists are historically good at this economist you know a little bit sloppier but some of us have uh you know taken this very seriously and the new york fed people i think are exemplary in their uh the way they designed their survey so you can read about that or they publish many papers that you can read directly there's the expectations of macroeconomic forecasters i'll say just a bit about that survey professional forecasters now all of this stuff that i've just said is uh takes as a maintained assumption that people do have probabilistic expectations and they accurately reveal the probabilistic expectations when you uh measure them however it's natural to ask whether that's the case so there is a literature this is not talking about section seven in the paper that goes underneath and says well what do we really know about what's going on in here how are people really responding to these questions this work on grounding uh that i've done and some other people have done this work on ambiguity so that's uh you know people having partial probabilistic expectations but not complete subjective distributions in their heads and then actually the hardest thing that i don't really know how to deal with uh but i think it actually raises quite a challenge is this work uh theoretical work and i mean jonathan's done some of this on uh confounding beliefs and uh preferences that that may be the basic conceptual distinction that we have long maintained an expected utility theory that there's expectations about a state of nature and that's there and then there's preferences over here and these are separate entities that maybe that doesn't actually hold so i'm not i don't have any time to talk about that but that's it's actually that's actually quite a challenge and then at the end then i do want to talk about expectations formation okay so that's the gist of what's in the paper as a whole going on equity returns this can be very quick about this equity returns are obviously uh uh expectations of them are thought to be a fundamental determinant of investment you know i have no formal background in finance but i've read some of the literature early on in finance theory the view was that expectations of equity returns would be homogeneous or if they don't start off as homogeneous that x post will be homogeneous you know driven by bayesian updating and so if you go back to as i read it shop and littener and uh and farmer and so on they basically say we don't have to worry about heterogeneity there's a there's a literature though that goes the contrarian literature that goes actually back to keynes and others in the 1930s and then through papers by miller and harris and revive and mesa and so on in the 80s and 90s that say that heterogeneity and expectations returns is fundamental to understanding asset markets and then particularly you can't explain volume of training of trading without heterogeneity so there's that so then you say well you then you'd want to have some data on uh expectations so jeff dominance and i uh we had our own survey of economic expectations and we started eliciting uh expectations back in the late 90s and then put these questions on the michigan survey just very quickly here's a kind of standard word and this is the one from the michigan question is the here's what the script that was read over the telephone to people you read it through yourself basically the question says you know if if someone were to put a thousand dollars in a diversified mutual fund what's the chance probability uh probability that it would be worth more than a thousand dollars nominally a year from now okay and then we also asked what's the chance to be worth more than 1100 1200 and you can fit a person-specific distribution function so that's the kind of work that we did and the various descriptive findings um don't know the time to go through it what jeff and i did based in our more most recent papers back in 2011 is we used the data to try to model expectations formation and we and we had longitudinal data so we could actually see revisions to expectations uh over a six-month period and we hypothesized and got some evidence that the population might be composed of a mixture of three types of people one one with a random walk model of in their head one with a kind of behavioral economics model of persistence that whatever has happened in the recent past will continue and one with the opposite behavioral economics uh model of mean reversion that if the market's been going up then people think about going down and that there will seems to be you know three different types of people forming expectations in three ways i'm going to have no more time to talk about this but i just want to say that as microeconomist we stop there if you're a macro person i think you might take this as a starting point from maybe perhaps modeling the dynamics in equity markets that if you see that there's going to be some unanticipated change then um what uh you know what's going to happen if the population is composed of these three types of people okay so 20 minutes isn't a long time and i can see i don't have i i was ready for this so i'm not going to talk about expectations of professional macroeconomic forecasters at all because i really do want to have my time at the end there's a couple of slides here to talk about expectations formation because i think this is probably the the bottom line for this for some at least for some of you here back in 2004 when i wrote my earlier review article i called for a study of expectations formation there have been some micro studies of expectations formation some since then but not very many and there remains a critical need for sustained research on expectations formation and i think it's even more important for macro work than for micro work on equity markets i just gave the reason right that how are you going to understand the dynamics of equity markets without understanding expectations formation so that's one example i give others in the paper now here's the interesting thing um i was a colleague of bob lucas um and i would see him over lunch i never actually read the 76 lucas critique paper until uh two or three months ago in preparation for this i mean everybody knew about it but i never actually read it and so i sat down and i said well what did bob actually say and you know it's quite a beautiful paper in some respects and i disagree with it in others it's quite uh beautiful in pointing out the importance of understanding expectations formation and um and in critiquing the lack of micro foundations and the existing econometric models at the time that's that's just wonderful but here's where i would part with i would have thought i never asked bob about this um and maybe is it if you take expectations formation is so critical then i would have thought perhaps he might have asked well why don't we get some data but that's not what he did instead he uh said very strongly that we should assume rational expectations and of course the uh literature went in that direction and we know why it's an analytically appealing uh assumption it enables you to close your model in a very nice way um however i you know and this is where from talking with marty i've learned some things i i recognize that the kind of if there was a period of dogma of rational expectations uh at that in carnegie mellon in the 70s it certainly was and uh you know and then maybe through the 80s and 90s but it's uh it's loosened up and i recognize that by now in macro theory there's lots of uh you know models of all kinds that deviate from rational expectations so that's good so i've looked at some of the recent stuff and i just give the ari paper by woodford and there's a paper that marty and bernstein rubello and this jl paper i've looked at a variety of these things there's a lot of macro theory out there um woodford raises what i think is very important question there's a proliferation of macro theory work that are deviations from rational expectations they go in many many different directions you know once you go away from that central model there's many ways you can do it and woodford asks well how are we going to separate among these to see what's really relevant so woodford actually uh calls for empirical analysis and i agree with that uh fully however so what i want to talk about is the nature of the empirical analysis that i think we uh need to do i i don't know you know woodford's a theorist i don't know what he had in mind exactly i assume it was revealed uh preference type analysis but um i don't think that just doing reveal preference analysis is going to be uh sufficient uh we need the data on expectations as well and and one and here on this slide i say i'll say very strongly that when i look at the recent macro literature even though there are deviations from rational expectations the representative agent an idea is still maintained in most of the literature that i've seen and of course representative agents ideas can simplify things quite a bit but i think you really need to move away from that i think the data is sufficiently strong that uh you really want to be careful with representative agent assumptions and worry about the robustness of your models to them so the idea then is since he says i only have a minute we should measure expectations particularly what i uh want to recommend is uh measurement of revisions to expectations after information shocks there are two different ways that that's been done in the micro literature neither one's perfect but they're both useful one is to do it in real time you have longitudinal surveys you uh measure initial expectations and then revisions after something happens um i give examples like before and after in the paper uh before and after 9 11 the revisions of the expectations of members of the surveyor professional forecasters panel and things like that the other thing you can do it in a survey you can give people information and immediately elicit their religious expectations in the survey okay but uh i'm gonna i am gonna finish here i'll be minus one minute maybe um i don't think it's going to suffice i i think measuring revisions to expectations will help but we what we also need and and this has not been done in the micro literature today but i think it's very important is to understand how people obtain and assimilate uh new information and here and i do not have anything constructive to say about this it's just bugging me all the time the standard way of modeling revisions to expectations is bayesian but to be a bayesian you have to have a well-defined sampling process that's generating the data so you can form a likelihood function and when i think about the kinds of data that people have from media reports and talking to other people in this i have a hard time for myself even thinking about how i might do bayesian updating i do updating in my head i know i go from prior to posterior myself but i can't figure out what likelihood function i'm using i don't know how i do it so so i think this is going to be a very difficult question how do people use information to update their ex
