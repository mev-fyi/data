thank you very much for inviting me to give this talk um I do hope it won't be a disaster what I want to do is talk about um the some work that I've been doing on disasters this is Joint work with Elizabeth frankenberger we co-direct this project and this is truly team science and the work I'm going to talk about today involves all the collaborators that you can see on this list so instead of talking about disasters in general I talk about a disaster that I know something about and that would be the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami this was a very large scale unanticipated negative shock um why do I want to talk about it I think it's important for us to understand the impacts of these kinds of shocks and lies and lovely livelihoods and while there are unique features to the 2004 tsunami um it's not a unique event the tsunami impacts on the um environment both the natural environment and the built environment parallel the effects of several of the uh disasters related to climate change inclusionally hurricanes flooding and sea water inundation and we know that those disasters are increasing both in frequency and severity what I'm going to do today is try and give a little bit of value added um to you by describing some impacts on population Health cognitive performance and some economic choices drawing on this broader research program that we've embarked on um so the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami it was a disaster it was devastating this is some of the debris um uh from a couple of years post tsunami at eight o'clock in the morning on the 26th on Sunday 26 December there was a 9.3 Rich scale earthquake off the coast of uh um uh Sumatra it shifted the North Pole by several centimeters at the time it was the largest earthquake ever recorded and it caused a spawned a tsunami that was felt across the entire Indian Ocean the um tsunami uh the earthquake was just off about uh just off the coast of Sumatra which is the north North most island of Indonesia the um earthquake the tsunami was felt right through to these Brown areas over on East Africa the epicenter was about 150 kilometers off the coast of our chain the tsunami surge was about 800 kilometers an hour and so it was only within about 20 minutes that after the earthquake the tsunami hit the um Coastline this is an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis the last tsunami that had been uh experienced on Mainland Sinatra was 600 years ago based on archaeological evidence and in addition it was um uh thought that the Pacific was not going to ever spawn a tsunami so therefore the Pacific had no early warning mechanisms any early warning boys that uh um would tell people about uh would inform people about a coming tsunami this was large and unanticipated shock some people who living on this Coastline along the east along the OS coast of Sumatra experience wave heights up to 15 meters um the mud reached up to about six kilometers in land at the worst areas and the coastline was permanently shifted by up to 1.5 kilometers it caused about 170 000 deaths that's about five percent of the population of archa 700 000 people were displaced and there was about 4.5 billion uh dollars worth of damage you know some guests there obviously it damaged the built infrastructure dramatically natural infrastructures dramatically and also reduced access to food water and markets some communities were completely devastated at the worst of communities there would have been um something like uh 60 to 70 of the population was was uh perished in the tsunami the tsunami was followed by a massive influx of Aid and assistance um about 7.2 billion was directed to Recovery in our chain or Sumatra initially for the first couple of years that was direct providing emergency food and uh temporary housing in camps and then later there were investments in infrastructure to rebuild the um uh um communities here you can see how bad the tsunami was this is villagers not from our study from different just from uh um um on the left hand side this is satellite imagery two days two three days before the tsunami and the right hand side is imagery three days after the tsunami the you can see that the um unbuilt environment was completely just wiped away the aquaculture was wiped away and the uh agriculture up in the top of um um uh uh plane up there the coastal plain up there was also just wiped away but there was also growth five years later you can see that although the coastline has shifted and the aquaculture never came back the village has been rebuilt albeit on different place and the roads are in different places and that's what you should be thinking about as This Disaster a complete disaster that turned uh productive assets into Brown Earth and then some rebuilding post-disaster um this was called build back better and it's one of the largest reconstruction efforts in developing country so let me talk about data or the data that we're going to talk about today so we call our studies the study of the tsunami off math and Recovery style and Susana says you many of you already know uh statistics Indonesia uh interviews hustles as part of systems in Nashua representative socioeconomic surveys in February of March 2004 which was um uh 10 months nine to ten months before the tsunami so nothing viewed about 30 000 respondents along the coast of North Sumatra the um populate this design to be representative at the population level for the Kabul pattern which would be like a county in this country um and includes both areas that were more and less affected by a tsunami so what we did we used that as a baseline for tsunami Baseline for star and we in collaboration with Statistics Indonesia went to try to re-survey the people who'd been interviewed in the 2004 susanas and what our goal is to interview all Baseline respondents so we had the Baseline and then starting five 2005 and then carrying through to about seven two thousand six we did our first year follow-up it was hard it was hard because we didn't even know which areas had been damaged because no one had been able to map this the satellite imagery I showed you a moment ago was actually only produced about three or four years after tsunami and so our goal was to First determine survival status of all the respondents and for people who we could find hot family members we that would be something we could get pretty good information on but for people who had all the whole household evapor had moved away or um all had perished that would be much more difficult and so we try to get about up to three at least three pieces of information to determine survival status and then we try to interview all the people who survivals I.E people who had not determined had been had died and in the hardest head areas the majority of people moved away half of them to camps and half of them to private homes that would mean that if we had only gone and interviewed people who were still around who'd had a very selective sample so it was tough but nonetheless we did actually interview 91 of the uh Baseline survivors or people we thought had not yet died had not died and um that was uh um our Baseline attempt our first follow-up we then did four more annual follow-ups and in every way we try to find the respondents who we thought it survived or had not yet had not died and of course we didn't want to just go for the people we found we want to try and find everyone else and so we would not have a cumulative attrition that seems to us to be a very important principle and in fact by the end of the fifth follow-up we had interviewed 98 of the Baseline survivors at least once not every time obviously we didn't first follow-up but at least once we then did a 10-year follow-up we did a follow-up at the 13 years which was a sub-sample where we ex did an extended assessment of biomarkers and cognition and I'll draw on that data now and then we've just finished up a 15 15-year follow-up because of um delays because of covert and in that just to give you a sense of how we're doing on attrition we've interviewed 93 of the survivors at uh the year 15 follow-up of course we've discovered some people who we thought had died actually who had not died and they've been brought in as being survivors and then some people who we thought were survivors we found actually had died and so the you know but that's trivial it's you know something like 50 people total out about 30 000. all right so here is the study areas these uh dots are our numeration areas we have 420 numeration areas in these Coastal Cabo patan um uh uh um in um or Sumatra and red designates these are the areas that were heavily damaged by the tsunami which is based on the satellite imagery inspection of the satellite imagery that I showed you before and after the tsunami and the blue areas areas had no direct damage it's kind of hard to see anything because the dots are all on top of each other so let me blow that up on the right hand side and you can see I've got three designations but essentially the black or the heavily damaged areas and the gray and white or the white or not damaged and gray or in between you can see here that the places that were damaged were very very close to they were heavily damaged we're very close to those that were not and this is because damage is a function of the Topography of both the land and the sea floor which would determine the wave height and wave direction and the way to think about this is if there was a Promontory or some elevation between two areas one area could be very badly damaged and the other area could be largely protected and so that's a sense in which we um think of the tsunami as being the doubt the damage that you were exposed from the tsunami as being not really under your control excellent well um so we'll use as one of our exposure measures the extent of damage in the community that you were living in at the time of the tsunami based on uh our uh priests Nami Baseline so clearly where the tsunami hits not uh under your control in addition the tsunami as I said was completely unanticipated and there were no anticipatory behaviors people were not trying to Run to the Hills which is the right thing to do when the water is starting to recede because the tsunami is coming in fact people went down to the beach to go and collect the fish which is one reason why uh motali was so high in addition in the Baseline there was a question about what is the probability you're going to have an earthquake or a tsunami and that was about two percent 2.5 percent for the uh in of raw and there's no difference between the areas of heavily damaged not heavily damaged so there's nothing that people were Expo expecting these things to happen um but nonetheless were the people in these communities that were effective can they be treated as being random and so a conditional being in a I'm going to use not the color pattern but the guitar baton which is a sub district below the carbon pattern and think of it as bit like a zip code because I don't want to compare for example people who with people living in rural parts of say nias one of the islands of Sumatra as that's not going to be a fair comparison so we'll compare when we do our comparisons we'll compare within kachamatan and then just make control also for being Coastal because if you're away from the coast you weren't really likely to be exposed and with that I can show you here's some characteristics of people differences in characteristics between people who were um in the uh uh Heavenly damaged areas relative to those who are not directly damaged or not they're heavily damaged and you can see that there's just no differences here are the mean gaps and stand areas for those gaps and they're all uh um um uh not close to being significant and overall The Joint test for these ones and I can show you a whole lot more but that's not what you're going to want in the seven in a 45 minute presentation um a joint test is they're not specifically significant so we uh draw the conclusion that these sorts of comparisons between the heavily damaged and not heavily damaged can um plausibly given a causal interpretation and obviously we need to stop shot for each of our studies but we've done that and things we're going to talk about and I'm just going to say leave that as an assertion for now and we um we'll show you some results so let's start with tsunami mortality at the time of the tsunami here is mortality in the areas where there was no direct damage for males and females and those um would be for the whole of 2005 because otherwise there was very few people who died in the three or four days after tsunami um and uh those uh numbers there replicate the source of numbers you'd get from uh life tables this is the death in the heavily damaged areas just staggering about a third of the population was killed you can see that the for females it's not much related to age but for males it really is there's an advantage if you were a prime age male and that's a reflection of two things strength and the ability to swim women don't learn to swim in archery and so the um that drives the vast majority of that Gap um let me move to post tsunami health and cognition with that as your background and context and I'm going to start with an obvious that point endpoint post-unami mortality how do the people what was survival like after the tsunami well there's two competing characteristics features here forces the first is the people who expose the tsunami might have been scarred and therefore more likely to die but there's also those who were survived a tsunami with a healthier and so therefore they would they would be selective mortality on health and so the healthiest would have survived and so therefore the people who were exposed would be more likely to actually live uh During the post-normal period and I'm going to look at the 15 years post tsunami and instead of just doing heavy damage not heavy damage I want to get a sort of dose response type effect to show you what's going on and um I'm going to use instead of just heavy damage versus not heavy damage the percent of the population that died in the community of resonance at the time smart tsunami and that uh um and then I'm going to compare mortality rates for people who age 35 or older at the time in the tsunami um so uh here's the picture and you can see that this is the percent dead on the y-axis the uh percent who died in the community on the x-axis so the zero percent is all the not damaged areas um um um on percent who died and so that estimate is very very tight and then you can see there's a downward there's a little blip up but then there's a downward sloping curve and as I said that's uh um got to be uh attributable to selective survival of the people who um made it through the tsunami um when we do that was just raw numbers when we do regression analyzes and we adjust for katamatan um split them up by age uh you see that actually this selective survival uh start piece is really driven by older people both males and females and there's a significant uh um you know significantly more likely it's five fifteen years if you were in if you had an worse exposure to the tsunami as indicated by the percent dead I want to turn next um to talk a little bit about psychosocial health and um the effects of this tsunami um your clock's wrong oh that's better I had I had I had I had a little I had a little uh a cortisol shock um so I'm going to look at post-traumatic I'm just suffering some post-traumatic stress from that post-traumatic stress symptoms at each follow-up in the in the uh in Star we asked about seven post-traumatic stress symptoms related to hypervisal avoidance behavior inventory experience designed to be specific to the tsunami and we talk we ask about the presence and severity of each of these and score them so that there would be a score of naught to 21 and we're going to call that post-traumatic stress reactivity this looks a lot like post-traumatic stress uh stress diagnoses but we're not doing any diagnoses here and um so we call it reactivity um at the first person Army follow-up we also asked about your worst experiences we've uh so we can get something about how it was immediately after the tsunami and then we repeated that saying follow-up and the uh correlation is very high so we think people are able to recall this pretty well which is consistent with what you would see in the literature about recall buyers if something's really really Salient you typically recall them very well so here is the level of PTC ptsr on the y-axis and here's some tsunami on the right x-axis and you can see that levels are elevated for those who are in the heavy damage areas but even in the no direct damage areas people are presenting with very high levels of ptsr a year later they've gone down a lot and three two years later they've gone down even more and by five years later there's still an elevated ptsr but the gaps between the um uh heavily damaged not heavily damaged are very much smaller they're still significant there's a 95 confidence intervals around there um those circles but they're not uh um uh they're not clinically important by any stretch of imagination and then as we go on further they really are um very very similar this is to say that they're these the the tsunami has left fingerprints on these people's lives both for the people who have exposed most dramatically and those who aren't um so that I introduced because that's our third measure of exposure post-traumatic stress reactivity that has two advantages it's individual specific as opposed to where you were living at the time of the tsunami and now when we include in our models instead of just having to jump down fixed effects we can actually control for how bad was the tsunami for you and how you were how you reacted to that by including Community level numeration area fixed effects um and uh of course what we can't do is interpret that as causal because that may well reflect all sorts of pre-existing differences uh priests knowing all right but what I can show you which is interesting is that when I showed you the mortality a moment ago it was comparing people in the heavily damaged versus not heavily damaged areas and we had that there was selective survival of the fittest from the tsunami but among the people for the males who had a very high ptsr in the first two years post tsunami those are people who for the tsunami took a huge psychological tall we see actually for them the um mortality um mortality is uh there's a missing negative sign there that the people oh no this is mortality excuse me so this is mortality mortality is higher and so these people who had high ptsr are um indicating that there is some evidence of scarring for the people who had the worst psychological experience and so we've got both selective survival overall in the population and then the people who had a really bad time we can see some markings markers of scarring occurring and that's starting to emerge only now there was no such um patterns five years after the tsunami um but let me turn now to getting under the skin why do I want to do that when I showed you these ptsr effects I could have done something like well what was General Health status or other sort of self-reported health status markers and we would have I would have shown you very similar sort of patterns that there were gaps in the first couple of years of tsunami but they very quickly become very muted and so what we thought we should do is look at biological risks of health problems linked to health outcomes and we know that stress affects the HP axis function we know it affects the immune function and there is a literature saying that it affects cardio metabolic Health some of that literature is very clearly causal some of that literature is more correlations um we started out I'm going to show you two markers we started out with C-reactive protein which is a marker in the blood which is tells you about inflammation um it's uh um elevated CRP has been linked with elevated with worse cardiometabolic Health elevated risk of heart disease and strokes with Cancers and during covert elevated information was one of the markers that resulted in people having been put onto ventilators and so they were measuring inflammation to try to track people's uh responses um in heart disease normally you think of BMI elevated BMI as being a big predictor of heart disease actually CRP is a better predictor of heart disease than BMI even after you condition on BMI CRP is a significant predictor of um uh um heart disease and so this is thought now to be a pretty good General Health measure and is quite widely used so we decided to measure CPR and examine the impact of exposure to the broad set of stresses of the tsunami the experience of seeing the tsunami the loss of your livelihoods loss of family members loss of community and also the um damage to your own well-being and we'll look at that on a the evolution of CRP of adults and I'm going to show you here this is conditional on age and gender and education and then also prison Army kuchamatan um fixed effects so we're comparing people who we think are pretty like and we didn't collect so we do CRP of dried blind spots which is relatively straightforward technology we did not collect dry blood spots in our first follow-up of the tsunami in our first follow-up of the tsunami all we did was try to find people and so we were not wandering around with huge amounts of biological uh marker measurement tools um and so in the second year after the tsunami we can see that this is all in log terms so there was a 15 increase in CRP among those who were living in the heavy damaged areas relative to those who are not and that tends to increase over time for the first five years and then at some point starts declining so this suggests that there were cumulative effects that actually accumulated and got worse and then there's a some evidence of improvement interestingly what we find is that that pattern is much clearer for women there's no significant difference between males and females for the first five years males are slightly lower but not significantly so and so one doesn't want to make much of that but after the first five years females seem to consistently have elevated uh CRP relative to males and I told you before that this may be something to do with mortality selection because we had that mortality selection effect for males it's not when we just do this for people who are not even close to getting to multi selection type analyzes we see these same patterns it's something about males having a greater level of robustness in terms of CRP than females suggesting that some additional uh behavioral attitude behavioral effects um included so we then decided okay so what's driving all of this we figured well that was a you know we started with a very natural endpoint mortality we then turn to a more General measure of Health that we can't really pin to anything specific CRP an inflammation marker why don't we try and look at stress hormones which we know should be directly related to exposure to the horror of the tsunami broadly defined and we only did that 13 years post an Army in that sub-cycle I told you about so what do we know about cortisol we know it's elevated um when you've um exposed to some kind of uh mechanism that's going to drive a flight a fight or flight response it's healthy for this to be the spike you expect elevated cortisol immediately after the tsunami but that should be deactivated when the stressor ceases so we should see Spike and then some decline um we only measure the cortisol 13 years later a healthy response would be there'd be no difference between exposed and unexposed people that would be good news for us um however if in the long term there's been dysregulation of the HP axis that drives the cortisol response then it's possible there would be elevated cortisol among the um people who worst exposed although there's also literature that says that repeated consistent cortisol elevation has been linked to reduced cortisol levels which is referred to in the show as burnout so people who have really really bad causal um uh um elevated cortisol elevated stress for an extended period of time you know like I'm feeling right now no it's not really a standard period of time then um uh we have evidence and this has been shown for example for people in very stressful jobs like ICU pediatric nurses they actually show elephant evidence of hypocortalism or this burnout as Bruce McEwen called it um so we figured we're not sure which way this is going to go we'll measure cortisol levels that's a little bit difficult uh mostly it's measured in cyber it's easy to measure in blood neuron the problem with cortisol is it varies diary so cortisol will Peak a little bit after you wake up you wake up because cortisol is rising it then declines through the day and so if you want to measure causal levels you need to measure it multiple times through the day it's not that it Peaks at X minutes after you wake up it Peaks at some point and it's not clear where it declines it varies uh both by day and by individual so you would want to measure this thing many times during a day and ideally you'd want to measure it over multiple days and while most literature in the past has looked at sort of the area under the curve in this uh cortisol map more recently the sort of state of the art today best practice is to look at the gap between the peak and the trough the diurnal range or dynamic domain all right die in Orange and that really requires a lot of measurement and that's kind of hard for us to do um without you know kind of moving in with all of our respondents so what we did was we measured hair cortisol in the hair because of course causal gets screwed into all the organs and it gets secreted in the hair follicles and so you can actually measure the amount of cortisol in hair which is not going to be a measure of causal at that moment obviously it's a measure it's an integrated measure it's cumulative HPA axis activity and it integrals integrates cortisol levels over time so what we did was we collected hair from the back of the scalp you've got to go right into the uh um to the root you don't want the edges and you we collected three about three centimeters of hair and since hair grows about a month a centimeter per month for most people that is likely to be about three integration over three months and then what we do is adjust for weight and measure cortisol concentration and there so we've got for that period which is somewhere around three months how are these what is these people's causal level and what I can show you is that for the people who are living in heavily damaged areas at the time of the tsunami there's evidence of reduced cortisol among females and it's significantly reduced so this is this hypochord Socialism or um uh you know extended stress and we don't see that from else moreover not only is that true but we also see that for the women who presented with elevated ptsr during those two years post tsunami they also have lower cortisol that is significantly uh significantly different from others and that's after controlling for Community level fixed effects so that suggests that these women 14 years later are actually suffering from what they called burnout which we know has negative consequences for health Downstream and so that seems very troubling and is one of the reasons why we felt like it was important to not just stop with CRP as it sort of gives us a greater context for understanding for interpreting the information results I showed you great I then want to turn to uh tsunami related stresses and cognition so if we know that stress has shown up in biological markers uh for these people we also have a literature that says stress is really bad for brain health and therefore potentially full cognition and so what we figured we should do is look at some cognitive markers and see if we're seeing any differences in cognitive performance between those who are exposed versus those not now we shouldn't expect to see this in things like a Ravens Matrix assessment um those embody all sorts of markers of cognition and so what we figured we should try to do is be very very very focused on specific domains of cognition about which we have a literature and so this work is in collaboration with neuroscientists and so let's start with one well-established result and that is that exposure to stress results in disruption in associative learning I'll tell you a bit more about that in a second and hippocampal function um and those effects are known to increase with great exposure that result is on human populations which is largely correlations but also in animal models where there really is causal evidence um and it's uh um the the literature is very is very clear that there's a negative impact of um persistent of of elevated stress really bad stress that on this associative learning capacity and this persists over the long term potentially associative learning is quite important for loss of our processing that could affect all cognitive domains so maybe that would affect Ravens and so we'll think a bit about that but um after the exposure it's also the case the neurosciences Neuroscience structure uh has established that there's scope with um our new skill acquisition so you have a terrible stressful event and then there's new skill acquisition you can offset that decent subdomains of cognition because you can grow cognitive capacity and shift the underlying neural structure and that's based on MRI analyzes and that would be true not just in young kids but also in adults and so what we um don't know is what would the impacts of this uh stress be on these other domains of cognition given it wasn't just that you exposed the horror tsunami but there was all this post-sunami growth from the um build back better so in the 13-year post tsunami assessment where we did these extended by biomarkers and cognition we assessed performance on specific cognitive tasks uh we did six tasks I'm going to show you two not because I'm selecting because I don't want to um um go over time and I want to have plenty of time for for um questions um these cognitive tasks have a foundation in neuroscience and linked to specific domains of cognition and they were developed in collaboration with Margaret Chardon at UNC um so the first task I'm going to talk about is called Clarity of memory it's a measure of associated learning it's uh um declared memory is the ability to encode retrain retain and retrieve information where you have explicit intent and the reason we're measuring it is that it indicates your ability to acquire new knowledge and to learn from that experience and I'll show you the test in a moment we start here because that's the Mark I told you before for which there's robust evidence that there's a negative and persistent effect of stress on the BR on this particular domain of neural functioning so how do we measure it how is it measured in our study there's many many measures this is a very standard measure Margaret um design them but they're designed from Tool you know there's a whole panoply of tools out there and so we just designed them so they were um not they did not require literacy they we could give them to people of all ages and that they were very very easy to explain and very very easy for people to do and they're just done on laptops um so what you do is you show someone a shape at the top of the screen and you ask them what is their power well the first time you see that you say I have no idea so you make a random guess and you're going to get it out right 25 of the time and then you carry on poking away until you get it right and so then you learn which one is the power and we'll do six pairs and then we'll repeat that three times uh sorry you'll have four times all together and so the second time you should have learned something and then the third time you you know if you don't you'll poke around till you get it right so the second time you'll learn again oh the square is actually matched with the uh um Blobby thing and the uh uh third space there and then the third this you get that the second time the third time and the fourth time and what we're going to do is uh the standard and the search here is to uh um treat did you learn it by asking whether you got the right pair on your first guess so first time it should be 25 and it is on average for our people so that's not a problem um but the second time should be higher and that would be how much learning there was and um from a hole in one if you like so I'm going to show you relative to the first presentation which was a round guess um I'm going to put in respond to fix effects because it's all going to be diff differences here and um I'm going to show you what happened among people who are in the sustained um who had sustained heavy damage who were in The Heavy damaged areas and you can see they decide they they did slightly better on the second presentation they 27.3 percent got it right and then better and then better so there is learning going on but the learning is greater among people who are not exposed to the heavily damaged communities and that difference is actually significant for the first uh uh presentation and whilst it's still negative it's not significant after that so this is clear evidence that not only are these people showing um elevated um biological health risks but there's also some evidence of this going through to the brain um so let me repeat that to a column right here so it's just the same column and go to the dose response analysis which is the fraction who died in the tsunami because that was a pretty crass measure heavy damage not heavy damage what about if you had a worse exposure do you do what are you doing worse and the answer is yes in fact quite a lot worse and so this is also evidence that the stressor has this not long-term negative impact of this particular domain of associative learning on this particular domain of cognition associative learning and then when we looked at ptsr it was just extraordinary really really high levels of impacts or evidence of deficits in this associative learning and so exposure to stress is clearly related to the deficit Associated learning all of these models include responding fixed effects they're all differenced and so we would say given the literature the way this is designed and the research design this is pretty likely to be a causal result that uh um the associated learning long-term impacts on social learning are are there's a deficit and that was sort of in a way good news from the research design because it suggested that you know what we've done we'd measured this thing correctly it was consistent with the literature and that um that sort of uh a pretty good test of the uh whole approach then we turned to markers that would be more related to things we would be familiar with and we I'm going to show you we've done this with a bunch and the results for all the others are very like this um but um I'm going to show you a marker a measure of executive function essentially planning an execution which is related to problem solving strategies where you match patterns so we assessed the the the the the task assess planning self-control and memory and why do we want to measure it well maybe these people are going to show deficits an executive function as well but it's also possible there was scope for post and army growth because of the um uh build back that up and having to uh rebuild your life so we don't do a standard uh a tool it's called stockings of Cambridge uh Tower of Hanoi Tower of London there's a whole bunch of my uh um names for it the idea is there's three boards of different sizes and you have to have the smallest but in the bottom the next smallest in the middle and the biggest at the top and your job is to move the balls you can move them one at a time and the balls always have to be in a sock you can't leave them up on the side or anything like that and then um you move them across and that one's incredibly trivial and you can all do that in two seconds what we did was we gave them six tasks of varying difficulty and so here's another task and that one is considerably more complicated you really have to move poles around quite in a you know in a quite um non-linear fashion and the measure we're going to use to see how well these people did was count the number of moves it took for them to complete the tasks to get their balls into the right hand sock and I'm going to use where they completed with optimal moves in the optimal number of moves only because that's a very simple measure and there some people who were flipping around with you know here they're here they're here so we have some guys who are on to 30 or 40 moves which you know not terribly helpful so I'm going to use this whatever I use my results are all going to be the same um so let me show you in heavy damaged areas on the first trial which was actually that first one I showed you 94 got it right and in the heavy damaged areas but then they got harder and harder and by the time you got to the sixth uh um one only about uh 38 were getting it right in the not heavy damaged areas it's not terribly different but it is different and it's actually significant and now it's positive so on associative learning the heavily damaged people performed worse they have a deficit but on Executive functioning they're actually performing better well maybe that's because they're smarter and the people in the heavily damaged areas were pre-existing smarter or something like that so let's do at least a different diff and take out pre exist pre-existing differences and you can see that that's still is significantly positive people who exposed the tsunami are doing better on this marker executive function I'm not going to claim which will go be exposed to a tsunami um but when we use the dose response approach measurement we see actually not only is it better but a lot better and um those effects are bigger as we've seen elsewhere but among the people who had really big psychological costs not better okay so what the hell is going on we have a deficit in Associated learning which we expect based on the literature because that's known to be impacted by stress over the long term but we have an advantage in planning and execution but not if you had elevated ptsr well if you were exposed to the horror of the tsunami you were also exposed to having to navigate your post and army landscape a landscape where you lost your livelihoods you lost family members you had to rebuild whatever resources you had whatever business you had and that landscape was largely new you would not be drawing on what you had learned before you'd have to navigate either a new area or a whole lot of reconstruction coming in and that would demand skill acquisition and maybe that's more difficult for people who had really elevated levels of ptsr and they weren't able to actually navigate it as well so we can investigate that using the longitudinal design of the study and I'm going to just talk about these very briefly because I um want to uh uh not I won't have plenty of time for for questions so we did ask questions about willingness to take risk and we asked those in the um Second and later waves of the uh of star so the first person Army survey um we set it up as choosing among different hypothetical monthly income streams this is not in the economics world we call these you know choosing amongst gambles we don't use that language since gambling is not something that is approved of in a Muslim uh population Muslim context so we talked about hypothetical monthly streams one with certain certain amount of money and the other was uncertain with a 50 50 probability and then we changed the amounts involved in the um uh uncertain streams and to summarize the evidence what we found was that in the heavily damaged communities the people chose the riskier option in the first year post tsunami relative to the others but after two years there's no difference in willing to take risk so what we saw was people had to take risk that they had not necessarily been willing to do in the past and that was because they needed to pick up either a um a new opportunity or some kind of business or something and in fact we've um we did have it we do know about starting U.S businesses and we see that those who are in heavily damaged communities of the tsunami were more likely to start a new business relative to others that was usually around about year three four and five there wasn't a ton of new businesses being started um um or at least not what they would call a business immediately after islamine and so this is consistent with navigating this new landscape and with the executive function advantage and we think uh it gives us a way to interpret the evidence uh broadly speaking so with that let me just give give you a few what I consider to be takeaways from what I think we've learned from um the uh uh um the whole broader research project first to me it's extremely clear that if you want to talk about large-scale disasters you need to look both at the short term and long term the short-term effects were very different from the long term and so knowing what happened immediately is super important but actually following these people over the long term seems to me to be really really first order it it's clearly important that we attract evolution of outcomes and it's absolutely imperative if we're going to ever say anything not just about um resilience but also about recovery some of these people really recovered I did think uh about presenting a whole bunch of stuff on consumption in Commonwealth and um that would have been a different talk so I decided I thought this would bring more value out of it but just to say that what these people had to do you can see in consumption in Commonwealth the people who exposed to Tsunami they had to do all sorts of things with their consumption because now they had to go and find a house to rent or go to a camp and you could see that reflected in consumption and also in their sales of all their sales of assets um but so I think that um as for us to understand resilience and Recovery we need to follow people over time there's enormous eternity in the population and it's super important as I just said to look at a multiple array of dimensions of well-being I focus on health and cognition because I thought those might be interesting because we don't usually those in the sort of context um but the consumption in Commonwealth has the same sort of parallel and without that I wouldn't be more I wouldn't be as confident about the um uh uh interpretation I've given and then finally um it suits me absolutely critical we really spent time trying to measure exposure to the event I showed you three different measures and they all sort of told you a somewhat different story I think that's really really uh key and that's it thank you all very very much
