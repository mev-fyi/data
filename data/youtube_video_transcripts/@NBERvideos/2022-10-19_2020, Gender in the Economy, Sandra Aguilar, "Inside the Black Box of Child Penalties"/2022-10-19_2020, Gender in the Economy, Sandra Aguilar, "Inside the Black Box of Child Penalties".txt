hi everyone thanks for joining us today to discuss our paper inside the black box of child penalties my name is Elia De La Cruz Toledo and I'm joined by co-authors Sandra Aguilar Gomez the research question that we want to explore on this paper is what is the impact of children on women's and men's labor market outcomes and time use and the motivation to dug into this paper is to understand the emphasis well there have been a recent emphasis on child penalties as a persistent source of wage differential that is interacting with gender norms and public policies and there has been a lot of recent literature that is exploring and also over the years employment patterns for the U.S different Scandinavian countries and other countries in Western Europe however the context in developing countries is very different and it's really important to understand employment patterns for women in these areas because gender Norms tend to be more traditional in developing countries there's a higher Reliance on extended family members providing child care and sometimes it's preferred to In traditional settings there's a large informal sector that is sometimes used in developing countries as a source of flexibility and a fallback option that is preventing mothers from completely exiting the labor force and just remaining and the informal labor sector in Mexico so the wage differential literature has stated that some of the differences in wages are due to differences in endowments differences in returns and someone explained portion of the of wages of the widget in Mexico there's uh recently has been a larger proportion of women that are attending higher education in their productive age and there has been an Institutional effort that is trying to tackle discrimination however even though there's a new Institute that receives all of these complaints and a quarter of those are related to pregnancy discriminate pregnancy related discrimination there hasn't been too much informed enforcement or oversight so not a lot of firms have been fined for this discrimination and even though the wage Gap has decreased over the over the years from 19 1990 wage up of 14 to uh seven around seven percent in the in 2010 there is still like extremely low proportion of women participating in the labor force around 43 and uh the majority of them can be over represented in the informal labor sector so we're still hypothesize that the Gap is associated with the role of caregiving that is falling predominantly on women and so what we do in this paper is we want to estimate child penalties in the Mexican context by using an event study framework um to analyze the impact of children on labor outcomes and find use and also we use an instrumental variable as a robustness check we look at the role of the informal sector as both the source of flexibility and fallback option and we also look at the outcomes of other household members which is one of our main contributions as a previous findings we see that there's a strong impact on labor market outcomes of women so we see that women during pregnancy start decreasing their labor force participation so one year post-birth women are 43 percentage point less likely to participate in the workforce and men are four percentage points more likely to do so so post-birth we also see that men have an increase in their labor income but women see a decrease in their labor income there's heterogeneity in defects of childbearing between formal and informal workers there are uh extensive gender differences in the burden of unpaid labor Associated to childbirth and we see that female household members support new mothers so we see that working age women and the household that are not the mother increase decrease their probability of working while men that are not the father in the household do not and the data that we use is the Mexican labor survey that it includes a panel that is rotating similar to that of the senses so there are households entering the sample each round of the survey and each household is included for a total of five consecutive quarters we find Rich information there regarding time use the um the type of sector that they work in whether it's formal or informal and we're able to link all of the employment histories of non-uh parents that are within the household our sample is restricted to workers that are at least four quarters in that panel along the ages of 16 to 64 years of age and our empirical strategy is an event study framework that is typically used in this literature to capture the global treatment aspect of all children in the sample and addressing the potential endogeneity of becoming a mother so our Alphas are time dummies that we include for those quarters but we exclude the t equal 4 which is four quarters per birth and that's how we um we see our results we also include age profile calendar year um shocks individual fixed effects to sort of control for different things um surrounding this employment patterns uh to control non-paramedically for cycle Trends and business Cycles so let's move on to the results um in these plots we uh in this graphs we plot the alphas that Elia mentioned uh capture the effect of children and the relative time with respect with respect to the birth can be seen in the x-axis uh and we highlighted the time of conception between the trimester -3 and trimester minus four and also the uh time of birth but it's a trimester zero between zero and one um so in this plot we see the coefficient of the estimate the estimate coefficient of the impact of um of children on uh women's and men's level first participation on the plot on the left we see the impact on the probability of having positive working hours and we see an impact of almost 30 percent uh 30 percent of points decrease in the probability of having possibly working hours for women uh at the point at a trimester of birth and in the longer run um that is four trimesters after birth there Still Remains an impact of roughly 20 percent um we when we consider uh the plot B uh on the right side uh for this plot we consider women to be still in the for Workforce when they're taking a maternity leave so really um discounting that out from the from the effect we see slightly smaller effects that round between that range between 25 almost 25 percent decrease and percentage points in the probability of working at the moment of Earth and uh 15 percentage point one year later um more on the extensive margin in this graph we compare women who were uh working at the beginning of the panel when with women who weren't and we and we see slightly different Dynamics um so what we see for women that weren't working at the beginning is that they keep uh that they end up being even more uh stopped out of their Workforce um after jailbreak then we look at the Intensive margin of the impacts of children on on labor market outcomes uh on the blood of the left we see the impact on women um who are working at the beginning and then we keep only the women who never stopped working um who never stop being in the labor force and we see and just as before we see different Dynamics um in which uh for women that never stop working um there is uh more pronounced recovery in the hours world so they're long or medium run uh one year later effect is of approximately 20 in their hours work um and what we see another interesting finding one that we are showing here is that men potentially compensate with an increase of uh between 1.7 and 1.9 hours of one year uh after birth thank you then we saw the impacts of uh of children in the short run on income and what we see is like the um is robust resource regardless uh if we use hourly wage or or monthly income and what we see is that one year after birth men have had an increase of 11 in their labor income and women see a decrease in uh 33 percent and now we will move on to a result on on reliever uh for mothers and fathers and also for other household members which is one of our most noble contributions uh with this paper um in this slide what we wanted to highlight is the difference between the impacts uh on men's and women on pay level when we look at percentage change like on the left versus when we look at the absolute change so what we see is that while the presenters change impact that children have on men's and women's hours of unpaid work is roughly similar when we look at the absolute hours uh what we see is that children have a widening impact on the gap of unpaid labor between men and women so we see a 16 hour increase in this Gap um after having children and a 10 hour increase when we keep women that stayed in the labor force during the entire sample um finally uh we see that there is an impact on child penalty and other household members that are women and that are not the mother of the children which reflects some of the degree of the of the reach of the gender Norms within the household over women even when they don't have a child themselves we also looked at the different differential impacts between the formal and informal sector uh what these graphs what this must show are the probability of leaving the workforce uh during the relative time with respect to chill to childbirth and when we what we wanted to highlight is how the bulk of the impact is felt by women on the informal sector which we see in the blood on the right uh and as usual and with the as with other results men remain largely unaffected in their transitions uh in the sexual transitions uh when they have children we also did some heterogeneity analysis um to see how how uh throughout the distribution of income children have different impact on women so we see that most of the impact is followed by by women below the 70 percentile of income and these effects are uh stopping statistically significant after uh for the 80th percentile and 90 percent of we see uh for paid work uh we see different a different pattern and what we see is that women in the higher uh range of the distribution above the 60 60 percentile of the distribution they don't see a recovery in such short term as the partial recovery that we observed for the first half uh of the distribution of hours of paper and for unpaid work what we what we want to highlight here is that the impacts are um can be discovered systematic because regardless of uh part of the distribution in which women are they have roughly similar impacts on their hours of unpaid work when they have children yeah okay now we will proceed to our robustness checks we did a series of robustness checks the first one is an instrumental variable approach and in this instrumental variable approach we exploit this literature on the fact that families have a stronger preference for having a mixed gender of their offspring in the case of Mexico following uh and in spirit of angry Stan and Evans cuso sangaliani showed estimates for sex preferences for couples both in Mexico and Argentina in the case of Mexico whenever families had two girls they had a four percent percentage Point higher probability of having a third child whereas in the case of uh having two boys they only had around 2.5 percentage Point higher probability of having a third child so since in our data we don't observe that many families with free children we decided to use only the sex of the first child as in this period of almond and co-authors in 2013. so um our instrument interacts this dummy variable of having a first child who's a girl with all these time dummies that we that defined our event to study and the usual assumptions on instrument Supply here the first stage we found that having a daughter at first increases the probability of having a second child but 1.4 percentage points and this is very uh statistically significant so we have a very strong first stage uh of just selecting into having a child in within our sample so even though these um results are expressly for second children uh the results we obtained from the IB strategy are not that different from those that we had in the event study of the OLS uh estimation that we presented before so the Navy the Navy line is the OLS and the bright green is the instrumental variable and we see that female labor force participation still drops uh since before having the chat the the the the the child so since pregnancy hours uh hourly wage also drops and uh it still drops very large percentage both for uh all the sample and for second children uh paid work the hours worked also dropped for both and here we find basically no difference between the OLS and the IV and on pad work also increases in both cases um we also received some comments on whether there is selection into Maternity in particular whether if women are experiencing something something aching to a national filter dip uh they would uh select into maternity since they are not doing very well in their careers or in the labor market uh so there's this uh opinion that says that there's some sort of narrative selection into maternity uh and in order to check whether that was true or not we re-ran our quantile regressions uh comparing women who had children with those who didn't have children and what we found is that those who had children in fact apart from higher wages uh also higher hours of work however depart from the same amount more or less of unpaid work so if if anything we find that there is positive selection into maternity instead of negative selection which in fact reinforces our results uh on on the negative effects that children have on on their mothers we also ran some other checks uh which we are not showing here for the sake of time but um we don't find that this is dominated by women who are single or uh and then had a child and the effect is more or less the same for married and unmarried women and sort of like consistent with the effects that we found on on the quantiles of income we also found that women who have higher education uh have a lower effect on wages and on participation okay so just to sum up our results we found that women in Mexico do experience a child penalty in the Mexican labor force at the extensive margin uh they drop around 43 percentage points uh their participation whereas men increase by four percentage points at the Intensive margin they decrease their hours very substantially and also we observe as a result a decline in wages and labor income of women whereas for men we in fact find an increase in their income so women in the informal sector which is one of the differences of our of our paper with the rest with the literature of the Western countries uh are more likely to drop out of labor force uh whereas men are more likely to enter and remain in the labor force we also uh checked this uh result on unpaid hours which is also novel in the literature um and we found that the the gap of unpaid work widens uh between men and women after they have a child and uh so our study still provides further Evidence also in developing countries that uh women have a balancing act when it comes to Market work and home responsibilities and hence uh in the public policy realm uh we expect uh the authorities to improve child care services and uh somehow in uh com improve the culture that assigns these gender roles to both men and women uh However unfortunately we haven't seen that in the current Administration uh and we want to analyze what the fact of the changes that they have brought upon has been on the child penalty thank you very much for taking your time to see our video and we hope that you enjoyed our research bye
