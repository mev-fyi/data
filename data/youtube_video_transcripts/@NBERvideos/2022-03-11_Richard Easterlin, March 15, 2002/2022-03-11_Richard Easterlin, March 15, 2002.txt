i'm at 329 patrician way in pasadena at the home of richard easterlin and eileen crimmons and i have richard right here and he's going to tell us about his role at the national bureau and what the national bureau meant to him and ever anything else he wants to talk about and yes in the date larry katz is here as well and he's reminded me that i should say that it is march 15 2002. thanks for being here it's a march is this the actual yes it is all right i'm dick easter this is your life you ask the questions cody well why don't you begin at the beginning and and end at the end i mean you can begin with when were you first employed at the bureau in what capacity um how did you find out about the bureau so why don't you begin there and and everything well of course i knew about the bureau simply because kuznets was always you know associated with the bureau and you know uh since i was a student of his uh at penn at penn i thought oh yeah the bureau was a big deal and i had my first contact really was uh kuznets i guess arranged a research association in 1955 56 and uh that was quite a phenomenal year because uh at the same time doug north was a research associate and uh ken buckley and doug was in residence in new york we all were took up residence in new york i lived on long island i forget where we're dug and one of them was in west chester as i recall and one of them may have been in new jersey i mean we were we didn't see each other uh socially because we were really scattered except there was this one incredible dinner at george stiglers that is a phenomenal story okay do you want to hear that why not [Laughter] i have five you may have to censor this you see because the the well there's no censoring all right well i mean you know stigler is sort of the great potentate and of course we are the you know minions that are invited to his home for dinner with our wives and uh so uh i i recall sticker lived in in manhattan and uh you know i i my view of stigler was always that he was not not really nber i mean he you know he wrote these books on price theory and that sort of thing uh and he had this this strange affiliation where he you know he's presumably did some empirical work uh but uh but i know i never knew him to do any empirical work himself and i remember this is just background in my attitude towards stigler but there was a a luncheon that you know we usually went out to lunch at the nbr and at one of these lunches uh the subject came up of a dissertation that had been presented at columbia in economics on uh that provided historical estimates of the balance of payments and uh it was done by matthew simon whom uh whose name you probably know if you didn't know a hard-working serious economic historian and he have done a good job of putting these estimates together and here's stiegler you know at the national bureau of economic research at this luncheon and he's saying and the question that he's posing is well now do you think uh a a a dissertation on uh estimates of the balance of payments for the united states uh is appropriate for a phd in economics well stickler's view on this was quite clearly that it wasn't you know and i was sort of really taken aback and here's this guy that presumably is an nbr person but i was not surprised because i never thought stigler really fit but yeah a perfect example of this incongruity between stigler and the bureau so that my my i never particularly liked stigler this only was you know sort of proved the point you know right and uh and so not you know not that i you know didn't get along i mean i mean i i always we always said hello if we passed each other in the hall or something like that but anyway so he invites us to his home well you must know that ken buckley really had a problem drinking and eventually died uh because of the yeah kidney problems brought on by successive drinking his wife was wonderful you know a very attractive very sort of understanding of can she put up with you know i think lots of difficult stuff ken was a really smart guy and a really able uh economist and economic historian uh who did uh you know some very good uh empirical work uh on canadian national income sort of had association with urquhart and so on and i actually went and gave a talk one time at s caster while in january i'll tell you it was that cold it was 20 degrees below but that was after we got to know each other anyway but i can see one reason why i drank so much as you had to to survive you know well you know that in new england how the back in colonial times the la yeah they grew corn in order to make bourbon basically then it wasn't that they needed it for the food consumption so anyway uh uh ken would naturally uh get well primed for an affair of this sort so he came and then uh doug was there uh with his wife who was quite attractive there's a reason why i mentioned her attractive and my wife was quite attractive the same way yeah 25 30 years old i don't know if we're sitting around the dinner table you know with stigler and his wife and we're chatting and so on and ken's not saying much you know and there's a pause in the conversation and ken looks around and looks around the table sort of blurry you know he says you know he said i'd like oh by the way stigler's wife is attracted to him right i'd like to every wife every woman here that's what ken buckley said yeah this is what cats yeah well if you know stigler i mean he has never had a lawsuit never this was the one time his job virtually dropped to the table silence descended on the room well eventually we moved on to other things that's what happened it was uh it was a situation i greatly enjoyed george did and you're you know this he and and i i you know i was a student of stiglers and and so i absolutely agree with you that i remember when i knew of his involvement with the bureau not knowing of the work that he did when i was a graduate student it did seem incongruous but then when i was you know when i began to read more of the material that that had his name that seemed incongruous because you know his early work at the bureau is is uh you know sort of uh very well somewhat meticulous data collections on on you know somewhat interesting but not stiglerianly interesting topics such as uh teacher salaries and and aspects of the service sector um transition from domestic service to uh other things uh it was it was somewhat incongruous and and were he alive i would ask him how he got involved in that and what he thought of it but but i can't do that and i i i i i had a high regard for the his price theory book we used it when i was a graduate student and he wrote uh extremely uh succinctly uh but uh but quite uh elegantly and uh it seemed like none of the work he did at the bureau ever had that type of distinction uh which is probably further testimony to the fact that he you know he was uh didn't fit very well there no so do we think he did this because it was lucrative um what yeah it was you know of course money were the bureau didn't didn't have a hell of a lot of money at the time but uh yeah there was something in that and i i i don't know uh i mean i never knew too much about the colombia and be or linkage and that must be how he got drawn into it but it it just seemed it didn't seem like something that would appeal to his preferences at all so yeah i i don't know how to explain it you know whether it was because milton got involved in 1950 with the bureau through burns whom he knew as a graduate student when he was a columbia uh and and and he says and and because he he needed the money that that it was additional funding i think that these were summers and and beca and in part uh maybe needed the money was second or third to some other reasons and one of them was true devotion to author that author said i want you to do this project i need you to do this project in monetary history and milton came to new york so i think that there was and it's hard to believe that stigler was devoted to anybody as milton's undergraduate teacher well that's what arthur milton first got to know arthur when milton was at rutgers but i think that it was it was mainly when he was a graduate student you know he was first at chicago where where he met george and where he met rose but let let's get to to richard not to milton and george so i had i was there at the bureau for a year 55-56 yeah and basically i just did sort of more work on what i've been doing uh on state income at uh at penn and i wrote up uh a uh you know a very descriptive piece in kuznetsian style that uh that probably occupied most of my time when i went there i had i'd already written up how these estimates had been made you see and we had the attend the project that pen produced these dittograft you know the purple right mimeograph things right yeah uh and uh so i had this report that was my write-up and so this is the work that you you were working with anne by yourself with with simon with with dorothy yeah well dorothy and and and simon were the project heads uh but uh basically uh the the four of us who were the lackeys uh so this is everett lee and myself and uh and uh miller and carol brainard uh you know we pretty much worked by ourselves uh but we would uh we would have meetings maybe i don't know once a month or two months in uh at penn uh when simon would and dorothy would sort of talk about where we were going and what progress we were making uh and uh but simon sort of you know was like my supervisor uh uh dorothy was everett's supervisor and uh carol and ann who were doing the labor force stuff sort of fell in the middle because uh uh simon you know sort of knew more about labor force i think than darth viola dorothy worked a lot but actually anne's mentor had been gladys palmer right and uh and and carols too and so uh that they probably knew more about labor force right themselves by virtue of that than either simon or dorothy so uh they i think sort of went pretty much along on their own simon sort of mentored me and dorothy uh uh played a very active role in uh migration now let me just get the chronology straight because you get your phd in 53 and what you're talking about now is 53 54 when when we're talking about yeah up till so at this point you're an assistant professor at penn yeah i got one appointed in 53. right and uh i need these i've never done any empirical work but simon said when i finished this dissertation which was on conceptual aspects of the measurement of economic growth uh he said now it's time for you to do some serious work and uh so he says uh how would you like to you know come and work on this project that professor thomas and i are starting you know so i i mean i didn't know what i was going to do with myself anyway and you know i had a very high admiration for kuznetsov i said sure so that's how i that's how i got sort of into empirical work and simon stays at penn until what year uh i'm not sure exactly when he left uh but but he was there in 55 56 when you were at the bureau right yeah uh we overlapped for several years uh we were just talking to lance and lance was it it was at hopkins of course and gets his degree what did he say in 57 56. so uh simon may have uh split his time between canada i think he went and visited before he left went there and you know the reason he left penn was there was this interim president acting president stassen had been president and then he left and i can't even remember the the name something like to pray but that's not it uh but this guy didn't even know who simon was and simon went and talked to him about well he had an offer from hopkins you know but basically and this beautiful home in elkins park in the northern suburbs of philadelphia actually i stayed there one summer when simon was away he said why don't you guys come in house just lined with books i mean the kind of thing you see in the movie many of the russian and german and so on you know just uh this yeah a couple of acres you know it was a just this lovely home and and of course edith was great too it's so sweet and anyway so uh he he would never have left penn they know he had a decent appointment but this guy that the president you know sort of acted like well he didn't know who kuznets was you know and you know he didn't much care about whether he came or left and so cousins just said all right i'm gonna go you know i he never said much you know uh to me about it but i my feeling is you know he must have been pretty upset right i think that that's it so it could well have been you know right around 55 56 he was transitioning to hopkins but the years that uh the couple of years the project was you know we were all there working on it he was there he was there since we're on simon and i've got as you know questions that are more about dick than about simon but since we're on simon let me just ask this uh question that you may know a lot about or may not i don't know um this is the what we i call the the burns kuznets rift which occurred i believe in 48 and maybe simon said something about it to you and this concerns the fact that as i understand that simon uh wanted to have part of the bureau studying comparative economic growth studying particularly aspects of distribution and of course burns following the mitchell tradition and following his own interests was more interested in business cycles and this concerned the use i believe of ford money it may have been rockefeller money i don't know and simon uh of course you you discussed this in a book a recent book review that you wrote right and discuss it right you mention it what do you know about this and in particular uh what was simon's uh uh feelings about it how did it change simon's attachment to the bureau what can you what can you illuminate well you know i most of it is speculation uh the uh the the one you know i i had not known until uh you know there was some occasion uh i may have asked him at some point uh you know why uh this work of his uh on comparative economic growth wasn't you know a bureau project right um you know for a long time our relationship was you know like you know he was god and i was way down at the bottom you know because uh you know there was many years age difference and simon uh was never that approachable you know he was shy so uh you know until later uh after uh uh 25 years now i would ask him questions more and i can't remember when it was but you know he said uh well the the the problem he proposed this to the bureau and uh uh burns had turned to ten and uh uh uh by then i guess he wasn't you know feeling too uh you know upset about it but i think at the time i you know i can only imagine you know uh here he and burns were like you know uh the peter and paul uh of mitchell and uh he had a vision uh that was obviously quite different from burns and uh and uh in and i think you know really more of a more in tune with what the needs were of scholarship and research and you know uh and uh certainly his reputation was comparable at the time to burns money you know he made this proposal and i think that was the beginning of the end uh at the bureau for for cousins when that project was turned down the thing was you know i have simon he had these enormous projects going on he had this was the one of capital formation and financing right it went on for close to another 10 years and he he stuck with it and he did all the work but uh as far as i'm aware what he did was then go to the social science research council the ford foundation and say okay the bureau will buy this project or this is not going to be done under pure auspices but i would like to you know in part the beginning of the end of simon at the bureau was as you say this proposal but wasn't not as well the transition from mitchell to burns rather than from mitchell to kuznets uh yeah i i don't know how to answer that i don't have the sense that kuznets ever particularly wanted to be the director i could be mistaken but i don't see him that much in that role as an an administrator over projects that he does not personally take a role in so i i don't know maybe not much about i don't know anything about that you know that transition and you may you may be right but uh i never had any information from him that he ever resented not being yeah not running latin in the er um let's uh keep on with burns for just a moment which uh uh when you were at the bureau for this year uh how much did you see arthur you know was he the director right i can only remember he probably was the director i can only remember one meeting with burns which actually went pretty well because uh he asked you know how i something i don't know something about how i what i taught in the course on economic development i sort of said uh the allocation resources distribution income international trade and he said oh well it's a good idea so uh that was my one contact in which we had any sort of personal exchange that i recall what about saul i mean what happens is that that author yeah he succeeded well what what happened was that the soul didn't really succeed what happened was that arthur went to the council yeah and he was the director of research and saul took over and then when author came back they created the position as president of the bureau arthur then became president saul became the director of research most of my dealings uh such as they were the bureau were fabricated almost all right except probably for that one time with burns so i uh i always think of a fabricant as running the bureau when in my tenure such as it was but uh probably in that year i was a research associate burns was the director and then he went to washington i think he went to washington before but that's okay that that's all yeah see i it may have been i just he was back for a day or something and i i met with him because i don't even remember the circumstances right but fabricate was the one running the show well when you were at the and i'll tell you they didn't pay much right because this i know for an absolute fact you may have financial records but it was funny i had gotten this desk in this office you know and uh i don't know this was after i'd been there maybe 10 months or something but i i pulled out the drawer one day because i was looking for something and a piece of paper fallen in the back you see and uh it was in fact a record of how much these guys were getting paid by the bureau at that time i mean i don't know maybe not at that precise time but you know within the past four or five years and it was like a couple of thousand dollars or something you know you say friedman said well the money was important but i'll tell you there wasn't a lot of money anybody was getting out of it but some of it was just i'll use the word gravy even though people were working for it uh but they were getting paid for doing things that they probably would have done anyhow right and i that's what i got basically a summer salary which uh freedom well also i i guess i got uh half time because i remember now i was only teaching half time at 10 for quite a few years so the bureau helped buy out yes yeah now one of your questions is about uh money yeah money and uh well my you know i didn't i i had no conception that you went out and you got money to do research and see so i just assumed when you were on the bureau of staff you just sort of you know got a little gravy along the way which is what i was getting and uh fabricate uh obviously thought that i could do better than that so he uh he sort of uh in a meeting sort of try to channel my thinking into well maybe if we get go to the department of labor we could generate some money to support the stuff and this is the manpower part of the department right exactly of the long swings project well i i i at the time i mean i sort of resented the idea that i had to go out and raise some money but i did raise some money uh at least they were they gave us some money and so i did have some funding for part of the time on the long swings project but basically you know i was getting a few thousand bucks from the knowledge so once again there was the the year that you were on leave which was funded by the bureau and you lived in new york and that was really nice you were on leave but then for subsequent years you would receive as you said and correct me if i if i'm wrong some summer support and some leave from some of the courses you had some buyout particularly when you were on the manpower project because you had raised the money yourself right okay and uh as well as i remember right and had no problem with a faculty member buying out that time no you know there wasn't a lot going on and uh the idea that they might actually have somebody besides kuznetsov after his that's doing some empirical or doing some research and then wasn't a bad idea well the the chairman of the department was ray bowman and he was a kuznets uh student and uh he eventually got became the president of the american statistical association because he went to washington and uh handed the bureau of the budget at one uh time at a later time and so he uh he was quite uh agreeable to this arrangement the other people in the department that were mainly writing textbooks or i had written textbooks didn't much care one way again so did you after the year that you spent at the bureau uh did you go to new york like uh during the year for a few weeks did you have research assistance at the bureau i would usually just go in about uh once a month i had a woman research assistant who was very good remember her name yeah chantal demolian what a wonderful name you know uh she was french and uh a very sweet person she was a columbia graduate student or um i don't think so somehow she she was a full-time bureau yeah she was a full-time bureau employee but she was hired i guess i may i don't know i may have hired her i think i hired her i had an earlier uh research assistant marcel tannenbaum who was a graduate student right he had been undergraduate hofstra right right and uh and he was very good too but then he got his degree and went on and i think probably that's when i found chantal she applied for the job and did you ever spend part of a summer at the bureau yeah no no i would i basically just would go in back and forth once a month thinking about a bad trip right you mentioned before um about the the very important lean miller brainerd easterlin sorry for putting your name last there kuznets thomas project and uh and of course this project uh sort of in some sense it's it once again in terms of odd aspects of the bureau's involvement this project had a life of its own it gets published under the imprimatur of the american philosophical society in philadelphia and yet part of it is a bureau project in part because you were there that year and it and it a piece of it goes into the important williamstown conference volume the criw volume so that's that's is am i right that was the relationship between that project i came to get connected to the bureau uh but uh i never think of it as a bureau of project no thank you i was gonna mention when i first got there i circulated this dittograf thing and uh thinking well everybody at the bureau is enormously estimated interested in how you go about constructing estimates i never got any comment from anybody else really yeah uh so that was a little disillusioning but the reason that i got uh connected to the bureau uh uh had nothing to do with that project except that you know it sort of gave me credentials of a sort i guess but it was you know boom ray bowman and i had done this work on cons the national income concept and we were there was this controversy you know between kuznets and the department of commerce about uh national income and that was something kuznetsov kuznets clearly really always felt strongly about this is treatment of capital gains and more than that you know you know the idea that uh the the commerce department part it was basically the idea that all you're doing is social accounting versus the idea that you're doing pogovian measurement of economic welfare that is the approximation and uh there was a a in one there was always these meetings of the conference on research and income and wealth and one of them had to do with uh uh with i forget what the topic for the conference was but i mean uh georgia was there who was running the national income division uh and bogan and i had given a paper uh on some other topic but yasi got up and gave this talk yeah all about well sort of how social accounting is the be all and all and basically uh you know the idea that you're getting a measure of economic welfare is nonsense and so so i really got pissed off you know and so i got up and yeah you know and i was you know like this little kid and i think after these people i certainly was in my own mind but i was really upset and you know i i rattled off all all of all the assumptions that that were made you see to necessary uh which you know were basically derived from you know uh you know uh welfare considerations do you include illegal activities you know but anyway i guess it was a pretty good uh explosion because uh after that fabricant calls me into the office who says what do you think what do you when you think about becoming a member of the nba research day right yeah so that was how i so what year was that once again chronology what year was that uh i would have to go and check when uh that that meeting was i mean uh you know that those uh comments were published now i could check my cv i guess i'll look but so so so uh my senses it may have been while i was at the bureau in fact i'm quite sure now it was because i can remember going back uh uh home and saying to my wife well uh uh i i was quite elated in fact you know i'm quite proud well i've been asked to become a member of that so it was during that period so that that's when you switched from being having this year to being on the staff right and that's when your name becomes part of the annual reports right a member of the staff but you know i'd be at penn and uh which you did for the next 10 years from 56. uh exactly when and i guess i was to continue on your cv you list yourself as a research associate well this is a research associate in 55 56 and by that you mean that you were on this year right but you're a member of the research staff from 56 so it was right at the end to 66. okay that's right that's right 57 is the first year you're listed as a staff member on in the annual reports okay and i think uh the idea was i was to you know do sort of demographic aspects of uh of the brahmanas uh long swings right right now but the state income project uh of course built on work that had been done very very early at the bureau on state incomes yeah well built on this little storm okay the way i went about it was entirely uh you know simon's uh idea and uh i don't think i went back and and looked at that earlier work until i started trying to make some comparisons uh yeah he had mentioned that work but that didn't provide the model simon sort of yeah had the conceptual model about how to go about doing this can you say anything about that or yeah yeah well you know it was basically um the labor force estimates would be uh sort of the the basic structural the industrial just give us the industrial distribution uh so what we needed of the labor force what we needed were per worker income figures for the various sectors and i was doing manufacturing so out of the manufacturing sector you were getting these estimates of wages per employee uh and this this was from the census of manufacturing yeah right and similarly for similarly from agriculture you know you could construct a there construct a new uh estimates of net farm income by state uh but beyond that there was there wasn't much to go on uh you just knew that there was this other all these other people yeah all these other people that you had so you had some estimates from censuses of the other yeah or national or i can't even remember now exactly uh where uh the other numbers uh came from and as i mentioned uh know a couple of years ago in some article i wrote you know i probably would have made better estimates if i'd known a little economic history american economy you would have made better estimates if you knew how much they were going to be used yeah well i i i did suppose i think i did assume that they would be used and actually you know i think they came out reasonably well and i got a little better educated as time went on but but that was the basic uh conception so the labor force uh distributions that uh brainerd and miller put together were you know fundamental right to the design uh and then you know the stuff i was doing on manufacturing provided another key component but that i had to do agricultural as well so what about the just out of curiosity the the price side the uh the problem with uh price and disease yeah well i've you know i looked some at it uh i didn't try to do anything about uh adjusting uh for the difference so these were stated as these are nominal prices unadjusted um let me move to uh and of course we can come back to any of this how then your ideas regarding uh population emerge from this and so the long swings project and so now we're going to move from the important three volumes that are done that i i have the library's copies of these that i just noticed the other day i've had for 10 years in my office i feel as if i own them which i don't and so uh so they're done and now uh you're moving into this this other this other project which fits together uh with lots of of what the bureau was working on and what what uh what abramovitz was was doing yeah well that may be how you see it well i don't see anything this is i i'm i'm trying to i never thought uh in the period that i was there that the bureau uh was particularly interested in any demographic uh questions yes uh and you know my own uh uh uh experience and thinking changed uh quite a bit uh you know dorothy thomas was the key influence because when we were on this project she made me go to these population association meetings and get to know who the demographers were i mean there were no other economists there you know so that i did so so what was her position actually she was a professor of sociology yeah so one of the one of the great uh trivia questions you see is who is the first woman president of the american sociological association was dorothy thomas and then that was in like 1952-3 and the next woman president wasn't tilled about 1967 or dorothy was just a phenomenon i just had occasion to write a piece uh you know only like 400 words for encyclopedia population for about dorothy but it made me go back and look at stuff that i'd never seen on her you know some biographical stuff some autobiographical stuff she was just an incredible woman so yeah you know in retrospect you know i was incredibly lucky because i had kuznets as a mentor and then dorothy thomas and she you know was uh this very strong personality more empirical even than cousins even though if you look at her evolution she she was you know involved in theory and she had very i was playing that but she had become very and you look at her presidential address the american sociological associate and it talks about theory and so on but in truth i mean when i got to know her she didn't give a about fairy all she cared about was make those estimates of migration this thing and let's look at what they show anyway so uh dorothy had sort of gotten me into into the in you know not liking population but i i i told goose that's at one stage you know when i was still graduate student i wouldn't i couldn't i didn't see any interest at all in population and he was a little taken aback by because you know he was you know more uh more obviously more interested in the subject but uh you know gradually better because of these couple of years of meetings at penn and so on and you know getting to know uh everett lee and the demographers and and something about the field you know i began to get more interested in so then uh i think it was that a brahmavids wanted somebody to work more on the demographic side of the long swings project and my initial uh take on that i mean the brahmavids never can provide any supervision uh and uh and kuznets provided no supervision either and so i was just off on my own and my you know i i was totally empirical you know so i was gathering all kinds of data about population and labor force and just trying to see whether they showed these fluctuations god knows i must have spent several years just compiling these things including like going to you know at penn they had this library i don't i forget whether you were you and you came after the new library right there was this old library was which is where the building they once said was a transplanted railroad station you know it was between if you're facing toward the city and the library the new library is on the left and college hall is on the right this is the building right in front of you that was the old library i forget what it became after well they had like dungeons down in the bottom of this thing you see and i wanted to see these state health reports that had statistics on births and deaths you see and so they gave me a light yeah one of these long cords you know and the light and this place was so incredibly dusty it was like these caves you know and i was going around pulling these reports down and copying down oh they had wonderful pictures this was like the 1870s you know what gonorrhea looked like and so it was just but this was the sort of thing i was doing for a couple of years you know i was just accumulating all these data but gradually i i actually wrote a up a a monograph that i never got around to trying to produce but it became like part of one chapter in my book eventually that had to do with what the labor force and population data show from the census about long swings and turned out they did show the long swings pretty clearly because they have the sentences happen to occur very fortuitous fortuitously in terms of picking up these demographic movements so that that was uh that was basically what i was doing and you know chantal was tabulating some of these things and i'd say do this let's do compute the decade changes and then the changes in the decade changes and so on by occupation by industry and uh and and nobody at the bureau paid much attention to what i was doing and you know i had occasionally when i would go in there would be a seminar or something and i would go to it but basically i was just working on my own and uh you know gradually i guess because uh you know i had been trained as an economist and i sort of had learned theory and i've done well in theory and you know i i was teaching economics and so i you know there was some sort of tension maybe between you know the empirical work and the theory i gradually you know started trying to do more you know i i i forget exactly how i got into the baby boom but it grew out of you know looking at these fluctuations and the population changes and the fact that immigration swing right was replaced by a fertility swing and and i think that was a key insight yeah and and and part of it was was also i'd lived this experience because uh uh i i remember you know you know i gradually came to realize you know how you know these aggregate supply and demand forces were operating you know to you know here we were in this incredible post-war boom economy uh and how their the immigration had been cut off by uh legislation uh the entry uh entry into the labor market from uh you know natural increase of the population was way down because of the fertility and the result was you know young people were in this exceptional circumstance that uh i can remember sitting without phillips who was a colleague of mine and i it was probably the late 50s or something and you know we were in the park i said oh you know we're in this incredible situation man i i realized yeah finally uh this was sort of like what our whole generation was about everybody was you know they find that it easy to make money they didn't have big aspirations we'd come out of the depression you know you know but butts billboards and ward i mean these people you know it was crazy idea that the labor market for women young women was so bad you know uh uh and that's why they were having kids yeah the truth was right it couldn't have been anything farther from that i knew it from personal experience you know these guys writing 20 years later they hadn't had a clue what was going on i mean the labor market was incredible but all these young women were choosing to get married and have kids because the job market was so good for the man they could just you know pick and choose and that's what was going on well yeah so that was sort of how i got into the american uh baby boom which sort of grew out of the long swings and that was i guess you know the first real analytical insight that i had where i merged uh the uh empirical uh with the analytical or theoretical right and uh and i knew it was right because i loved it and uh uh and that sort of got me on this track sort of uh you know how you look at the data and you're trying and so you know then i got more uh uh into trying to understand uh the mechanisms of the of the long swings and you know reconciling some of the the the differences in timing that turned out because if they if you looked at at decennial data that related to manufacturing activity it didn't show the swings only certain components would show the swings and you know and i knew that and i'd read burns and kuznets on these movements and so on and i knew that you know they found these movements but they weren't showing up the way i expected in that but they were and they were showing up in demographic data well you know eventually so i got to realize yeah you sort of got a sequence going on you know an investment boom that generates urban growth which generates in migration and household formation and a whole new wave of investment and that's what i've been picking up in the population so uh you know it was sort of you know this working back and forth between what the data seemed to show you know what sort of ideas came out of you know theory i i knew you know keynesian theory and aggregate demand clearly was involved in this whole process and uh so yeah those are issues involving how the age structure of the population affects aggregate demand here uh at that stage i i still haven't gotten really into the age structure this was this was simply how uh what what was happening was was basically well you've got a long-term process of economic growth going on of reallocating labor from rural areas to urban areas because the the the investment uh that is centered in urban areas as a result of the large-scale technology that's emerged so the thing is this process didn't occur uh in a in a linear way it occurred in this wave-like fashion and occurred in this wave-like fashion because what happened is the new investment would get started so i can in the development of electricity in certain places well labor would kind of become scarce and then you get this movement of people to these areas and that would sort of give you that sustained economic boom that would minimize the inventory recessions and so on so that that was the basic idea and actually this was published in the aer uh i guess what was it maybe 61 was it that early probably which had to do with that there were these interactions going on between private investment booms and population movements that generated these sustained expansion in aggregate demand more than it was a cycle but at the time i didn't get that much into the age structure except insofar as you know it was producing uh low rates of entry into the labor force i'm going to have to change this film yeah well this is a good breaking point i don't know this is good what do you mean you don't have anything more to say yeah i have i have various questions that i want you to think about during this break which is that um you're working on labor issues attached to the bureau the bureau has this business cycle shop uh this little business cycle factory and they're not that interested in people they're doing their business cycle things but in through the doors of the bureau appear various people who uh are labor people at this time and there's jay and jacob so um i want to bring them into the picture a little bit and um uh and vic and um who else here maybe some some others um tom just was was later i take it yeah i knew him but i never had one yeah so i'm going to turn this off and we'll continue i have almost the whole richard and so this is tape number two of march 15 uh 2002 and the home of richard easterlund so when we ended the last tape i mentioned that there were some other labor people at the bureau some during the time of your residence and some when you would sort of come back every now and then and that's of course gary and and jacob um one what did you uh relationship did you have with them did you talk to them much well i i had really uh i think a good relationship with gary jacob i always found a little hard to deal with that gary always seemed pretty open-minded and as i recall gary was a research associate the year after i was and so that's when i first got to know him and uh and uh you know we shared a lot of interest in terms of uh you know uh understanding population and labor uh he he approached it you know from a theoretical hypothesis testing uh point of view and i was approaching it from you know trying to understand particular empirical phenomena but uh uh gary gary and i think uh became good friends at the time and uh uh as i recall uh there was a time when i when i stayed at carrie's house i don't know maybe i was staying overnight for something at the bureau or something like that and uh gary gary provided my introduction to playboy magazine that's something i bet you would not have predicted no but gary probably got it because of some academic question yeah gary had a good supply that i think had nothing to do with academic questions he said well here dick he says whether i was in the guest room or whatever but he came in with a stack of playboys they said yeah this will keep you entertained for the rest of the evening so uh uh and indeed i tried to hire carrier pen when i was chairman uh which was not too long after uh that uh so uh yeah gary had uh the you know he he he really had more uh uh i guess more of a program than i did i mean i i was sort of working as part of the promise thing gary had more ideas about you know where he wanted to see research in human capital going and that i'm laughing because with hindsight you had a program and i think that gary would say that he didn't have a program [Laughter] well it's nice of you but it's true uh but uh so you know uh i over the years i mean larry gary and i have not had uh you know uh any sustained contact but we've always had uh friendly get togethers uh what about we've ended up pretty much on opposite sides of how you go about studying things and you know what's right what's wrong but aside from that small difference i think we still have close friends i think him as a close friend what about fake fuchs oh well victor uh uh actually i tried to har victor too victor however got i think well the department didn't wouldn't hire him i don't know why they wouldn't hire him you know this was a pen uh by that time year are we talking about i guess the early 60s so we're talking about that well his his good work was yet to come yeah he was good he but i thought he was a i i you know i thought he was a smart guy right and i i knew it was good he had this sort of peripheral appointment at the you know in the college of general studies or something at columbia and i don't know i guess it was you know that his status didn't look good enough to the park i uh after that i always since we didn't make did not make him an operate i i think uh victor always sort of you know held it against me personally as though i have been responsible whereas in fact i've been one that you know had tried to uh to hire him but he was always very sort of uh critical of uh you know pen and you know things that i would discuss with him i don't know but actually you know in our early uh get together victor and i you know he he was more empirical certainly than gary and uh though uh i think uh somewhat uh too amenable to influence by gary but he had ideas similar to mine about the baby boom and actually referred me to a little piece he'd written in a pop in the popular press that sort of had some of the same notions and so victor and i hit it off uh well i thought until things got a little frigid after this unfortunate that you never want to be a chairman i can assure you of that uh and uh and jacob uh jacobo was i he just was inflexible you know so i don't know i well there was one time when uh uh i don't know there was something i wrote about the labor force and uh his his view was well you know i uh uh did i have an identification problem or this kind of problem and that kind of probably yeah he's giving me all this economic all hangs together nicely theoretically why don't we focus on the substance and not the methodology in that well that was the problem i always had with jacob i mean yeah you know you yeah i think that jacob wasn't good at giving to you yeah i i think jacob had a very good sense of his agenda of what to follow he knew that he was starting today and he was going to get to b and then go to c and in that sense i think he was somewhat inflexible yeah and gary was always much more oh oh gary was completely open gary's story about how he got involved with the bureau is that uh someone came to him maybe it was author maybe it was george i don't know and said you know if you all you have to do is write a grant proposal and we'll give you summer money and gary said okay that's fine and he went off and he wrote this proposal he said well what what am i going to write about he wrote about this thing that you know he had talked in chicago to uh to ted schultz about about human capital and then he got the money and then then they said someone said maybe arthur or george said well now you can do whatever you want and uh and gary said well i didn't know what to do whatever i wanted so i decided to do what i promised and so so in that sense there is a tremendous amount of flexibility and and and there still is uh in and gary yeah i agree um uh bob lipsy did you talk to bob at all what about ruth mack did you see ruth oh yeah well actually uh ruth was sort of i i think i tend to think of ruth as being in my state is sort of a peripheral member of the bureau because if you weren't in columbia or if you weren't in anywhere you right in new york and had the bureau all the time you weren't involved i thought she was at the bureau a hundred percent well uh uh yeah uh it may not fit her but somehow she doesn't seem to she i i don't know she didn't fit that but maybe i always like groups you didn't like hides and shoes [Laughter] she had an article that was very good on consumption aspirations you see that was totally out of step with you know what the profession was doing right but was right you know basically i think about uh that i mean i i probably didn't appreciate it later on but i somehow i was like ruth she was she had a good you know uh she was a good person to talk to because she uh she had a lot of some intelligent things to say yes uh maybe it was because she was a woman she was peripheral that's a good point uh so just like as anne you know and right it was seemed to be uh right sort ruth is alive and lives in new york city still great she's very frail she's 99 and wow yes and she her husband passed away some years ago she had a boyfriend and he just passed away a few years ago two years ago and she was living on the west side and he had been living on the east side and i heard about this because they were she was combining these residences and her library was being donated to the to the new york bureau um is there anyone else um in the years that you were at the bureau i think about you mentioned bob lipschi i think of lexi and creamer's sort of uh cinequa non nber you know very empirical and fabricants and fabricant i mean they were all uh you know kendrick john kendrick uh let's do the numbers and you know it was a view that i had at one time and uh and it's a view i i wish had some uh support in the profession now uh uh well come to cambridge yeah well [Laughter] uh the bureau's changed you know it's much more uh mainstream than it used to be the the bureau is completely different yeah right right organization right exactly if the bureau weren't there most of that work almost all that work would be done now yes back uh in the 30s 40s and even 50s uh if the bureau weren't there that work would not have been there that's right that's that's that's it represented a distinctive strand of work facilitates stuff that's taking place anyways now it's not really yeah um well i didn't uh so fabricant uh i found it to be a very difficult person to get along with so yeah uh you know he was a director and he had his views and uh he he just always seemed to be thorny you know and i never could ever feel like you know friendly toward him or that he was friendly toward me in any way you know it was sort of like employer employee relationship and you know i knew it was worked pretty well because i read most of the stuff these guys had done you know it was you know very solid yeah uh respectable work uh but somehow even though he you know he did hire me uh i found him i found him difficult to get along with so was he if you were at the bureau he was the main sort of he was the main administrator during the time that i was uh mainly involved uh i think you know uh by the early 60s uh you know although this project was still going on uh i wasn't uh you know i i became less and less involved you know it's just the i don't know you know my my work seemed to sort of diverge something so you know even though you say the thrust shifted it was mainly because gary was there and jacob were there and they were in new york and you know they were there all the time they had students that like mark rosenswag was uh as i would call a doctoral dissertation student of gary's at columbia jacobs maybe it was of jacob's i guess a little a little after gary leaves in 1960 768 to go to chicago but michael grossman is yeah but see grossman i didn't know i think i think he was after very chiseled no grossman was being very i knew but only barry i'm not even sure i knew him at the bureau uh so uh you know it's part of part of it was simply i you know was not that much involved but whatever was they were generating in this area of human capital i don't think i take any credit or responsibility for anyone else what about jeff moore talked about saul well of course he he's he's he's cynical none too but yeah jeff was a good guy but totally interested in his stuff nothing else well what did you think of the business cycle shop i mean did you uh ever think well there is this part of the bureau that's devoted to business cycles it's this little factory in which they did business cycles or was it that uh you felt that your work was a part of that uh of the business i felt my work was related uh right i don't i never had the sense that that that feeling was reciprocated but you know by virtue of my association with the brahmavids uh and of abramovitz's approach to long swings you know we generated uh um uh some of the standard nber measures uh you know uh we we we we computed averages over the nber business cycle right to show the long swings and so on and so i had a fair exposure to uh to some of the business cycle methodology and i thought it was good you know i thought it was worthwhile uh where was moe living at the time he was in stanford so he he would just come back for a week at a time or how how did you uh yeah i'm not even sure that uh i guess the you know my big uh uh the time when i had uh uh a real opportunity to to interact with mo was uh i visited at stanford in 1961 and uh that's when i was still working on you know all the long swing stuff and the american baby boom and so on and so uh that was when mo and i had a reasonable amount so prior to right so it was just that you would read his work you would do your work and right if you read the annual reports there would be mo's section and then there'd be your section and so it gave the impression that these were two people who talked to each other but well read each other read each other well that's that's good um did you ever see uh i throw this out because he entered everyone's work and he was behind the scenes and that's irving foreman oh irving he was perfect yes uh and he was he went yeah he was he was he taught me a lot about how how you how you construct a figure so irving was the draftsman of the bureau he was he understood he was a number guy he was a prickly guy oh yeah he was he was absolutely certain about how to do things you know jacob weiner always talks there's that story about jacob weiner the envelope curve well it's true and i can conceive a a foreman as a as being the draftsman in that situation and saying this you absolutely can't do it this way and and irving would never have done it right he would never have done it uh but uh but you know he was right because he said you know every goddamn journal you see they put the titles of things at the bottom of figures you see he says you never put the title at the bottom you read a page from top to bottom you want to put the title at the top and of course he was absolutely right you know and you know there were a lot of things like that uh that but he was just a genius at taking many series and drawing them in the same diagram right he took yeah he taught me how you go about doing that how you how you can you know splice different uh scales and stuff and put them together and so on and the book you know my book uh you know just uh the figures in it you know uh bear the his imprint right absolutely he was undoubtedly you know uh he contributed a lot you know uh in that way uh to uh presentation of the bureau's work that was very rarely appreciated i think but uh i always liked him and we got along uh quite well it's extraordinary that that he he did all that he was he was a full-time employee of the bureau that's just how much came out that was that needed graphical analysis uh complicated and he taught me that there you know that a figure is a work of art it is i mean it's it's a creative work of art it certainly can communicate as much as the entire course we should find uh the original uh irving foremans and have them mounted uh yeah i wonder i'll have to call up new york offices there she is and you can never find any i'm always looking at them to see that overhang of because he's doing it all by hand yeah and he there's never there's never an error and all of the print he must have had plates and the thing was you know my undergraduate degree was engineering yes and my worst subject absolutely was uh mechanical drawing yes i i hated drafting a c and i could really appreciate you know what artistry went into that because i had been so terrible at it yeah and he could just do exquisite work larry's shaking his head because he's terrible at it i have i have two uh questions and then uh we can uh say anything else you can say anything else that you you'd like um the first one is uh is is just my own uh desire to understand um the intellectual roots of your own work on relative income a very important part of where your work then went and in terms of of the economic theory that you had in your head was that what mattered was not just the absolute level of income but your expectations where you saw yourself fitting into some relative and and the relative could be at that moment or relative to your parents relative to when you grew up um and you came upon this notion i don't know if you know in your own mind when you saw the light and everything fit together um uh so maybe you can say a word about that but i was uh interested i was reading rose and milton's book last night and came upon the a statement of roses in which she talks about her work with dorothy brady on relative income in the 30s and then of course jim dusenberry does work on relative income i know that these are somewhat slightly different um concepts than than the one that you hit upon but can you say anything about the intellectual roots of this when you saw this well i think that you put your finger on on basically the you know when i was doing graduate work and then subsequently when i was teaching at penn and graduate a graduate course in economic development there was always this big controversy about the savings ratio and duesenberry's book was you know directed to that and modigliani had written a you know have more of a time series type of analysis but both of the relative income nature and so i i've been teaching you know friedman consumption function and these are the various views and so on uh and you know i'm not sure at what stage sort of uh you know i i i i got to you know make the connection to uh fertility behavior but uh i'm sure that you know that those were the roots of it because uh uh i knew that literature quite well at the time i don't know much anymore but um and you know i i sort of in uh in the nber book when i got onto the baby bust part of the thing uh uh i you know i tried to do more of looking at uh some indicators of the kinds of backgrounds that people came from that might have influenced their aspirations i remember trying to look at some of goldsmith's work great goldsmith's work now there's a name you didn't mention ray was quite a yeah a great personality and quite an influence uh i didn't know he was in residence uh well he was in an app but i was sort of like brian and i knew him because uh of his close association with simon uh yeah so uh we sort of shared a mutual admiration for simon uh so uh you know i'm not sure you know uh exactly uh when i i think you know i sort of had started playing around with the idea of aspirations and gradually i you know i i realized that basically this is what duesenberry and so i would talk about the savings ratio and now that and modigliani and so it sort of merged and i think that's that's basically the genesis of it and then you know uh when i i was at the stanford center in uh 70 71 10 years later see i remember these dates because at 6061 i was at stanford as a visiting professor in 1771 i was at stanford at the center so because in 1881 i was at caltech so uh they're big junctures in my life uh but then at this at i don't know how i got started on looking at happiness uh data but uh you know it had i i initially expected in the happiness state everything would be relative that there would be no differentials at a point in time let alone over time then you know you sort of got this paradoxical result but that was an evolution a subsequent evolution of that so i think sort of it was duesenberry and modigliani and then i got into this and then i got onto happiness and that's what happened i remember when i was in wisconsin you came to give a talk on happiness i think that you gave a talk and may have been just been that it was a cleometrics conference and we went out and there are certain moments that you remember so well because a light bulb comes over your head and you were talking about the theory stuff that you were working on on happiness or maybe in my mind i had a theory model and i remember that dinner so well and that was a lot of fun although i remember going to wisconsin and you were sort of my host you were an assistant professor there and uh it was so nice because that sticks in my mind as the first time i knew you and uh you know how just you know what a great person you were it was that was a very nice visit it was a fun visit um sort of the final question that i have and i probably missed some i've been checking them off and we we can return to any was uh was data work at the bureau and um you know uh um larry and i certainly remember uh computer cards and mainframes and tapes and uh we don't remember doing things these enormous printouts and calculators as as many people do and um but you uh uh i i know that um uh people at the bureau who worked in the 50s and the 60s speak about the fact that that ibm gave them time on their machine and in uh in one of your annual reports um you speak about the ibm 704 and the 602a um do you remember i don't know what these are what a 704 was and but do you have any recollection of where these machines were housed and uh who who i think they were at ibm's headquarters that's what i thought so so ibm was given right so ibm was giving the bureau uh yeah time on the machine right i see uh my my recollection my this is how one of the reasons i always was sort of skeptical of computers because uh there was this wonderful a young woman that sort of did that uh computer took you know she was the one you talked to and she went out is that charlotte what's your last name ocean yes i think that's right okay i think that's right uh and she was very sweet and nice and but to get anything done was a matter of a month or more you know so uh i i i would come up with this idea well this would be a good thing you'd have to do and so i'd give it to charlotte to do well by the time i got it back i either couldn't remember what i wanted or i realized yeah there was something else that was much more interesting to do than look at this that so i would have these you know sizeable computer printouts given to me you know that i would just put on a shell and i decided that you know the main advantage was of getting anything done on the computer was that it gave you time to think about something important so that's that's my recollection of that well that's good because that that answer is the other question i had about this which was tell me about the problems encountered so i think i think we've got that yeah now all all of the of the stuff that i really analyzed all of the time series and population data were done by chantal by hand and you know she would send the these things to me at home or wherever i was in the summer and i would just work with that i don't think i ever or hardly ever used any computer stuff that was done right um are there any other things about the bureau that i missed i know nothing much well one of the best parts about going to the bureau was i would stop at chock full of nuts uh they had the greatest doughnuts the greatest donuts yeah anyway crunchy on the inside exactly you remember in the uh in the hole the crunch is in the hole that's right okay what about what's happening and then and then and i but i i think that was as far as i i went i got myself to be corrupted but uh at the bureau on madison avenue they had a shraps coffee service that's great and shraps of course had the best coffee going so going to new york i had the best donuts and the best coffee i would have europe for once a month bureau kitchen um in cambridge used to have donuts all the time from but from dunkin donuts those were terrible terrible bagels and coffee cakes that should be crispy what is the krispy kreme yeah i've never had a krispy kreme have you no we're out [Laughter] so let me turn this off and thank richard easton and
