thank you first to the organizers for the invitation very happy to be here um I'm going to excuse me um pick one topic so Ben give this a very nice overview um I'm going to pick uh one thing that he kind of mentioned towards the end um and I'm going to be talking about the supply side of this market and in particular the care delivery or hospitals is what I'm going to talk about um so I want to kind of just as an overview um convince you uh hopefully at the end of this talk about um two things one is that um you know this is a very important topic um there's a significant share of the total health care costs that comes from hospital costs and also um huge impact on patient outcome and Welfare um and then I want to kind of talk about you know the main problem here when we look at hospitals which is matching Hospital Resources with patients in need and this is an area I think we haven't seen a lot of work from the market design perspective and I think there's a lot of room there's a huge opportunity for doing interesting uh important work here um the reason that I think this is uh particularly interesting area of research is um because there are multiple parties involved here in the decision making making these allocation decisions um and as a result there are lots of competing objectives and incentives and finally one thing I want to highlight um is the behavioral aspects of these allocation decisions that are made in hospitals and in a lot of cases the human error I think this is very important to take into account when we think about improving the efficiency of allocation resources um so first just to kind of convince you that um you know this is important topic you know over 30 percent of the total National Health expenditure is um Hospital expenditure okay so this is you know um in 2022 for example this is more than 1.3 trillion dollars a year so huge um uh size uh magnitude of um impact here um second in terms of you know hospitals providing care to um uh patients were thinking about you know this is um uh the most urgent type of patients the most severe conditioned patients they receive Care at hospitals so um also from the patient outcome perspective and I'll show you some examples later um this is important topic and uh finally you know in the economics literature there's a kind of limited work on this topic so hospitals largely kind of Remain the black box and we know very little about or we've looked at very little about you know what's really going on inside um hospitals so the question that I want to talk about here is you know our Hospital resources allocated and then um efficient way okay of course you know there are other aspects that are equally important you know for example fairness it could be one important question here but I'll focus on efficiency here um so some examples of you know allocating these resources to patients so first in intensive care unit okay or ICU best um these are allocated to of course patients with the most urgent highest severity um we care about them there are you know 15 to 40 percent of total Hospital costs and so very large fraction and in this country most icus operate in your full capacity what right so very extremely scarce resource so we care about you know really allocating them in an efficient way um operating rooms is the or how we allocate them to surgeons of course and surgeons also match with patients okay so this is also um uh important question um ORS are um you know traditional um uh Revenue engine for for hospitals so they could uh count up to 60 of total Hospital Revenue so you want to think about really allocating these resources in an efficient way um and if we think about you know just regular inpatient units so for hospitals in the U.S and a lot of other countries these beds are organized by specialty okay so for example A cardiology patient would be typically allocated a bed in a Cardiology unit but of course you know when we have congestion when your Cardiology unit gets busy a lot of times the patients are sent to what we call an off-service unit okay so it could be an Orthopedics unit so there's also matching between these specialty beds and patients of different specialty in the hospital okay um and then of course there are other treatments and tested prescriptions um that happened inside the hospital and we also care about the efficiency of allocation there so in terms of you know the impact of inefficient allocation on patients so first I want to kind of try to convince you that impact here is really huge okay so Studies have looked at for example access to an ICU bed um could reduce readmission rate by 32 percent for the high severity class of patients coming from the emergency department okay um access to an ICU band also reduces Hospital length of stays so this is a common measure of quality um uh or sorry a common measure of patient outcome that hospitals use so an access to ICU bed could reduce Hospital length of Say by more than one day which is substantial this is a large impact if we think about um you know or scheduling and efficiency so Studies have looked at for example inefficiency that leads to heavy daily work load of a surgeon and this could lead to up to nine percent longer post-surgery length of say for a patient in a hospital and more than 20 percent longer ICU length of say okay so these are you know important um uh impact on patient outcome and also from the financial economic perspective for a hospital these are large impacts um there are also studies that look at off-service hospital admission and misallocation of other types of treatment how they lead to poor patient outcomes there's several recent papers that that look at um have found evidence of that so what is kind of um the problem there or how do we think about these allocation decisions that are being made inside hospitals why is this interesting area of research first of all you know there are multiple parties involved in making these decisions okay so first we have Physicians who are actually you know making decisions for their patients you might think well you know why is this a challenging problem Physicians should know best about their patients so they should be making the the right decision here but if you look at the data looking in practice this is a very far from what we have in mind so first for Physicians you know each physician is responsible for their assigned patients only okay so in some sense you know Physicians are kind of competing also for their patients for shared resources inside and hospital and so then there's you know in incentive issues are here already and for some Physicians they might also have their own practice right so Ben had also mentioned you know how Physicians get paid also play some very important roles so there are Financial incentives that Physicians are facing that we need to take that into account when we think about these allocation decisions as well um and third and this is also something I really want to highlight is the behavioral factors okay so this is something that um probably would not realize until you start looking at in in the data so purifact for example so Physicians sometimes make team decisions for example and this could have an impact on how they make their allocation decisions naive decision making and in a lot of cases even physician error okay so I'll show you some example of this in a little bit um when you talk to you know Hospital managers um they also acknowledge you know their Physicians make errors although they are you know highly trained professionals um a lot of them will say you know probability of a human error here even for uh you know they're very good Physicians are probably up to 60 to 70 percent um and then of course there's also hospitals okay so hospitals also play in a very important role that here uh for the the outcome of the allocation so hospitals in my prioritize certain types of patients right so for example um when we think about ICU beds there's both surgical patients and medical patients and hospital here would you know set the rule or provide the guideline in terms of how they prioritize these two types of patients for you know their High Revenue generating specialty patients okay so when you look at you know how their capacity or specialty beds are allocated across different Specialties they don't match with demand at all okay for a lot of hospitals for example Orthopedics patients generate a lot of Revenue and you have huge um Orthopedics units where you know Cardiology or general medicine units although demand is very high um you have very limited capacity foreign and then of course you know policy makers um play an important role so Ben had mentioned outcome-based payment so this person might distort hospitals and Physicians um patient admission and selection decisions so there are some studies show that um we do see um once these payment outcome based payments are introduced there's a uh difference in terms of how hospitals and Physicians select their patients um and finally you know patient outcomes unfold over time right even if um we are able to take into account for example we look at you know readmission rate in 30 days or in 90 days there are things that unfold them much longer period of time and how to think about measuring these outcomes is a very important question here so all these different parties are involved in the allocation decisions and um I want to kind of show you um a couple of two examples empirical examples about the behavioral factors on the physician side um so these are um uh papers that uh of my my own that I've looked into the data here so in the first example I want to talk about a very very simple scenario so um um we're looking at the hospitals that are vertically integrated so these are 24 Kaiser hospitals in Northern California because they're vertically integrated so they're less incentive issues so Physicians are facing their Physicians are paid by salary um and another simplification in this setting is that you know there's one physician that makes ICU admission decisions for Ed patients and these hospitals also prioritize surgical ICU admissions to to medical admissions but you're you know very soon realized what there's kind of inter-temporal externality here right if the icus are operating at close to full capacity if I'm meeting a patient at time T this means I'm taking a better way from patients that arrive at t period time T minus one sorry t plus one um so the question is you know are Physicians so forward looking here you know that seems to be um the uh reasonable thing to do it's a dynamic problem but the answer is uh not really okay um so what we did um in this paper is we estimated Physicians potentially Dynamic ICU admission using data over two years from these 24 hospitals for those of you who are familiar with the empirical IO literature this is just a rust model but we're going to also estimate the discount factor in this model um so what we find is that the average discount factor is um about 0.3 okay so what this means is that Physicians not even taking into account very much what happens in two hours okay so they are not on average of overlooking at all okay when we look at the kind of um hospital by hospital um we find that this discount Factor also varies um uh significantly across hospitals so some hospitals Physicians are very forward-looking and the discount Factor as he made it is about 0.9 and some are you know not forward-looking at all okay essentially making um static decisions here so what we learn here is that you know within the same hospital system there's a huge heterogeneity in Physicians forward looking Behavior okay and this is not an isolated example so there are also similar findings in other diagnostic settings that people have looked at there's a huge behavioral um hydrogenity across Physicians okay um so here we also look at you know how big is really this impact is this behavioral aspect really important so for some hospitals we find that you know more forward-looking can be equivalent to adding essentially one ICU bed or saving over one million dollars operating costs per year okay which is um significant um so the point I want to make here is that you know taking into account the physician behavior or sometimes you know naive decision making is a really important in thinking about you know coming up with a good mechanism for allocating um these Hospital resources okay so some kind of um interesting questions here to think about is you know for example if we provided physician with more accurate information are they going to be able to make better decisions so a lot of hospitals use real-time census information where you can really see who exactly are the patients at each unit at each stage of their treatment um sometimes these information is not available to physician so um there's a kind of information design type of question here um also providing you know demand forecasting tools a lot of hospitals are kind of um quickly adopting these tools to try to help their physician to make more informed decisions um hospitals also of course provide guidelines and incentives um to want to try to reduce the heterogeneity in Physicians Behavior how could we do that in order to improve efficiency in uh these important resource allocation decisions is another question and also Ben had mentioned this too you know the role of AI in improving allocation decisions hospitals are also kind of jumping out some of these tools to to help them reduce heterogeneity behavioral factors um in terms of on the hospital side so those are you know the Physicians hospitals allocation of shared resources that's a big question across different departments so medical versus surgical patients for example um so here really the incentives and behaviors of all parties matter and so going back to some of the points that Ben had mentioned we here I think Market design tools which are robust to physician behavior and air that we you know try to take those into account is really important and also huge opportunity for future research um in the remaining two three minutes I'll mention another kind of quick example so um in this setting we looked at cardiac surgery scheduling and the Columbia hospital um there is um uh quite a bit of work done in the operations community on surgery scheduling but I think there's still huge room um for future research especially when you start looking at data looking into what's actually happening um in practice so here like many hospitals and the or schedule is organized by blocks so one room is assigned to one surgeon for an entire day um and um it's partially kind of a result of Surgeons preferring block schedules so that they can you know spend other days teaching and seeing patients um and the schedule is also fixed months in advance so result of that isn't you know when an urgent case arrives and surgeon who has the or block is more likely to perform the surgery but what we find is that adding one more case to surgeon's daily workload actually increases the or time on average substantially by by close to 30 minutes and post surgery ICU Time by over 20 on average so huge impact so this shows that inefficient allocation of orders to surgeon fatigue and for patient outcomes so again kind of highlighting how taking into account the physician behavior failure is going to be very important in thinking about the good mechanisms so just kind of um very quickly a kind of questions that that I think are are worth thinking about is you know can we think about mechanism to incentivize surgeons not in schedule to share a workload a more accurate forecast of or Time by surgeon but here of course there's also incentive issues because the surgeon knows the best about their patient and they may not kind of give um they may have incentives to you know over estimate or underestimate the or time um and then from the cardiac surgical Department perspective they're also important to play important role here how they're prioritizing between elective and Urgent cases incorporating scheduling considerations when we're matching cases to surgeons right and also a coordination of scheduling of Specialists and staff your supporting team in the surgery it's also important and better allocation of pre-surgery beds and post surgery best so this is important thing for hospitals to decide so finally you know incentives and behaviors of all parties involved to play key role inefficient or allocation and also other important resource allocations um in in hospitals
