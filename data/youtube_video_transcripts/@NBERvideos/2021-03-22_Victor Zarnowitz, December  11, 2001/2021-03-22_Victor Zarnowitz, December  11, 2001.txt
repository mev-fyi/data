here at the conference board in new york city on december 11th of 2001 and i'm here with victor johnowitz and i've asked victor to begin at the beginning and end at the end but where he sees the beginning is wherever he wants to begin it and i'm willing to begin at whatever beginning he wants so thank you victor well let me begin at uh when i came to new york and that would be the last of january 1952. and i came from heidelberg germany where i spent some time studying economics getting phd and waiting uh primarily waiting for the us visa which took a while and took enough time for me to finish there if you compare it for example with fate of others jacob mintza for example a good friend of mine also from the national bureau he came earlier because he didn't have my problem he was in in germany uh longer and i came from russia and there was a law called mccarran act mccarran walter actor that made it difficult for people who came from russia to at the time to get to the u.s right something like that right and but that was revoked right in the congress and then i could go um and instead of studying in in us as jacob did for example in emory and so on i studied in halibut which wasn't so pleasant given my my past but um i was all right there was a whole group of students mostly in medicine and when i was the only one in economics at that time in hardback i got a phd in there then i came to new york and um my first job and still my my association and it was with the national bureau of economic research which was at that time at the columbus circle the place where where there is today the convention convention hall and tall tower and i just um looked for a job and by i believe mid may about um ten weeks after i came to new york i i got a job at the international bureau and had not heard about the national bureau oh i heard about the national bureau near that's why i came there of course um but were you in contact with um i was not in con no not before i got a job and i got a job not with more brands not in business cycles but in a study of mergers by gideon rosenblutz a canadian economist then in new york and still a very good friend of mine and i was working on that on that project um and i applied for a for a research scholarship at the social science research council and about a year after i came to new york we moved for a year for an academic year to harvard where i had this post-doctoral research training fellowship with us cult of the social science research council but then after after that um academic year at harvard where i started with samuelson and solo and leon tf and other great names i came back to the bureau i was very attached to the bureau even you know after after only a year of working there i found i liked the atmosphere i liked very much the place and the kind of work that they did appealed to me largely empirical but i believe um it's not quite correct to say that it was like was largely empirical i think that they they always respond to to some general theoretical advances and well that's sometimes difficult to get but um they were working on it i believe that um mitchell's 1913 uh book which was kind of uh the beginning of the study of business cycles alabama alabiro he was after the founder of the bureau i missed him by the way because he died shortly before before i arrived but i believe that that it's not not right and not fair to claim that his work was empirical and not theoretical although some people he met the bureau would would subscribe to it probably george stigler would anyway i am i found the atmosphere and the type of work very appealing i was interested in business cycles much earlier at heidelberg my my professor eric preiser wrote a little book on on the theory of business cycles was very interested in it so um what was your phd i'll call it a dissertation my dissertation was my dissertation was it was my dissertation i was a doctor uh dr schrift as they call it and it was published as a book in heidelberg and it was on the theory of income distribution so it was not on on business cycles or not directly on it and they are either inca the uncommons for thailand in germany in german um and vikram ghun hoitygastrand which means development and and the present state and so i had already something but i had to start a new in a sense in uh at the bureau i was just a research assistant there for a while um but i worked with gideon and i found that interesting as well um but it was not my my field it was you know i i went to to harvard for a year when i came back i had a paper my first paper in english was actually on input on input output theory and published in the review of economics all right in 61. that's right but well i i'm impressed that you know that much but what's interesting is that you did that research during that yeah nice i think fertile year 53 54. and then did some editors say do this do that it took until 61 to get it published or no no no no i think it was it was published earlier i don't know exactly when but it was 60 it was 61. really i have to fight right it was on um well then it took a long time perhaps right uh but i didn't realize that it was that that late all right but uh it was written this paper of in the review of economic studies and it was written in havoc and i you thanked the people who were there all right so i put it together that of course that came out of the year of 53 right but i came back to i think 61 i wrote i was in 61 day um i think on forecasting at the bureau anyway i have we can check it with you as my wish i could be wrong i think you are probably wrong i don't think it took that long no and i don't think it took longer i i submitted it probably before i i came back to the bureau and um it didn't take that long now and but anyway um after i came back to the bureau uh i i i worked with uh felt certain not to redick spells and he was also the bureau and i had some things with him but um it was for a while that i worked with with um a guy from from berkeley in in fiscal policy and again i have to look at that maybe i should do it now sure i can turn this camera off because you know it will be probably better um we're back uh i just want to correct something which is that victor's review of economic studies paper was 1956. and uh and so we're we're reconstructing the zarnowitz bureau history okay victor well after i came back from harvard um in 1954 53 54 the academic year i was i was at harvard on a post-doctoral research training fellowship of social science research council and i spent that year uh working at samuelson seminar leonty of seminar and these are these were the two main main centers of my study and out of the elementary seminar came this paper which was my first english publication on causes and consequences of changes in general equilibrium system review of economic studies during 1956. so i came back at the bureau i worked there for a short while on on fiscal problems with two professors from berkeley but very soon i shifted to business cycles and states in that area ever since i became an assistant to jeffrey moore who was the associate director of research at the national bureau and whose area of study of course was a business act and i worked first at um at um a um a book a two volume book edited by by jeffrey moore on business cycle indicators and i contributed three chapters to this book one chapter on cyclical aspects of incorporations and the formation of new business enterprise and the second one on cyclical changes in business failures and corporate profits and that was caused with lionel lerner the son of abalone who yeah who was at a beautiful time and finally the third of these papers and the one that i spent most time on is the timing of manufacturers orders during business cycles so these three chapters in business cycle indicators of geoffrey moore was my first um contribution to the and two business actors but even before then i worked for a while with ruth mack at the bureau and the outcome was an article in the american economic review which i course at which uh ruth mack uh entitled cause and consequence of changes in retailers by and it was ruth's initiative and she sort of corrupted me for this for this project and in that paper she developed or she continued to develop the concept of what you call sub-cycles and what we would call today growth cycles probably or maybe slowdowns and so on this is a concept of of changes that are more visible in growth rates or in detriment values than than in levels and where are they on your cv is the prismac paper it's on page eight in the complete one right no no it's on the it's not a short article it's on the books and articles and um but it's early so it is you know it goes uh in the reverse time order so right and that was part that was published in 19 march 1958 in the uh uh can you put your finger on it on your company there it is no that's the business cycle oh that's the one with right now all right do you have it it's not on this um maybe that's a short thing i think it's a shorter one that's what my and um yeah in a sense it was also in business cycles if you want right right so by then you were a visiting uh assistant professor at columbia and a lecturer and i take it that uh um that was through burns must have introduced you to no i don't i don't think so i uh i don't think that burns was involved in this one um it was victor fuchs yes who you should by the way also interviews because victor was uh my name is victor um was at the school of general studies and that's where i was teaching yes part time and so was he so it was columbia university school of general studies and um i'm not sure what what i was teaching exactly there but it was economics clearly it was macroeconomics problem and okay so um that was true victor fuggs okay um you would but i i was there to teach for a time you'd come down to the bureau and and uh work on these various projects well i was somehow full time at the bureau so in part time at colombia so colombia was definitely sort of um i devoted much less time to it compared with the bureau in bureau it was full-time and so tell me about much of the work that you were doing uh after you came back from harvard um you of course you worked with ruth mack but much of it appears to be the work that um uh was on business cycles right that came out in these volumes that that jeff wore i think less than a year after i came back from harvard i started working with jeff the bureau night and i was his assistant but i must say very early he gave me a chance to to work on my own and the first chance he gave me was connected with a book he was writing or editing i mean he has contributions to that to that book as well as editorship and he just let me do what i was interested in he suggested what what indicators i should look at he was interested in in the leading indicators i mean he revived the work of of bench and mitchell are the michelin bands that went back i believe to the first effort in indicators at the bureau was in 1937 38 and when secretary of treasury morgan saw asked them to and to construct a list and they did and it was a list of indeed indicators of recovery because they were waiting for a recovery in 37 it was the relapse you know from the great depression and then and the second effort was was actually more and more by that time had an occasional paper already on the leading indicators and that was more general because it referred to both recoveries and recessions and then he wrote this or edited this book of business cycle indicators it's in two volume the first volume is text and second volume is data a collection of data small of indicators and i was working on that on that book at the beer so at the bureau the business cycle project was an extremely large part of the bureau there were many research assistants that's right and there was um well i don't know many i mean the whole bureau was not not that big right but uh but there there was sort of a protocol that you use can you talk about um what people have referred to when bob lipsy claims that he still has a mimeograph sheet about the protocol i don't think this is apocryphal about the protocol that one used in taking a series and looking at it in terms of business cycles well the protocol for for business cycles it was really a big book and it was in measuring business cycles by by benjamin mitchell there was a kind of a bible of business cycle procedures and they were they were additional they were additional materials and there was no computer but there was it was a calculator it was a freedom calculator we worked on you know we ran regressions we calculated regressions for example on that on that manual calculator which was a very time consuming and sort of tedious uh work but it helped to understand it you know from ground up i think how what for example regression means a multi-paragraph and and many people think that you know that this was very helpful although as i said tedious and so we did that but we followed the procedures and in general of measuring business cycles but the procedures are in different from from today's computer procedures for computerized procedures very different they allowed i think for a much larger role of judgment for example um a turning point programs that were developed they existed late late and then again they didn't exist at that time yet and so it was done largely by by judgment but by trained judgment backed by a lot of experience after a while you work with so many times years and i find today that i do the same thing i get a 20 point list from the computer and i i never accept it as it stands i always looked at the chart because that's what we have done then and that's what i'm used to without a chart all or time series i'm not going to do anything i have to look at the chart the chart is after seasonal adjustment and we look at the quality of seasonal adjustment too we paid a good deal of attention to it and then we looked at now we look at the turning points designated by the computer and sometimes we overrule the computer for example the computer even though it is instructed in the very abortion procedures to do more or less what what what we did before it doesn't always do it exactly if there is a plateau for example if there are two competing turning points peaks at troughs if they are alike we were told to take the latter one and the later one of the two and the computer will not always do that and the previous one will be slightly higher and will be taken by the computer will tend to to take the later one for example this is just uh that's an illustration and that's how we proceeded in fact we had these rules uh but we used our judgment and the rules themselves were might have been overruled if that if that seemed to be the best uh choice but we always work together so for example there was a perhaps underwritten rule but much followed where when we made this kind of a decision uh somebody else independently also did it we invited somebody and to do it and um and we spent a ridiculous amount of time sometimes on discussing these decisions when we disagreed but i think that it was probably justified at least i like to think thank you go back to the earlier data on business cycles to you know burns mitchell and others had worked through the older data and you were then picking up and sort of adding to it did you ever go back to the oldest stuff what would i have done very recently i did something similar and what i did i did here is um to look at our so-called index of a coincidence composite index of coincident indicators of which therefore there was personal income rate personal income less transfer payments a manufacturing and trade sales again adjusted for inflation industry production the index of industrial production and non-farm employment from establishment survey the combination of these four is the coincidence index and i wanted to see how the old dates of the nbr hold up and after many revisions that were made in in some of the cities not as many as in gdp but you know the televisions and turns and i looked at gdp as well and there are deviations even though the dates are not revised but they are not very serious as far as coincidence is concerned the only serious one was a lead of six months i believe that it and the rest is all zeros that means exactly coincident or minus plus minus one or two months so that's sort of negligible and there was one large one in gdp there were three leads of one quarter each uh which i don't know you know how they how they arise but must be due to revisions because we looked at both this monthly coincidence index and at gdp as well of jane patterson anyway so um it's holding up pretty well but not not not exactly and i i have my doubts whether you know the the present data are better than the judgment then made by what i would like to think were skilled observers and you know because that could be due for example to the deflators new chain indexes why that should you know matter 40 years back i'm not sure you know why that should mean uh rewriting history in a sense or whether but i simply don't know you know i that is some an interesting subject of study for study and did you and sort of when you're working at the bureau and thinking about sort of the broad sweep of business cycles and of course that's what mitchell did he uh you know he and others sort of tried to uh push the uh the envelope of data for the us to push it back into the 19th century uh way back into the 19th century um did you um and earlier except that the earlier ones are not uh not monthly right did you sort of hold this stuff in your hands and your head and say um aha this is how i would tell the story of the american economy using these business cycles now i see did you ever have one of these eureka moments when you say aha now i understand or did you always say business cycles are difficult they're unique there are some aspects that are similar but we're not going to do a very good job at telling the history of an amer of an economy on the basis of these business cycles how did you view i i i i think you know they are different they are complicated but they are common threats they are common elements and i'm convinced myself that that these guys but i didn't know mitchell i didn't know him only from from reading but i knew burns pretty well and i was very kind of happy and even proud i must say when he asked me once he said he has written himself out on mitchell and he asked me to write about mitchell for the international encyclopedia of social sciences which i did you know and i'm convinced that they want it wanted a general theory of of business cycles that they tried to move in this election but they they were extremely cautious they were they thought that it doesn't come first that it comes much much later after they accumulate a lot of knowledge about what what happened during business cycles as much as one of michael's books is entitled what happens during business so they wanted to know that and develop an empirical sound somehow and valid validated and something that can be validated with the data a theory of this kind but they certainly believe that while they differ that they have common elements and they wanted to concentrate on the common elements they were very they were explicit about it and i think you know if you read them um closely and correctly you'll get this impression particularly from mitchell i mean in measuring business cycles they may have gone too too far you know in and going going into into great detail you know and um and losing what what seems almost a loss of of the sight of original theory of business cycles but that was if they did it it was nothing it was against the intention rather than you know right yeah in 1970 he was very explicit on that i believe a couple of questions for you about the people who were there and what you thought of them what your interactions were let me begin with arthur burns who led the bureau from what was at 47 until 67 with one small year or two when he was uh at the council well he was he was mostly elsewhere i mean when i was at the at the bureau more random things with others but and burns was absent burns was mostly upset well of course for the time that you were there there was a long time when he was at at the council right so he was truly absent he was truly and and in fact then um i don't mean that he was you know absent in the sense that he would be around and and and and neglected someone now that i i don't think that but he was absent he was in washington he was in washington and that's made a big deal of difference he comes back when you come back from your year at harvard he comes back he comes back right and when he came back he was active he was always an active guy he was he had i was never bothered somehow by that but some people were very very much by his kind of presence and i know the truth was i mean it was interesting oh bothered by arthur she was bothered by her i saw her crying right right ben rents could be very very sharp and and and difficult right yeah in meetings and so on now of course i was young at first i didn't i didn't participate on all these meetings you know but i saw her crying yes and she complained that she was not rude but but extremely difficult you know and giving them to understand his superiority you know and inferiority and something to that effect as i say this is second hand for me i i never had it with him but from luz i know that for sure did you ever hear anything about burns's um and kuznets yeah i heard i heard about the conflict but again i don't have any first-hand knowledge of it that they were not not good with each other and i heard it simply in the context of how difficult branch was you know um but i don't know the detail i learned about the detail and so on uh much much later oh i knew him of course yes i knew him i cannot say i knew him very well i knew him because among others he worked on he worked on business cycles as well he worked he helped quite a bit you know in before in measuring business cycles and later and it's still earlier in seasonal variations all of that was one package right all right uh so i knew him from there from that and i think that not everybody is very comfortable with national income accounts i am not myself i must say so you know i'm somewhat sympathetic to to the critics i think i deplored the fact for example that the government statistical agencies neglect other things to to devote all the almost all the time to internationally in chemicals and i think for some purposes for example dating business like international income accounts are inferior for two reasons they are quarterly and then and then they are also subject to long strengths of revisions that um are not not always very clear you know where they lead to or what how they are justified and all other it's not always clear to me that there are improvements so um maybe that was behind this this conflict with uh with kushner well my sense that is is exactly yours that some of the conflict was a personality that that burns was just yeah burns had a kind of overbearing personality part was that i believe simon wanted to move the bureau in the direction of thinking more about growth and development he wanted to broaden the bureau and the bureau's mandate was to study the united states i think burns made that very clear to uh to simon and simon had before you came to the u.s simon had put in for funds i think through the poor foundation to do this study of a multi-country which he of course did yeah uh and burns would not have it in in the bureau i think part of it was that right we'll never know even today there you know those people who say i think martin himself would say that is a national not international bureau of economic research yes yet we have japan in there we have germany in there that when when there's a way of getting in uh marty now has these relationships and very important relationships with india china now it's going to be cuba so speaking for myself for example we here at the conference board now and are working and that's why i joined the conference part on these international indicators and composite indexes i wish there will be some kind of link with the national bureau on that but i didn't pursue it yet i i was told by bob paul that it is indeed the national bureau not the international bureau of economic research so maybe this is not that um old and past this whole notion yes there is more more than the departure in the international direction but still not not enough as far as i'm concerned i think you're absolutely right um when anna and milton were working on a monetary history did you did you you saw anna because she was there i think she had an office the bureau from 53 so it would have been when you got i saw anna and so from time to time milton as well of course right but and um when i went to chicago it was uh george ziegler who you know and told me asked me whether i would go and i went um even though george did not work at all in in my area in business and was rather suspicious of the whole thing but i think he was always suspicious all right yes i think you're right but build um right he wanted to attract very good that's right and milton and milton of course was in chicago already and um and he was interested in business cycles very much so i must say i i never i mean i um i admired the effort and the results to a large extent the monetary history but i was never persuaded that that this is the clue to business science this is the main this is the core of the clue to the business act yes so did you did you talk with anna about uh maybe to some extent i don't remember probably not a lot probably not a lot yeah and but i i don't want to defend all of the monetary history of the united states but much of the if you take for example the chapter on the greatest business cycle of them all the chapter on the great contraction um their point is that other forces were getting us down so that there was you know i think it's in august of 29 or no it's july of 29 there's a business cycle downturn then in october 29 the stock market crashed and that would have all of the events up until then and beyond would have gotten us down pretty far and then the contraction of the money supply fully right brings us to the bottom so they're not denying no no no they are not denying other forces now and they're much too good for that um but right but i mean but um well others you know it so often happens you know some followers um want to go further than the originators so you know there was there was a good deal of uh writing business like history in the in the monetarist um sense and direction and more exclusively monetary things and they probably some people went further in that direction than then and then milton and anna would uh would uh would do right but it was nevertheless probably their influence anyway um you asked me whether i i sort of collaborated on that i must say no yeah but but in discussion i'm trying to get a sense of in the bureau it's a small organization um you're working in part by yourself and part with jeff moore maybe self-fabricant a bit uh there are other people around uh do you get together you have lunch together you have the brown bag seminar right can you talk a bit about that well you know um that was very open and uh of course we it was a small place and the relations were in general good there were some conflicts of course but i didn't experience that directly and i went along very well with jeff in particular and i worked more closely with him than with others and and i think the good thing about the bureau was precisely the freedom that they gave to people if they thought that they didn't deserve it that they you know will make good use of that freedom and i may have been of course yeah there probably were cases the opposite cases you know where say research assistant stayed stayed research resistant for forever you know but yeah that will probably happen in every uh organization but there was i think there would there was an interest in in developing people and letting people uh do work on their own at least this was my experience i think just about everyone who was at the bureau at that time and and i think through till today says the same thing about the purpose yeah and that was probably among the best best features of the bureau now on in in in discussions for example of course there are people differ as you know and and some are very strong and some are simply more timid or not so good at that so it was probably good not so easy for for younger people uh beginners in in in this kind of work to say make themselves hurt uh against people like burns and and and friedman for example who are both you know friedman is a is a debater kind of i don't know whether you know him from the side all right he is you know so it's not so easy it's not so easy and sometimes it was was we wrote i remember was where jacob mentioned a um jacob means i edited a book on economic focus and expectations you may know it and we have a joint paper there jacob and i and you know i did on the whole i continued to work in this area he that was for him a single departure and and roseanne called contributed and so on and at the bureau there were always stuff readings you know that i mean anything that was uh to be published and so on went through staff review and that's remarkable because you know there were no outsiders and you worked with these people and they you know had to pass judgment on on your work so i remember that milton friedman uh read our paper the paper which was jacob and in one case he wrote on big on the margin nonsense with a it was a exclamation of maybe more than one exclamation mark and well we looked at that we didn't find this and i still don't think it was nonsense at all it was a disagreement between his view and and ours uh so that was you know that was um a by-product of of the work at the bureau you have to be you had to be prepared for it for this kind of thing of course you could oppose but you had to pay attention to that yeah who are the other people who were coming through let's say from 54 until 50 um but there were many there were many 59 you leave and you go to chicago right so but i left i i was still very very often in new york you know and i worked with the bureau from chicago other people who you look back on those years there was a guy again i have to look up the annual reports to remember the names and so on as a guy at mit you may know him in in fiscal year i knew him very very well but it's years ago and he didn't work in in my area but we we were neighbors i was a neighbor also of the guy who is now lives in garden garden city long island many many names will come back when i when i when i and i may have something to say three minutes who knows right um the guy i mentioned from long island worked on did you say what works um i was my neighbor he also worked i think on concentration and concentration right right [Music] and maybe my other thing i should have brought the publication occasions right i mean that would that would um i didn't work with him directly but you know and was my neighbor i remember i will remember many of these things which i'm sorry for for my memory of names that they definitely deteriorated someone doesn't remember names um but i will recall uh of course jacob would uh would appear he meant sir yeah i worked with him okay i'm sure and stigler and siegel i didn't work with stila but he knew about me he he asked me to go to chicago so you must have known me but he was aware in fact when i came when i came to new york i remember i had an interview with with gideon who hired me but also with jeff moore and with um um and we stretched yes what are your recollections of stephen uh my recollections are more from chicago right not from not that much from the bureau because we didn't work together but um of course much more in from chicago and i knew very well there and and he was tough just like uh like uh freedman was and and burns in different ways i mean in very different ways not personally you know but demanding you know expecting a lot and and uh george also had a great sense of humor oh yeah and a great sense of irony and sarcasm and which milton no milton didn't have it no no um and he was going to george's lectures i i did i o and i went to george's lectures and sometimes i would just go for the jokes yeah he was great at that and he tried to be fair but he was he had strong opinions they all had strong opinions extremely extremely stronger things that may have been a little bit on the on the negative side to some extent you know it's not good to be so opinionated but strong opinions prevailed at the bureau there's no question about it you know right and they differ among individuals of course so um is there anything else you want to say about the period at the bureau up until when you and i will still say left to go to chicago because you didn't leave even though you came back very well i came back but of course i left i was not present physically and that makes a difference where you are of course so he was sad to go i was set to go but i was you know i wanted to teach i i knew that this should be advantageous for for for me and it was and it was you were still a uh your title was a research assistant rather than no i think it was associated right i think i was or i don't remember when it started but i was on the you know they had this list of people on the on the covers and uh and at some point yeah of course yeah i picked all right i was picked up for it right but i don't remember exactly when but all of that is could be easily checked with annual reports right absolutely no i just don't remember 1959 probably not not very long my impression is that maybe two two years after i came back to three years no no probably no longer than that i was working with more at the same time as a assistant and i was already working on my own stuff you know so it was not so very clear i know what it was said as well when i spoke to him and bob was was just a research assistant and of course you you would have known bob oh yes of course i knew i knew all right he was uh um he was i will say sort of more of a kid because he didn't have a phd yet he had and so therefore he was sort of a research assistant right but there was not you know and that was a good thing i don't think that there was a sense of very strict hierarchy and so maybe with some people like bro like burn burns maybe more but certainly more for example i would say that more was very good at that you know it's delegating world at you know picking up people and and letting them do their own work and that was my experience because she was my boss after i came back and i didn't have it with rosin blues and with the guys from from berkeley but this is because they themselves were sort of visitors and temporary you know things but more was of course on the staff and as soon as i started working for him very soon after that i worked on these three papers you know and maybe difficult to say for a while whether i was a research assistant or research associate but it was fluid and that came very fast so my experience was that they let you work uh on your own uh regardless of where you where you had your phd and you know where all of that and regardless of your english of course you were expected to write so you had to to to be good enough in english you know but it wasn't so difficult at least 59 you get this offer it's a very good offer right from the university of chicago it's a business school right it was for associate professorship not another assistant because i was already assistant assistant professor to colombia so and and i was 40 40 years of age so it was when i in my farewell uh party you know um stiegler and jonah gave talks which you know i couldn't wish for better people and i of course had to reply and in my reply i stressed the fact that i was already 40 and i came to to chicago and i came as a associate professorship you know um with kenya no tenure i got i got two years later like two or three years later something like that anyway um and that's in many places you know it wouldn't be so obvious that you'll get there at this age and with my background which was not not fully american and so and and that i think that this is um this is a a positive feature of chicago that they were open enough um to do that and i think it was were received and it was meant it was honestly necessarily meant as a kind of a counter complement to all of that and it was it was the beginning of one of the absolutely grand moments in the history of the university of chicago right economics but it was similar you know so i was lucky both at the bureau and at chicago and in the combination because at the bureau it was very similar and they were open and they and they accepted me for what i was worth you know and gave me a chance to to work on my own it's true that i had a phd and all of that they wanted me back in in germany and of course i didn't i say of course but i mean you will understand it probably but the my german professor and particularly his uh his the 10th class they didn't like it because he said um like i answered it too quickly but of course you know after all of that um all my experiences in europe was obvious i wanted to be in in the states and i felt well in the states so i answer not so quickly and very politely that um but in the negative there was an opening in reagan's book that yeah and the president wanted me to do that this is sort of what's the point i just want to know so you you moved to chicago your wife your two sons um the south side of chicago is uh is a uh it was not a very pleasant place in uh in certain respects it was a the university was um the grandest place but hyde park yeah was was a little dangerous right and how did you adapt to it it wasn't so bad you know and it wasn't so bad i i had i we lived very close we lived very close blackstone you will know blackstone and 58. that is wonderful 58 is the axis of the university right so it was on blackstone yeah a pretty large building and i was on the top floor seat floor and i lived there for about 13 years and then i built a house on the next on the you know next right yeah it was it was a space between the two buildings between this building and the next one was the university uh there were people there was a physics professor there under me you know and i bought the parcel between this building and the next one was a student housing of the university of chicago and then i built a small house so um it worked out perfectly well i mean it was my wife my great wife that moved mainly and the house and so on that was her i worked more than mine but um very very happy yeah it was the happiest time of my life in chicago actually because i had a family i had a nice house yeah near short walk to the world was very nice i lost my wife last last year to parkinson it was very hard here you know she didn't want to come here very much you know but um and so i blame myself for for moving so quickly and so on but i had a good and she understood it too she always went with me you know i i worked with moore again at colombia initially but then everything fell apart for various reasons you know and i didn't have you know it wasn't very good until i got this this job which is a good one but i don't know for how long you know in my age and so on as long as i can i i do it do you see any uh uh we're gonna run out of the film now i thought that i would just do a lit can you sit for just a little bit no i give you all the time i'm very much interested in this okay okay so as long as you i'm going to turn this off and put in another roll for just probably another 20 minutes but you must let me again people and in the office of victims arnold woods on december 11 2001 and um they're just a couple of of uh questions that i thought that um you would have some interesting responses to which is how do you see um the function of the bureau change in the time that you were the closest to it in the 50s then into the 60s when you were returning to it from chicago forgetting about the more recent version of the bureau with with marty in which it has very much changed its function in a very deliberate way but in the 50s and the 60s do you see the function of the bureau changing and i mean that in think about the relationship between the bureau and the us government what one was doing what the other one was doing the relationship between the bureau and other private operations is there any sense in what should change well i know about the changes again i don't have i was not involved in them directly and there were of course changes at the top the presidents have changed there was a kind of um it was a problem mainly because of um of people were not not on the spot first bands spent a lot of time in washington and and then more left and fabricant became more active more left for also you know being and became commissioner of bureau of labor statistics and spent a lot of time in in washington uh and there was some kind of an interregnum there and became active uh elipsie was active in administrative positions but there's a lot of of gaps to to fill in for example i did fit in the gap left by by moore um in business circles uh to some extent what about that function that was not clear to me that there was a change in the animation of the bureau there was the same interest in in researching more or less the same same same areas same people accepted they become they have become kind of distracted by by other jobs made in government and then maya came my uncle uh the interest changed of course somewhat i think there was probably less emphasis on business cycles as things developed but there was still a good deal of interest in the area you know i think i think as far as gov relationship with government are concerned that you ask and there was an old old rule that um the bureau was to be non-partisan and non-politically in a sense and that was that was observed in generally it was kind of in constitution of the bureau and that was observed by the successive uh administration of the bureau always still up there i believe when the top is a person is is actually active and has strong political views we'll be very careful to to speaking his own name her own name rather than and we are that was always and the case um there was a question there was there were financial problems of course the bureau had and that was finally resolved sort of results in the in the present bureau rather than in the old one the old one suffered from that uh time of the bureau and when you were there you were funded by the bureau of the bureau right money from ford foundation and from other right for example for the forecasting study i guess it was burns for raised the money and um manufacturer of um refrigerators what was the name of the of the name big manufacturer representatives gave gave money for that so it was private money you know it was private money it was not just old ford foundation or or nsf or anything like that and you know so it was um it was money from from corporations where they could could interest corporations in in that um but i was very subdued when i compared for example with the conference board uh it's much more active for all you know english with business executives and so on for large corporations um asking for money raising money in various ways interesting them in what we are doing there was much less of that was at least visible to staff members at the bureau maybe because it was all much smaller or maybe it was reserved to the to different people and here it is not you know here i'm asked to talk to groups of businessmen i never had that yet that wasn't done yeah so at the bureau you were never asked to write a proposal to oh yes that yes but it was all internal you know it was all internal it was not very formal either you know you did it and you didn't much of that was oral rather than in writing and i believe so it was not very formalized but you could interest people in this or that by talking with and you can you could write it of course you wrote you wrote your contributions to the annual report each year each one who had a project wrote it that's how it's how it worked actually i don't remember that it was much more than that yeah now i've i've uh now that i've received all of them i've gone through many of them and it's it's um it's often uh sort of humorous to to read a little blurb by yourself or milton or anna in in which they say during the summer of 1961 i did the following a little blurb or i have not made much progress on right that's what we did and that was the progress we reportedly normally gave was the microphone okay we we talked a lot as i say much of what that was informal at least on on the level i operated maybe it was formalized in a higher level but i think that most of it found its way to to the annual report which actually staff members have written and that was reviewed but not very strongly what i have written i remember i was always accepted and published in the annual report and that's why the annual report i think is a good source of seeing what what we have been doing or what we have failed and doing um we're sort of we've sort of worked our way up in time and you uh you just mentioned uh ed coo and john meyer so we're now into the 60s and the bureau and can you mention anything about what happens when now when ed kuh comes in i think that there are also some changes in in the machinery at the bureau we're getting i think hooked up to a mainframe okay there was of course yes the computer made its uh adventure to bureau and before then even though there were changes there were absences and and therefore changes i think fabricant was activated for for a while you know was really running the bureau but that was not much of the change in in substance or in mission as you call it that i remember it was very much the same there was a continuation of of what uh mitchell burns and moore were doing before with little change i believe in substance now with my uncle there were more changes there's definitely more change um but there was also there was there was a good deal of continuity still and fuchs was very very active and i've been sharing the beer all right and then he moved west also right and that was she's doing i think this palo alto uh branch and um and he did it very much in this in the old way i believe even maya and cooper perhaps did it in a old way at least the scale was was similar the main difference i think is um that the bureau was much smaller the projects were much fewer and very very few and distinct and everything was more or less centralized people were on the spot and working on it on the spot or if they left let's say to a university they continued more or less on the same project and they would rather frequently appear in in new york and and again talk about that or present us that the findings and so on and later of course it became much much bigger and much more decentralized and in terms of projects in terms of funding i believe also because people rose raised their money at the bureau through the bureau but you know on their own more or less and that was not before the case right and that was um a very very big change what were your feelings or what was your sense when you discovered that john meyer would be the new head of the bureau well you know i i didn't know him well i i learned to know him pretty soon and um you know even though it was different it was still i would say there was still much the same saying as far as i'm concerned you know arthur had been uh pushed out kindly maneuvered out well i no no i didn't and i i simply may i may be wrong and maybe he was but um i was given to understand i think we were given to understand that it was you know that it was the other way around that burns found maya and and install him and that may or may not be the case i just don't know i don't know either no i don't think it was i really don't think john all right no no my impression is that that you know burns was looking for somebody and found maya um that's my impression and now how maya ended up i i again don't know really i don't know if there were intrigues or some you know things at the top i was no no and i i didn't know maybe i would have cared but i never knew about it and i never was told anything so you know i know um no but what i was told what i understood is definitely that uh you know it didn't come from maya and throwing burns out that was the other way around that's what i meant right i didn't think that meyer threw burns out but that the board um decided that it would be best if burns were not there and it could have been there was definitely that was definitely the case some case for it i believe because branch was wasn't simply not there and you cannot you know if you were but of course he was then very fortunate in some sense because the next year he is selected as the head of uh the federal reserve well yeah that that very mixed views on how he did his areas there is on how he did it all right and then you were in chicago at the time and uh she didn't have very good interviews at chicago very good reviews and milton who had been very close with authors right breaks with him right yes i know and again i know it but i don't i was not involved in that at all in any way you know neither men milton or asa told me anything about it directly so um no but i know i know how they felt because this you know was was general knowledge and of course we talked and so i know that milton was unhappy with burns they signed you directly yes but uh what happened between the two directly i i don't know you know how he broke with him i heard about that he broke him you know but i think i think that it was because of wage and price controls right right right i mean this is ana sema in chicago you know that and and for for milton probably in particular so no surprise there right what is surprising is that um that burns um and did was not more decisively against inflation you know against the threat of inflation that is somewhat surprising because i think he was but i i think it's probably the might have been the attention to business cycle situation you know but precisely the background in business cycles that have caused that you know inflation was important as a threat and so on but business cycle recession was an even bigger uh right problem i think that that might explain it good insight and i think that it's an important issue to resolve why arthur let inflation go which was his downfall he's down for right right and i saw last ascerbance on a national airport in washington by chance and he was already ambassador to germany and we talked right and we talked briefly and so on but nothing can report nothing particularly interesting i met him i think only once and i think it was in the 80s and i and i was i was on a panel in a conference and he came very late because he was a very important person and he came into the room sat down next to me he had missed all the presentations and then had to get up and and give a summary and he looked at me he said um tell me what has happened and he leaned over and i gave him uh some coaching commentary on it he thanked me he stood up he went to the podium he said some remarkably fine words he sat down and what do we find uh i i think that he summarized he brought history to bear on it i dimly recall that i sat back and thought how did he make so much sense of what i said no he wasn't but i think he was a bridesmaid but he was also what i find interesting and people have said this to me anna said this to me she said anna said the men hated him they despised him the women loved him yeah and i remember thinking to myself at the time way back in the 80s what a charming individual and anna essentially said uh-huh the women were charmed by him but the men despised him he had a i met her only once and moore lived in an watergate actually yeah both were had apartments in the water and moore was the commissioner of bls i was in washington on some business and and burns came over and we had a good evening we ate and so on um and he had a charming wife charming wife thanks and i know i felt and so i didn't know them you have well but they were all charmed right here they all laughed more and all everyone and he indeed he was not not necessarily liked very much you know he didn't he may not have cared you know he was he was overbearing he was difficult but i have only you know as it happens it's all chance you know i never had any any friction with him quite a contrary you know i was i was surprised and very pleased when he asked me because i know that it meant something for him you know after all he was asked to do it and he said he has written too much too much about the man which i understand you know about me and he asked me so i was very pleased and and of course he read it and he approved of it and i didn't know what would happen if he did you know maybe he would show his his bedside then but i never i never knew his website directly but i know about it because as i say ruse complained bitterly about him yes i think a lot of people complain bitterly about him and it was also perhaps the comparison mitchell was wonderful to everybody yeah to say here today and he was a deeply humane kind gentle loving every good word you see now i knew several people at the bureau who who looked to me to be like that definitely more mo was very kind very very a very good man a very good man he may have had you know intellectually may not have been the same caliber but uh and some people thought uh shout so and even gave him to understand that for example south africa did and i was sort of taken aback by that but uh and that was my impression that that is what i what i know about the man you know he was a very very kind and uh and friendly and humane men more was you know imagine that gideon rosenbluth is still in new york city right no no he is he was in vancouver canada he's teaching there right right i saw him fairly recently on on some occasion i'm meeting somewhere you know no no he he get back back yeah he is he might and then you should i i tell you what um i'll make it a point um and i will try to uncover and uh and look up the annual reports okay or maybe can you do it i don't know whether where i have them if i did it i could tell you a good deal more i would remember what the names i could tell you what who to contact let's do the following let's end this i'll pack it up and then as we do that we'll talk a bit more but are there any uh you've said so much and uh and um i don't know if there's any final comment that you want to make to this tape if there's anything that we left out as i said before i like i liked very much the the bureau as it was and maybe that colors my my uh reminiscence but um that's how it is i i felt at home at the beer and almost from the beginning that's why i came back that's why i was actually somewhat reluctant to leave but of course i left because it was it was a thing to do and for in in almost every respect financially too and we were not very well paid to bureau you know and that was one one thing but the fact that people generally i believe felt well and stayed with the bureau despite that you know and despite other things like for example there was probably on the part certainly of burns and so on i wasn't involved in that but it probably existed this sense of hierarchy a sense of of i'm here and you are here and so on but other than that and i worked with more who didn't have that and i i felt that there is remarkably little of it you know and that the atmosphere is good and people like to work and work very very hard and of course you know it was also the sense that you work with with um with people who who do their best and their best is really very good right people like like friedman kuznetsov are still and so on they had they are they were giants and they are still in a sense you know in what they are doing and so i like that obviously i felt it and and it was the good thing about it and that is in a sense and i regret it very much lost in the present bureau soon fault of no one you know it's not you know it's simply the size in the evolution of the bureau and the decentralization and so on is there still probably very very good people excellent people working on on their stuff but they are not then they're not together and that makes a difference you know you must come and visit me there because they if there is a court group who are together okay some of us are on leave for the year we we're there we uh we talk together they may be very similar you know that's maybe very similar it's similar in some respects in the respect from one respect it isn't which is that we're each working on our own project they're not as integrated well that you know that i think needs to be corrected i mean it um there was integration in the sense that there were meetings in which we talked about our own project and the others from other projects intervened sometimes very actively they liked it or not and so on they were outspoken on that but other than otherwise it was it was a separation by projects very clearly you know so it was not so that and they didn't have the sense that they know all about the other projects you know that they already all knowing and so on now i mean there was a good deal of specialization in the sense but now it's i my impression is much more yet of that because there's a greater diversity and greater size hugeness diversity there's no question but but let me just end this this tape with um a proposal that victor's arnold would come and have um lunch with us at the bureau and join in the conversation okay it's even in cambridge in cambridge in cambridge thank you very much you should go to new york because we do go sometimes you know yeah right okay i'm gonna turn this off now
