thank you very much eric uh so this is obviously joint work with with richard rogerson let me just jump right in um so this figure is the the motivation for for our paper it shows the mean uh employment rate for men age 55 to 64 in a balanced panel of 14 oecd countries going back to 1976 and you see these dramatic changes so the uh the mean employment rate for men uh in this age group declined by more than 15 percentage points between 1976 and 1995 only to increase by almost as much uh between 1995 and 2019. and when you factor in that the employment rate uh for men in this age group had been declining for several decades already prior to 1976 this reversal is particularly striking the goal of our paper is to shed light on this dramatic shift to shine a light on this dramatic shift in in labor supply and to present a broad narrative to explain these these employment dynamics to gauge uh the extent to which the mean reflects the experience of the individual countries here uh we've plotted the time series uh of um male employment uh for the age group 55 to 64. in our in our 14 countries this is five-year moving averages and what you see is this uh tendency toward a u-shaped pattern in almost all of the countries but also a lot of heterogeneity in the magnitude of these these changes we argue that these this qualitative similarity across countries um speaks to common factors driving these dynamics but the quantitative differences across countries could prove helpful uh in guiding our search for for candidate factors so textbook explanations of this several decades long decline in the employment rate of older men typically stresses two two factors namely the expansion of social security uh and secular increases in incomes now it should be noted that these forces have operated alongside with secular trends that likely serve to increase employment among older individuals namely improvements in health and longevity and increases in educational attainment interestingly there's been no widespread trend reversal or trend break or there was no widespread transversal or trend break in the mid 90s in any of these forces granted there have been some changes to formal social security rules uh in some of the countries uh but that doesn't go very far toward toward understanding kind of just how widespread these patterns are or the magnitudes of these changes that i just showed you so all of this taken together um means that this trend reversal and employment rate of older older men is really viewed as a puzzle in the literature and in fact it has you know caused some researchers to look for potential new trend factors and one of those uh or one of the more prominent ones is rising female employment and i'll return to that uh in in just a minute but let me first talk about um our narrative so while we certainly don't um dispute the common wisdom that expansions to social security and increases in in incomes were the driving forces behind the decline in older men's employment throughout the 1900s we would argue uh that one shouldn't just assume that those continued to be the dominant forces in the 1970s and 1980s our narrative builds on the shocks and institutions literature which uh which um uses the which takes the builds on the um the uh uh sorry which takes the um uh the construction distresses the overall worsening of the uh of the labor mart kid outcomes uh in response to a common shock or series of shocks and then the of course the institutional heterogeneity which influenced how how those shocks were propagated differentially across across countries now additionally uh we stress the role of heterogeneous responses in institutions um specifically what we term shadow social security systems so what do we mean by shadow social security systems is programs that accommodated effective retirement prior to the normal retirement age and entry into into formal social security so to summarize um we argue that the dynamics that i showed in that that initial motivating figure are the sum of at least three processes namely uh a trend component reflecting kind of the standard secular forces that i i just mentioned um low frequency but mean reverting negative shocks to labor market opportunities that affected all age groups but particularly older individuals and uh a temporary shock to institutional features uh in a subset of countries that amplified the um the common shock um particularly for the the men aged 55 to 64. so going back i uh to this these potential new trend factors which i alluded to and namely the the role of rising female employment the the narrative there is that you know going back to to say the 1960s women entered the labor market in increasing numbers and with differential career expectations um and if you take the the cohort that turned 20 in 1960 um they turned 55 and in 1995 and so it's around that time that men aged 55 to 64 were increasingly likely to be married uh to a woman who who worked who engaged in market work to the extent that the higher employment rate of women in the mid 90s um can be attributed to factors that took place several decades before um this plausibly could be viewed as exogenous from the perspective of events in in the mid 90s take that together with the assumption that the leisure times of spouses are compliments or the non-market work times of spouses or compliments then rising employment among older women has the potential to explain the the trend reversal in older men's employment so as a first step here what we plot is the mean employment to population rate show for men and women aged 55 to 64 in our uh in our panel of 14 countries and what you see is that this trend over a trend break occurs at roughly the essentially the same time for for both men and women so the first pass this seems to support uh this this narrative however we would argue that a closer look at the data cast out on the role of leisure complementarities or rising female employment as the dominant force behind the rise in older men's employment if leisure complementarities were the driving force you would expect single men and married men to look very different in the data however we show that the timing and the magnitude of the trend reversal was effectively the same for for married men married and cohabiting men as it was for for single men additionally we use uh lag the lagged employment rate for women aged 45 to 54 to control for for cohort effects and show that the increase in um women's employment in the age group 55 to 64 started at least 10 years or so later than than one would would expect so let me show you that evidence um so here what we have is a plot of the um the employment rates from nh55 to 64 for for men married men or cohabiting men uh and and single men single men respectively in a subset of of six countries and what you see here is that all six panels uh tell the same story namely although there are certainly level differences in the employment rates of married and single men the timing and magnitude of the trend reversals are are very similar um for for married and and single men so while uh we don't cl what so while leisure complementarities can certainly play some role um we are in light of this it seems unlikely that they're the they're the dominant force we view this uh in itself as rather persuasive evidence uh but let me also show you a second second piece of evidence so here what we have is we use the growth in the employment rates of women aged 45 to 54 between years t minus 10 and t minus um one to proxy for the exogenous component of the growth in the employment rate for women uh age 55 to 64 between years t and t plus nine and so what this figure shows you is that the employment rate of older women women aged 55 to 64 was depressed relative to trend in the period leading up to the mid 90s so our analysis suggests that um the female employment dynamics are part of the the larger puzzle rather than the solution that's that's been proposed in the previous literature let me let me now show you evidence in support of our narrative which we term shocks and institutions 2.0 so the the first fact that we establish is that the trend change uh in mean male employment in the mid 90s was not limited to the age group 55 to 64 although it was most pronounced for that age group so the left graph zooms in as an illustration zooms in on the age group 35 to 44 and there you see this this decline in in male employment through the mid 90s followed by a modest recovery that's ultimately disrupted by by the great recession the hand graph shows you the employment the evolution of the employment rate for men for for the different age groups and what you see is this is a common pattern across all age groups with the exception of the 15 to 24 year olds where we see more of a leveling off rather than a recovery in the mid 90s the second fact that we establish is that countries with the largest decline in the employment rate of prime aged men prior to the mid 90s also experienced the largest decline in the employment rate of older men so computing the correlation coefficient between the declines in the employment rates of men aged 35 to 44 and 55 to 64 between 1976 and 1995 we get a correlation coefficient of just under 0.7 so these first two facts taken together suggests that at least part of the decline in the employment rate of older males between 1970 and and the mid-90s should be interpreted as a response to negative accurate shocks to the overall labor market so the third fact that we establish is that countries with the largest decline in employment for older men prior to the mid 90s also experienced the largest subsequent increase so we compute the the correlation between the decline and the increase on either side of the minimum and get a correlation coefficient of just under 0.5 so if the increase in the mid 90s or following the mid 90s was due to the appearance of a new trend factor there's little reason to expect um that that that that new factor the changes associated with that new factor would be correlated with changes associated to the factors that operated earlier rather we take this as evidence highlighting the role of institutional responses to the overall worsening of the labor market conditions and that's what i'll talk about about next so at this point you might be wondering if what our narrative is just a minor extension of the shocks and institutions narrative with a particular focus on on older individuals um and it's certainly reasonable to to posit that that age group would be more affected by it by a common shock so while that that narrative gets one quite far we argue that something extra is needed and in particular that heterogeneity in institutional changes that directly affected older individuals would help account for the heterogeneous patterns that we see across across countries so to that end this figure shows you the employment rates from men aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 respectively in two samples two sub samples where the first sub sample includes australia canada ireland japan norway and the us and the second sample finland france germany italy and sweden and for now let's just note that this partition is based on the extent of institutional changes leading up to the mid 90s so there's there's many things that we could talk about in relation to the figure but let me point out the a key key observation um so looking at um the employment dynamics for the 45 to 54 year olds you'll see that the changes are are very similar across the the two two samples but looking at the employment rates of 55 to 64 year olds we see much more dramatic changes for the countries in in sample two relative to sample one now if it were the case that um these countries in sample sample two uh implemented temporary uh reforms that uh in response to to the common shock that amplified um the effects for for the for the older individuals only to scale those back uh following the mid 90s that would would account for for the pattern shown here and what we argue in the paper is that that's exactly what happened and we provide provide evidence and support of that for for a set of set of countries so much previous research on older individuals has focused on permanent features of social security we argue that the most relevant policy changes in this context are temporary changes to what we call shadow social security systems or what in fact created so-called shadow social security systems facilitating retirement for individuals uh prior effective retirement prior to the official retirement age johanna two minutes two minutes thank you perfect um so there's myriad and diverse differences across countries in these institutional changes uh we document uh relevant relevant features for for a subset of countries particularly european countries in the paper here let me simply give a few examples of the type of policies that were implemented in the 70s and 80s and then later scaled back starting in in the 90s so examples include for example allowing older workers to receive unemployment benefits for longer duration creating a bridge to the official retirement age granting disability benefits for for labor market reasons rather than just health reasons uh granting laid off workers early social security if firms replaced an individual with with a younger worker and note that in some instances these policies uh these policy changes were really uh a change in how a policy was was interpreted rather than you know any statu change to statutory policy so we've focused on the age group 55 to 64. uh and of course we showed some evidence for for younger age groups because we thought that that found that that informative to compare but you could of course ask what about older individuals so take for example 65 to 69 year olds they're in fact impacted by formal rather than shadow social security systems so one would expect that in countries with modest reforms to shadow social security the employment rates for men aged 55 to 64 and men age 65 to 69 would largely be driven by by common factors and thus you would expect uh the uh changes in employment rates for these two age groups to be highly correlated conversely in countries with sizable reforms such as social security you would expect those reforms to have a big impact on the eight on on the age group 55 to 64. and thus you would expect the changes for these two age groups uh to exhibit a much lower correlation and that's indeed what what we find uh providing further further support of our narrative so let me let me conclude uh by saying that we we offer a new narrative for understanding the changes in male employment rates um over time we argue that much of the decline between the the 1970s and the mid 90s is a result of a negative shock to aggregate labor markets and temporary policy measures that amplified uh the effects of that that common shock for for older men and thus much of the increase post-mid-90s really reflects or aversion to the mean rather than than a new trend now our approach is purposely one of a broad brush strokes nature and as thus really just constitutes the first step in understanding these these patterns uh much much interesting work work remains uh certainly interesting to delve deeper into the country level micro data and the institutional uh differences in details there uh certainly many interesting policy questions remain like the study of the welfare implications of of changing employment patterns for for older men thank you thank you very much our first discussion uh is nier jamaric thanks eric let me share my screen and hopefully we are live are we good great thanks thanks uh for inviting me to discuss this really interesting paper i learned a lot uh from it and uh something i'm going to say will repeat or perhaps share the my own thoughts about what diana was presenting and some would compliment let me just give you a little bit of the way i think the context and importance of the paper and everything is an important paper um you know facing aging populations almost always city countries implemented reforms to the public pension systems in recent years and actually if you look a little bit uh the details about half of this reform target work incentives among other workers i think really understanding and diving into how such reforms affect the labor market is crucial and i agree with johanna's kind of last comment i think this paper is really the first step in an exciting new research agenda so thank you for the opportunity to discuss this um there are two parts and let me just go quickly about what the authors do in the paper in terms of data the authors show rather convincingly the employment rate of older men 55 to 64. displays a u-shaped pattern over the last four decades and what is really interesting that this pattern is surprisingly common across many advanced economies hinting that there is a common explanation that could be responsible at the same time more nuance the reverse of magnitude across countries varies so the authors basically have a three-part hypothesis i call it institutions one there were some provisions that favored early retirement in many countries in the 70s and the 80s then there is a mean reverting aggregate shock and i think the new part as johanna was emphasizing towards the end of the talk what i call institutions too there are variations in reform institutional changes that led to an amplified recovery in a subset of countries so what i'm going to try and do uh in my two-part discussion i'm going to dive into the u.s experience okay and i agree with authors i think really the the big narrative is looking across countries but by diving into the u.s experience i'll be able to look at some covariates and perhaps when you look at so many countries you kind of don't have that ability johanna mentioned at the end let's look at some micro data that's exactly what i'm going to do we didn't coordinate that comment but i i'm happy you and i mentioned that and i think again i will emphasize i agree this is the footnote 10 for from the paper i don't agree with the offers looking at the u.s per se is not the most interesting thing but by having this ability to dive in a little bit we can see some of the key covariate and actually i think that the message that i will hopefully try to convince you about really reinforces the message of the authors and then you know being a student of larry martin sergio again today i need to think with some models some it's a way to organize my thought and i will put a little model in quotation marks uh that at least for me was useful to understand what are the key forces that shape the employment demand dynamics and kind of also use that model to see how it relates to the offered hypothesis and with some heroic assumptions i'll try to do some numbers at the end of the day okay so let me just dive into the data and what i'm going to do is uh use the micro cps monthly data and basically cut and slice the used data along five different dimensions gender is it really only about men and johanna touched about the issue of gender age is it really 55 to 64. occupation what's actually happening where are these people going back to work and the role of education okay and again i want to emphasize the goal of the us data analysis is to identify the key converts that are driving things and i think it's informative hopefully you'll agree with me about the role of the institution uh story okay so this is kind of what johanna was trying to do for all countries i will show you just for the us five age groups men and female together and you can see the 55 to 64 reversal here at the bottom uh figure great let me just normal i think so it's more visible to the naked eye i'm going to do everything around 94 which is like a turning point in the us and again you see this red line this is the 55 55 to 64. visibly different in terms of employment okay as we all know during the basically four decades towards the end of the 20th century there is an increase in labor force participation of fema's side remark i'm going to go back and forth between labor force participation employment rate unemployment is not like the most important thing here the authors also i think back and forth go back and forth with that so let's copy that the previous figure was obviously mixing genders that's separate okay here is male 55 64. again 55 to 64 men are visibly different than the other age groups actually pointing that the same patterns are visible in the u.s let's talk about females female again 55 to 64. while all other age groups in females are converged by basically the year 2000 to their what looks like a new study state of first participation besides this age group the 50 faculty keep on growing okay so in the u.s you will see that 5564 male and female are behaving distinct differentially than other age groups okay let me just dig a little bit into the f-55a group and i think it's useful to break it a bit further apart because of this perhaps we could call it the naive hypothesis if the dynamics are driven by an aggregate shock then i would expect a relatively continuous response across adjacent age groups i think this has come for me was a useful way to discriminate between the story about shocks versus institutions now interesting stuff is going to happen it's actually not about the 55 to 59 it's about the 60 to 64. okay so here's the same u.s men i will show you in a second for female and a bit of you can see here the reverse size for the 6064. okay 50 50 55 55 like you know flat is a pancake and here as you can see lady add actually support eight groups here is the 55 to 59 not visibly distinct from other younger age groups the 6064 is the one that's driving and here i added a bit older age group 65 69 70 74. okay so look at men the 55 again this is about the us this is just a way to organize digging in a little bit more in the us when you look at men it's actually the 60 and above that are driving the result we saw before that 55 to 64 females were behaving like men what about when you do this further age cutting actually the same story even within the 55 to 64 females is the 60 to 64 females and again i'm adding also the 65 and above famous just to see that okay so something on the age structure is a bit more perhaps tilting you towards alderaan group for me that brings us more the role of institutions or the importance uh we should pay attention to that and i think that really corroborates the the story the authors are after okay so all these guys are coming back to work they have to work somewhere let me just show you something about where they're going to work and how this is related to their education background so what i'm going to do i divided the 6064 i'm just going to zoom in on the 6064 male and female and i divided it whether they're not during the labor force that's what you see in the top left panel not in the labor force and then whether or not they're in routine occupations middle school occupation the auto drone kind of characterization non-routine manual so in the left tail of the weight distribution and non-routine cognitive hopefully all of us in this session belong to the normative cognitive okay and what you say is again what you see in the top left panel is the reduction denoting the labor force increasing the employment rate exactly in this sphere that we're talking about and what you see that this is by the time basically that the reversal begins the routine occupations are kind of well that's it we converge all the action is coming in this longitude cognitive in the right tail of the weight distribution okay similar story comes for females it's really about a ratio about four to one five to one between cognitive and non-routine manual so all these entrants and this is not exactly entrance it's not the same people different chords but you know abusing the the notion of water entrance there is a ratio that are entering four mainly into non-routine cognitive i put the caveat there are known issues to everyone who works with these occupation data about creating time series of occupation because of redesign etc but i feel pretty comfortable that those i think are the messages is there that it's mainly a story about nothing cognitive okay so it looks like a 60 plus no routine cognitive no gender specific type of show okay but now when you think about nothing cognitive what is the role of education that's the first thing that will jump to you i'm going to look at two things of education i'm going to look at propensity so what is the employment rate within education age groups okay and then i'm going to see about the share of education which i think johanna also mentioned towards the end of her discussion this is age groups again the same age was before and i broke it by education it's going to be a lesson high school that with the l group and high school and some college with m and h which is going to be college and above and what you see for men again is the 60 to 64 from a very specific education group it's the higher education group okay again i'm emphasizing this might not hold to other countries but i think even when we think about the us this is telling us something about what are the forces what are the groups that are exhibiting this reversal so all what we were seeing before about 664 is men for the men it's 1664 who work in high education again this is where we see this usher okay for females it's a bit more the data is a bit noisier we see it again the 64 the ones that are driving it and you see that it's in the middle education group and in the high education group okay so the first point for 5a the propensity effect for men it's about a high education men 50 60 64 that started to increase their uh and employment propensity in the interest of time i'm not going to show you there's also composition effect in that age group there is over time more and more highly educated uh within the age group of men which because highly educated men tend to work more than the lower educated that's also pushing the employment rate so there's both a composition effect and a propensity effect again interest of time i'm not going to show you that okay so i think the first thing we see we see this reversal in employment in the us we see it not only in mail it's in both centers it's not the 55 to 64. it's the 60 plus it's not across the board it's mainly not in cognitive and at least for men the education both two channels of the education seem to play a crucial role anyway i want to update i think the value of the use data is suggesting keep for viral that would be useful that are responsible for the reversal it would be useful to look at the context of other countries okay and to me this seems to be the importance of institutions uh seems to be emerging from this data analysis okay what about the mean reversal shock you do see something in the u.s this is log wages for male normalized by the turning point by age group and there is something interesting that we see kind of in the mid 90s exactly when the reverse unemployment occurs there is this rise in in wages they don't look distinct across age groups okay they seem to be rather similar different cuts again will give you the same story okay so again to the naked eye or to the native hypothesis this seems to be something about institutional versus shock because we don't see any uh distinct behavior and we don't see the other age groups behaving in a similar way to the 6064. okay i'm going to skip this there is a large literature in my literature that i was happy to learn in the last few years i enjoyed basically showing social security reforms three major one changes to full retirement age delayed retirement credit and earning test elimination that people argue as always is the case that can extend between 20 and 100 percent of the reversal but the narrative is there about the role of institution okay let me skip that what i want to do in the my remaining eight minutes i really wanted to think about what our institution changes because that's kind of the i think the new fact that the paper is pushing about and i want to understand what are changes in institutions okay and i think one of the things that hopefully i will try to convince is we really have to care about elasticities which is going to be how these the changes matter to employment rate and how they depend on the context okay as i mentioned i try to make some heroic assumptions to get some numbers so i try to write the following model hopefully capturing the the spirit of the the exercise it's whether or not to work for one more period or retire okay so there is a value of working for one more period and i'm going to think that we have different abilities uh that's going to be the epsilon drawn versus distribution so in the same time that i write one paper richard wright the richard and jana write 10 jps okay so they have high epsilon i have a low epsilon our wager is an efficiency efficiency wage and we're all facing some labor tax rate and there is some work in this utility i'm going to put it like that to avoid wealth effect just to make the analysis cleaner and then after that i retire so it's a one period short game and if i retire i get some benefits could or could not be indexed to the wage are we sure that this matters a lot actually there will be some benefit tax rate again i retire as you already see this would lead to some type of cut off participation ruling ability okay so we will have something that defines this epsilon star people above epsilon star work people below accident star don't work this implies that given that epsilon is coming from some distribution the employment rate is just one minus the cdf and deployment okay cool so this is how the model works we have on the y-axis the employment rate one minus the cdf and here's an example this is not a coincidence that i'm looking at this this would be the numerical case with the target one of the groups i was talking about before that has an employment rate of about 76 percent but what you see is that this would be the cutoff and then we will have all employment rates about 76 what is the cutoff i did two two models here benefit index to wage ability some countries actually have benefits that are indexed to the ability to the last weight and some countries actually have benefits are constant okay so here's two cases like that and the way i interpreted the story about institutions is the following thing there are a bunch of things in this model there are three institutional things benefit that would decrease benefit taxes could increase or weight on taxes could decrease all of these things are going to change epsilon star in this case will make it lower and employment rate would go up okay so those are that's the way it is i was thinking about the paper in terms of what are changes in institutions but this is just part of the story obviously because we're interested in the employment change this hat this log deviations and it's not just about epsilon hat it's not just about this change the horizontal change is also how that is going to be translated to e-hub so here are two cases i took basically two cdfs two uh different abilities okay and what you see for the same trend in excel for the same institutional change we're going to have actually very different mapping naturally to the employment rate in this case because the pdf is flatter we're going to have a smaller change in employment in this case because it's steeper we're going to have a higher change okay so separating the institutional change from how we transmit to e to e hat i think we need to understand the object how those elasticities vary across countries and how actually they are institution dependent don't get scared this is just you know my favorite activity love linearizing but i think it tells us well within economics my favorite activity um this is telling us something about how to think about about the changes how they map okay so it's not just about the hats it's not just about the institution the variables you know that are changing it's also how they transmit and as we can see the elasticity itself is institutionally dependent this is for example the net pension replacement rate that's an institutional detail okay epsilon star the cut off the petrol the ability distribution but also obviously on the institution that determines whether or not you are retiring okay so one thing the message is i think this idea of changes versus transmission we need to to think about how to clarify that and authors are obviously very aware of that who am i to teach them at this point but you know i think just in terms of when we try to think about how a certain change matters to employment we have to think about these channels this way okay so then i try to put some numbers bear with me you know it's heroic assumptions but what i wanted to show that this little model actually enables us to gauge some of these skills and policy elasticities now for many countries let's go back to that there are no elasticities about these different reforms i really enjoyed the case of finland learned a lot about finland from the paper but you know how many cc reforms are out there this model tells you actually you don't need that if you know we're willing to go a little bit with economic theory we can recover those so for many countries there are no elasticity estimated different reforms but for many countries it's quite common to actually estimate elasticity with respect to the wage and what we can do is we can use this little model to recover then the elasticity to the policy reform i think it's valuable what we're doing here and i'm sure the authors will come with much better models than this little one to to gauge the effect so let me just show you how we do that first let me think i'm going to think about let me first make a quick point there's this respect to the wage that i interpret that is the aggregate shock even that is institution dependent you can see here that in a model where the benefits are indexed to wage and ability you're going to have another factor floating around versus the world that the benefits are constant and certainly there is variation in the type of institutions across countries so that's the first person to go with the first near two minutes perfect perfect 20 minutes thanks eric great so let me just put some numbers there are three things let me go with the first case there is something about net pension replacement rate this is this is the benefit to the wage after tax there is something about the ability distribution and there's something on the deployment rate if i can get all of those i can actually go ahead and run with the assistance for reforms here's net pension replacement rate with four countries i've been affiliated with i live in switzerland i was before 20 years in the us i was born in israel and my parents are from argentina so you just go to the oecd 2018 but that's the key number from what the model was telling us i'm not going to bother you how to estimate the ability distribution it's you use the idea that richard and ian are three times more productive than me so how the wages should be reflecting that and then basically from some observed truncated distribution of the wedge you can recover parameters about that okay good we recover the ability distribution and i'm going to tell this model i want you to match the elasticity of employment respect to wages i took two countries okay i took a male 55 to 64 education above high school for the year 2012 these are the two years that's the group where i had israel in the u.s kind of numbers so i went with that and here uh i'm basically all the numbers i need i have the npr the net pension replacement i have the employment rate of that group i have the standard deviation of wages that again allows me to recover the ability and i have the elasticity of a perspective waitress interestingly the fantastic paper by support and co-authors they found in israel there cease to be point 43 that's exactly the maximum value in chetty's paper so let's go with 0.43 for both countries and then voila i got what is the standard division of ability i got what is the mean ability i got was the excellent star and now i can just plug the things and get the system of different reforms i have what is the elasticity for benefit reforms in the us versus israel i love what elasticity respect to different taxes et cetera et cetera okay so this is just a way now to get we don't have to go and start estimating everything every kind of 10 seconds i'll be uh wrapping up okay so this is just a way through the model to emphasize how these elasticities matter it's not just about the epsilon hat okay so i think the us data was suggesting the value of zooming in covariate whose employment is reversing and i think it's really consistent with the important role of institution i think this model is highlighting what exactly are institutions okay i think that's where we need to dig in the next step about changes versus elasticity and the model was giving us a way to consider other reform by basically plug and play by matching uh elasticity with respect to the wage and i really look forward to work that i think quantifies the role of situation i think that's the next step and hopefully the authors agree with me that's my reading of their conclusion in their point reversal and i think really it's an import first order importance uh research dropping given the demographic transition that we're facing thank you i was engrossed and i forgot i had to do work thank you very much and our next discussion is is mark bill i enjoyed the opportunity to read and think about the paper i enjoyed near's discussion uh so um richard and joanna highlight this these striking trends i already talked about that and they discuss possible explanations especially this complementarity of leisure uh negative shocks and the rise and fall of distortionary transfers i was rooting for the complementary of leisure it was a very romantic story i thought of these couples you know coordinating their their leisure uh i wasn't surprised they didn't quite find it it doesn't mean there's not complementarity because there's a strong wealth effect with the spouses working more that the uh that the men had retired sort of like the um you know the added worker effects you used to hear about then they have a discussion of negative shocks and then the rise and fall of the distortionary transfers i think for the negative shocks this is uh i would i would just highlight that it's not obvious that these negative shocks would have reduced employment uh there's wealth and substitution effects and i don't i don't think necessarily people in the 70s and 80s view these as temporary shocks um it would be interesting to see what happened to the consumption of these older households not just their their wage rates now there's one view of that the shocks are of course temporary for the older workers because they're going to retire but that doesn't really hold for aggregate shocks unless you uh don't have a bequest motive so there's sort of a recording equivalence that still holds that there'll still be a wealth effect for older workers and then they discuss this rise and fall of the distortionary transfers so all very interesting i i don't have uh any uh unforced errors in the paper i feel i need to discuss i'm going to go the very similar route to uh near i'm going to focus my discussion on one country i picked germany fortunately i didn't pick the us i picked germany because to take advantage of the psoap this uh the long panel which is a very nice panel data that goes back to 84. it's it's large for the early years it's only west germany but i think everything i'm going to say is going to be uh robust to to excluding east germany throughout the nice features of this data is i can look backwards at work history of these older individuals including retrospective questions on whether they're employed at 30 40 or 50. they're going to be able to sort of go pretty directly at this sort of cohort effect issues and it also has rich data on not just the employment hours and earnings but also the transfers and then the household assets although that's only after 2002. okay so before i jump into what i'm going to discuss i just want to highlight that the patterns are pretty striking for germany uh so these are the employment population rates just similar what uh what what johanna showed for the for the broader set of samples um and you can see the the fall is a little less pronounced for the the men but the rise is actually sharper and to me i think the the most puzzling or the most interesting thing is the rise rather than the fall that holds true pretty similarly for annual hours not just employment and then um as they were serving blind it's much stronger for uh for older individuals so for men you can see this this rise in annual hours um by these different age groups the other age groups are actually having a decline uh while theirs is rising for for women all the groups are rising but for the older women you get this convergence where they're clearly catching up okay so what what i want to do with my discussion is i want to first uh ask you know if this possibly reflects cohort factors and both toronto and they're sorry talked about this i'm going to mariners just you know excellent discussion uh various points but there you know potentially you have strong cohort effects you have your trends in life expectancy schooling occupations uh you know in germany the experience growing up for the early part of the sample i'm going to show 80. you're growing up in the 30s versus 50s or 70s arguably growing up in germany in the 30s could look quite different than in the 70s and then also allows me to control for this past work history and then after that i'm just going to turn to talking about substitutional wealth effects the patterns and wages and wage growth patterns and assets and a little bit about changing policies in tech in transfers okay so some possible cohort factors one would be like rising like life expectancy i'm not going to spend any more time on that it it increases throughout in germany but at a slower rate after 2000 and so i don't think uh i don't think that's a natural channel rising schooling attainments school entertainment's a powerful force for uh working more when you're old if you take uh you know the simplest thought of schooling is we have more schooling in a particular generation uh you get higher earnings but you start later in uh there shouldn't principal be an envelope condition where there's no wealth effect of that extra schooling so i think it would be very easy to calibrate a model where an extra year schooling translates it maybe even to more than one more year of working late in life and you can see the attainments grew very rapidly and they actually started growing particularly rapidly when the employment rates started turning around again remember these are the these are the attainments for the 55 to 60 four-year-olds so it's just a slice of this group at each time period if that's not clear i'll i'll state it again but that's this is the trend for that particular group um now having said that you see you really still see again near found something different for the us but you see these trends for both schooling groups here we just break it into greater than 12 years in less than or equal to 12 years and you can see there's a rise for the uh these again all the older workers these are the men 55 to 64 year old you see a strong rise for both groups neither group rises quite as much as the is the green line which is what was for overall because it does have this compositional effect but it's not much driven by compositional effects you see strong rises for both groups and the same holds true for women uh there's many more of these population are in the 12 years or less so it's it's going to largely mimic um the the group for them largely mimics this but the the ones with more education increase also so it's not just a compositional effect i don't think okay so um we talked about four factors i think it appears that the core factors do not explain much of the phenomena that's consistent uh which what the authors said so in particular there's a v-shape uh in this employment is is relative to an individual's earlier life cycle employment in particular relative to employment status at age 50. so i could have controlled for fixed effects so i did something very similar but simpler similar but simpler which is controlled for employment status at age 50. but first i'll just show these figures these are for the men 55 to 64. so we know they have this v shape in their employment but if you look at their employment rates at 30 or when they were 40 or when they were 50 um those those aren't increasing so it's not like these it's in fact later in years where the employment's increasing at the older ages those were the cohorts that actually showed sort of declines in employment um earlier here somewhat similar for women and then finally this is the one i want to show is this this breaks down again this is the this is a figure for before this is an employment population rate for all men um um at 55 to 64. but now i'm giving separate lines based on employment status at 50 to 54. so there's a group here that weren't employed at 50 to 54. there is fairly small group and their employment doesn't rise over time that is their employment at 55 to 64 stays kind of zero condition on that they didn't work from 50 to 54. whereas if i focus only on those who work 50 to 54 then you get this very clear v-shape okay what you're saying when you you know when you control for this sort of history of work you actually get a much more striking v-shape that's particularly true for women so if i again i have two lines now one for women who weren't employed 50 to 54 and another one for those who were and here again is the total so this takes out this is a compositional effect of these two groups and you can see that if i only focus on the women who weren't actually employed in 50 to 54 you see a very very striking fall from like 0.8 down to 0.4 and then back up to 0.8 so this reinforces their message that it's not a cohort effect for germany okay so then i want to uh talk a little bit about substitutional wealth effects um i don't have consumption data ideally i'd look at consumption um you know wages relative to the consumption that would be like the natural thing i think to look at but i'm going to look at uh some evidence on wages and on on assets so if i look at the median uh i'm using the median real wage it ages 50 to 54. so i'm using uh the wages at 50 to 54 just to try to limit a selection effect that over time as the employment rates are falling going up you might get a selection of the type of workers and you see these in hourly wages and euros and 20 20 18 euros and there is you know some increase in the real wage it's not enormous greater for women also you don't see that the wages are growing more rapidly later in the career that's that's one thing that would tend to drive up the labor supply for the older men is that you know whatever their history of wages you see sort of an acceleration in their wage growth or you know a better wage growth later in life didn't really see that in the german data in terms of assets you do see a pretty clear decline in median assets again i'm taking the assets at 50 to 54 so they're not influenced by the employment decision in 55 to 64. and you can see particularly excuse me particularly during the great recession there's this decline but there is this secular decline in median household assets not in mean household assets because there's a upper tail that tended to have their assets grow pretty rapidly but there is this drop in assets and there's definitely a drop in median assets held at 50 to 54 relative to the median earnings you know 50 to 54. um and these are not trivial drops um so this is a drop of about um 50 for the women and pretty much 50 for the men if i just judge the assets relative to uh earnings now in the literature i mean it's very clear i mean one thing we know there's a clear wealth effect on labor supply and so there should be a clear negative effect of assets on labor supply or a positive effect of a decline in assets um that's that's different uh that's difficult to highlight in the data because of the heterogeneity households that tend to save more uh also tend to work more one of the reasons they work more is because they want to save more but i will just mention that um natalia emperson is working on a project uh with this data related to retirements and i'll just highlight you so aside things she found is when you instrument for assets uh centers paribus but but instrument with whether you grew up in east germany or grew up in west germany as an instrument for having fewer assets the individuals who grew up in east germany have fewer assets you do see a clear wealth effect of those assets on the on retirement decision she's looking at retirement decisions um now i'm gonna turn to how much time do i have eric four and a half minutes five minutes we'll cover so i'm gonna finish by talking about the unemployment benefits um and particularly the pensions so you can see there's this clear decline in and uh um and this doesn't go back as far so this is started in 95 so you should view all this with respect to the period when the when the employment rates for the older workers are growing so you can see that the mean of the unemployment benefits are declining particularly for for men now of course that also is going to reflect know for whatever reason the men are working more you're going to see a decline in these benefits if i look at the median unemployment benefits condition on receiving them that doesn't show um so much of a trend now if i look at the mean of the old age and disability pensions there you get this really nice you know um reverse you which is sort of the inverse of the employment rates that uh joanna and richard were were highlighting particularly for men uh and if you look at the median you do see this is the meaning of old age and disability pensions conditional and receiving and you do see a pretty significant decline and then the last i'll say here on this is if i look at the the mean pension for um whether you're employed or are not employed you also see uh it's actually a fairly significant decline this is um the differential i'm going to focus on just one line for women you don't really see this but for men you see you know up here a 15 um 1500 euro a month higher pension if you look at just the men who aren't working versus working and that declines over time and that's going to reflect these reforms including reforms that allow you to sort of keep working maybe and still collect functions which all work in the direction of encouraging employment if i look at employment populations separating older men by age you see that both the um all the groups rise all of them show this pattern um this is for men but particularly those 60 to 62 and those 63 uh to 64. now the reason i highlight that is there's just like a there's a reform to the system like every six months i think in germany but a couple of big ones was a reform in 1997 and a reform that occurred in 2000 it's usually called a 2001 reform and it came in step wise so the 97 one uh raised the retirement age for insured uh pensions so not disability and so it would be natural to see a rise in employment then for those um 63 to 64 starting in 97. i think you could argue you see something like that this this change in the disability retirement age from 60 to 63 that's kicking in starting in 2000 or 2001 you should see its change here for this group and in fact you do see a pretty significant change for the the group 60 uh 60 to 62 even relative to the other groups starting with that reform in in 2000 and again it wasn't a one-time reform it was stepped up so you would expect this sort of trend pattern mark two minutes two minutes now okay i'm going to sum up then i had 20 more slides but since i have two minutes okay so we see rising employment for older men the last 25 years that departs from history possible causes um i think it's pretty clear from their work uh what near showed and what other papers in the literature have shown that these policy changes apparently did matter labor supply does matter for employment um i i highlight that even though we're not meeting in cambridge this year but the labor supply does matter for employment and i also think this wealth relative to the potential earnings probably mattered also at least for germany then the last thing i'll mention this echoes what nero is saying i think probably there are other important factors that mattered um and one of them is going to be this changing nature of the work versus non-work for older individuals so i don't have as good of a figure by this uh uh road work versus less road work but you do see what this turnover is a period where um the white collar employment for men is holds for the women not quite as strongly starts taking off and so back here in 95 you have um you know only a little over nearly three times as many in the blue collar jobs to the white collar jobs whereas here you know we've switched it and there's a clear majority in the uh white collar jobs so that's going to change the nature of work it's just you know the whole distinction between leisure and working market non-market work is a lot less striking for for certain jobs than others and then also it's going to change it even even beyond what the the individual's labor supply decision when you have an aggregate change in this and you're encouraging older workers to work and the work is becoming that way the whole the whole employer employee relationship is going to change uh what sort of asked of workers at different ages is going to change they're going to become more flexible to have you know workers stay along longer uh be less productive in their older ages even though they stay around longer and then the whole wage grow and the conference compensation scheme has plenty of flexibility for these sort of sort of long-term changes to just you know rework how the compensation scheme works over the life cycle i would argue especially for the salary and white-collar type jobs so i'm done thanks again
