i i usually start talking to my undergraduates in the history of thought by having them look at the first sentences of the wealth of nations because adam smith talks about aggregate consumption is what's going to be the topic of the wealth of nations and per capita consumption uh and uh the point there is that measuring national income is an old activity it wasn't invented by uh simon kuznets there are estimates from the 17th century the 18th century i didn't put this in the paper but two of the early estimates in the u.s which were very well done bob goldman praised them they're based on the census data whereby george tucker a southerner and ezra seaman and northerner they weren't concerned very much about welfare what they were concerned about was the relative strength of the free states and the uh and the slave states and i'll sort of come back to that when we get to simon kuznets and world war ii what actually caused the uh spark the formation of the bureau was as jim pointed out uh the rise in inequality in the in the progressive era uh the uh laborer is saying that these robber barons are creating great inequality of income there are people on the other side saying we can't be sure about that there's a lot of innovation going on uh in 1915 two books are published uh and i think there's a very strong parallel with the piketty one was by scott nearing and the other by wilford king niring was a socialist uh who looked at the ratio of property income to labor income and thought it was uh way too high too much property income wilford king who will become part of the bureau in the early days wrote a book that we would recognize the methodology today he calculated real wages of different classes of workers he plotted lorenz curves in fact he was one of the first users of the lorenz curve his was a colleague lorenz was a colleague at uh wisconsin uh what he'd found is that between the turn of the century and 1910 and a little bit later wages of the lowest skilled workers had fallen he blamed that on immigration basically and said a lot of things about immigration that wouldn't be very popular today and he also uh found a rising inequality of income and wealth which he uh blamed on the robber barons this is uh king on uh what's causing the inequality of income it's these uh monster corporations that's what's uh that's what's doing it uh just i just included this figures picati's uh figure of course been criticized a lot richard such criticized some of the early estimates but you can see that the inequality reaches a peak in 1910 which is exactly the year that king is is talking about so here are the two founders of the nbr that jim mentioned malcolm rorty a business economist and stone a uh socialist i couldn't find a picture that i was sure was named stone so this is his first book a translation of an early book by karl marx rorty i'd say was very impressed because stone wrote a review of nearing's book and complained about it said niring was not putting in all the sources of labor income that he should have he was estimating too high a ratio and that persuaded rorty that this was somebody that he could really work with in 1917 they form the committee on the distribution of income with prominent economists and some business people on it that's really the first name of the bureau the committee on the distribution of income uh after it was formed they changed the name of the bureau to what we know today the national bureau because some of the people on the committee wanted the bureau to do business cycle research there'd been financial panic in 1907 another one in 1914 when world war one broke out uh unemployment had spiked after those financial panics and there was a lot of concern about it the war intervenes that in 1920 the bureau is incorporated there's money from private donors and later on from the carnegie corporation this is uh mitchell the first director of the nbr he'd written an important book on the business cycle and used a lot of data in that so he was a natural choice as director but the first study is uh as jim mentioned on the uh uh income in the united states it's amount in distribution all right it's by uh mitchell and king who's now been brought into the bureau uh and mcauley enough it is a big book bit bigger than anything that a nearing or a uh even a king could do just in their uh at their desk in their in their study right you needed a team to do that the uh estimating national income from the you know the two sides of the circular flow was one of the things they were proud of it was widely praised all the the reviews that i've read suggest that everybody thought this was a milestone and it's updated then at the end of the 30s by king and epstein's william epstein this is uh simon kuznets kuznets comes to the united states but i i have to have to tell you i gave a paper about some of this in tokyo and i pointed out that kuznets was my intellectual grandfather was from pinkst belarus and that my biological grandfather was also from pinkst and uh it didn't seem to interest the audience there in the slightest and and i guess doesn't interest you either yeah so now comes the uh the great depression uh uh senator lafollette wanted uh the government to turn out estimates of national income to show how uh bad things were and uh quiznets is seconded to the uh commerce department to lead a team to create the first estimates right this is somebody who you probably may not know robert nathan he was a student of kuznets he is brought in as part of the team at the commerce department and then after kuznets leaves and comes back to the bureau nathan takes over the bureau at the commerce department and updates the evidence on national income and writes the reports for the survey of current business roosevelt immediately recognizes the importance of these national income estimates this is uh just a quick a couple of comments from one of his campaign speeches in 1936 and he's pointing out i wish i could put in more of it he's pointing out how national income had fallen uh under hoover and now because of his policies national income is rising and he just grasped immediately the national income is a quick summary of the state of the economy and important as a political variable after world war ii starts we have another crisis kuznets goes then to the war production board nathan his protege has become chair of the planning committee of the war production board which was supposed to maximize production he appoints kuznets as the chief statistician of his commission and they become very concerned that the army and navy are just issuing too many uh contracts that consumption will be reduced too far that there'll be congestion in various product markets and that production will actually be slowed down it's just not feasible to issue as many contracts as the army navy want and there's a compromise roosevelt agrees to reduce the amount of money that the army navy munitions board can can spend you know it's hard to know exactly what would have happened if they had been allowed to spend as much as they wanted but mike edelstein who's a very distinguished economic historian thinks that the kuznets and nathan intervention was important and jim lacey was a military historian wrote a book which is immediately convincing when you read the title how u.s economists won world war ii uh one of the things i wanted to mention is that kuznetsov in all of his writing even going back to that original commerce department report uh stressed that national income was not a good measure of national welfare and he always thought about all the various ways that national income could be or gnp or whatever could be modified to make it a better measure of welfare some of the problems of course are home production that was noted in the first nbr study they noted that production in the home was not being measured and they made estimates of how much that might be and kuznets talked about the distribution of income this is one quote from him where he's talking about how the prices that we're using are influenced by the distribution of income and we've got to think of some way of adjusting for that um one of the the main uh sort of philosophical issues that that worried kuznets was whether we should count military spending uh as a part of gnp right and so now we're kind of circling back to tucker and seaman kuznets kind of finally agreed that in world war ii where the safety of the nation was at issue we should count military spending as part of national income but in peace time he thought it should not be in there it's just an intermediate good leading up to the production of goods and services for the consumer and but this was an issue where he basically failed and the estimates of the commerce department the ones we use today all include government spending military spending as part of the national income and i have kind of a discussion in the paper about why uh he lost that uh debate part of it of course is the cold war uh suddenly it seemed like military power was going to be important all the time not just in an all-out war i did a little bit of work in the paper comparing some of the early nbr estimates with the ones that we use today maybe i think i guess i tried to put a little bit too much maybe in this one figure here but you can see that the if you look at the national income and product accounts today the 1920s and 30s 1930s look pretty much the same as they did for kuznets and the bureau in world war ii the estimates diverge a little bit this estimate here is by friedman and schwartz these are i should say net national product estimates which kuznets always preferred to work with the friedman estimates are a little bit lower because he's adjusting for what he thinks is evasion of price controls during world war ii uh and then as you can see in the uh post-war period the modern chain linked gdp estimates diverge because you're constantly updating the price base but in the early years the the early national product estimates stand up i think as well as they did um so just to kind of recap a little bit i think it's rising inequality the problem of inequality that led to the formation of the bureau the solution was a non-partisan agency first the committee on the distribution of income and the nbr and uh i i think they did a good job mitchell king and epstein and that's the end of my my story i think they did a good job [Applause]
