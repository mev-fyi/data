so this is thanks for having us for the program this is trying to work with lucas ishito is not with us today and varun who is in the audience okay so this paper is about corporate bonds and this is a sizable market accounts for roughly 10 trillion u.s dollars outstanding as of 2021. so the corporate department is therefore uh you know again one of the major sources of funding financing for u.s corporations and at the same time a major asset class for investors to invest in there's no shortage as a result guess not surprising of quantitative corporate bond pricing models there's three classes and one commonality across all these classes of quantitative pricing models is that they're either implicitly or explicitly based on a representative investor okay and so very natural starting point for this paper and also a natural question to ask is who is this representative investing corporate farm markets what i plot you here is a graph of the share of corporate funds held by investor type and you see that the most dominant investor are insurance companies that's the blue solid line which which sort of held a share of roughly 45 towards the beginning of the sample uh that then declined a bit but uh we rebounded to roughly 40 towards the end of the sample um pension and retirement funds that's the black dash slide on the on the in contrast saw a steady decline in the shared hold uh in the shared health of corporate bonds from roughly 35 percent to all the way down to roughly 15 on the flip side we see mutual funds they have seen a steady increase in in in holdings from close to nursing all the way to almost 20 percent okay and the good old representative household that's the gray solid line accounts for roughly maybe only you might say 10 towards the end of this sample okay so you know like given that households are relatively small corporate bond markets are dominated by institutional investors all right and um you know like in this paper we try to take this serious and we estimate in the spirit of coin yogo 19 you know an investor specific demand-based equilibrium model for pricing corporate bonds to that end we compile a rich data set with institutional investors bond holdings and then we relate these holdings to bond characteristics in order to demand to estimate this demand functions we document and that's important that there are significant differences between demand functions across investor types and then once we have estimated these demand functions we can also evaluate counterfactual equilibrium prices that are induced by you know hypothetical movement in the interest rate you know changes in credit quality undoing of fed interventions and so on so forth the overarching result is that the composition of institutional demand is an important state variable for corporate bond pricing and i guess that sort of nicely uh relates back to science uh keynote speak speech yesterday where he said you know like maybe the future brings a change in the investor composition base in government debt and you know some of these investors are less elastic towards uh treasury yields than others and this can have pricing effects okay what are the data sources what is the sample we essentially assembly uh three main data sources and put them together so we have pricing data that comes from ultimately from trace we have holdings data from thomson reduced emacs database and then we have static cross-sectional characteristics bond specific characteristics that are from the fisd database okay our sample runs from 2006 all the way to the third quarter in 2020 so we have quarterly snapshots of these holdings and during our sample period you see a steady increase in the number of institutions uh from roughly 1300 all the way to 3500 that said the the market the coverage of our sample is roughly constant it hoovers around 50 all right so in order to sort of do equilibrium bond pricing we essentially need to equate uh demand and supply but this in the first step we write down characteristic based demand functions and we write the portfolio weight of an investor i in a bond n as a function of the yield right of this given bond and and the vector of characteristics that includes time to maturity liquidity size of a bond to the offering amount and ratings credit quality and ultimately latent demand as well okay so that is we have prices on the left hand side of this equation right uh implicitly in the fraction invested in a given bond and and on the right hand side through the presence of the yield so we need to solve this by introducing an instrument and i get back to that on the next slide before we get there in order to do pricing we also need the supply side and that is imposed by market clearing and so the market value m of a bond n must be equal to this wealth weighted sum of portfolio weight so so you have the sum that runs across all investors or institutions if you wish a of i so i is there a indicator for investor i and and then you have a which is acids under management that multiplies uh this fraction uh that is invested in a given bond bank okay so that's the market clearing condition so what about the instrument so here we will rely on investment mandates okay so the idea here is that institutions can only invest in bonds that belong to their investment universe a very concrete and simple example would be bond corporate bond index funds okay so if a bond doesn't belong to an index or it's not a constituent of an index this fund cannot really invest in this bond all right and we we sort of anecdotally find evidence we find empirical evidence that this might be a a good description of reality in this mile of of these investors in corporate markets right so that is 98 of the bonds that are on average that are currently held by an institution were also held at least once in the previous three years um so what does this imply for identifying assumption we essentially have that each institution's investment universe is exogenous okay so that is it is predetermined by an investment mandate right that is exhaustion to current demand shocks and that allows us to instrument yields with the so-called exogenous demand component okay so we have this indicator function uh subscript j that denotes the institution n bond n right it takes a value of one whenever a given bond belongs to investment universe officer investor j okay so this exogenous demand component is larger if a bond and belongs to more invest or to the investment universe of more investors point one point two is if this bond and belongs to the investment universe of larger in terms of assets under management investors okay and then a larger exogenous component of demand generates higher prices and hence lower yields okay now equipped with this instrument we can go on and estimate this demand function in the first step we take a panel regression approach where we include time fixed effects so we actually exploit cross-sectional variation across all things of these investors okay so the main takeaway from this pretty dense slide is that you know there's significant hydrogenating magnitudes and fines of estimated demand coefficients across institutions so focus on the first row so that's the coefficient of the instrumented yields for insurance companies you have zero coefficients if anything negative for life insurers right but uh you have very uh much more uh larger in absolute terms but also positive coefficients for mutual funds and other investors such as pension funds as well as foreign investors okay another example may be bid ask spread so liquidity of a bond again you know not much action for insurance companies if anything slightly positive in the case of life insurers but significantly negative coefficients across mutual funds pension funds and foreign investors okay we can you know trace out these differences across investors a bit more in detail by estimating uh quarter-specific regression in the cross-section for individual investors okay and um and this allows us to also sort of trace or or look at the time series variation of these estimated coefficients okay so here again we have the coefficient on instrumented fields and you can see that in blue mutual funds versus red dashed life insurers right that mutual funds have much higher and positive coefficients and these two lines rarely overlap and uh life insurers have maybe zero coefficients up to 2011 and then these coefficients become negative which is consistent or which implies upward sloping demand curves after 2011 for life insurance time to maturity elasticity so that's the partition time to maturity characteristic again uh you see that they look very different across life insurers and mutual funds if anything that means you know mutual funds tilt their portfolios towards shorter bonds and life insurers tilt their portfolios towards longer time to maturity bonds with respect to liquidity uh similar results so stock differences across the entire time series between these two uh investors and you can see that uh mutual funds one interpretation is that mutual funds they act as consumers of liquidity all right liquidity takers whereas life insurers they're actually act as liquidity providers they're quite inelastic with respect to big ass express okay in the next step we then uh think about counterfactual equilibrium simulation okay so in equilibrium bond prices are fully determined by bond supply it's a vector both uh letters are vectors bond characteristics and the valves or like you know the asset on the management distribution of all investors a and then the estimated uh demand coefficients okay and latest demand so more formally you can write this uh p the surprise vectors is equal to this function which depends on all these ingredients and now what we can do we can essentially and on the slide we have an example about this acids under management distribution we can counter actually change these ingredients and solve for the prices again okay iteratively and then look at the differences between those two price vectors or yield vectors for that matter okay so and that's exactly what we do in our first country factual we we essentially implement what's written here on this slide at the bottom of this slide that is we take away assets under management from of the largest mutual funds so that this we we force them to experience a 20 outflow in assets under management and we distribute this money proportionally to all remaining investors that we observe okay and here what i thought to hear is essentially the cross-sectional distribution over time of this changes in the credit spreads in basis points so that's the uh the vertical axis on the horizontal axis we have time and um you know these are these are bonds that are predominantly helped by mutual funds okay that's why we see a lot of action here and you know you see if you close your eyes a bit it looks like there's a bit of a downward trend in these effects okay that might be uh due to the rise of mutual funds okay over our sample period in terms of shares held in the corporate markets that is you know if we just shock these largest mutual funds there are more mutual funds remaining that stand ready to absorb this liquidity okay proportionally speaking that and they share very similar demand functions uh uh compared to the one shocked okay so that is there's not much of a price effect we can then uh explore these results a bit more in sort of the cross section so uh sorry for the small figures here um um so so we in the first uh figure on the top we sort of distinguish between high yield versus investment grade bonds and in the bottom figure we look at short bond short-term bond versus long-term bond and what we find is that the impact on short-term and high-yield bonds are larger in terms of credits by changes which is consistent with remaining investors predominantly insurance companies uh that are actually reluctant to hold short-term and risky bonds okay another um you know um sort of way to process this result is you can rather than distribute the assets and the management that you take away from large future funds to proportionate to all remaining investors you can say force mutual funds top left insurance companies top right and other investors on the bottom to absorb this this liquidity okay and and you can see differential effects um and so the largest effect is when you force insurance companies to absorb this liquidity perhaps because their demand functions are farthest away from or the most different compared to mutual funds okay in a second counterfactual we think about the interest rate liftoff okay and so we asked the question how would the equilibrium prices shift if short rates were to rise by 100 basis points and that's to some extent a bit of an indirect um count factor because it's a quote unquote out of sample that is we don't have a characteristic that is a a steady a ready function of of the interest rate itself so we have to uh relate this time series variation in coefficient of demand functions to the short grades okay and then essentially predict where these demand functions are going to go whenever interest rate change and the same what we do with assets on the management okay turns out so we have these two effects changes in demand function versus the change in asset under management that we could look at the composite effect okay turns out that all the actions comes from changes in demand functions the changes or the redistribution of asset under management doesn't have much bite so these are also changes in credit threats so these are basis points okay so almost no changes why because it turns out that this redistribution of this money is absorbed by inelastic life insurers then we think about the question of what would happen to corporate bond prices if the feds were to sell off all corporate bonds purchased under the secondary market corporate credit facility okay and um you know first panel you have counterfactual credit spreads uh that's just the level and then the more important one is the changes in credit spread that's the second panel below and you can see essentially the answer is not much right not much happens why is that even though the announcement of this sm ccf had huge effects or recitable effects in terms of magnitudes on corporate bond yields the undoing of it seems not to do you want to have a very sizable effect the answer lies in the quantities it turns out that the fed ended up buying very few bonds through the in the context of this corporate facility in the secondary market okay only four billion which compares to 10 000 billions as the overall size of the market okay all right let me conclude we find significant hydrogenating and demand elasticities across the main players in corporate markets our end our results emphasize the relevance of this composition of institutional demand as an important state variable okay for corporate bond pricing and we predict substantial disruption in corporate fund pricing depending who provides liquidity right and one context was this impending interest rate change that we might see in the not too distant future and so in equilibrium such disruptions are not only reflected in prices but also in the real economy eventually through the channel of firms financing decisions and that's what we think an interesting avenue for potential future research thank you very much
