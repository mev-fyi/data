okay so this is uh data from the cps on annual hours worked of men between the ages of 21 in in 55 and i want to just make five quick comments on this picture first usually the peak of other business cycles men are working about just under 2 000 hours per year okay you see that in 80. you see that in 90. you see that in 2000 second as of today or 2017 we're about 200 or just a little under 200 hours below where we were in 2000 for these prime age men and all of the decline is on the extensive margin so the employment rate for for these men is about four and a half percentage points lower in 2017 than it was in in in 2000 so even though the unemployment rate has returned to kind of pre-recession levels the employment rate or the employment to population ratio for these prime age men is well below where we were prior to the start of the recession and where we were as of 2000 four the declines were much bigger for less educated men i'm not going to show you in the picture but in the paper so hours worked for men with a high school degree or less or about 220 hours below where they were in 2000 in five the patterns are broadly similar during the 2000 for less educated women so for the first decade over decade change women with less than a bachelor's degree actually reduced both their employment rates and hours worked so in a lot of my recent papers many of you seen at different times i've been trying to put some structure on what could explain the decline in work this a persistent and large decline in work and prime age for prime age workers basically over the last 20-year period we know there's a recession in between but even now into the recovery we're still where well below where we were so in this paper we're going to examine the link between uh what i'm gonna call the transformation of the manufacturing sector and how that relates to declining employment and and the paper has kind of five parts and i'll talk a little bit in my comments a little bit more extensively of some relative to others but we're gonna just the beginning part of the paper just documenting a lot of facts about what has happened in the manufacturing sector over the last over the last 20 years or so we're then going to exploit some regional variation to potentially assess how local effects of manufacturing affect local labor market outcomes we're then going to talk a little bit broader of not just labor market outcomes but also broader measures of well-being and we'll show a little bit how these local manufacturing uh changes in in local areas has also uh is associated with larger increases in in things like opioid use and opioid deaths we're then going to compare and contrast the variation within manufacturing that is potentially due to trade to things that could be other sources like technology and then the last part and i think this is the the the kind of important part of the paper but it's also the most speculative is why now we've gone through transformations in the sectoral transformations in the economy many times in the past and in manufacturing in particular we've had some changes in pure prior periods why is it showing up so persistently in declining employment rates now okay so you might ask why manufacturing i'm just going to say is it just another labor demand shock that we might be picking up and i'm going to say yes it is there's potentially nothing overly particularly interesting about manufacturing except manufacturing is large basically in 1980 about 20 percent of all employment was in the manufacturing sector but it's particularly large for low-skilled workers and about a third of all men without a a bachelor's degree were working in manufacturing as of 1980 and it's also very spatially concentrated so when the shock to the sector hit it has large spillovers into the into the local community and as a result there's been large amounts of policy discussions in the past and even currently when we start thinking about trade policy and environmental policy the backdrop is in its heart to try to promote employment potential for through the manufacturing sector for for lower skilled workers okay so let me just show you a couple of pictures about manufacturing employment in the united states so this is basically going back to the early 70s this is our mid 70s from from the bls the statted lines are just decado points and between 1980 and 1990 we lost about 2 million manufacturing jobs in the united states okay lost another about 0.3 million jobs through through the 1990s about 2 million manufacturing jobs went away during the 80s and 90s so in the period you're saying manufacturing's been declining for long periods of time it has but between 2000 and 2010 we lost 6 million manufacturing jobs in the united states and there's barely a rebound post 2010. this is a massive change relative to historical standards in this sector the decline in employment is also associated with a large decline in manufacturing establishments so manufacturing established fell by 75 000 establishments from basically 2000 today after basically a century of kind of chugging along increasing establishments now despite the decline in manufacturing employment and establishments manufacturing output is slightly up during the 2000 to 2017 period so we're getting declining employment declining establishment slight increase in manufacturing output how is that possible the capital intensity of the manufacturing sector has increased dramatically relative to its past trend and relative to other sectors in the economy so what i'm showing you here is the labor share this is kind of similar in spirit to what uh lucas and brent have documented and more much more carefully than me just downloading some stuff from from the st louis fed uh but these are indexed at 100 in terms of just the labor share in the manufacturing sector in solid all other non-farm business in in blue and you can see this is just a dramatic collapse in the labor share in manufacturing during this period you simultaneously see a major increase in the capital intensity of the labor uh the manufacturing sector again relative to its past trend and relative to other sectors starting in 2000 so this is a measure of like the capital stock uh to to to the value of workers in in manufacturing so you see this big movement away from workers towards capital in in this sector at the same time the composition of workers are also shifting within manufacturing so i've already showed you manufacturing employment has fallen sharply but within manufacturing there is now much less production workers in manufacturing than there was at past periods of time okay and the last thing i want to show you are maybe two more things this is the share of different skill groups less than a high school degree or less some college a bachelor's degree or more from the cps who work in manufacturing for men 25 21 to 55 and you could see they've been declining in all groups okay it's been declining for less educated men for a while why you know manufacturing declined a little and that group has grown in just absolute numbers so you get declines in in shares and the key thing though is the decline it's basically now kind of converge to about you know a little less than you know 12 to 15 of each group again in these prime age men working in the manufacturing sector the manufacturing sector is kind of shifting towards a higher skill composition and so we could also show that explicitly by just asking what is the share of workers with a bachelor's degree working in manufacturing and how that's changed over time relative to other sectors and what you're going to see here is you know it used to be one out of five men in manufacturing had a bachelor's degree now it's like one out of four okay that's kind of increased relative to wholesale or retail trade or constructing construction traditionally other low-skilled sectors for men so you're seeing this compositional shift that manufacturing is becoming even it's smaller in scale for employment but conditional on that it's becoming more skilled so in the first part of the paper again it's just a documenting of these facts that manufacturing employment firms have plummeted people have kind of known that but the declines are very large relative to historical standards manufacturing is becoming both more physical and human capital intensive both relative to other sectors in relative to its trends in the past so in the second part of the paper we then try to get a sense of is the relationship between declining manufacturing that we've seen during this period and local labor labor market outcomes that we started the paper with how much can the decline in manufacturing potentially contribute to declining employment rates and to do this we start by trying to put exploit some some regional variation and then we'll ask later how do we use this regional variation to to learn about aggregate trends but for now what i'm going to show you and i'm going to defer to a region as a commuting zone so think about that as like a slightly bigger than a set of counties or cities around there's about 700 of them or so in the united states and i'm going to look at different periods most everything i'm going to show you to start is the 2000s but also in the paper we also kind of do seem things during the 80s to compare and contrast the different different effects and at the heart of our local labor market kind of variation is of something like this it's a picture this is scatter plot just data okay and what it shows is that the decline in the employment rate within a commuting zone which is going to be on the vertical axis was not uniform across space in the united states during the 2000 to 2016 period there was a large variation across space and that large variation is strongly correlated with the share of employment that was in manufacturing and how that changed over time so places that had big declines in their manufacturing share also had big declines in their employment rate again there's no causal interpretation of this but in your mind a lot of the things that i'm going to try to shed light on a little bit more causally in the next few slides has this picture underlying it which is just in the data places like the industrial midwest is collapsing in their employment rate particularly for less educated workers relative to other places in in the us during this time period so in the paper we run some regressions like many have done before and probably will do after of of changes in manufacturing share at the local level on some local labor market conditions in the ols the simple scatter prod that you see you might be worried if you're trying to make a causal interpretation because of potential confounding factors so what if people in detroit just got lazy okay and as they got lazy they stopped working and it happened to be in manufacturing that was their sector and then they stopped working you potentially could see a correlation between manufacturing declines and employment rates that could be large that have nothing to do with the causal effect of manufacturing declining likewise suppose another sector booms okay maybe you know coal boom somewhere and that draws people out of manufacturing and brings people into the labor force and that you can see a negative relationship between manufacturing uh changes in employment so you might be worried that the manufacturing declines were a function of some other things that could affect labor markets so what we do is we use like a shift share a strategy [Music] that you know many people have done for for periods of time which basically with the identifying assumption is that the industry mix within a region okay is set at some pre period there are national trends in that industry outside of that region and you're going to interact your share with these national trends to kind of get a sense of a prediction of how much manufacturing should change in your place the identifying assumption there is a lot of these national trends would be due to things that are orthogonal to local labor market conditions in that area aside from its effect through manufacturing so competition from trade and automation would be two things that would be good for national variation to try to identify these local strategies now we do all this stuff in the paper about this instrumenting strategy the ols results in the iv results are nearly identical with each other because the variation in detroit wasn't because people got lazier or wasn't because um you know there was a cold boom in detroit it was some of these you know national trends uh potentially from trade and automation this just shows you that our first stage is extremely predictive of our actual change in manufacturing and our predictive change in manufacturing are highly correlated uh with each with with each other now doing that we come up with stuff that says like a five percentage point decline in the manufacturing share and in your mind think about that as a one standard deviation type of variation across regions during this period is associated with a reduction in annual hours of prime age men and women by just under three percent okay and it reduces the employment rate of again both men and women by about two percentage points or one and a half percentage point two percentage points for men maybe one and a half percentage points for for women during this time period so these are kind of effects on the local level of manufacturing changes on local employment so places that get hit harder or initially had bigger manufacturing shares did have bigger declines in employment rate just like those pictures um the simple scatter shot plots that i showed you showed you earlier now how do you oh and the facts are much larger for for low-skilled workers than high-skilled workers almost zero for high-skilled workers so this is really hitting the low-skilled part of the population so how do you take these local estimates and kind of say something about the aggregate and the answer i've said in many other papers is you can't without much more structure so many of you seen in this room before my work with martine barrera uh talking about how we take local estimates to to national thing you need a lot of structure because general equilibrium forces could make them go up and that's kind of the stuff david otter and jerome do by putting in input output matrices and the guy in detroit stops going on vacation to orlando and that has fill overs on orlando as well or it could go the other way national policy could go in the other direction to kind of mitigate these things just as a back of an envelope type of estimate we say ignoring those you get about half of the point decline in aggregate employment could be due to kind of manufacturing knowing that there's a large standard error around that depending upon how what you believe about the general equilibrium effects we just think it's instructive to kind of put it on the table as a large story that we should be exploring more as we go to the aggregate i'm not going to talk about this more we'll probably talk about it afterwards we also do a lot of stuff using this local variation on things like opioid use and opioid deaths in the paper and we show declining manufacturing is associated with more opioid use and more opiate death and it's going to say a couple more things in our last period of time how much of this is due to trade versus other things so for those of you familiar with the order door and hanson type paper they exploit variation across industries about exposure to trade from china and they get pictures like this which is places that are most exploded to trade relative to least exposed to trade had bigger declines in employment across the 2000 to 2016 period all sectors declined so first thing i want to make a point is even the ones that weren't exposed to trade also had large declines in employment during this period and they seem to increase and this is just basically the slope of this line is the order door and hansen type of regression second thing i want to say is the places that were exposed to trade were also the ones that had the biggest declines in the labor share so the places that had big trade increases that's not the labor share actually it's the capital labor ratio they had the biggest declines in labor to capital during this time period so there's a correlation between potential automation forces and exposure to trade so in the paper what we do is we basically just kind of take our instrument run it on the otterdorn hanson instrument residualize our instrument to the variation in the china shock and ask does the labor market effects differ whether you're exposed to trade or anything else that isn't trade and the key takeaway is it doesn't our labor market affects it doesn't matter if you're we load everything on trade we don't matter if we load everything on automation it's just something about the decline in manufacturing that that is that is important okay the last part of the paper i mentioned earlier on is i think probably the more important part but it's also the most speculative is you know why is the decline in manufacturing having these persistent effects on labor markets um decades or so after the shock occurred again a lot of these shocks occurred 10 years ago and yet we're still having these these large effects and we've gone through psychology sexual changes in the past from agriculture to manufacturing manufacturing also had modest declines in the 2000 in the 1980s why didn't that show up in changing employment rates in the paper we actually verify things that others have done um that we didn't find any effect of manufacturing decline in labor market outcomes during the 80s so what is going on now and we started trying to explore different mediating forces such as sectoral switching or inner region mobility and skill upgrading and public and private transfers and we kind of show some results like public and private transfers if you believe that is a first order thing quantitatively it can't be that big because most of these people who aren't working or have are in households that aren't receiving a lot of public and private transfers or public transfers the private answers i can't measure as well we talk in that mobility like the documenting like others have in the past that mobility inner region mobility in response to these shocks seems to be much less now than in the past is that a cause or is that a symptom i don't know but it seems to be a feature of the data and then we also show kind of some evidence that you know the skill myth there is just it's a broad skill shock that is hitting this group and all skills are relatively low in demand for low skilled and maybe that makes it a little bit harder to uh to adjust so okay so putting it all together you know i kind of summarized i'm not going to summarize all everything that i just said but i think one of the things that we kind of come to the conclusion as we are going through the paper is that policies to promote the manufacturing sector some of which were being discussed in real time today might have a positive effect on manufacturing output but might at best have only a modest effect on the employment rates of low-skilled workers because manufacturing even if it does come back in response to tariffs or trade wars or such just isn't produced with low-skilled workers with the same intensity for which those which they left
