this is a paper in which we investigate whether fiscal policy during covid uh was effective both at the micro level in helping small and medium enterprises to stay afloat during the pandemic and also at a more macro level and whether it helped sustain economic activity and what kind of spillovers it generated across countries now just to start with i'm going to illustrate the differences in scale in fiscal policy it was across countries during the pandemic this this figure here shows you on the left for a group of advanced economies the size of the fiscal spending and foreign revenues in 2020 as a share of gdp and it averages about 16 of gdp across all these advanced economies so clearly uh as the pandemic occurred in the first quarter of 2020 um governments everywhere sort of jumped in and put in place a variety of programs uh with the idea that uh much support was needed to keep the economy afloat now the same thing happened in emerging economies as you can see on the right side of the of the screen here we have a sample of a number of emerging market economies but on a much smaller scale in part due to limits to the fiscal space that a number of these countries have so on average the fiscal support in emerging market economies was around five percent of gdp now what we ask in in this paper is first we focus on small and medium enterprise and whereas did the fiscal policy programs that were put in place did they provide enough liquidity support to struggling smes and in doing so help reduce uh business failures then we're going to shift our focus to the more macro side and ask whether the fiscal programs more generally not just foods for smes whether those help support aggregate activity more broadly and then finally we're going to ask whether uh the speedovers across country spillovers from fiscal policy were important in other words whether the large fiscal programs we saw in advanced economies whether these programs helped also lift the tide and pop up economic activity in emerging markets now our main message after we do all this is that fiscal policy was in fact very effective in getting into all of the cracks of the economy but it was mostly effective domestically and therefore uh it requires a lot of fiscal space and so the preview a little bit one of the main results we're going to obtain is emerging market economies did not get much support from large fiscal programs in in advanced countries okay so let me start with the first part of our research agenda on this we start with a a model of individual firms operating in different sectors and and embedded in in a rich input output structure with an extensive margins we take into account business failures etc and we in that framework will represent kovite 19 as a combination of country and time varying supply demand aggregate and sectoral shocks and let me let me explain a little bit what i mean by that kovid 19 is of course a very complex shock that hit most economies in the world on the supply side we can think of kobe 19 as a shock that prevents firm from keeping all their workforce workforce employment a number of workers had to be sent home during during lockdowns they were only able to operate with with reduced scale and so we're going to capture this and we're going to measure this using data on the feasibility of remote work uh that we obtained for for the us from the net database and we're going to cross this with measures of this strictness or the intensity of the lockdown policy across different countries now on the demand shock kobe 19 also had large effects it reallocated the expenditures across different sectors of the economy you wouldn't go to restaurants maybe you would order more groceries online things like that and so we are going to also measure this from data on uh how reliant sectors and businesses are on face-to-face interactions at a finely disaggregated sectoral level and we're going to interact that with an intensity index that comes from google mobility that tells us whether people are actually traveling a lot or going to uh places of business outside their own home uh of course there's also an aggregate side to cover 19 as the pandemic hits a lot of people may decide to cut down spending there's a uncertainty component to it and and so that's also something that we're going to we're going to fit in now with all this input into the model we're able to calculate which firms are going to survive based on the liquidity criterion whether they're able to meet their financial expenses with their available cash flow and the cash balances now when we do all this we are going to calculate a failure rate in a situation without fiscal support and then we're going to turn on fiscal support and we turn on fiscal support calibrated to what we've observed in many countries in terms of uh fiscal policies or fiscal programs of the form of in the form of tax waivers cash grants or pending loans now in the case of the panamic loans what's important to realize is that this is not necessarily a cost to the government the expectations that make many maybe most of these loans will be repaid as businesses exhib the the pandemic and the lockdown but they are disbursed through the banking system with a government guarantee now this slide here illustrates the on the left side on measure of the sectoral supply shock so the reduction in uh the size of the labor force that you can still employ across different sectors at the one digit level you can see that sectors like accommodation and food so reduction in their workforce is about eighty to ninety percent at uh uh the sort of the highest point of the lockdown if you want uh while other sectors didn't see any reduction in orange here on this figure you see the essential sectors there was there was no reduction in in in labor supply in essential sectors on the right what you see are the sector specific demand shocks due to the reallocation of demand that we can we can measure and again here you see very large relocation of demand in sectors like entertainment and recreation or other services and some increase in relative demand in in the essential sectors began in orange now when we put all this into into our model we calculate that the failure rate of small and medium enterprise would have increased substantially during kovid in the absence of government intervention so the number that is important here on the slide is this nine percent here that's the that means that there would have been nine percent of small and medium enterprises would have failed in 2020 in the absence of government intervention to help small and medium enterprises now when we turn on the fiscal program and scale them to what we observe in the data we find that this number is still high about 4.3 but much smaller than the 9 overall and so our first result is that fiscal support did help reduce sma failure substantially now there is also an interesting result when we break down the data according to which the advanced versus emerging market economy so for instance we find that for advanced economies fiscal support was so strong that in fact it even reduced the failure rate below that of a normal year so the calculated failure rate in 2020 would in fact be about half a percent lower than in a normal year and that of course is due to the very sizable uh um scale of the support to smes about six percent of gdp uh in advanced economies by contrast for emerging market economies there's still a very sizable increase in in business failures so there is a large effect of fiscal programs there's also a television idea across countries now the second and third result is that this these programs were effective but they were relatively poorly targeted we can go back and look firm by firm at the firms that receive support and ask ourselves did they really need it and in fact we conclude that about 90 percent of the funds that were dispersed the 90 percent of the of of the support to smes went to firms that would have survived even without any support so in a sense governments just used existing pipes and dispersed money very very broadly probably because in you know in the midst of battle you you can't really do microsurgery you don't exactly know which ones are going to need it so you have you have to be very very proud um and remember a lot of this funding is coming through beneficial government subsidized loans so a lot of it could be also coming back as uh the economies emerge from from kobe tonight kobe another important result is that we find very little evidence of quote-unquote zombification of the economy if we ask ourselves have we propped up all these smes but then as soon as the economy is going to recover and we pull back on support are we going to face a wall of business failures and the answer according to our simulations is no we find a very modest increase in the failure rate about 2.6 percentage point overall as the economy normalizes but certainly not uh those nine percent of five percent have been preserved sort of coming down the pike and and just exiting omas so there's no evidence of that so to the first question we set out to answer which is that this will support provide enough liquidity to struggling firms our answer is yes despite poor targeting it did reduce sma failures and did so without at least as far as we can tell without creating a lot of zombies now we turn to the sort of the macro in the global site and we asked there um is there what was the effect of fiscal problems more generally in popping up economic activity and we do to do so we build a global dynamic heterogeneous agent general equilibrium model with nominal rigidity so there is a world for aggregate demand but also and importantly this is what you see illustrated inside a fairly rich and detailed global trade and production network to take into account all these linkages both between sectors this is what you see on the right side the of the slide but also across countries through trade networks this is what you see on the left side of the slide um and so what do we find when we do this well first there is an important distinction that we need to emphasize the distinction between supply and demand constrained sectors covet 19 is going to create a lot of supply bottlenecks there are a lot of sectors where workers are not able to produce there and we hear about this news all the time about supply chain bottlenecks these days in this sector's fiscal support is not going to be able to increase economic activity the only thing it might do is maybe increase prices but it's not going to boost economic activity very much but also demand constrained sectors sectors where demand exceeds the productive capacity at a given point in time maybe because that productive capacity has been curtailed and therefore in those in those sectors where you have demand constraints if you boost if you boost demand you might be able to overall improve activity in that sector and maybe more broadly in the economy overall and here our estimates are that about 31 of global gdp occurred in demand constrained sectors in other words there is room there is room for fiscal policy to improve matters about a third of gdp is taking place in sectors where there is insufficient demand if you want now when we calculate what is the effect of those large fiscal programs this uh 16 in advanced economies about six percent in emerging ones what is the effect on global output we can do this in our model by turning off this policy everywhere and then turning it back on and seeing the difference and we find that the increase in output linked to this fiscal problems is relatively modest it's about 0.7 percent of gdp this is a number in red here on this table now remember the fiscal impulse was large on average across all countries was about 11.3 so if you do just a simple division you come up with an incredibly tiny fiscal multiplier 0.06 for every dollar spent only about six cents uh improvement in aggregate activity you might conclude this is just this is just an extremely low number it's very very close to zero but we want to argue that this is somewhat misleading it's misleading in part because remember we started with coi19 creating lots of supply bottlenecks and in those sectors that are supply constraints fiscal support is not going to be able to increase activity what it's going to be able to do is going to be able to reallocate demand from supply constrained sectors to demand constrained sectors and we find substantial evidence that it does this where do we see this well if we look at what we call canadian unemployment which is a measure of the slack in the labor market in the sectors that face demand constraints we find that the skin asian unemployment is reduced from about 2.67 to about 1.4 thanks to fiscal support so it's reduced by almost you know one 1.3 not quite half by uh by fiscal policy so this is a situation where fiscal policy should not be expected to boost output after all workers were sent home they couldn't produce but it was able to prop up activity in sectors that phase demand deficiencies and close the closed day output gaps in these sectors the final result is to look at global speed overs so here the question was well if emerging market economies are not able to implement large fiscal programs can they rely on the large fiscal programs implemented in advanced economies to help them along and so to answer that question i'm we're going to run a little experiment we're going to turn off fiscal policy everywhere and then we're going to turn it back on but only in the us and that will allow us to look at the effect of fiscal policy in the u.s on the u.s itself of course but also of the effect of fiscal policy in the u.s on other countries that we have you know in our sample and this is the graph that you have on the left here you see every country is a bar and we see the change in output relative to the baseline of no fiscal council due to u.s fiscal policy only now not surprisingly u.s fiscal policy increases improves u.s output sorry improves thanks to uh u.s fiscal policy it proves modestly by about 1.5 amount of spending in the us was closer you know slightly above 20 so the multiplier is not huge there either but it it there's a significant effect but notice that for most other countries with many exceptions of very close trading partners like canada and mexico and of course that reflects the the sort of the trade and global production network for most other countries the effect is small and negative in other words speed overs if there are any as far as we can tell are relatively small and moreover they tend to be negative now when we unpack this result we find that what's driving this is in fact the fact that fiscal policy in a group of countries are in a single country tends to drive up interest rates globally and this increase in interest rates globally tends to hurt other economies in in the world now again there's a disconnect between output and employment here in the sense that even though fiscal policy in the us doesn't help output in other countries it does help reduce very modestly but it does help reduce canadian unemployment in that in this other country so our conclusion is that fiscal speed overs to output are small and negative spillovers to employment are small and positive now in the paper we run a little bit of a forward-looking scenario we ask ourselves okay well given all these results what can we anticipate if we have a two-speed recovery so if um advanced economies thanks to a successful vaccination program can emerge from kobe 19 while emerging market economies maybe are lagging behind because the vaccination program maybe has not been successful or they're lacking access to the vaccine and therefore the economy is still subject to sexual supply and demand shocks and what we find there is is that the two-speed recovery is actually uh something that could hurt emerging market economies for the same reason that the speed overs are small and negative in other words as advanced economies are uh booming ahead and we have projections like growth projections for 2021 and maybe 2022 that are very very strong for many economies what we can anticipate is a rebound in global interest rate and that rebounding global interest rate is sort of exerting a drag on emerging market economies are still subject to the kobe 19 chart and so in our simulation what we find is that emerging market economies could even experience a decline in output growth in 2021 and and in 2022 relative to uh 2020. so to conclude here the exercise was to sort of assess the extent to which fiscal policy was getting into all of the cracks and we conclude that it does mostly domestically sme fundamentals are quite strong especially in advanced economies thanks to the very generous generous fiscal support these countries received multipliers from fiscal policy are very small but this is to be expected these are transfer programs which typically have already no multipliers there are supply bottlenecks and in the paper we explain that io linkages also tend to reduce even further in these multipliers further the cross border speedovers are relatively small so countries are a little bit on their own they have to rely on their own physical space on their own vaccination programs if you want their own policy in order to in order to exit the kobe 19 pandemic and that's where i will end thank you
