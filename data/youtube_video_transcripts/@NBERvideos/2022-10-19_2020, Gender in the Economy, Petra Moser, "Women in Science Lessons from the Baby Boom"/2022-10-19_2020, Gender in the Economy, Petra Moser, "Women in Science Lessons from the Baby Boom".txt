today I will talk about research on women and science lessons from the baby boom this is Joint work with Scott King who is a first-year PhD student at Wharton women are severely underrepresented in science both at the college level and particularly at The Faculty level part of this might be driven by an unequal burden of parenting in 2018 for example the American time use survey found that mothers spend about 50 percent more time on kids and chores compared with fathers mothers even do more housework and child care if they earn more or when their husbands are unemployed we will look at the effects of parenting during the baby boom in a period of very many births between 1946 and 64. we will first look at whether there is gender inequality in science then we'll see whether some of that could be due and or how much of it could be due to a disparate impact of parenting we will use patents to investigate differences in productivity of scientists across the life cycle and we'll do an event study of marriage to see how patenting changes after scientists get married depending on whether they are a father or a mother and then we'll see how that leads to differences and promotions particularly do people get tenure track jobs and then do they get promoted to tenure and finally we'll look at selection and I will talk a little bit about this potential social costs and specifically you will be using data on entry into science let me tell you about the data that we're using we're using something that's called the American man of science now despite this name the American men of science actually included lots of women so I'll show you one and at that example I will explain to you what is in the data and what we how we use the data this is Gertrude Bell Elian we use her name to assign her gender Gertrude is a female name and we use that uh with the Social Security Administration data and we'll also use her full including the middle name to assign her with her patents then we'll have her age we know precisely when she's born and we know where she's born and we can use that to assign her to a cohort and this is really nice it's a very nice feature of the data data we not only know her discipline but we also know her research field so we know the topics that she's looking at and we use these data to assign every scientist to a research field so we can look at selection into science and we can also look at differences in the propensity to patent across fields the other nice feature is that we know when these people got the degrees and how they progressed to the uh through through their careers so that we can look at their promotions how long it took them to get somewhere and also what was their probability of getting to the next stage so our next example here is Helen Valles Tulin she got her Bachelor of Science uh in 1929 at the age of 17. she got married in 1930 and she had three kids then she got her PhD at age 34 17 years after her undergrad and she became an assistant professor seven years after the PhD because she tells us that she was an assistant professor we assigned her to be an academic scientist and when we're looking at promotions we're only looking at people who actually decided at some point to take an academic job another example here is Juliana Tesoro so I want to show you to sorrow because we know that when she got married and so we can put the marriage date here and then we met to sorrow with her patents and what you see here is that Tesoro after she got her PhD she got married basically immediately I then she was very unproductive for about uh 10 12 years and then became very productive afterwards and those are the patterns that we're going to look at in the data more broadly and systematically how do we assign scientists to names we use the U.S Social Security Administration data between 1880 and 2011 to assign something to be a female name and then we use patterns to measure productivity so the nice thing about patterns is that it's very very systematically available we can also pinpoint the time of the application for the patent which we use a proxy for the invention and then we have a very nice very clean nice matching process and another nice thing we can do here is that in some Fields people patent more than others I already told you that we can match scientists to Fields so we can control for differences in the propensity to patents across fields so now using this data let me show you some results on productivity so the first thing that you notice is that women patent a lot less compared with men and that is consistent with women maybe not being put on a patent but I think our Focus here is really on um parents and what happens what happens differentially to a parent to mothers and fathers so that's the next thing that we'll look at is where the mother's patent less compared with fathers and so here we see that if you're a woman you patent 5.8 less uh if you're a mother your patent minus 0.9 point less putting that together and dividing it by the pre-babybumin means that mothers on average patents 77 less compared with fathers and then interestingly if you do the same thing comparing mothers with other women so we're adding up the parent variable and the female parent variable here comparing that with the pre-baby Boomin what we see here is that mothers Ashley patent nine percent more than other women and that might be due to selection which is what we are looking at later so this is already one indicator that maybe only very very exceptional women survive when they have kids in science another interesting thing to look at here is that for women it seems like the first kid is really the big productivity killer whereas for men they become more productive with every kid and we can only speculate like why are men becoming more productive but say one reason might be that there's this specialization say the man goes out the man goes out and becomes a scientist focuses on their careers so then the the mother stays at home and with each kid there's more specialization there's more demand so Men actually have to work more then a really really nice thing that we can do with this data is that we can look at how productivity evolves over as people age so now we're comparing first Mothers with fathers and what you see is that fathers become more productive until their late 30s but then slowly decline after age 40 and become less productive mothers have a very different time Trend uh time pattern of of productivity they're much less productive in their 30s and early in their 20s and early 30s and they become more productive after age 35 and actually Peak much later compared with fathers you can also compare mothers with other women so here also you see that mothers and other women actually look fairly similar until about their late 30s then mother's patent more late in life so that is also stands out in this comparison as well as in the other comparison compared with fathers and then it's interesting that if you compare female and male scientists without children even though the levels are different the changes over time the changes across the life cycle actually look very different so they have very similar time patterns over the life cycle and productivity so now we're going to look at that more systematically in regressions that where the outcome variable is the patents by scientist I of demographic Group D at h a so we'll estimate separately regressions for mothers fathers women without kids and men without kids and we're controlling for year fixed effects for birth defects effects and for field fixed effects and we'll compare everyone with themselves so I'll compare a mother with other mothers at age 20 with themselves and other mothers at age 20. so again what you see here is that fathers become more productive until their late 30s than plateau and become less productive after age 40. fathers are always slightly more productive than other men mothers are less productive between the ages of of starting after the ages of 25 when actually I'll show you the scientists that tend to have kids and then mothers become slightly more productive uh in their late 30s so now we'll look at if an event study of marriage and so why are we doing this what we ideally we want to understand the impact of parenting on gender inequality in science ideally we would just assign kids randomly to scientists so we would randomly assign fertility we obviously can't do that so what we do instead is we will estimate an event study of marriage and we take uh we take advantage of the fact that marriage is a very discreet event so that any changes in your productivity uh marriage say you get married and you have your first kid and it generates a very sharp change in productivity with all the other things that influence your productivity across the life cycle are very much smoother so we then then this approach allows us to identify the effects of getting married by that comparison by the difference between the DraStic change and productivity as a result of marriage and those smooth more smooth changes in productivity across the life cycle and the other thing that allows us to do it allows us to trace out a long-run trajectory of productivity after marriage which is what we're really interested in so our event study here has us the outcome variable patents by scientists I in demographic Group D and year why after marriage we'll have again year fixed effects will have birth year fixed effects and we have field fixed effects and the comparison groups excluded group is the year just before the marriage so what you see here is that again fathers and other men become more productive after their marriage and women become less productive both women with and without kids but what is really interesting here is that the mothers actually recover 15 years after marriage so 15 years after marriage these two Trends diverge and the mothers become much more productive than the other women so now let me show you uh some data on differences in the rate and speed of promotions foreign so one thing that people have looked at a lot is how uh investments in education vary for women and men and so a woman might be less likely to invest in a PhD because if she has kids she's going to spend less time in the labor market so therefore the payoffs from investing in the phds are lower it may also be that if I expect not to get tenure anyway I may just drop out and not get my PhD that both of those factors would lead female scientists to be less likely to have a PhD it could also be if there is labored Market discrimination then I may either decide I have to signal that I am are very smart and I have to get a phds um or I actually have to be another way to think about this I have to be more qualified to get the same job and then female scientists are more likely to have PhD now so this paper is historical so let me also tell you that at that time there were still lots of formal and informal barriers for women to get a PhD and some of that may actually persist to today so for example like John steitz who's now known as the queen of RNA was turned down by professor at Harvard in the 1960s arguing that well you're a woman and you'll get married and you'll have kids so what good will a PhD have done she got her PhD anyway with somebody else which was a good thing so what in our data what we see is that women are actually more likely to have a PhD and that's consistent with women actually uh having to be better or women having to be more qualified to get the same job 84 of female academic scientists in our data had a PhD compared with 78 of male academic scientists now how this does how does this translate How does it go on in The Next Step there are lots of examples in our data and also when you read generally of women having to go off the tenure track because say they move with a spouse so this is one example as the leaderbread and so that would mean that women actually are likely to get these assistant professor jobs or they may actually be just they may take longer to get to them again this is what we see and we see it differentially for women 30 of mothers who are academic scientists become assistant professors compared with 45 of fathers and other women mothers also take a lot longer to get that first job so mothers on average take 4.4 years to get their first tenure attack job compared with 1.3 for fathers and 2.8 for other women now let's look at Kenya mothers who are academic scientists were 21 less likely Catania than fathers and 19 less likely compared with other women so what it looks like is that the the likelihood of the tenure penalty so the fact that women drop out at the 10-year stage seems to be predominantly driven by women who were who who were mothers foreign you see this very nicely in the timing data so in this graph we plot the years that it takes somebody to get from PhD to a system professor and what you see here is that mothers tend to drop off after five years and they just never recover so the Gap here really happens I I think this is because mothers tend to be productive later in life when their kids are older it's just too late for getting Tanya let's look a little bit at selection the few remaining minutes I have female scientists responded to this so they were less likely they were less than half is like to marry compared with men 40 of female scientists were married compared with 80 of men female scientists were also they married much later than the population this is compared with the population and now I'm going to compare and show you the same comparison relative to college educated women so you see our scientists here and our scientists married a lot later than college educated women in fact they actually married sometimes they married later than the men very few of them had children 22 percent of the female scientists had children compared with 74 of men and when you're looking at productivity there's really no evidence that mothers were less productive than other women foreign to research Fields so one thing that Claudia golden for example has has looked at all that is that whether whether women are more likely to select and to family friendly occupations and so we can look at that within science and within science historians of science have said like well one of the reasons why scientists science has so few women is because we were just not interested in these fields they were not interested in physics for example so in physics courses boys outnumbered girls three to one uh careless for example says in our data that's not true so actually he did not have I think systematic data uh so mothers actually are more likely of women's or women are more likely to go into physics and mathematical analysis compared with men so this is this figure here let me show you some data on Survival do they survive in science to do this we match faculty directories with the man of science in 1956 what we see here women were less likely to survive twelve percent of female academic scientists who were professors of Colombia in 1943 were still in academic science by 1956 compared with 20 of men so let me just show you something about the advocate effects on participation which I think is really important so what does this do actually to science overall this is the stock of scientists in 1956 and what you see here there is a missing mass of scientists who would have been of childbearing age during the baby boom women there's a mass of women there's a generation of women who were in their 20s in at the beginning of the baby boom in 1945 who are missing so participation by women declined by 16 uh in 1945. you can also look at this in terms of Entry so because we have employment data we can figure out when people entered science and what we see here is that 1945 saw a very large decline in entry by women and that decline was driven almost exclusively by or was driven primarily by women in childbearing age this is the last generation of mother of the baby boom let me just conclude really quickly so yes produce reduce the productivity of mothers but not fathers a lot of this is that mothers have a different time pattern of productivity than other scientists mothers become more productive after age 35 and they become more productive 15 years after marriage basically they come more productive when the kids are less work that has important implications for tenure mothers at 21 less likely to get tenure compared with five there's 19 less likely than other women so what we see here is that this is these 10-year 10-year penalties are actually driven almost entirely by women who have children there is no evidence that mothers were less productive than other women our female scientists any female scientists mothers and others married late and had fewer children mothers and other women were also less likely to survive in science and we see a dramatic decline in entry by women in their 20s in 1945. so what that suggests that yes there was a disparate impact and it had an enormous cost for American Science in terms of a last generation of female scientists among the mothers of the baby womb thank you very much and we would really appreciate your comments
