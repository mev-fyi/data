all right so this is John work as um thank you very much for putting us onto the program this is John Walker with Mary party and aishago um so inflation has recently searched um CPI inflation reached 8.9 in June 22. its highest reading since November 1981. um and this behavior of inflation has been very different from some of the experiences in recent expansions and we try to illustrate this here in this diagram so here we plot the growth in core CPI over the course of an expansion on the x-axis is the number of quarters since unemployment peaked in the preceding recession and on the y-axis is the core CPI growth and so what we show here is that in the 1970s expansion core CPI grew by about 17 or so over 10 quarters in the following expansions core CPI grew slower and slower so in the 80s expansion uh the 90s expansion early 2000s expansion and then finally the expansion that started in 2009 where core CPI had grown by only about five percent or so after 10 quarters the current expansion is very different and that's been tracking much more the 80s expansion than any of the more recent expansions and this strong growth in prices was led in particular by the good sector and we illustrate this here on the left panel we see core Goodson on the right side we see core services and we see that core Goods prices initially searched in the current expansion so passing even the price growth of goods in the 70s expansion while Services price growth was much more moderate and only recently picked up and is now tracking the 80s expansion this Behavior where inflation was led by the good sector is very different from some of the recent expansions like here the 2009 or the 2003 expansion where Goods prices basically were flat and the entire price growth came from the services sector several developments have contributed to this strong price growth on the good side so on the supply side there have been supply chain disruptions leading to an increase in imported input prices in particular and there was a decline in the willingness to work leading to a rise in the reservation wage by about 20 percent and so these factors have contributed to increasing input prices and increasing wages as we show in this table so here we're showing the annualized growth rates of import prices and wages in the last four expansions and highlighted is the current expansion on the on the very right so in the first row we see that import prices have been growing at an annualized rate of about six percent and if you look at the import prices of so-called Industrial Supplies such as metal chemicals Rubber and so on inputs into the production process these have actually been growing at an annualized rate of 20 in the in the current expansion in addition to that wages have been increasing as measured by the employment compensation index here we see that that has been rising at an annualized rate of about five percent one to two percentage points faster than in earlier expansions finally domestic intermediate input prices have also been rising kind of reflecting that both foreign prices foreign competitors prices as measured by import prices have been rising and domestic production prices have been rising as well in addition to the supply side factors they've been shocked to the demand side there was a quick recovery in labor demand and the pickup in consumer demand due to pent-up demand after the lockdowns and fiscal stimulus as well as a shift towards goods from services that has led to a rise in the good share and consumer expenditures from 36 to 38 percent so there's been a lot of recent works it's trying to understand this current inflation episode and to disentangle some of these Supply factors and and demand factors what we bring to the table is that we examine this recent search in inflation so the lens over two sector new Canadian model that will allow us to illuminate some of the equilibrium effects in the equilibrium relationships and to do counterfactuals so we do three things so first we're going to focus a bit on the supply side of this previous table that I showed you we're going to analyze the role of Labor Supply shocks and supply chain disruptions we're going to show that these import price and labor Supply shocks contributed about two percentage points to the rise of inflation about one-third to two-thirds of the pickup in inflation overall that we've seen importantly the interaction of these shots to import prices and labor Supply had an amplified effect increasing inflation by 0.6 percentage points relative to a world where these shocks hit separately next we turn to the effectiveness of a monetary policy and we consider demand shock that increases inflation also by two percentage points and then we compare the implications of the supply shocks versus the demand shocks and what they imply for monetary policy what we're going to show is that aggressive monetary policy is very effective when the when the shocks are on the demand side but much less effective when the shocks are coming from supply side factors finally we challenge some regression evidence and you use Aggregate and Industry level data to provide some corroborating evidence for the mechanisms of our model so let me start briefly summarizing our model so our model is a standard new Cajun dhte model with wage and price rigidity was kind of four key departures from like the plain vanilla the HDE model so first we have two sectors goods and services and these sectors differ in their labor share and their consumption share moreover firms in the good sector compete with foreign competitors in the output Market within the services sector there's no foreign competition or competition is domestic second there are two inputs into production labor and intermediate inputs and intermediate inputs can either be domestic can either domestically produce or imported so this production structure gives rise to Rich substitution patterns when the price of imported intermediates goes up firms are going to substitute towards domestically produced intermediates and towards labor and this is going to drive up inflation third there's a finite number of domestic and foreign producers meaning that their strategic interactions between firms and incomplete pass-through so when foreign producers experience a cost shock this is going to allow domestic firms to raise their prices by relatively more because they're not going to lose as much market share towards these foreign competitors so they can expand their markups and finally there's going to be a time varying expenditure share on Goods to capture this rise in the good share that we see in the data so we're going to calibrate this model using standard parameters from the literature and that we focus here on two key parameters that we focus on so the first one is the elasticity of substitution between labor and intermediates this is important because when there's a shock to these intermediate inputs firms are going to substitute towards labor and the strengths is governed by this elasticity of substitution so we're going to set this to two in the good sector and to 1.5 in the services sector based on some recent work by Chun in Danish data that has estimated these elasticities to be in the range of one to three second the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign intermediates which we also set to two based on some work by field sharing courses that finds a range of one to three for this elasticity and we analyze the robustness of our amplification results to different parameter choices in the paper our main exercise is to study the effect of Labor supply and supply chain disruption so our model is soft and dinar using a third order approximation to capture non-linear effects and we're going to operationalize this these shocks as three joint shocks that happen simultaneously first there's a labor Supply shock that is asymmetric it increases the disutility of Labor more in Services than in Goods to kind of capture the pandemic experience of these sectors and to match the 0.3 percentage Point decline in labor Supply relative to the trend from hobane and and Shaheen's work second there's a shock to imported input prices of 16 to kind of match the observed rise in imported input prices that we see in the data and finally there's a foreign competition shock so that increases the marginal cost of foreign competitors and we calibrate this to match the roughly constant share of imports in GDP so foreign firms didn't really gain market shares U.S firms were affected by these shocks so they must have experienced kind of somewhat similar shocks let me decides this again okay okay um so we feed these joint shocks into the model um and let me show you a couple of impulse responses to show you what's the what's the model generates so here we show input responses of Labor demand and domestic input demand these are deviations from steady state and we see that as a result of this combined shock firms substitute away from imported intermediates towards domestically produced intermediates and towards labor and this effect is in particular strong in the good sector because intermediates are a more important input for goods as a result of these shocks in this substitution there's a rise in the real wage in both sectors and real marginal costs go up as a result consequently there's wage inflation we find about 3.5 percent wage inflation in both sectors and there's Consumer Price inflation of about two percent as I mentioned at the beginning this is about one-third to two-thirds of the inflation pickup depending on whether you look at 21 or 22. what are the key takeaways from this exercise so there are three key insights that we take away from this so the first one is the substitution effect so an imported input prices a supply chain shock on its own can actually generate substantial wage and price inflation let me illustrate this here with these two diagrams so on the left we have average wage inflation averaged across the goods in the services sector and on the right we have price inflation and we find that the 16 imported input price check on its own generates 0.5 wage and price inflation intuitively when imported input prices rise from substitute towards domestic production factors this drives up demand for domestic labor and this increases wages the second Insight is that a shock to foreign competitors also raises domestic inflation so now we feed separately into this model just of foreign competitor shock and we find that it generates roughly similar wage and price inflation why is this well when foreign competitors prices rise consumers substitute away from buying from foreign firms towards domestic firms is again drives up domestic demand and domestic firms now have greater pricing power that can increase their markup because they're not going to lose as much market share to foreign firms and again this increases prices finally a joint shock has an amplified effect on inflation so let me show you this with a couple of diagrams so first I'm just going to feed in separately the third of the shocks the labor this utility shock so these are these three line shoulders three shots separately and let me just add up these separate shocks so just basically adding up these impulse responses that's this red dashed line so what happens if we feed these three shocks jointly into the model well then we get to the black line and clearly this black line is above the red line and so the difference is what we call the amplification effect so this joint shock raises wage inflation by one percentage point and price inflation by 0.6 percentage points more than the three separate shocks what's the intuition well when both wages and input prices go up at the same time becomes less effective to substitute across these inputs to blunt this cost increase firms can't really substitute from inputs towards labor or vice versa to reduce their cost pressures and again consumers can't really substitute towards foreign suppliers to to reduce their costs and so as the result prices are going to go up by more what are the implications of our model for monetary policy well there's been a lot of debate about what monetary policy should do and in particular when the sources the shock is uncertain so we've talked about the supply side about Supply driven inflation of two percentage points but what if this inflation came from the demand side we're going to study an exercise where inflation Also Rises by two percentage points on impact but not because of Supply shocks but because of demand shocks so we feed into the model A Goods favor demand shocks that shifts expenditures towards goods from services and boost consumption today because of a reduction of the discount Factor and we're going to analyze our Baseline scenario with the standard Taylor rule versus an aggressive policy where the interest rate Rises more and earlier because of a less persistent tailor Rule and higher weight on inflation and we're going to study the implications of this aggressive policy when the shocks are Supply driven versus when the shocks are demand driven so let me start with the kind of Supply shock so here I'm showing you the impulse responses of consumption labor demand and price inflation to the Baseline in black and the aggressive policy in in red Dash first we see that under the aggressive policy consumption which already contracts in the Baseline contracts substantially more so there's a recession in this case um labor demand is actually very strong and positive in the Baseline this is again because of the substitution towards domestic labor so the labor market actually overheats in response to the supply shock um here the aggressive policy reduces this but the naval response is still positive in this case so there's no unemployment or less employment if you will and finally price inflation obviously comes down so intuitively higher interest rates in the case of the supply shock they deal with inflation but they reduce demand and so in this case consumption actually contracts substantially the pictures are very different in the case of the demand shock so again the demand shock generates similar inflation of around two percent uh in the Baseline scenario and this is obviously reduced with more aggressive policy however consumption was also too high because this was the demand sure consumption was overheating and so here aggressive policy is kind of good it brings consumption down which moderates inflation and additionally a recession later if you follow this black line there's actually a recession in labor demand and also in output this recession later is actually avoided and so this kind of standard classic textbook basically um was aggressive policy the higher interest rates deal was both higher inflation and this overheating consumption by bringing both more in line was kind of the Baseline okay in the final couple of minutes let me try and present some corroborating evidence uh for our findings so the model generates increasing marginal costs and amplification in the recent period so do we see any support for these claims in the data so we're going to look at two data sets first an aggregate data set where we run some local projections following jorda to trace out impulse responses and second some industry level data we run panel regressions for about 506 digit next Industries so let me start with the aggregate analysis so here we just run local projections of producer price inflation in some quarter t plus h on the left hand side on input price inflation and wage inflation as well as up to eight quarters of lags on the right hand side and so we run this regression for H from 0 to 20 so Trace out impulse responses over this period 1988 to 2022 and for both input price inflation and wage inflation we find the H with the highest correlation so kind of the peak of the impulse response function and then for that age we're going to see whether these parameters vary over time by rewriting this regression over 25 year Rolling windows so this is kind of the peak response so let me let me show you what this looks like so here on the left we show the peak response of PPI inflation to intermediate price inflation we're now on the x-axis we have the end of this 25 year Rolling window period so it's kind of the gamma H coefficient over time and so we see that this correlation between input price inflation and producer price inflation has been coming down but then recently it has picked up in the recent period so this pass through has been increasing the picture is similar for wages basically there was no wage to price pass through in the 2000s as we've documented in an earlier paper but wage to price plaster has significantly picked up reason has kind of jumped up and become positive again so there's been this re-emergence of wage to price pass through what about this interaction effect so we can add an additional interaction term to our regression as well as additional lags for this term and we can trace out this impulse response function for age between 0 and 20 and so this is how the impulse response function of this looks like we see a nice thumb shaped impulse response so this interaction term has a positive and significant effect meaning that inflation is higher when both wages and input prices go up at the same time so that's very helpful um we now turn to Industry level analysis because we want to also control for some aggregate effects that that may be going on so the time series analysis we can only look at these aggregate effects and maybe there were changes in expectations other aggregate things and so was industry level data we can actually look at within industry variation to see if our mechanisms hold so we run a similar regression we're on the left hand side we put four quarter producer price changes in some industry I and we regress this on four quarter changes in input prices uh wages foreign competitors prices um so these are the import prices of an industry so if I is the car industry these are the import imported prices of import costs and we control for productivity and finally we control for industry fixed effects and these time fixed effects to take up any out of the trends so we run this regression and we look whether things are different in 2021 compared to the earlier kind of pre-covet period so what do we find so we estimate these kind of pass-through coefficients and let's focus first on the um on this orange term which is input price changes so we find that this correlation between input price changes and producer price changes was about 24 percent um before covert but in the Corvette period This has picked up to the sum of these two coefficients this passthrough has risen to about 40 percent similarly the wage to price passer has risen from basically near zero to about 13 percent and finally producer prices have become more correlated with foreign competitors prices this correlation has also strengthened and I should point out this is for the we're focusing here on the goods the good sector in this analysis the second thing is we can look at the interaction effect so we can add an interaction term to this regression um just as before and some additional non-linear terms that come out of a second order Taylor expansion and what we find is that this interaction term is strongly positive and significant so again we find strong support for the fact that when both input prices and wages go up at the same time there's a stronger effect on inflation than when they go up separately and in fact once we add this interaction term to the regression these individual interactions was 21 become insignificant kind of indicating that this pickup in parcel that we see is completely accounted for by this interaction effect so let me conclude with our key takeaways so we have four key takeaways first we can interpret these supply chain disruptions that we've seen as a partial reversal of the disinflationary effects of globalization that we have enjoyed over the last couple of decades or so second we find that part of the tightening of the labor market could just be due to supply chain disruptions that have led to a substitution towards domestic production third The Joint import price and weight shock had an amplified effect on inflation and finally the benefit of regressive policy depends really on the source of the shock so for the demand driven shock it's advantageous to be ahead of the curve and to be aggressive but aggressive policy is much less advantageous for the supply shock uh thanks very much that's it actually
