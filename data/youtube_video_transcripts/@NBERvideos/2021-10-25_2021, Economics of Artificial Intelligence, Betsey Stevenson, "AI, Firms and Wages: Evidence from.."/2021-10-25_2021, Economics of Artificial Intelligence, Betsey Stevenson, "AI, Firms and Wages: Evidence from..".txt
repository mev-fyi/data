okay great thank you so much for having me here to discuss uh this paper i can tell you that i find this to be the most fun conference i attend uh each year and i actually just want to applaud the creativity and the ways that you've changed it up the discussion today you can see i wasn't asked to discuss the papers as much as to say ai will reduce the total number of jobs true false uncertain i'm not supposed to say uncertain i'm supposed to take a position so let's see where are we well we started we just heard from two new papers new evidence ai will reduce the total number of jobs no says one paper automation increases employment at the plant firm and industry level higher sales lower prices benefits of automation greater in industries that face international uh competition yes says the other ai firms and wages evidence from india ai displaces jobs a 1 increase in ai jobs leads to a 3.61 decrease in non-ai jobs and reduces wage offers across the distribution what's right well i like the paper uh by xavier the best because i'm a technology optimist and it can and it shows that if you widen the scope you'll see just how automation can actually increase jobs and that you know perhaps highlights places where uh asamoglow and rustrapo uh didn't look hard enough for the potential benefits okay now i hope you know that was somewhat tongue-in-cheek set of comments around the problems of confirmation bias which is there's lots of studies out there that are going to show us that sometimes technology and automation increases the number of jobs sometimes it decreases the number of jobs and i can find a study that confirms whatever i want to believe if that's what i want and so we have to be really careful if we're going to answer this question to not just pick and choose the evidence that builds the case we want to but actually try to assess the the evidence and as unbiased away as possible there are two big competing ideas the two big competing ideas are that technology displaces workers through technological unemployment because fewer people are needed to produce the same amount of stuff and the demand for stuff simply doesn't increase enough to offset the displacement the other idea is that automation creates productivity gains that lead to price decreases which increase market demand in the scale of production sufficiently to offset the displacement which one's right well on a small scale do the productivity gains offset displacement within a firm on a medium scale do they offset displacement within an industry or within a small geographical region on a large scale do they offset displacement within a country what about an even larger scale are they going to offset displacement on a global scale so answering this question will we get more or less jobs really is going to depend on the scale at which we're trying to answer the question assessing whether ai will reduce the total number of jobs the paper by xavier and his co-author said because of these multiple and countervailing economic forces understanding the aggregate and distributional impacts of automation across workers consumers and producers is fundamentally an empirical question i'm an empirical labor economist so that sounds right to me but is it an empirical question we can measure the past in a particular scenario but how much external validity is there for predicting the future with ai how do we combine many empirical studies across industries across time across technology across points of development to inform our predictions and what exactly is it that we're trying to predict will ai reduce the total number of jobs in the world let's think about global trade and automation again pulling from the paper by xavier and his co-authors and and i should say that the paper by alex ashley and catherine i really uh appreciated and i was really struck by the findings being very similar to what you see in developed contexts because my intuition probably was that you'd see something different in an emerging economy um and i think expanding our evidence around the globe is going to be very important for answering these questions then uh coming back to this quote in a globalized world attempts to curb domestic automation in order to protect domestic employment may be self-defeating due to foreign competition the problem is you can't just smash the machines in your own country you'd have to shut the world out and you know we uh we've already learned in the pandemic you can't really do that lots of countries tried i actually just spent some time in fortress australia and believe me they're doing everything they can to shut the world out and haven't been able to succeed so the problem is smashing the machines around the entire globe is probably going to be a lot harder than smashing the machines in the 1700s and even that wasn't that successful so do developed countries need to fear a global shift of jobs towards emerging economies so again is the right question will ai reduce the total number of jobs in what in the united states maybe because maybe they'll shift to india although today's findings maybe not maybe ai doesn't confer any kind of advantage to emerging economies if we though think about gains from increasing comparative advantage and specialization again to quote from the paper from xavier and his co-authors competition with international suppliers providing close substitutes can explain why the relationship between automation and employment can remain positive even at the industry level because the response of consumer demand can be large in other words if you only sell within your country it's harder for the scale effect to be big enough to get a net positive impact on employment but there are these positive externalities from globalization still there are limits demand elasticities of substitution are going to depend on how much we're consuming and these estimates aren't necessarily predictive of a future with even more automation the bottom line is if we look at the united states we've had enormous growth in productivity we've had enormous growth in the economy it's all happened in the service sector we don't want to produce more stuff and we see a flatlining a shrinking of jobs in the goods producing sector because there's just only so much stuff we want to have some of that's because we're producing these goods internationally but it's not all that they're you know what if for any given thing for that we might have say cars there's only so many cars we want the idea of more jobs comes from new ideas for about new ways and things that we might consume but maybe ai does reduce the total number of jobs i think in some sense of course ai reduces the total number of jobs great this is a great thing and i come back to this quote by throw the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation what is called resignation is confirmed desperation unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind there is no play in them for it comes after work work less work is something that many of many people throughout history have sought so i think bigger questions are does the impact of technology depend on how much bargaining power workers have are there positive externalities from work that mean that even with no labor market imperfections we could get the wrong quantity of work from a societal perspective so we may have fewer jobs hey i might reduce the number of jobs the question isn't does it reduce the number of jobs or increase the number of jobs but do we get the right number of jobs or the wrong number of jobs given the societal benefits of jobs now if we think about our standard positive externalities if we don't have any government intervention we get a wrong lower quantity can we learn anything from the fact that a global pandemic that resulted in fewer jobs seems to have given workers more bargaining power that's certainly something that people are wrestling with right now it seems almost counter-intuitive and yet post-pandemic people are re-evaluating their working lives 28 percent of u.s workers say that they're likely or very likely to quit if they have to go back to the office 63 of people now want to work remotely compared to 38 in 2019 55 of workers prefer to be remote at least three days a week only 21 percent of executives now think employees should be in the office five days a week 55 percent of americans in the labor force want to seek new employment in the next 12 months uh even greater for younger people 70 nearly 70 percent of parents plan to make some kind of change with 25 of them saying they want to work less 25 percent of parents say coming out of the pandemic they want to work less so bring on the ai reducing the number of jobs they want to work less but at the same time the pandemic spurred entrepreneurship uh and so i think when i asked this question will ai reduce the number of jobs in the world in a country in a developed country i hope the answer is yes in the world i'm not sure about the answers there's a lot of countries where there's really not a lot of formal jobs in an industry certainly for a firm i hope so because i don't want individual firms to grow with unlimited power which question are we trying to answer ultimately the question is not about the number of jobs or the hours of work but whether ai can be harnessed to improve most people's lives or will it increase inequality and hardship for some the answer is going to depend on policy unregulated ai left to benevolent industrialists and benevolent is very seriously in quotes there will enrich a few at the expense of many and has the potential to erode entire societies we're already seeing evidence of this and i think it's unregulated ai that we need to worry about thank you
