so the motivation for this project is relatively straightforward so the coven 19 has been a global pandemic that has created unprecedented economic and social disruption and in particular it has been a threat to older and disabled workers and so let me just motivate why we should care about this group so first the pandemic had higher rates of mortality among those at older ages and also prior literature has shown that these groups of individuals are more vulnerable to permanent labor market exits during recessions so with this in mind what do we do in this paper so we're going to ask two key questions so first how have older workers employment outcomes evolved over the course of the copen 19 pandemic and second did the copa 19 pandemic result in changes in social security disability and retirement applications we're going to bring together three different sources of data so first let me talk about these data so we're going to use the current population survey or the cps so this is individual level data and we're going to look at individuals ages 50 through 70 in the years january 2015 through march 2021 so these are going to provide us with employment characteristics of these individuals so an individual can either be employed unemployed or no longer in the labor force and then within the non-labor force bucket we're also going to be able to identify labor force exits due to retirement disability or reasons other than retirement or disability we're going to pair this with ssa data on applications for disability these data are going to be at the state by month level again for the same time period and to make this com these data comparable we're going to convert the app number of applications to be applications per hundred thousand people specifically within the ages of 20 through 64. and so we can separate total disability applications into those that are for ssi ssdi only ssi only and those concurrent for ssdi and ssi and then finally we're going to have retirement applications as well um the caveat being that the retirement applications we only have at the national level but that being said we still can we can still say a little bit about retirement as well and we'll be able to disaggregate the total applications into those filed online versus those filed offline and additionally in the paper we also incorporate google trends data which i will not talk about today but is in the paper if you are interested so let me walk you through our key results so first i will walk you through the employment outcomes the red vertical dashed line represents february 2020 and each dot on the graph you should think of as the effect in the month relative to what we would have expected without the pandemic so think of what we would have expected given typical seasonality and trends and then this deviation is normalized relative to the excluded year which is february 2020. so we see a really sharp decline in employment of about 10 to 15 percentage points that occurs or peaks in april 2020 and then this slowly starts to recover over the course of the pandemic however it stays at a depressed level of about three to five percentage points we see a slight increase in employed but absence so these are people who are currently employed but absent from their job they could be sick they could be um home from work for a variety of reasons on furlough and this seems to be most prevalent in the early part of the pandemic and not really a factor later on so where are these employment effects coming from so we can look at both unemployment and labor force exits so we see a matching but inverse increase in unemployment that mirrors the drop in employment and we again see this peak in april 2020 and then steadily decline over the course of the pandemic however on the other side in terms of labor force exits we do see a relatively large increase in april 2020 however unlike the employment effects we actually see that the results maintain a heightened level and when we take the labor force exits and we separate it into the three components that i mentioned so for the younger older workers so the 50 to 61 year olds we see that the labor force exits are largely driven to live driven by reasons other than retirement or disability whereas for the 62 to 70 year olds the largest component is due to retirement and then the second largest is due to reasons other than other than retirement and disability in terms of magnitudes the largest uh factor in terms of our employment effects is coming from unemployment so 60 of the employment effects are attributable to unemployment for the 50 to 61 year olds this is about 50 of the employment effects for the 62 to 70 year olds so for the 62 to 70 year olds the labor force exits make up a larger fraction of the employment effects now let me turn to the disability applications so what you're seeing here is a very sharp decline in disability applications so in may 2020 this peaks at about seven fewer applications per 100 000 people this is about a 15 decline in applications and this hovers around for fewer applications per hundred thousand if we break this down into its subcomponents this is largely driven by a decrease in ssi only applications so this accounts for 55 of the decrease and is a 22 decrease relative to the mean and the next largest component is 30 is the 30 uh 30 percent of the decline in total disability applications is coming from concurrent applications and this is an 18 decrease relative to the mean the pre-coded mean and then finally ssdi only applications are attributable to the rest of the total decline but only represent about 16 percent of the total decline in a 7 decrease relative to the mean now we turn to retirement applications on net we actually see no change in retirement applications for social security we do see an interesting shift in how people are applying so we see a shift from applications being filed offline to being filed online and so this might be interesting for social security going forward and that it might be a long-term shift in how people apply for these benefits we do a lot of interesting heterogeneity in the paper that i'll just briefly highlight so we do find that the reductions in disability are largely concentrated among more vulnerable groups so these are individuals with lower education more likely to be a minority and those who live alone uh in contrast the increases in retirement are higher among high education whites and those who live alone in terms of employment effects we do see that employment reductions are larger in states that were more shut down and mirroring this we see larger increases in unemployment and retirement in these areas however we don't see this similar distinction in terms of disability applications so places that were more shut down did not have fewer disability applications and then finally we see employment reductions are more pronounced in areas that have a higher share of older workers who were previously employed in non-teleworkable and non-essential jobs so we think of these jobs as jobs that were probably most vulnerable to the covid pandemic so just to conclude let me talk about some potential mechanisms and and what might be going on here and what we can say about these so for each of the sets of outcomes there's both demand side factors in supply side factors that may be at play and in fact we find evidence that both are present so on the labor market outcome side the demand side factors are things such as business closures due to shelter in place or other ordinances requiring businesses to shut down this led to people being laid off and we do find that employment dipped in to a further extent in areas that were more shut down on the flip side for supply side factors these may be people who are not working due to caregiving responsibilities for a rational fear of contracting the virus or due to changes in work requirements and telework that that led to separations and so we are able to look at this in the pulse survey and what we find is that fear of contracting the virus doesn't appear to be driving the supply side factors and then in terms of dynamics we find that both supply side factors and demand side factors are at play however supply side factors are more prevalent in the early time period and demand side factor or sorry i said that that means so demand side factors are more prevalent in the early time period and supply side factors become more prevalent as as the pandemic goes on in terms of disability outcomes the demand side factors are things such as actual reductions in disability we look at this in the cps and find a small reduction in people self-reporting disability um the caveat being these are not work related disabilities these are your standard cps disability questions such as do you have trouble with vision um climbing stairs and so forth there's also the explanation that expanded ui benefits or the stimulus payments may have led people to either delay or or not apply altogether um we do see in in the paul survey that most people didn't change their decision to apply for social security however uh there is a non-trivial group about seven to ten percent who decided not to apply and this is larger among ui recipients and then finally there's supply side factors so many social security field offices closed during the pandemic and additionally some people may have had lower access to internet and with library closures and so forth may have not been able to apply um we do find in terms in regards to this we don't see that there were larger decreases in applications in places that were more shut down however what is consistent with this is we do see larger reductions in ssi rather than ssdi which could also point towards an access story given that the ssi population tends to be more vulnerable and then finally in terms of supply side factors there's also the possibility that people were not able to certify their medical conditions given that um non-urgent medical office visits were delayed or or closed down um however if if this story were at play we would have expected there to be a recovery in applications following offices reopening and we don't find any evidence of that we hope you check out our paper
