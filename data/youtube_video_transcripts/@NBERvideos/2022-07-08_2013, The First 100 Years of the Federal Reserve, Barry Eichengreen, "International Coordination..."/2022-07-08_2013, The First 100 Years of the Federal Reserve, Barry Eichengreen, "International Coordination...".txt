this paper has had a variety of titles monetary policy the international dimension the title before this one was does the fair the fed care about the world and our conveners suggested to me that that was perhaps open to misinterpretation and might be best modified uh slightly as it has been my my task has been eased by some of the comments made in the previous session by carmen's reminder that the united states is an open economy um that's also the point of my paper uh the argument of the paper is that in fact open economy considerations have repeatedly played a consequential role in in the conduct of federal reserve policy uh a statement that i think might come as a bit of a shock to the presumptions of many people in this room they're accustomed to thinking about fed policy in terms of the institution's dual mandate which refers to price stability and maximum employment but not to the exchange rate or other international economic and and financial variables uh people will be used to viewing fed policy through the lens of the taylor rule in which the exchange rate and other international variables matter only in insofar as they influence inflation and the output gap which is to say by and large not very much i will argue that this view of the conventional state of affairs is heavily too heavily in fact shaped by the distinctive and peculiar circumstances of the last three decades when the influence of international considerations on fed policy has in fact been limited international considerations uh repeatedly played a larger role in earlier phases of the institution's history i think this longer perspective is a reminder that just because the fed has not attached priority to international aspects of monetary policy in the recent past is no guarantee that it won't do so in the future the founding of of the fed to start at the start is typically portrayed in terms of domestic financial stability considerations interest rates spike during the harvest and planting seasons uh giving rise to financial stringency and instability the fed was therefore created quote to furnish an elastic currency and for other purposes my point then being that the four other purposes part is important in addition to those desiring desiring a more elastic currency there were exporters importers and financial interests uh who wanted to establish a market in dollar denominated trade credits uh and and more generally create an international role for the dollar before world war one they were aware uh the dollar in new york played a little role in financing international trade even the trade of u.s importers and exporters themselves taking payment in dollars was unattractive given the volatility of american financial markets because u.s banks were prohibited from branching abroad converting dollar payments back into local currency was not straightforward that left the new york financial community unable to compete with london for uh an important source of business it put u.s importers and exporters at a competitive disadvantage therefore the federal reserve act authorized u.s banks to branch abroad for the first time so that they could originate international business and one of the first initiatives of the new central bank was to take steps to foster a market in trade credits known in contemporary parliance's trade acceptances the the challenge with creating a new market of course is developing liquidity without a minimum level of transactions the market will lack liquidity if it lacks liquidity there won't be the uh the requisite uh willingness to transact that was the chicken and egg problem facing the new central bank and it uh responded by stepping in as the pi the buyer and liquidity provider of last resort purchasing dollar acceptances at uh at or close to the prevailing price when private demand was lacking and at the outset private demand was always lacking so uh in the 1920s the uh the fed was the the principal counterparty uh in this market it was the dominant uh purchaser of trade related paper if you want to put it this way credit easing or large scale asset purchases are not entirely unprecedented in in the history of of the institution and those efforts in the 1920s succeeded in the sense that uh new york and the dollar quickly came to match and surpassed london and and sterling as a source for low credit for global trade a very startling change from the situation prior to 1914. the other thing the fed did the new york fed in particular did under benjamin strong in the 1920s was to cut its discount rate in 1924 and engaged in those expansionary open market operations in 1927 that julio uh referred to i have its uh discount rate here where the 2425 cuts are visible what what it did in 27 less so those cuts were taken with the goal of helping great britain back on on the gold standard so strong saw exchange rates stability instability as having a withering effect his words on international trade and international trade as the key to u.s prosperity his policy was criticized at the time as we heard in the last session as inappropriate inappropriately loose for domestic circumstances it was criticized specifically for fueling uh the real estate and wall street bubbles of the 1920s both of which of course came down with a crash his critics concluded it would have been better for him to uh for the fed to keep its eye on on the domestic ball that's a normative judgment the positive statement is that international considerations were quite important at critical junctures in the 1920s for shaping federal reserve policy the next time they were critically important was of course in 1931 in october of 1931 following britain's departure from from gold in response the fed made unmistakably clear where its priorities lay this was in the teeth of the great depression and it it responded to the international dimension the external repercussions of britain's departure from gold by raising the discount rate by 200 basis points that made speculating against the dollar more costly again the wisdom of the decision uh has and can and has been been questioned by by friedman and schwartz and others but it's clear that uh the fed privileged exchange rate stability over price stability over financial stability and over economic stability the final attack on the dollar of course occurred in march of 1933 worries that fdr might devalue encouraged capital flight their nationwide banking panic resulted at that point there was essentially no choice but to embargo gold exports close the banks and regroup that then was the initial step down the path that brought to brought to a close the first era in which international considerations played a a prominent role in us monetary policy after uh the dollar was uh stabilized uh once once again against uh gold in january of 1934. it's hard to find much of a trace of international factors on fed uh decision making devaluation had enhanced the country's international competitiveness with the pro the approach of world war ii there were large capital flows toward uh the united states with the problem now uh not gold and capital outflows as before 1933 but large golden capital inflows uh u.s policy was essentially unconstrained by international factors then comes world war ii and and and the aftermath and the accord mentioned previously uh after which the fed regained control of monetary policy um recent scholarship by our conveners and others i think uh portrays monetary policy in the 1950s in a favorable light more pertinent for this discussion it portrays monetary policy in the 1950s as focusing on inflation and to a lesser extent temporary deviations from full employment there's little emphasis revealingly there's little mention in the minutes of the fomc of the dollar exchange rate the u.s balance of payments or the impact of u.s monetary policy on the rest of the world the pendulum begins to swing back then around 1960 1960 was the year when u.s foreign monetary liabilities first exceeded u.s gold reserves it was when investors worried that jfk if elected president might follow fdr and devalue the dollar to get the economy moving again that expectation that he would devalue proved wrong but i think the other worries did not the question for me though is how much influence those other international worries had on the policy process one way of focusing thought on on on that is to look at to count mentions of balance of payments considerations in the minutes of the fomc now thankfully machine readable and if you do that um you can see uh the hump in the graph i don't know how how visib visible it is from the back is the first half of the uh the 1960s where there are growing references uh slowly but surely growing references to the exchange rate and rapidly increasing numbers of references to uh to the balance of payments um qualitative evidence uh i draw on a study that michael bordeaux and i uh have done previously points in the same direction calibrating a taylor rule using real-time data points in in in the same direction uh as well it shows that policy was tighter uh in the first half of the 60s than would be expected on the basis of inflation and the output gap uh alone contrary to the impression i think that was left by some elements of the previous discussion and i interpret that tightness of policy in this period as uh the fed responding to those balance of payments concerns interestingly then reference to this begins to decline in the second half of the 1960s that's when when responsibility for balance of payments considerations is more clearly assigned to the treasury as opposed to the fed that's when a variety of of of capital control like measures are imposed in the united states that begin to relax uh the external constraint the 1970s then is uh as we've heard a decade of mixed signals it's a decade of uncertainty about fed policy the fed was unconstrained by the exchange rate unconstrained by much else in retrospect monetary policy drifted and that then changed dramatically when congress amended the federal reserve act to include the dual mandate and then when chairman volcker made inflation control a priority from 1983 policy begins to track the taylor rule quite closely perhaps not entirely surprisingly given that's part of the data set on which the taylor rule is is estimated but i think what's clear is that inaugurates the period when international variables matter almost only insofar as they were relevant to the future evolution of inflation and the output gap so that's a slightly over strong statement i list some exceptions uh in the paper but i think it is the relevant generalization there one can point to a combination of factors uh to explain why international considerations were less uh influential uh starting in the 1980 than they had been in the 1920s in the 1930s and the 1960s after the collapse of bretton woods there was no longer an exchange rate peg or a gold peg to uh to defend or to focus on the 1977 amendment gave the fed a mandate to pursue price stability and full employment but said nothing about the balance of payments or international financial stability the u.s still was or was under the impression that it still was large enough and closed enough that the fed could afford to act to a first approximation uh like uh the central bank of a closed economy the u.s trade to gdp ratio was rising but more slowly than in the subsequent quarter century the explosive growth of capital flows to which carmen alluded uh earlier was essentially yet to come all of this permitted the federal reserve to formulate and implement monetary policy more or less like a closed economy central bank with a few exceptions so um by way of conclusion i want to ask whether international considerations will have play a more powerful role on fed policy in the future and how if at all the federal reserve should modify the formulation and conduct of policy to take them into account when i think about this i think about three likely trends that will work to heighten the impact of international variables on the us economy all of them are debatable and reminds me that i i have no time to debate them with myself first i assume that that the us will continue to grow more open to international trade and and and financial transactions trends and technology and policy both point in that direction second i assume that emerging and frontier markets will continue to grow more rapidly than mature economies like the us so the u.s will come to account for a progressively declining share of the global economy that's the logic of convergence if you will third i assume that the dollar will lose it its monopoly as funding currency for international banks and as all but exclusive vehicle and currency of denomination for international transactions there's no fundamental reason why only the u.s should have deep and liquid financial markets the logic of convergence suggests that the us alone will not be able to provide safe and liquid assets on the scale required by the global economy it follows that even u.s banks and firms will come to rely more on foreign currency funding and liquidity in the future than they have in the past the implication of these assumptions is that shocks to the exchange rate and the balance of payments will have a larger impact on on the us economy and that the implications will extend beyond those foreign inflation and the output gap they will extend to the stability of the financial sector among other things there will be the related tendency for large capital flows in addition to pushing up the exchange rate to put unwelcome pressure on on housing and other financial markets as has been the case in the recent past but the the volume of those in inflows and their impact on u.s markets will arguably be even greater so um assume uh as i do that as a result of these changes the impact of the exchange rate in capital flows on the u.s economy becomes more important does it follow that the fed will have to modify the formulation and conduct of policy in order to take them into account um i'm too much of an economist to answer anything other than yes and no uh if excessive reliance on foreign currency funding causes exchange rate movements to potentially have destabilizing balance sheet of effects we know that the first best response is not to use monetary policy to prevent those movements but to strengthen prudential supervision and regulation of banks and governance of corporations to prevent excessive exposure to this form of balance sheet risk if capital inflows place worrisome upward pressure on housing and other asset markets then the first best solution is to strengthen lending standards raise margin requirements otherwise address problems directly in housing and asset markets second best will be to address the capital inflows that are are the proximate source of the problem by applying inflow taxes uh tightening fiscal policy under certain circumstances that makes monetary policy uh the third best response uh at most if the issue was permanent damage to the traded goods sector from temporary exchange rate uh appreciation then the first best response similarly is to eliminate the financial imperfections forcing incumbent exporters to exit or to use tax and other policies to address their problems directly so you will know that all i have really done here is to restate the lean versus clean debate the question in that context was whether central banks should lean against asset bubbles or leave it to other agencies of government to address those problems using other instruments better suited to the task it was whether even with less than full confidence that other agencies of government were up to that task central banks could afford to shun preemptive action and clean up after any resulting damage with only limited repercussions it would be presumptuous to assert that recent events have decided that debate in favor of one view or the other but i think there is no question that those events have shifted the balance they suggest to many of us that central banks need to think harder about when they should take pre-emptive action both because other agencies of government may not be doing their part and because cleaning up afterwards can be very costly the implication being that precisely the same issues will arise with growing intensity over time in connection with movements in the exchange rate and capital flows thank you [Applause] you
