thank you nicole and um i also want to take a moment just to thank dr ellison for our keynote address and for anchoring us again in the really important intersections between our programs our data representation and equity this is clearly one of our acting commissioners top priorities right ensuring that our programs are fair and equitable and that we are removing barriers and doing our part um to ensure equitable access to our programs and services so i also want to thank you and thank the rdrc program for the opportunity to facilitate this panel the size of the ssa disability programs is often described by the total number of people enrolled and the total enrollment depends in part on the number of people who are newly awarded disability benefits every year and the number of new awards depends in part on the number of new applications and so we are really interested in the trends and applications and in better understanding what drives those so in our next panel the factors affecting disability and disability benefit receipt we'll be taking a deeper look at some of these things so first we will have italo lopez garcia garcia from the university of southern california and he'll present his paper on the role of physical cognitive and interpersonal occupational requirements and working conditions on disability and retirement this is one of the first papers to use the second wave of the occupational requirements survey the ors and it matches ors data to the national health and retirement survey data to consider the relationship between mental and physical job requirements and retirement and eventually disability outcomes this will be followed by nicole mistus thank you nicole um from harvard and nber presenting legal representation and disability claims representation plays a large and growing growing role in disability adjudication this paper investigates the impact on ssdi case outcomes when a claimant representative is engaged from the get-go a little over a month ago ssa announced an increase in the maximum fee that lawyers representing disability claimants can charge and collect going from six thousand to seventy two hundred dollars so legal representation has been a top of mind for many people of late um the last time we increased the pcap was in 2009 and we hope this change will increase representation so we'll be interested in that and our panel will conclude with a paper exploring worker and firm characteristics that drive the use of accommodation for workers with disabilities presented by stephanie renan from rand one interesting aspect of this study is its use of administrative data from the state of oregon on workplace accommodations which provides a uniquely large sample size to explore variations in accommodation and across a large number of worker and employer characteristics and may expand our understanding of demographic variation in the availability and use of workplace accommodations in a way that is really relevant also to our equity goals so without further ado i will turn it to italo thank you so much for our first paper italy you're muted okay can you see my slides sorry okay great uh hi everybody i am italo lopez garcia i'm a senior economist uh at real terri at the center of economic and social research in university of southern california i was about to say iran that's my former employer and it's i love run i used to be there and my quotas are from some of my cars are from brand too and this is work joint work with kathleen malin from usc and jeffrey wenger from rand uh the role of physical and mental requirements on retirement for today today i'm going to focus on retirement with the department disability is working progress so i will be talking about that possibly in in future talks uh so i guess the overall question we have is that can we encourage individuals to delay retirement and what is the role of occupational requirements uh in retirement and retirement transition so a little bit of background this is familiar to this to this audience uh increases life expectancy has have increased the time spent in retirement which people have shown to slow the labor force growth and also challenge the sustainability of the social security and social disability insurance programs so jeff demands likely matter for retirement so there's suggestive evidence showing that uh delays in retirement could encourage uh could encourage by improving working conditions uh and also we know that this is a really important problem because more than half of american workers are exposed to hazardous working conditions and it's likely to affect the retirement labor supply decisions later in life however the current evidence is rather uh conflicting so there are similar results regarding of the role of self-reported physical strain on retirement and also there's some mixed evidence or conflicting evidence where of the role of of uh job demands on retirement when you compare self-reported measures from the hrs with the objective measures typically from on it so this paper what we're going to do as kate said we're going to exploit new data from the occupational requirements survey which so far hasn't been used to address this question and we're going to be using data from the wave 2 which is just really fresh and uh we're excited to talk about that so there is it's a very interesting survey conducted by the bureau of labor statistics in agreement with ssa uh where the advantages of the hr of the ors for example with comparison we compare with on it is that it's this is basically uh conducted by field economies not by java incumbents who interview human resource specialists and occupational managers from the selected companies um we're going to be using the public version of the rs from wave 2 so web 2 was collected in three different years sample 1 2018 to 19 sample 2018-20 sample 3 is undergoing we're going to be using data from sample 1 example 2 and we're excited to uh looking forward with the sample tree is released to incorporate it to our analysis to our analysis so there are three types of job requirements and the areas physical activity or physical job demands there are 32 job traits environmental conditions there are 10 and 11 cognitive and mental requirements and all these datas covering more than 50 000 of observations and 390 occupations at the six digit level soc code so this is amazing has a lot of information but also there are some problems and challenges using this data there are some variable there are variables that are available and some variables are really missing for example with our t type three types of variables in the rs the means and percentiles are continuous variables but for example the hours standing and or the means i was standing for a particular job and also percentiles of our standing for a particular job but the percentiles are missing whereas the means are can be used also binary variables for representing for example the percent of workers for which a particular job traits such as reaching overhead is required or is not required and that is available for most best available for most occupations and also frequency duration variables for example the percent of workers that are exposed or not exposed to wetness or cold or heat and also uh additive variables in the sense that uh uh not exposed to weight wetness or constantly or seldom obviously however this additive frequencies are not really available for most occupations so we'll be restricting our analysis to the variables are highlighted in red there are also some issues with missing job traits for some occupations uh this is a big problem for some for a couple of physical job requirements and for some cognitive job requirements so overall our strategy to deal with missing data from the from the rs is that we're going to use the mean standardized variables uh mid-standardized hours spending one particular job trades uh when available and we're going to be using the continuous variable the percentage of worker data that a particular trade x is required or exposed to a particular x working conditions we also select trades who that are reported for at least 70 percent of occupations which lead us to trip to drop some some some uh some requirements such as cognitive requirements and we will impute the remaining trades for six digit level occupations using average job trades at the two digit level uh two digit occupational level so this is a little of a map of uh how it looks like this just to show you that uh basically we have a large so we have a physical demand the physical environment and some of the mental requirements are available for a large number of occupations but some of them such as communicating verbally or problem solving which are related to cognitive requirements will have to drop because they're available for less than 50 percent of the occupations in the in the data okay this is some exercise we did and uh this is just really like i love these graphs because we wanted to see how the ors compares to the onnet and what we can learn from this comparison so what every time we could actually the ors and the owneth collect data for very similar job trades although the scale is different for example in the arrest is going to be the percentage of workers for which a particular job trade is required and they own it what's the importance of that requirement for a particular job so it's a different scale so we showed like what if we compare them graphically and what we find as you can see these two examples on the right is that there's a large degree of consistency across the two databases for the majority vast majority of the job trace which is encouraging there are some few exceptions and we noted them here before but uh and and those exceptions typically these are typically because some of the ors physical requirements have very little variation so we drop those as for example near vision or hearing and some of them just the match is not it's not really great but there are very small cases that that happens okay so basically using this data and just um using this analyzing statistical properties of the rest of requirements we drop some items which are here just want to emphasize the the for example the four quantity of requirements uh there's a high level of missing missingness but we don't we drop them we also drop some of them that are had little variation or they are perfectly collinear which leaves us with four indices so one is the physical activity index in which we will have 11 requirements uh physical requirements the physical work environment in which we keep all 10 uh has that hazardous conditions uh um and two mental uh two mental uh indices one that reflects job autonomy and flexibility which are the four requirements and one that the second mental uh mental uh in this index is related to supervised people that are supervising their work or that implies working with public which in a way is kind of the opposite to the first index it just reflects like the opposite things like jobs that they have offered low autonomy little autonomy or little flexibility so this is our final list of job traits um uh i'm not going to discuss it each of them in the interest of time but just to show you that basically the supervised and working public mental requirement index is mostly related to jobs that offer little autonomy in opposition to the job autonomy and flexibility index so now next we want to merge this orah data to hrs and the question here is what is the right occupation we should use to merge this indices so in year one project what we did is that we used occupation individual health in wave seven because we're following in our hrs panel we're following everybody from by seven to wave 12 and we were merging indexes to the occupation individual health in the first in the first wave that we observed this person however a better strategy might be to use the job demands from the most important job held during prime years so in order to recover that job we use data from the live instrument survey that includes uh rich occupational history however the problem i mean this is great news but it's also challenging because we also found that for example they've reported the self-reported most important occupation during prime years between age and 30 solely available for about 51 of hrs respondents there's a little bit more information from the list of uh the list of the most that the list of the ten most important jobs in people's history uh so we can actually supplement this information with the longest tenured occupation between the age 25 and 50 from the hms and then we recover a few more cases but the rest of the the rest of the sample of israel's respondents what we do is that we don't have more information occupational history so we supplement with the first occupation of serving the panel at the entering wave so that's going to be our strategy to merge data sets by occupation and this our estimation strategy basically what we're going to do is that we're going to relate our indexes of demands to two different retirement outcomes one's going to be the retirement status basically individuals if the individual is fully retired or not at one particular way and also transitions from working in pdt to fully retired and t plus one where for example part-time and unemployed always going to be considered as the beer is working and we allow multiple transitions so this is a very simple linear regression here our interest is this coefficient alpha one which basically since our job demand index is standardized reflect the interpretation of these coefficients by how much a one standard deviation increase in a particular job demand index changed the probability to be retired or the probability of transitioning into redundant so these are our results so this is our main result so basically what we find is that physical and and mental job requirements in the physical work environment is highly predictive of retirement and retirement transitions just to give you an example for example in the physical activity index a one-time standard deviation increase in the physical activity index is associated with a 10 percent increase in the probability of being retired and a five percent increase in the probability of transitioning into retirement on the other hand the pro a one standard division increase in the job autonomy and flexibility index associated with a 22 decrease in the probability of being retirement and a 12 decrease in the probability of transitioning to retirement and the index supervised work with public index which we interpret as low autonomy uh is actually where we're right it actually is they behave exactly opposed in the exactly opposite way as the geraltine autonomy flexibility index so it's a measure of just little autonomy so we also find there is a large degree of heterogeneity in our results for example this is our heterogeneous results by gender we find that physical demands induce all workers to retire earlier but this is much more pronounced among men so as you can see here in the physical activity index uh one the the an increase in the physical activity index associated associated with a 10 increase in the retirement transition among men and only at 1.7 among females so this is true for the pc college of demands and the and the and the and the physical work environment there are no significant differences for the other two and finally we also find important heterogeneity heterogeneous difference by education for example we see that people with low without a college degree and much more affected by the physical demands in the physical work environment that people that would have a college education and also we see that job autonomy and flexibility delays retirement much more for people that have uh that are more educated with a college degree than people that without don't have a colleague a college degree so conclusions oh i'm trying in our time so we find that physical demanding and has other jobs are likely to retire significantly significantly earlier and that more autonomous and flexible occupations significantly delay retirement may is low educated and workers with poor health and fiscally demanding and hazardous jobs that are much earlier than the counterparts and higher autonomy and flexibility health delay retirement for all groups but they do much more to they do much more so about among college educated workers so next step is disability and this is the part of the outcome that we missed for this presentation but we will uh update in the final report thanks thank you italo i think we're gonna go through each panelist and then we'll come to questions at the end so nicole i'll turn it to you thank you [Music] everything look okay yeah great okay so um thank you everyone this is um joint work with hilary hoynes from uc berkeley and alexis strand from the social security administration now legal representatives have long played an important role in the ssdi application process at the appellate level this is common in other civil law settings where there is a judicial hearing such as immigration court or housing courts but really not a standard feature of the broader u.s social safety net however there is a very large payout in legal fees every year currently about 1.2 billion dollars and we know very little about the value of legal representation in the ssdi context now you might imagine that there really could be important gains to having representatives involved in the ssdi determination process now ssdi is a complex program to apply for representatives might help applicants understand the rules complete their application forms obtain medical records you might see them providing assistance in matching medical evidence to regulatory criteria and in the best case you might even see them getting cases to decisive outcomes more quickly currently about half of awards in our data at least are made on on appeal after a two-year wait so shorter processing times overall would of course reduce processing costs and workload benefiting both ssa and applicants but there are some concerns concerns about aggressive marketing practices perverse incentives possibly and even some high profile instances of fraud so everyone has seen the morgan morgan billboards everywhere around airports charles binder was a staple of late night television advertising for many years and then there's of course the aptly named eric khan here defending himself in a congressional hearing um but he was convicted of a fraud so um this you know um this advertising these instances of fraud and people's understanding of the incentive structure led to allegations that perhaps representatives were slowing processes down in order to earn higher fees now what are the incentives well representatives are paid on contingency only if they win and only if retroactive benefits are owed so the fee is standardized it's 25 of back payment up to a maximum fee of six thousand dollars effectively november 30th that will rise to seventy two hundred dollars um the average fee payment has been about three thousand dollars back payment what that means is that's all the payments the benefits that are owed to a claimant from the months that the disability began their onset date until the time they get their decision minus the five-month waiting period so and well and of course ssa detects the fee from the claimant's back pay and pays the reps directly that's what's known as the direct payment system so the fee payment technically is maximized when cases move more slowly generate more back pay but ultimately result in a favorable decision of course that's only up to a point since the fee is kept so what we're going to do is study the impact of legal representation when representatives are engaged from the initial review stage we're going to use new new admin data we're going to track cases through the hearing level process and their final case outcomes and we're going to develop a new instrumental variables research design to account for the non-random assignment of representatives to cases and that design is motivated by developments at the appellate level that we believe have altered the market structure for representation and may have increased the use of representation at the initial level so what are these developments well this figure shows from 2001 to 2019 the total amount of direct fee payments to representatives across all levels by and large this is largely dominated by by payments for appellate cases so what what you see from 2001 total payments were about 600 million dollars these rose sharply peaking in 2010 at 1.6 billion dollars and this coincided with the rise of a number of very large what we call kind of super-sized disability law firms then in 2011 feet payments began to decline and they declined rather sharply until about 2014 where they stabilized this decline in fee payments came on the heels of the decline in the hearing level allowance rate remember that representatives are paid on contingency only if they win so when the hearing level allowance rate declined this was a big hit to the disability law firms and many of them had these very high throughput business models that depended on on representing a lot of cases most famously one of the biggest firms benjamin binder filed for bankruptcy in 2014. so as all of this was playing out at the appellate level there was an interesting doubling of representation from about eight percent to about 15 percent um between 2010 and um 2014 which is the period uh period that we're going to study here today at the same time there was geographic variation in the um in the distribution of the gains and initial representation that occurred across the country you're seeing here two maps one from 2010 one from 2014 the dark red areas are three-digit zip codes where representation rates and initial claims were over 25 percent in these areas and so you can see that by 2014 there are many more of these darker areas and almost every area of the country got more initial representation although differentially so our research design is going to make use of these kind of more aggregate trends and how they have played out locally at the geographic level and the hypothesis behind this is simply that the reduction in the appellate allowance rate reduced firm revenues for the big law firms these firms turn to new revenue sources um and entered the market for initial initial applicants not all not only the big law firms were affected of course but there were also many many many many more much smaller law firms that were also affected by these changes and so we're going to construct so-called market instruments that capture the shape of the existing market for representatives at the appellate level by area year and essentially what the instrument does is that applicants who are living in areas with greater disability law firm presence in appellate cases they're more likely to enlist reps for their initial filing due to local advertising or word of mouth so if you live in an area where there has been more appellate activity more advertising more people using representatives for their appellate cases people filing new initial claims will be more likely to enlist a representative that's the instrumental variable so um we do have a a paper um produced on the nbr website that has a lot more information about the research design and all the validity tests so i'll just give you a summary of the results the um these are our main estimates um they are our instrumental variables estimates and um our first main finding is that initial representation leads to a 23 percentage point increase in the initial allowance rate we also that's column one here in um in the table we also find that there is a sharp large reduction of about 45 percentage points in the appellate um the probability that there is an appellate hearing and a reduction in processing time of nearly a year this is 316 days so in other words cases are more likely to be allowed initially they don't go to hearing to an appellate hearing quite as often and this leads to a pretty dramatic reduction in processing time importantly we find no no statistically significant effect on the probability of final allowance so it isn't as if representatives are allowed getting cases allowed that otherwise wouldn't be allowed it's just they're getting them allowed at the initial level instead of the final appellate appellate level we find this also quite intriguing 10-point increase in the probability of initial denial for insufficient evidence and our best theory for this is that perhaps this represents representatives um um um essentially kind of cutting their losses on cases that have either a weak evidence base or perhaps where medical records are not sufficient or can't can't be obtained now we looked at um we looked at mechanisms and the primary mechanism for the increase in the probability of initial allowance appears to be that representatives succeed in getting people who meet the listings qualified on that basis and so of this 23.2 percentage point increase in the probability of initial allowance 19.7 almost all of that is due to an increase in the probability of initial allowance for meeting listings there is a non-statistically significant increase in medical vocational allowances so these two coefficients mechanically have to add up to the total so you can see that 19.7 on 23.2 means that virtually all of this effect is from from cases um reps getting cases to uh to uh better better aligned with the regulatory criteria and qualified on on that basis now we also find some improvements that may re represent improvements in efficiency so claims are more likely to be electronically filed we see a dramatic 41.6 percentage point increase in electronic filing from representatives we also looked at processing time now i i told you that there is this overall reduction of nearly a year in total processing time but there were many allegations about reps intentionally slowing cases down at the field office or at the dds so we wanted to look at that specifically and that's what you're seeing here over in this right panel we find really no evidence of case slowdowns at the field office or or at the dds so these are are positive but not statistically significant what we do find however is there is a sizable increase by 31.3 percentage points in the likelihood that a case has back pay now that's not coming however from increases in processing times it's coming from representatives succeeding and getting more favorable that is more distant onset dates for their for their clients so um to wrap up um we do find that representation i'm right on schedule improves case outcomes on the margin um we find increases in initial awards for medical listings fewer appeals shorter times to decision and no effect at all on final allowances our estimates do imply that initial representation helps cases get to the right decision earlier and um another implication of these results is that representation in initial claims has been inefficiently low there are large benefits for claimants small costs for claimants substantial cost savings for ssa and um the current contingency fee structure of for representative pay really does encourage reps to be overly selective to minimize effort and our results do suggest that the optimal fee is is quite a bit higher than the current fee for for many applicants with that i'll conclude thank you thanks so much nicole thank you to our entire panel you know this was really terrific right from our perspective not only did we use important new data did we ask important questions methodologically advanced questions but these are really very practical questions for us running the agency in an organization and so i really um greatly value and appreciate all of these papers there are some questions that have come in in the q a and so i encourage people online to take a look at the q a you can see those that are answered and as they are answered by our panelists those they will appear um but as people are sort of thinking and looking and working their way through that there are a couple of others that have come in that i'll just sort of start with um uh italo i'll start with a question for you were there um and are i guess how heterogeneous are requirements of work across different occupations as you were sort of looking at that and you know we're talking we talk in in summary and aggregate but did you find anything that would that would be um of interest to us as we as we kind of dig into these questions so um yeah we find we find a large degree of heterogeneity of occupational requirements uh across occupations is that your question across occupations or yeah yeah there's a lot of large degree of authority united across occupations and actually our four indexes showed like a high degree of i mean a high variance and uh depending on on the occupation so but some someone asked me in the chat as well like what can we say about like for what we can infer from specific job requirements right and then yes we do identify we do identify that there are some job particular job requirements that are more important than others in explaining these disassociations with the with the labor market outcomes and and i don't know for example like low postures in physical physical job demands low posture seems to be terribly important you know to explain whether people work work more or less and uh but in terms of the mental requirements right symptomatic requirements like the ability of i mean whether to supervise others but you are supervised right it's like also very important in order to explain these disassociations but others like um like um like working with public you know it's it doesn't seem this does seem to be like that that that that so important i don't know if that answers your question but it's we do find we do find a large tv of heterogeneity and we do find i think now i realize that part of the part of the paper we're going to be analyzing these things also some of these things also individually right because if we want to uh talk about specific talk about specific or potential policies or interventions that we can implement in order to shed light of what can be done to uh encourage workers to deliver retirement right we also need to look at the specific uh job requirements because the elasticity so how they i suspect the elasticities of how they relate to to labor market outcomes might be very different across them even within a single dimension thank you very much um nicole i have a question for you too um do do all people benefit from representation in the same way right or or does do impairments differ or things that you know that we see in in differences in the in the in the program so you're kind of hearing a a thread of interest of mine right the different people that we serve yeah i mean it's it's a it's a great question and and we did look at that and we found exceptionally large gains for people with mental health diagnoses we find almost no benefit at all for people with back or musculoskeletal impairments so in fact there is a very very large um even larger than the average effect increase in the initial allowance rate for people with mental health diagnoses especially if they would qualify um you know under the listings but not exclusively so and really there's very little gain to initial representation for people um people with back or musculoskeletal problems and you know it's it's not that representatives you know do harm to them we find really you know no effect on on their chances certainly no reduction in their chances of initial allowance um but what what happens is once you have initial representation um your chances of then the representative taking you on for appeal go down by quite a lot and we think this is because simply the representative has learned quite a bit about you know the quality of the case and the signal that's been extracted from from ssa through the initial review process is actually a better signal because the representative has had a chance to to to craft the case great thank you very much um stephanie a question for you could you walk us through eligibility for the accommodation um programs and just a take more detail [Music] sure um so the first one the employer at injury program is um the largest it's it's kind of i guess maybe the most important to think about eligibility so these are workers who they need to have some kind of residual impairment so they can't go back immediately to the type of work they did before but maybe could do something transitional so that's one important component of eligibility a second is that they need to they need to be at the employer where the injury occurred so it's kind of the employer same employer who has the incentive to provide those opportunities for this worker to return earlier than they would otherwise those workers still have to have an open workers compensation claim while they're participating in their transitional work as well so there is this this kind of three-way connection between the worker the employer and then the program itself um that all need to come together so yeah thank you um again i'm going to encourage people if you asked a question check back into the q a because our panel they are working feverishly to answer your questions um we want to sort of reduce duplication between between spoken and written questions so check back for the the q a they're terrific questions coming in from folks in in the audience as well so um i'm going to wrap us up and head us off into a break people have been uh waiting patiently again thank you to our panel it was really terrific and practical and important for our program so thank you all enjoy the rest of the afternoon
