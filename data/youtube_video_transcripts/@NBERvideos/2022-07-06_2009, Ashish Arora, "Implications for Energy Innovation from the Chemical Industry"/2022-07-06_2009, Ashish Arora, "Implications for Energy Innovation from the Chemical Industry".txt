[Applause] okay i'd like to introduce professor ashish aurora from carnegie mellon university from duke oh sorry from duke university who will be talking about the chemical industry and i'm looking for your slide here you're here right maybe lessons that's lessons from the internet no accelerating is the end of it how about this one yes got it there we go good morning thank you very much um as rebecca's introduction indicated i've recently changed employers right so the chemical industry and i'm mostly going to be talking about the from the history of the industry rather than the more recent developments but i think it i hope you'll you'll see that it's it's of use the first thing to note is the chemical industry grew came of age at a very different time when when large-scale government involvement in the economy was was definitely the exception rather than the norm um despite that and in in this sense it's it's sort of an exception to what brian just said if you see this is the chart from 1971 nsf figures this is the share in of basic it shows you two things and i'll summarize what it shows in the interest of time it shows that the chemical industry was extremely r d intensive and it funded most of this research through private dollars okay so at this point we could sort of since this is about mostly about public policy we we might want to stop and say well there's not not a great deal to be learned but in fact i would submit to you there are some very interesting things that we can learn from this there is one prominent instance where the government intervened very heavily in in innovation and this was the synthetic rubber project during the second world war around 1941 there's about 10 000 tons of synthetic rubber being produced in america and there's this very real fear that america will be cut off from from the supplies of natural rubber so the primary objective in some ways resembling well not with the same we don't quite have the same urgency but there's the sense that we needed to increase at that time there was a very clear sense that we needed to increase the supplies of of production of synthetic rubber there was a public private academic partnership set up uh lots of uh firms were involved in this both rubber farms petrochemical firms university departments um and this was then extended after world war ii this program in some ways was a smashing success so the output of synthetic rubber increased 85 times which isn't quite incredible seven times peak german production and mind you this was using german technology this technology essentially had been uh was was ready for prime time this was the butadiene styrene technology so it succeeded in his primary objective which was to increase the supplies of of synthetic rubber it had a couple of subsidiary objectives uh which was uh improvements in in polymer science and improvements in quality and there the success was much less pronounced in particular if you think about contributions to polymer science uh observers of this program uh have concluded that uh the the contribution was modest as at at best right most there were significant improvements at this time most of them came from sources that were outside the program the conclusion i guess at least i draw from this is programs that are about increasing supplies are very different from programs that are about increasing increasing knowledge about increasing innovation and we must not confuse them right the second point that dr conan mentioned is this idea that change comes very slowly and this is the chart of how fiber synthetic fibers have diffused and the top blue line here is cotton and this purplish line here is synthetic man-made fibers of all kinds and this this only you know you can see this is about uh 80 100 year period a century old and this it takes 70 years before man-made fibers overtake cotton and professor coonan um basically laid out the reasons why this is so and it's just worth emphasizing that this is a general tendency of all producer goods anything that gets used as an input in somebody else's production tends to have this this property there is an interesting exception which i want to talk to you about which is the switch from coal to oil as a feedstock in the chemical industry i don't know if you can read any of this stuff here so let me just read it out for you in 1950 well actually in 1938 when when nylon is discovered and dupont trumpets the introduction of nylon it is made from coal air and water not petroleum air and water as it eventually will actually be made that's that's the central role that coal played in chemical production not as an energy source but as an input in a short decade things changed quite dramatically so 1950 50 of us organic chemical output was based on natural gas and oil by 1966 one and a half decades 88 the change is even more dramatic in europe for obvious reasons in 1949 only nine percent of british organic chemical output was based on gas and oil in 1962 it's 63 percent the first petrochemical plant in germany takes is started in 1950s by 1973 90 of organic chemical output is oil based right so this was a fairly dramatic change it takes about a decade and a half or two decades um and the remarkable part is there was very little government intervention in this in other words no government mandated this there was there was no large-scale government subsidies to some extent this tells you that the point that rebecca made earlier when you have a clear demand and this it's seen as going to be persistent private sector will respond and will make these large scale changes now there were some other things that happened alongside this required major developments and advances in in technology uh it required a very significant diffusion of this technology and this diffusion too in contrast to the uh to to what brian presented about agriculture was mediated by markets by uh profit oriented firms and that's what i want to get to next um this picture here is a picture of an oil refinery in india in jamnagar in 1997 which took place with almost no comment in the world press by mark contrast when a company introduced a small car in india it was on the front pages of new york times and the wall street journal what's remarkable about this this refinery it was the biggest refinery in the world the biggest grassroots refinery in the world built at a cost of 6 billion then and has been expanded capacity has been doubled it's now uh 12 billion dollar cost it made india for the first time a net exporter of gasoline believe it or not but that's not the most interesting part the two parts i want you to focus on first that it happened without comment okay you might say well refining his book is boring so is car technology the the internal combustion engine is is about as old as as refining if not older okay the fact that it should happen without comment tells you we take it for granted yes this this technology is a commodity listed here are the key key technology suppliers let me read out backtel blue and sorry black and v tech dow global foster wheeler eop criterion catalyst stone and webster baby power gas it's a market you can buy this stuff by contrast think of how what it is like in in automobiles tata had to develop more or less a lot of its technology internally this tells you what a difference it makes if there is a market or if there is not okay i won't belabor this chart but this tells you where what the sources of technology and engineering expertise are for plants globally petrochem chemical plants globally all over the world in 18 18 18 19 18 1990 a very large fraction of the technology is sourced externally and can be purchased on a market that's the takeaway i want you to i want to take you want you to take away from this put differently much of the diffusion of petrochemical technologies in the world has taken place through markets and these technologies are being actively sold by profit-oriented firms both large and small right so that's the last part of my presentation now which is coming to so what what made this possible rebecca had highlighted these three things so but i just want to exemplify them these sefs that you see here are specialized engineering firms these are engineering contractors whose business is to supply technologies for chemical plants free sometimes they also develop new technologies and offer them for license in other cases they act as agents for the original innovator the first and this is a sort of a summary of what what my research has shown in the research of others the first takeaway is that these kinds of markets flourish this sort of market for technology flourishes when you've got vigorous competition in the downstream product market the best way to to illustrate it this is with a story of uop most of you don't know but the largest the most important source of refining technology over the last century has been a company called universal oil products so the company outside chicago when this company started it was competing with standard oil right and so this company's business model was it was the technology supply to the independents now without vigorous antitrust there would not have been any independent refiners in america there would not have been a market for uop we would have missed some of the most important uh advances in refining technology without eop so the first thing is you need competitive product markets if you want this kind of competition in or if you want this vigorous technology market second and you may have missed this when you have these kinds of companies like uop one thing fundamentally changes with for the product companies themselves oil companies have been remarkably open in terms of licensing their own technology bp shell and even exxon have vigorous licensing programs for their technology one reason is if they don't somebody else will you can no longer keep this keep this held because there's now a market out there so this that's what this chart shows this shot shows when you have these scfs or independent contractors active and licensing then the incumbent producers the chemical and the petrochemical firms are also active in licensing their technologies a related point to this again i'll go back to the history is therefore you need to think about antitrust not just in the product market but also in the technology markets and the the us department of justice and the ftc with rich gilbert and others have been very active in this aspect of it and making sure that we don't get monopolies up in in the technology market as well finally this goes back to ip patent protection appears not to have hurt a very robust market for technology diffusion in the chemical industry in particular these specialists these technology specialists do well when they have patent protection in fact they require patent protection to compete against the large established companies that's my last slide so this on the first column you have what i think are the main takeaways from the history itself which is this is an example of an industry which was the first science-based industry this was the first time we had the systematic application of science for economic purposes to design new materials starting with synthetic dyes and then moving on that despite this strong science-based character this was funded largely by private and private funds government support for basic research was an exception rather than the rule one reason why this was so because there was a very clear route from science to dollars or from science to being able to make money and there was significant increase in demand so i didn't i didn't get to talk about this because i wanted to move through but you know for example in the 1920s and 1930s the growth of the automobile had a significant uh effect in encouraging investments in refining technologies in new types of plastics lacquers finishes that kind of stuff and not only has this industry relied on private dollars for innovation it's also relied on the market for diffusing these innovations universities have played a very important role but for the most part it's been in institutionalizing the disciplines the knowledge and in training people rather than as an active source of new new technologies what are the implications that we see from the history for energy innovation and i don't want to over claim or let me let me sort of qualify these i've overstated them in the interest of being clear as george orwell once said it's better to be clear and wrong than to mumble so i'm going to be i'm going to be trying to be clear and wrong um which is this it suggests government programs are much better at coordinating large-scale production when the technology exists than in bringing forth radically new technologies that support for the demand for new for new technologies is probably much more effective or is is at least as important as trying to subsidize the creation of new technologies and third we should not neglect diffusion it does no good to have new technologies if they are not widely deployed for either of the two objectives and in this i would recommend to you that uh comparative markets both in the product space and in the technology space are very important thank you [Applause] does anyone have questions yes i'm philip webber congressional budget office on your table of the specific technology the specific technologies that were the big share by the independent firms in the non-independent firms air separation was uh really different the reason i am asking this is that a carbon capture and sequestration one of the biggest cost elements is the separation of the co2 and it's very inefficient now and very low what are the factors that uh make that uh the in-house rather the sef role so low for the air separation technology so it's a it's a good question my sense is one reason the share is low is because the producers have been very active in licensing their technologies air products boc linde these were all very active in in licensing out their own technology and i think at least they actually actively had business models where they would help you engineer their plants so there was less of a scope i think for independent suppliers for plant design so the the the producers were also doing this as a business david mitch from university of maryland baltimore county i'm just struck by the contrast with the the previous presentation in terms of uh private versus government and i'm not sure i'm completely clear on on why the chemical industry might have been different than agriculture you know we're wondering if you could comment more on that um i well just i think probably rebecca did it deliberately to heighten the contrast and perhaps i'm overplaying my my hand in some sense um but again i think the chemical industry came of age in the 1870s where you know there was no other choice and so we might be seeing a kind of selection effect and moreover you know starting starting right then the german chemical companies that first started investing in in-house r d managed to realize very significant gains from that and therefore that business model where you invested in r d and and you made money uh perhaps got institutionalized and in america this it took a very significant anti-trust action against dupont before the trustees of the people who running dupont were convinced that the only way they could grow was through creating new products and materials and businesses they could not grow in their existing domains and so in some sense and this was a decision that i think serendipitously happened to be right the other big chemical company in 1920s was ilite chemicals most of you have not heard of them they were the second biggest chemical company they chose not to do that and the consequences were well what you know right i think uh also to look at chemicals you need to look back into the early part of the 19th century the development of aniline dies in the quest for a replacement for quinine in anti-malarials yes in in united kingdom which wasn't supported by the united kingdom uh industrial sector so it went to the academics in germany to develop applied technologies in german universities maybe in around the 1840s and then that became the foundation for the german chemical sector which then went on to dominate the world so much that in the 1920s and 30s for example when an american company got the patent for aspirin part of war reparations it couldn't actually develop the technology until it imported uh experts from germany to show them how to do it over about a decade so i think that it's partly the fact that the needed technology was developed way earlier than the 1870s and we're seeing now the application of technology going on today [Applause]
