so we've long wondered what would happen if interest rates hit the zero bound and now we know the answer basically nothing now that that's a surprising answer uh because our theories predicted big events uh old keynesian adaptive expectations models predicted that a deflation spiral would break out at the zero bound the zero bound is like an interest rate peg unstable it's like the ball on the seal's nose the taylor rule usually fixes that instability if the fed moves interest rates more than one for one with inflation the same way the seal moves his nose under the ball then the fed can stabilize inflation but when the interest rate can't move anymore as happens at the zero bound then the inflation or deflation spirals away and the ball falls off the seal's nose here's a more serious illustration this is a simple adaptive expectations model there's a static is curve at the bottom a phillips curve and a taylor rule with a zero bound constraint so when when you hit this with an is shock that's vr the inflation in red starts to go down interest rates in blue start to go down faster following a taylor rule to stop the disinflation but then interest rates at zero and the deflation spirals out of control new keynesian rational expectations models here inflation is stable at the zero bound but new keynesian models are indeterminate the interest rate ties down expected inflation but then actual inflation can add any arbitrary iid shock or sunspot in these models the taylor rule or the taylor principle picks one equilibrium but when the taylor principle can't work at the zero bound new keynesian models predict that you'll have sun spots multiple self-confirming equilibria and inflation becomes more volatile this is a core prediction of new keynesian thought clarity gollian gertler wrote perhaps the most important empirical paper in this literature inflation in the 1970s was volatile because passive policy led to self-confirming volatility inflation became quiet in the 1980s because of active policy for 20 years a vast new keynesian liquidity trap literature has predicted that the zero bound would generate sunspot volatility so if you throw away the prediction that passive policy leads to volatility you have to throw away the theory's central empirical success and in 20 years of its work as well monetarism uh i represented here by milton friedman's license plate mv equals py remains surprisingly strong in commentary though it's mostly vanished in academia in this view the zero bound is not really relevant but raising the monetary base by three trillion dollars should cause a hyperinflation but there was no spiral there was no volatility there was no hyperinflation inflation has the same pattern in this business cycle that's in red than it did in the last one if anything inflation is slightly less volatile now qe uh illustrated by reserves in black had no visible impact on inflation uh here's unemployment gdp gdp growth may be too low but if it's anything less volatile than before unemployment came down if anything a little quicker than before there's nothing here to suggest that the zero bound introduces more volatility or it's an important state variable for economic dynamics at all japan japan's been at it for 20 years excuse me it would have been quite sensible in 2001 to think that we were starting a deflation spiral but then nothing happened europe says the same pattern and intriguingly even lower interest rates corresponding to even lower inflation now so in sum we've learned that inflation can be stable and quiet at a persistent zero bound and that huge excess reserves paying market interest aren't inflationary it's a pretty clear implication the theories that predicted big events at the zero bound are wrong like the famous michaelson morley experiment which showed that the speed of light is the same in all directions despite the earth's motion quiet in the face of strong predictions is a telling experiment fortunately we already have another theory if you add the fiscal theory of the price level to the rational expectations new keynesian model you get a theory in which inflation can be stable now determinate and hence quiet at the zero bound and in which arbitrary open market operations can be irrelevant let me show you how i start with the the fiscal theory equation stating that the real value of nominal debt is the present value of primary surpluses second equation move the dates forward one period multiply and divide by pt and take innovations now you get that equation unexpected inflation corresponds to revisions in the present value of future primary surpluses so so for example suppose that there's an unexpected deflation well now nominal debt is worth more that can only happen if people expect higher surpluses to pay off that unexpected gift to bondholders if they don't then people try to get rid of overvalued government bonds that raises aggregate demand and it reverses the deflation so you see the fiscal theory can solve the indeterminacy problem of new keynesian models it disallows the old keynesian spiral and it can determine the price level independently of the split of government debt between bonds and reserves it's the only pre-existing simple economic theory consistent with the quiet zero bound and we don't have to happen sort of previewing larry here a big fiscal theory debate to use this result these equations hold in every single model if there's no change in long-term fiscal expectations whether achieved actively passively endogenously exogenously or whatever there can't be an unexpected inflation or deflation now as you may have noticed the paper is really long it's long to answer about half of the questions and objections i'm sure you have already and this slide is deliberately illegibly dense to give you a sense but let me just give you a sampling maybe the economy really is unstable after all but the fed skillfully offset the deflationary spiral with hyperinflationary quantitative easing maybe expected future active policy can cut off multiple equilibria in a way that it didn't in the 1970s maybe nobody expected the zero bound to last so taylor principal selection it was still working all along maybe we can modify the theories so that stability at the zero bound doesn't imply stability at an interest rate peg and so on and so on i answer most of these but the main point is these are all possible but complex x post patches and they start to look a lot like epicycles and etherdrift and here comes my second author occam maybe it's time to take occam's advice and just use the really simple answer sitting on the plate before us you also likely have objections to the fiscal theory what about japan what about the 1950s what about the 70s and the 80s why are fiscal expectations so stable right now the paper addresses many of these as well but again the main point i only claim that fiscal theory and new keynesian model is possible that it can account for this quiet zero bound in a way that the existing theories really can't i don't claim it's proved no theory is ever proved and i certainly don't claim that it accounts for every other period in history as well now second point if inflation really is stable an uncomfortable implication follows it means that raising interest rates must eventually raise inflation as i show you in the left-hand graph this is the third my third author fischer it's a form of long-run neutrality under interest rate targets but it's still possible that raising interest rates could temporarily lower inflation as i show you in the bottom right so is there a simple modern economic model all the adjectives matter that produces a temporary decline in inflation on the way to the eventual long-run rise let me start with the frictionless model here i have a rational expectations fisher equation and fiscal policy indexes inflation innovations now pretty much the defining feature of the fed and monetary policy is they cannot change fiscal policy so i'm going to call monetary policy a change in interest rates with no change in fiscal policy and if we do that that kind of interest rate rise this is the green line here all it does is increases inflation one period later in red with no temporary negative effect the purple lines combine a fiscal policy shock with the interest rate rise a fiscal shock again can give you a one shot unexpected inflation or deflation so a joint monetary fiscal contraction can give you a negative inflation on the day the policies announced followed by inflation induced by the higher interest rates that could well account for a lot of observations vars and episodes but it still means that monetary policy alone will just raise interest rates it'll have the same effect well duh you say obviously we need to add ingredients the world isn't frictionless how about sticky prices then higher nominal rates mean higher real rates that lowers aggregate demand that could temporarily low inflation right i hoped so too this was supposed to be a positive paper wrong it turns out here i have an interest rate rise again in green with no fiscal change in the standard new keynesian model set out i put the equation at the bottom sticky prices just smooth out the inflation rise and we still have no temporary decline this result is deeper than pegs and passive policy here are solutions to the standard three equation model with active monetary policy straight out of woodford's book in the bottom right hand corner you see the standard result if there's a transitory monetary policy shock interest rates go down and inflation goes up but in the top row especially the top left inflation and interest rates go up together when there's a persistent monetary policy shock the standard active money equilibrium choice is even more fisherian than the no change in fiscal policy equilibrium choice that one from my last slide it just goes up immediately now let me show you a modification that does work go back to the frictionless case but add long-term debt to the fiscal theory part now a persistent rise in interest rates lowers long-term bond prices q in the equation b is predetermined s doesn't change by assumption that's what monetary policy is so the price level p must jump down on the left-hand side higher interest rates still mean higher inflation as before but now you get a one-period price level drop you get the temporary deflation that we've been looking for bond prices are driven by expected future interest rates so it's the forward guidance part that matters not the current interest rate and so here i graphed an interest rate rise announced three periods in advance to show you that point as well now this isn't our goal this is a frictionless model our goal is to mix fiscal theory and sticky prices so here i plotted the effects of an unexpected interest rate rise with sticky prices again no fiscal shock and long-term debt now and i calibrated the maturity structure to match us data there's way too many lines on this graph because they make a lot of points in the paper but for now just look at the solid red line which shows you the path of inflation one percent higher interest rates leads to one percent one half percent lower inflation and that eventually uh melts away lots more in the paper on this model but is this the answer in its favor this mechanism unites quantitative easing forward guidance and interest rate policy the paper describes the quantitative easing effect i'll spare you a slide of equations on it and it doesn't need any monetary frictions or pricing frictions to do it however it only works if and when the fed surprises markets so like lucas non-neutrality you can't use it for systematic policy and persistently higher rates eventually mean higher not lower inflation so it could be a story for the 1970s but on its own not the conventional view of the 1980s you need joint monetary fiscal policy for that most of all this is absolutely nothing like any story you ever told to undergraduates or fomc members about why higher interest rates might lower inflation so it's the answer but not the answer to every question now here too the paper goes on and on to suggest that no other simple economic models give the desired result i have to survey a lot of models you might say oh just add money it turns out that can't quantitatively explain the past and it certainly can't work for the question at hand how is it how's it going to work going forward with abundant interest paying excess reserves the paper goes on to to address your natural question what about more ingredients you're certainly itching to add ingredients and again i listed a long set of possibilities on the slide that i won't read to you but our objective is to find the minimum necessary not just the sufficient conditions if a quiet zero bound or a negative sign requires a big big blacks blinkback big black box friction for people to act irrational irrationally or specific novel and complex alternatives to rational expectations then we agree there is no simple model economic monitor modern economic model teachable to undergraduates explainable to fomc members that generates the classic belief so that conclusion should at least reduce our confidence in the effect and if we were honest we should do that publicly imagine the fed shares congressional testimony that starts raising interest rates to lower inflation it rests fundamentally on people acting stupidly and us exploiting that or well sorry congress people there's no story i can tell you about why without a lot of equations and frictions about why raising interest rates lowers inflation now yeah here i i absolutely do not argue that we should stop with simple models of frictionless models there are pricing frictions monetary frictions real and financial frictions just like regular economics we should and we we now can start with basic frictionless supply and demand to get the general signs and stability right and then add frictions to understand magnitudes and dynamics so summary the evidence and simple theory suggests that inflation can be stable and quiet at the zero bound and therefore under a peg or passive policy and that large interest paying reserves are not inflationary even though these statements overturn long-standing contrary doctrines stability implies that persistently higher rates mean eventually higher inflation and your faith in a stable exploitable negative short-run relationship i hope is at least a little weakened so let me draw some some obvious policy implications most of all we should get over an inordinate fear of the zero bound and a large balance sheet we can if we want to live the friedman role perpetually low nominal rates and liquidity satiation in interest bearing reserves there is no need to keep bonds artificially illiquid in order to have price level control another long-standing doctrine bites the dust the optimal quantity of money is a lot that was supposed to be a joke the the constant interest rate peg however that's not necessarily optimal if you have a constant low rate that means that variations in the real rate have to be accommodated by endogenous variation inflation and therefore possibly output the fed can well also adjust nominal interest rates corresponding to its idea of the natural real rate and that would stabilize inflation and with sticky prices output as well if like me you're dubious about the fed's ability to define the natural rate stability opens another option the fed could target inflation expectations directly by targeting the spread between index and non-indexed debt and let the level of the real rays rise and fall by market forces or the fed can still diagnose and offset all sorts of shocks try to fine-tune dynamics with a complex dsg model as well the old argument that fi about fine-tuning discretion versus simple rules that really isn't about long-run stability and neutrality and and can go on there's the old argument about what the fed should do that's also supposed to be a joke so observed monetary policy need not change that that much from a tailor-ish rule following output and inflation with temporary responses to other shocks at most the possibility of a peg makes the case for leaving things alone to settle down on their own a little bit stronger the lesson is more about foundations how we think about policy structure price level determination anchoring grand strategy how to avoid and combat another inflation and the long run choice of long run targets and balance sheet so i close here and yes i am closing with two warnings this line of work is already cited in turkey and brazil to suggest that countries with high inflation can just easily and painlessly lower interest rates despite poor fiscal policies no that conclusion does not follow to lower inflation the interest rate change has to be very long lasting credible and must come with fiscal backing all of the historically successful disinflations that combined lower interest rates with lower inflation combined fiscal and monetary reform many attempted interest rate pegs failed from a lack of fiscal balance our flight to government debt came before and not after our lower interest rates second the fiscal perspective recognizes that anchoring quiet inflation comes from a stable real value of the government debt that stable real value must come from a belief in abundant future surpluses or from a low discount rate right now the low discount rate seems like the much more plausible option but low discount rates can change quickly and a small loss of faith in surpluses can be amplified by a higher discount rate that's what happened in greece so inflation anchoring could varnish quickly and apparently mysteriously having nothing to do with central bank actions and then no quantitative easing or other intervention would stop it thank you
