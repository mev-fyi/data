thank you very much to grenados for including my paper in the program I'm uh very happy to present my paper titled cooler dimensions and as the pricing so my paper starts from uh two stylus back documented uh by Recent research first uh financial markets appear to be surprisingly priced in elastic when and when asset demand is not that much sensitive to uh prices then Dimensions can have very large bags on asset prices um and according to question Yogo demand shocks uh seem very important in explaining as the prices they show that latent demand shocks explain up to 81 of the total stock return volatility the cross-section I recall they call this they call these demand shocks latent demand shocks because we do not observe why this demand shocks arise in the first place so here comes my paper so my paper has two contributions the first contribution is to identify a strong driver of correlated demand shocks arising from benchmarking so by benchmarking I mean active Equity institution investors common incentive to outperform the stock market index such as the s p 500. and I show that the resulting correlated demand shocks uh increase Stock's Market risk and surprising the application of Market risk is strongly priced so what I mean what do I mean by benchmarking my paper starts from a simple observation that many execution investors have a similar market index to it such as the s p 500. just to give a concrete number in the estimator from space more than 60 percent of the fund managers at the S P 500 indexes are Benchmark and if you think about roster industrial we're also investors the number gets even bigger it's a very common incentive for active fund managers to outperform the stock market in the key inside of my paper is about like asking these questions so I asked those benchmarking induces activities institutional investors to trade assets in a similar manner and I find the answer is yes and I find that this incentive generates procyclical risk-taking Behavior among active fund managers by procyclical I mean they tend to exert buying pressure for stocks and the stock market is rising and they do the opposite when the stock market Has Fallen and notice that because the direction of the stock trading coincides with the direction of the stock market movements I find that the resulting quality trades from these investors amplify stocks Market exposures and here that here are my main findings on my paper so I find that in a cross-section stocks with high exposure to create men from benchmarking uh have higher Market betas and risk Premiere than those stocks with low exposure to demand shops because of the application of Market risk and the economic magnitude is quite sizable because industrial portfolios foreign stocks based on their differential exposure to demand shocks I find the annual return premium about 8.5 percent okay and this risk materializes during bad times such as in the global finds a crisis of 2008 because the stock is very high exposure to currently demand from benchmarking experience sharp price crashes that are associated with massive selling pressures from their institutional stockholders to start out uh talk about the mechanism because it's not entirely clear why benchmarking generates for cyclical risking Behavior to explain the mechanism I start from this fact you all know that active fund managers struggle to beat the stock market but what is really interesting is about the time series they actually struggle more and the stock market is performing better meaning that when their Benchmark is performing better so here the y-axis is a fraction of underperforming funds and the access is a contemporaneous stock market returns you can see there's a strong positive relationship between the two and when the stock market is doing well typically more than 60 percent of the fund managers struggle to beat their Benchmark and here's an anecdote to evidence you know I think that you have 2021 the stock market performs spectacularly however according to this news article about 6 85 percent of active fund managers couldn't beat the S P 500 so they're under pressure to improve their phone performance because otherwise investors will be disappointed so I'll just do a Simple Start experiment so suppose I'm a fund manager who is in the same situation basically stock market is going up but my fund performance is lagging then I gotta find a way to improve my phone performance because otherwise investors will be disappointed and this exchange and creates a strategic incentive for me as a farm manager to increase the riskiness of my fund because by increasing the riskiness I might have a chance for riskerection and here are the things I would do as a fund manager so I typically hold some cash just to be ready for unexpected outflows but now I want to give up on this liquidity management because I'm under pressure to improve my phone performance so I'll rather decrease my cash Holdings to buy more stocks so that my portfolio has a higher Market exposure if I'm out of cash if I don't have a leverage constraint I may even lever out my portfolio but if I have a leverage constraint I'll probably tilt toward riskier soft such as high beta stocks the bottom line is that when the stock market is doing well because a lot of active fund managers underperform as a group they systematically increase the risk of funds at the same time by buying more stocks that have a higher Market exposure at the same time and this risk-taking strategy will just work fine on average because having a higher Market exposure means a higher risk premium on average from an unlucky fund manager in the sense that after increasing the market exposure on my portfolio the stock market subsequently crashes unexpectedly then until I'm into a real problem because investors will be immediately disappointed and they will throw their investment but remember I increase the equity exposure of my portfolio by decreasing my decreasing my cash Holdings which means that I have I don't have enough cash buffer to deal with this large outflows so as a fund manager I'm likely to become a nest stock seller because I have to deal with this largely damage and the bottom line of this thought experiment is that active institution investors demand for stocks is likely to positively Co vary with the direction of the stock market movements potentially amplifying stocks Market exposures and the empirical evidence is consistent with the notion of prosecutor risk-taking behavior these are active mutual funds and you can see that when the stock market is performing well as they underperform they tend to decrease their cash Holdings if they tend to be a Net stock buyer during the custom market performance and this is consistent with the notion of a prosecutive heuristic in Behavior to catch up with the market performance so given this risk-taking behavior that varies across time now I'll think about the cross-sections so now I'll think about which stocks are highly exposed to these forces given this behavior is taking that varies over time to answer this question I will develop a simple model and the goal is to understand cross-sectional variation exposure to query design shocks and I would I want to do it in a very simple manner so I'll develop a very stylish model but it will be very useful because it will guide my empirical work in a simple manner specifically in the model bonds will buy when the stock market is rising they will do the do the opposite and the stock market has fallen for some known exogenous reason I will also show in the paper uh that the same economic forces can arrive endogenously due to benchmarking building on a more realistic model uh based on bicycle 2013 AR but this model is empirically less extractable so I'll work at the simple model instead so in this world there are multiple stocks index by K and they're active multiple active form managers indexed by eye and it's fun we'll adjust it it's Equity exposure over time here Delta a is net dollar purchases or sales of stocks at the fund level and the denominator is the electron AUM so again for example if I'm form manager and if I underperform I will increase the risking of my portfolio by buying more stocks to catch up with the market performance and in that case Delta a will be positive at the fund level and the given the average the early evidence I showed you our potentially model the direction of the stock trading as a function of contemporaneous stock market returns as in equation number one so here Theta is a parameter to be estimated which turns out to be positive and this is consistent with the notion of prosecutive risk-taking behavior and again Delta a here is net dollar purchases of sales of stocks at the fund level and given this quantity what one will do is it will distribute this amount according to okay stocks according to a predetermined wave function called pi so let's say for example Delta a is hundred dollars but this morning let's say I buy 40 amount of stock a and sixty dollar amount of Stock B the sum is the hundred dollars then the weight will be 40 for stock a and sixty percent for stock fee okay so the sum of a should be equal to one and in this case the dollar flow to ask the K due to fund ice trade will be Delta a times pi and I model pi as follows it will be a function of a portfolio weight and Lambda is another parameter to be estimated and S is the ownership ratio of a fund so basically how many how many shares the fund hold divided by the total number of shares outstanding to understand equation number two it's useful to think about a special case where Lambda is equal to zero in that case the a function is simply equal to portfolio weight meaning that whenever funds adjust their equal to exposures about time they will either scale up or scale down their investment in proportion to their current portfolio rates however with positive Lambda what I have in mind is the possibility that large funds internalize the price impact of their own trades okay so to give your intuition I found it useful to think about a rather extreme real world example so early 2021 uh art fund was in trouble because of the poor poor uh performance it experienced an outflow of about 2.7 percent in a single week the case you would have to find a way to deal with this large uh disappointment so she had to sell some of her stock Holdings and look at the stock called cgn its portfolio weight The Arc fund's portfolio rate is not that big is about 0.5 percent but the funds ownership ratio is nearly 30 percent so this used article tells us that if Kathy Wood had distributed this outflow simply according to the portfolio weight then the fund would have generated a large selling pressure for this stock so going back to this equation number two then will be cautious in trading stocks that she heavily owns meaning she'll have this positive Lambda she will tend to decrease the size of the trace Trying to minimize the price and pick her own fund creates and this Lambda will turn out to be strongly positive in estimation with the structures I end up with the nice model implied in dozens Market exposure the model tells me that market exposures are positive function in what is on the record side here it'll be a fun some of all the funds Trace so again each term is as follows the first component is expected amount of equity adjustments over time and the fund will distribute this amount according to the predetermined wave function so if you multiply this two it'll be a net it will be a dollar flow into Assa K due to fonsi ice trade and if you sum this quantity over all the funds it'll be a net dollar flow into Sak due to all the funds phrase in the resulting amount is large relative to the stock market value it'll move prices so there will be a price impact which will affect Market betas again because the direction of active fund stock trading will coincide with the direction of the market movements I work at this modern part exposure as well as empirical proxy which is the number of institution owners so basically how many funds are holding a stock this is a very nice nice proxy for the model implied exposure because having a higher institutional owners means that the stock is exposed to correlated demand shocks from even more funds more importantly at the same time having a higher institutional owners means that the ownership structure is highly dispersed meaning that each owner is small so they're not particularly concerned about the present pick of their own Trace however when they whenever they adjust their Equity exposure over time they'll be relatively more aggressive in trading these stocks so the wave function will be relatively higher across all the funds so we'll generate a larger price and pack as a result so the model tells me that betas are a positive function in what is on the right hand side model for exposure and this empirical proxy so I'll run a following regression as follows so this is stock quarter level following effect regression and why variable is a Stock's Market exposure as captured by market beta and you can see that there's a positive relationship between Market exposure and stock exposure to correlated demand from benchmarking and the economic magnitude is sizable because if you look at the third column on interquartile range increase in modern plot exposure leads to a higher Market beta of 0.35 which is very big and given this evidence on Market beta the next question is about whether this price is a price risk to answer this question I first run a follow-up with regression with the different y variable which is uh future start returns and you can see that stocks exposure to correlated demand from benchmarking is a strong predictor of future stock returns and this return predictability can be also found in portfolio sorts on the top table I store stocks based on the modern plot exposure and you can see that average monthly portfolio returns increase from the bottom to the top tester portfolio and the spread between the top and the bottom as our portfolio is about 57 basis point per month and what is really nice about this table is that returns press are explained by the differences in Market exposures across a portfolio so the spread Market beta between the top and the bottom that's our portfolio is about 0.4 with the empirical proxy I get even a larger spread as well as a larger spread in uh Market beta as well you can see that from the bottom to the top of the portfolio average portfolio returns increase and the spread is even larger 71 basis points per month and all the return spreads are fully explained by the differences in Market betas across a portfolio and you can see that the spread in beta is about 0.5 and this risk does materialize during bad times such as in the global financial crisis of 2008 because the stock with the high exposure to correlated demand from benchmarking experience sharp price crashes which are associated with massive selling pressure someone's among their institutional stockholders you can see the ownership level for the stocks in the top of the portfolio was about 80 percent right before the global financial crisis but the orange level decreases toward below 60 which is a massive correlated selling pressure among those institutional investors and I have uh additional results uh but for the sake of time I'll uh skip this part and I will conclude so my paper starts from an observation again that many active institution investors many active fund managers have a similar market index to beat and I show you that this common incentive generates prosecutorist taking Behavior among them and this forces amplify stocks Market risk and this amplification of Market risk translates into stock price crashes during bad times including Global financial crisis and covid-19 crisis and this this risk commands a risk premium about up to 8.5 per year thank you
