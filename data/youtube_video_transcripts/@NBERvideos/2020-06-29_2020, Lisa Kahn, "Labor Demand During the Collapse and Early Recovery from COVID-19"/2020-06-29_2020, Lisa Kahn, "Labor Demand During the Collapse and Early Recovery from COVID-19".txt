our main goal is to understand the evolution of the labour market in the collapse and now hopefully early recovery from the Kovach crisis so we all know that the economy has been in freefall since mid-march um but typical data sources usually provide little granularity for understanding a range of important questions for instance what are the impact of the state imposed stay at home policies on the economy how have the Kovach crisis impacted across different types of jobs what is the effect of the impact on reopening we're interested in these questions and to some extent we can use traditional data sources to answer these but that's going to be at somewhat of a lag or at much less granularity than we would like so primarily what I'm going to show you today is our analysis of a data set of job vacancy postings collected by burning glass technologies so burning glass scrapes postings that are jobs that are posted to any online website for instance monster.com careerbuilder.com they would also scrape individual employers like the National Bureau of Economic Research who presumably post ads on their website they have proprietary algorithms to code up information content in the job ads and most importantly right now these Java's are available in real-time at a detailed geography industry occupation whatever you like now important to remember a couple things about job postings relative to other data sources so job vacancies are inherently a forward-looking measure of how employers anticipate their hiring meets contrast that was something like initial unemployment insurance claims which are also available at a weekly level and received a great deal of attention those are a backward-looking measure asking essentially what has been going on with layoffs in the recent period so we can learn a lot by contrasting the forward-looking and the backward looking measures so what do we see well the Left panel here is the time series of job vacancy postings in 2020 and what you see despite the fact that vacancy postings are fairly noisy in general you see just this map to plunge in postings beginning in mid-march and bottoming out basically in late April early May where we see a 40% over more than a 40 percent decline in postings over this time period interestingly actually we are seeing in late May and early June posting starting to come back there we see this historic spike that is again beginning to come back down but even just as of the release today we have almost 1.5 million new claims as of last week which is much larger than in any given week we saw in the Great Recession so we're starting to see a little bit of recovery but these historically high initial claims are worrying now with hindsight we actually can compare these series to the more traditional data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which now goes up through mid May the left side shows the Employment series which matches the the plunge of the burning glass data and you're actually starting to see a little bit of an early recovery in the last month this recovery is quite shallow compared to the 13 percent employment drop we saw in March and April and interestingly this recovery is coming a little bit before the big recovery and job vacancy postings and I want to come back and talk about that at the end how we are not yet seeing recovery through market hires and vacancies but hopefully we will and on the right series I'm showing you a series of our a measure of separations that we've been able to calculate using current population survey longitudinally linked data of movements from employment to non employment and that series matches that fairly well and what's neat about that is we're gonna get much more granularity in terms of Industry and occupation compared to the initial claims data although we do have to sacrifice on sample size because it's smaller circuit okay so these are the national trends but what can we learn by going into detail with the burning glass data well first we can look across US states at the timing of when they implemented their stay at home policies so here I'm just dividing States into four groups the darkest line is the earliest closers the dashed lines are states that never close and the lighter colored lines are somewhere in between and the overwhelming impression from this picture is that there was a nationwide collapse that occurred at the same time and roughly the same magnitude across sectors these vertical lines give you an indication of the essentially the week of closing but what we see from these collapses is they really did all happen at the same time and even if there are some small differences in the levels that is trapped trumped by just the general collapse we can look at a number of other data series as well and essentially we see the same thing everybody collapsed small differences perhaps between states and the magnitude of the class but in general everybody collapsed where we actually do see more of a pattern is when we relate the employment collapse and the labor market serious collapses to the early spread of the virus so if we look at how many cases there were in early March basically before state policy had a time to impact either the virus or the labor market we do see these relationships so the the more cases a state had in early March the bigger their eventual drop in postings drop in employment and the bigger their eventual increase in unemployment insurance claims and all of these relationships are statistically significant though we don't want to make too much of that because we have essentially 41 data points that are highly correlated with each other however it does make more sense that it's the actually the virus itself that is potentially driving these labor market trends more so than the state policies for stay-at-home workers now we can also look at the impact the economy across sectors and in particular where interest understanding essential industries versus non-essential industries and pulling out some important patterns so for example the maroon solid line has shown you essential retail essential retail had no collapse whatsoever in fact you see these spikes and vacancy postings at the beginning of the crisis as employers scrambled to to meet the need of people racing to the store to buy their toilet paper and groceries for the other sectors so here I'm going to show you the maroon dash line is non-essential retail like clothing stores and such the red solid line is leisure and hospitality so that's going to include essential industries like restaurants and hotels as well as non-essential industries like movie theatres these two sectors saw the largest collapses which kind of makes sense these are the customer facing types of jobs that people might be worried about going out to consumed in for the other sectors the solid green line or other essential sectors the - green line or other non-essential sectors and the orange line is healthcare which also had a special experience during this crisis for those sectors there's really a very little difference everybody experienced a big decline in vacancy postings at roughly similar magnitudes and actually everybody's vacancy postings are starting to come back and when we compare this to data series on job separations and employment that all looks very similar small differences across industries especially a retail sector was somewhat protected while the customer facing non-essential retail and leisure hospitality were somewhat her hit overwhelmingly almost all industries took a took a large hit interestingly essential retail although its vacancy postings and employment did not collapse workers who were previously an essential retail had a big spike in layoffs and so what that means is that industry in particular was experiencing a great deal of reallocation as employers were scrambling to meet need in particular segments and not other segments um so what does this all mean job vacancy postings and our other data show broad-based synchronous collapse across states what I didn't show you is that we've also looked at postings in our other series in terms of work conditions and in particular is this job one that can be performed from home and there we're using the Dingle and Neiman measures that they have produced and there we see small differences but we see big collapses across the board regardless of whether the your work from home capable and as I've shown you we've seen big collapses across the essential and non-essential sectors so essentially we see collapses across the board regardless of whether the state is prohibiting employment from happening or whether work conditions are prohibiting employment from happening and therefore our conclusion has been that the damage was not solely caused by stay-at-home orders and state policy and therefore is unlikely to be undone simply by lifting them now the more traditional BLS data sources are largely aligning with our sources but they don't provide the timeless the timeliness for us to be able to understand what's happening lately what's happening with state rhe openings well in the burning last data if we divide states into four groups based on the timing of their reopening policies we are still not really seeing much of a difference at all it really doesn't look like the darker lines would be earlier reopening and the dashed lines would be never closed still really does not look like there's much of a difference in activity other than now this early recovery that we're seeing in vacancy postings so just to wrap up again the early evidence on reopening confirms our initial intuition that you can't just flip a switch to get the economy back on track and now how many researchers are coming around to the same conclusion based on their other data sources as well now the shallow employment recovery that we saw in March which I alluded to at the beginning what we're finding as we look into the data is that that's mainly been driven by recalls so workers who were temporarily separated from their employers are now being recalled somewhat and that's good because that means that workers are maintaining ties with their employers but overwhelmingly what's going on is that most workers are still waiting to be recalled those who are searching actively have had no success have had very historically low success in finding jobs and part of that must be related to the fact that burning glass vacancies had not recovered as of May when we saw some early employment recovery and so we're not really seeing hires through the market process moving forward the June burning loss vacancy data do show improvements and so we might start to see these market hires going going forward although UI claims are still remain at historically elevated levels and the worry about the virus is certainly not going away in fact it might be increasing and so our conclusion is really that the complete recovery is going to take getting the virus under control improvements in consumer confidence etc
