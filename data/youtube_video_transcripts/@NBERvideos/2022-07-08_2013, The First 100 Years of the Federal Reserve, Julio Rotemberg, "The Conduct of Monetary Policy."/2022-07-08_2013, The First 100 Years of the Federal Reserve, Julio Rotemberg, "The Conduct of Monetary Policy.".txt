first of all thank you very much neil david and christy for this incredible honor to have gotten to write this paper it really is a fair fresh pair of eyes in my case i mean i learned so much writing this paper but um i appreciate that too actually so that was that was a great thing and also to be here so um so anyway so this paper is about a topic which um is a broad topic i mean i take a particular perspective on it but but i think the topic is something that is very good to reflect on as the fed turns 100 which is why has the fed's approach changed so much over time so if you if you take the broad view you know one point they focused on monetary aggregates at one point they focused on you know who what kind of lending is okay what kind of lending is not okay at one point they were sort of tolerant of inflation at other times they've been completely brutal against inflation i mean so so what how can we think broadly about these really large changes i mean these are not like little changes these are really large changes in the whole approach that the fed takes to its job and so again i have taken a a kind of particular storyline which i have then imposed on a bunch of these so so the mechanism that i stress is basically three elements so so first something bad happens now this this is unfortunately true in economies bad stuff does happen uh and then the the next thing that happens uh is that there are critics out there who basically blame the fed now interestingly about the critics that blame the fed is that there's you there's usually competition among the critics that is that different critics point to different things and and so this process leads to a kind of view that's dominant you know that view becomes like more or less the accepted criticism of the fed's behavior to that point and so it's not like one decision it's like a pattern of decisions that gets criticized i think it's more effective to say you know you have all been looking at the wrong variable that seems more effective than to say on september 12th in a meeting that we never you know get to see the details off you made a mistake that seems that seems harder so so it tends to be more a pattern and then and then the third thing that happens and this is maybe the center part of the paper is that the the fed then somehow becomes averse to repeating that pattern and and i have struggled hard with what the right word for that is and i have settled on penitence which has not ideal connotations but it has one connotation which i really like which is that the main thing you're supposed to do if you've committed a sin is not to do it again and so and so in that sense i mean i just want you to hold on to that aspect of the word and not be too you know hung up on other aspects so um so i have a handout which is going to get distributed which has this this is really just the last page of the paper there's nothing that i mean if you've seen the paper you've seen this but but to give you sort of a general sense of what this how i'm proceeding so so basically the criticized outcomes on the left i mean they're the things that you've heard of i mean the great depression the great inflation these have all been called errors by various authors the two that maybe are not so commonly seen seen as errors are first the initial decline but of course during the great depression the initial decline was a very dramatic event when you're in 1931 that was like an incredibly shocking thing that had just happened and then the other one which again does not get that much attention is this 5760 recession which first of all has two nice aspects one is it comes right before the 50th birthday of the fed and so it leads to congressional hearings having to do with the 50th birthday and then the second thing is these are the last recessions that take place before the fed becomes inflation tolerant and so i'm going to link those recessions to the tolerance of inflation that comes later so anyway so those are the declines then i give you the mistake interpretations independence let me let me just keep moving so so first how can you possibly prove that that penitence mattered i mean is this something that is even like provable you know audience to an audience like this and so so i would say there are like four elements of the so-called proof so so first is a timing question you know does the change in policy come after the bad outcome and after the bad inter of the interpretation comes to be accepted about that outcome the second is the specificity is it the case that we observe the fed really not doing the thing that they've been criticized for and then the third which is i think the hardest is i prefer it if i can find somebody at the fed actually expressing an aversion to that behavior and so so i look around in the minutes and so on uh in the records for that version and then i do something which academics do is i beat up on other rationales but i try not to do that too much today um so yeah i mean the truth be told is this an incredibly hard problem so many people have taken a stab at trying to explain various bits like the great inflation there's a gigantic literature on the great depression there's an enormous gigantic literature on obviously i'm not going to do justice to it but i think it's fair to say that none of these things are settled matters it's not like we know what led to any of these things and so maybe there's room for you know a little bit extra which is what's being provided here okay so the initial decline so anyway so it was incredibly dramatic 24 decline industrial production from 29 to 30. and so what is the mistake so i would say i mean i don't know the literature as well as i should for this period but but it does look like a single thing that people pointed to several people pointed like the largest error ever made by the fed was this 1927 expansionary policy that basically uh was led by benjamin strong and and the monetary history makes a big deal of this and he was doing it mainly for international reasons which fits with various discussions so in any event the the view after the fact particularly by governor adolf miller who called it the biggest mistake ever uh was that this was just been an error that they had done this expansionary policy and he went on to say i'm satisfied if the reserve system had his hand ties against too easy a yielding of the seductive expedient of inflation through open market operations so so he's saying look open market purchases lead to inflation inflation he means asset price inflation then there wouldn't be all this speculative abuses and access which is what was the sort of proximate cause of the great depression the abuses and excesses that led to the stock market increase and then crash um so now what's the aversion it didn't work out so well um well the aversion is basically trusting banks with funds basically the whole principle of the pre-1927 operations of the fed was that you couldn't trust banks to do the proper lending banks had to be con you had to make sure they didn't do speculative lending and so in 27 they kind of depart from that principle and i'm saying well what happens in 31 is they sort of reinstate this aversion to trusting banks with extra funds and that's why excess reserves come to be seen as a bad thing and so so there are two things that they do they they have an open market operations program starting in april 32 that ends in august 32 and they get nervous about the excess reserves and then they when they see reserves going up because of gold inflows later in the 30s they increase reserve requirements and so okay so you see the specificity now the you know do we see them saying an aversion well what the best i can do is in the annual report they say the board's action was in the nature of a precautionary measure to prevent an uncontrollable expansion of credit in the future so that's like the fear the fear is if we do a slight op you know if we increase access reserves a little that may lead to an uncontrolled expansion and we're afraid of that okay so um so i'm not going to spend too much time debating other things what other people have said but but i just want you to know that there is a bit of a mystery here the mystery this is trying to explain is why did the expansionists not win there were plenty of expansionists in the fed at the time including the chairman meyer who was very clear that he wanted an expansionary policy and so so anyway there are these alternative views i mean the the one thing maybe the one thing i would mention is one alternative view is that excess reserves were seen as irrelevant they were just seen as a waste and i'm saying well that that may be for sure many people said it was a waste but when really needs to explain why they didn't do it given that there were so many people wanting to do it there has to have been something that was negative about them too in any event um so so then the effects of the fed on the great depression so after great depression itself so here is the influence of freedom and schwartz so free marriage words come much later in 63 and they finally explained to us what actually led to the depths of the great depression and this becomes completely accepted uh and so in fact governor bernanke apologized so that so really if you had not apologized i may not have been able to write this paper in any event uh so the newer version is um basically gearing policy to the riskiness of new loans by money providing institutions and um and so so basically that there's some timing evidence which i have in the paper which is that in 53 there's still a lot of discussion about well this kind of you know the balance of lalone seems all right to us that kind of thing and that gets to be absent i have actually since then it will done a little bit more work so this is uh counting the word loans in the fomc meetings so so this is literally just a count of how many times in that year the word loans came up in discussion and the reason this turned out to be a good choice loans is that loans tends to be associated with cni loans business loans so it's all about the details of the lending that banks are doing and you see that it declines very nicely a little bit after the publication of the monetary history so anyway it's a timing evidence now the thing that i think is most fascinating here okay is it's not that we learn from the modern history that money matters i mean that clearly he had a great point that they had let money fall a lot and that that seemed like a bad thing after the fact okay and he had a good story i mean everything fit right the thing that i find interesting and mysterious is why did the other thing disappear that is the other thing had some wisdom too you know there was some wisdom in caring a little bit about what loans the banks were doing i mean endangering the banking system doesn't seem like it's a great idea so so and you know trusting the regulatory system to do it entirely i mean again it's not that you can't tell the story but but it is remarkable that there was incredible change in the attitude of the fomc and that i think is not so easy to explain why is it that you you should have learned about a new variable instead you learned that the old variable is something you should be averse to and so um and so this is where i say well maybe critics are just more successful in creating penitence and they are in creating excitement for their new idea uh i mean friedman said both things and in some sense he was more successful with the second part not be concerned with the credit market that will be the first okay so uh the last thing this is literally just a second is of course freedom shorts are another influence which is that in the current great recession liquidity providing institutions were mostly saved so obviously that was another aversion i mean there is a aversion to letting the money supply shrink that's for sure in the current environment okay so so then the 57 and 60 recession so so basically in the 50th birthday it's kind of amazing at these hearings all the economies you've heard of paul samus and milton friedman and so on they all agree the fed is way too independent it should basically be controlled by congress why because it is incredibly deflationist all the time they have an incredible bias towards deflation and obviously that's only because these bureaucrats are in charge if congress were in charge that wouldn't happen and and so uh so um so the mistake so i think here they really were competing mistake explanations so one mistake explanation was that the fed just swings to excessive tightness at the smallest whiff of inflation in some sense they found a job for themselves in 1951 which was to fix inflation and then they get so excited about the job that at the slightest whiff of inflation they just jump on it uh another view is that they just swing from one extreme to the other they're sort of unstable and this is basically what no confidence says and that's why they create recessions and the last one is this philips curve idea they're just picking the wrong point in the philips curve if only they understood they would basically be tolerant of inflation have more unemployment and the thing that's fascinating i won't have time to get into it but i think it really is amazing how unsuccessful the phillips curve is at the fed even before friedman publishes his presidential address martin is out there saying there is absolutely no trade-off in fact if the flip's curve is anything it's positively sloped so that one does not work but the other two really do work and so um so basically the there is i think a new aversion to creating sharp recessions to fight inflation and uh and so basically i have various little bits of evidence on this i mean first of all martin says the objective should be disinflation without recession now maybe i think that the thing that i find more interesting about martin is in my reading of him he was actually a tough inflation fighter in the 50s he said we should be up in front of inflation and then as time goes on he sort of loses the initiative he says well let's not do it because maybe congress will do it or or he even says at one point oh you know i understand that you all would have liked me to tighten earlier but i don't think that would have been a good idea so so i think he really changes and so i i mean this is excessive psychologizing on my part but i think he may have been affected by by this incredible criticism which really was a barrage of criticism and personally this is not you know in the paper i think it was justified in the sense that the 1960 recession was not preceded by a whiff of inflation nothing that is in 57 interest rates go up in response to actual inflation but in 60 they go up because the fomc says they think there's an inflationary psychology out there and that's enough for them so i mean i think it's reasonable for the public to have been a little bit shocked by that and i think it's reasonable for them to have felt a little guilty about it i mean again that's all my own psychologizing and not something that i can really substantiate now burns is a different matter burns really i mean he criticizes the 1960 policy himself before he takes office and i think um i think he really uh was even more if anything more overtly averse to creating recessions and there's plenty of that in the record now the thing about burns is that he is one complicated human being and so and so basically you can find him saying in the same speech i have and there won't be time but i have this this one speech where he says three things that have been interpreted different authors differently of course i prefer my interpretation that he's a gradualist and so that's one that i would have presented first if there had been time but but but there's another interpretation that he felt trapped and he felt like he couldn't cope with inflation there's another interpretation which says get ready for pain that last one by the way is the one that fits the best with the moment in which he said it because he actually did cause a recession in 1974 but but i think i think the range i mean i think that if you said was burns averse to causing recessions i think that's a fair statement i think beyond that he really said many things including that he didn't think monetary policy could matter i mean he he he really did say a lot of different things and so it's very hard okay so okay so obviously i won't have time for this is it really true that the 1960 recession caused the great inflation which is not a standard view so i have a long list of alternative upper views what's clear that milton friedman did explain why there was a great inflation and he said it was because the fed focused on the federal funds as an intermediate target that was his idea and um and so what happened well when volker takes office it is not the case that the fed feels penitent about the great inflation in general i mean they don't like it but they they are very much stuck with this gradualist viewpoint which is quite dominant in the fomc and it's not like they're all ready to go and have a gigantic recession to kill inflation so volcker has to get it through and the scheme that he uses to get it through is basically to have these new operating procedures and what i say is that the mistake interpretation was that exceeding money targets was a direct consequence of using interest rate targets and then the procedures are the solution and uh and of course other arguments are given for this not just my argument and so uh so what is the evidence that they had a new aversion to interest rates moving so so i'll show you the evidence because you'll see the kind of things that convinces me but i don't know what it would convince you so so as i was reading the fomc meetings i concluded that i had found utter disbelief at the idea that you would fix the interest rate and allow the money supply to go up so this happens in 1980 1982 it's way later the federal funds rate is nearly 15 percent the cpi has grown by way less than before so the real interest rate seems super high unemployment rate is enormous and part t says let's have a limit of 15 so basically say let's cap the interest rate more or less words now and what's the and he says that's not so unreasonable because i mean after all 15 percent is a big number relative to inflation and what does he get a response he gets wallach saying but if we got there we would provide unlimited reserves see i think this belief comes out of this but you know that's how i read this and and then other people say well how does different from the pre-1979 practices and you know party has to agree that it's a little bit similar and ford says are you implying that there wasn't a change in october 79 so i mean didn't we already get over that anyway so that's that's what the that's the evidence now there's a little bit of indirect evidence which is is very indirect which is that when the 1982 disinflation is over the fed is not accused of having made a mistake it is a fact that the monetary targets have not worked very well and the people inside the fed are extremely aware of that and discuss it at length how velocity shifts have really completely messed up their money targets but it's not the case that they have to respond to a public view of critics that they have made a mistake and my indirect evidence that this mistake thing matters that what the critics say matter is that at that moment they extricate themselves very slowly so i have various bits of evidence i mean for example interest rate targeting is something that evolves slowly the taylor rule is something that evolves slowly and so um so basically um so so i would say that here uh the the lesson is that it's not that what this paper is trying to say is that when things go wrong the fed changes what it says is that there is something extra that happens when the critics are able to establish that something was a mistaken pattern that then the change has a different character it becomes a first of all more drastic and secondly has more of the subversive characteristics so so i have a concluding remark i mean one thing which struck me as i sort of pondered about what i had found is how much more successful critics are when they say don't do something than when they say do something i mean so milton friedman in this paper is successful three times three you know first he tells them not to focus on loans then he tells them not to be swinging back and forth all the time and causing recessions and then he tells them not to stabilize interest rates and each time he wins his proposal of what the fed should do has always been the same but uh but uh but the but the the sort of accusations that are successful vary okay so i have to stop but so i want to leave you with these two questions which is the future which you know i mean again you know we are living through a period where things are not ideal and have not been and i think it's unsettled which mistake if any will be blamed for that and so the question i just want to leave you with is will there be a new aversion if we settle on a mistake and remember this could take a long time it took a long time after the great depression and then the other much harder question is what do you think prompt some mistake interpretations to be more successful than others thank you very much [Applause] you
