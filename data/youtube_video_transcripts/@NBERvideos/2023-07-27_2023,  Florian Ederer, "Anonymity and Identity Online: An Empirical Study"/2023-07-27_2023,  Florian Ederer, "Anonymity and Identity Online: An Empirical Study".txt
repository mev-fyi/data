thank you very much Catherine thank you very much for everybody for coming this is a joint work on anonymity and identity online with Paul Goldsmith Pinkham who's in the audience and Kyle Jensen as I said this presentation includes numerous excerpts of offensive speech including racism sexism and threats of sexual violence so I wanted to get that trigger warning out beforehand now what do I want to talk to you about today it's I believe a very important topic for everybody in this room and for everybody in our profession namely toxic speech in economics what do economists say when they're Anonymous why are we interested in that question we're interested in that question because we think this is indicative of what goes on behind closed doors and in private conversations we would like to document how widespread is toxic speech in economics who engages in such speech is it the downtrodden the disaffected or is it the elite or is it just pervasive and everywhere to that effect we're going to study the platform econ job market rumors or egmr which is a popular Anonymous Message Board which receives millions of monthly visits and many tens of thousands of posts every single month um it is impactful on our profession it is impactful on the lives and the careers of the people that are being discussed on there and I believe it is a very worthwhile study to look at who posts on this platforms today what I will be focusing on primarily uh the statistical properties of how egmr allocates usernames and how this reveals IP addresses for the majority of posts on that platform in that we're going to focus mostly on the methods of IP address attribution and then I'm going to show you aggregated variation across posters across universities across time across cities to show you that there is widespread use of econ job market rumors even at top universities and I want to stress here that we only use and I really stress this only use publicly available data and follow very much on the seminal work done by Alice who in her sequence of papers now for those of you who are not familiar with econ job market rumors it contains much useful information it contains information about how to run non-linearly squares with fixed effects it contains information on how to make your stator graphs more beautiful it contains information such as this assistant professor here at the top ranked School asking where one should move down to for the best salaries in terms of lower ranked universities there's also much gossip particularly about senior faculty moves okay hundreds of threads about who moves where and who has offers where information that clearly can only come from people at top universities sometimes or sometimes also at universities low ranked um but there is and that is I guess what it can drop Market rumors is much more Infamous for much unsavory content on the platform racism racism ride along with ads for Citibank there's placed right below genocidal messages economic specific racism again just the line along ads for United Airlines sexism and misogyny racist and sexist discussion of job market candidates these posts stay up months years without any content moderation who writes such things racist sexist misogynistic posts I'll show you today that particularly these messages these posts here come from IP addresses at Harvard at Stanford at Yale at Chicago and even the NBR headquarters as a 1050 massive okay now how does the username allocation on econ job market rumors work such that we can reveal or such that it reveals the IP addresses of these posters each topic only contract Market rumors is assigned a topic ID okay it's an OT or an incrementing counter and auto increment encounter that's common to Wordpress sites so in this case here there's the topic which is right versus left-wing dictatorships that's called the slug but it has a specific topic ID which is one one two seven two seven two each Post in a topic is assigned a username an ad username is topic specific so if I post in this particular thread in this particular topic here I get allocated the username824e now that username was characters 10 to 13 of the shaw one hash of topic ID and ipv4 address and for anybody who's familiar with cryptography or online security is this is a allocation scheme that did not use assault which is a random secret that sort of gets added to the stuff that is um indeterminant of the uh the poster and that was also in plain sight for more than a decade so give you an example here I gave you the example of that username a24e specific topic ID 1127272 with my IP address this is an IP address at Yale okay which I used to post on there showing one input is just topic ID plus the ipv4 address run through a show one hash and it gets the output and then my username is just 824e okay characters 10 through 13. okay how would we guess this we guessed this in 15 minutes the shaw one hash is one way it can't be reversed so we observe the topic ID we observe the username we do not observe the IP address so how do we go from the usernames and the topic IDs to the IP addresses okay well we can just try every possible ipv4 address to see if some of the match we start with the first IP address 0.0.0.0 okay and then we go down all the way to two five five FH okay and some of them in terms of their short one output are going to match on characters 10 to 13 like my true IP address okay a24e but they're going to be others that are going to match okay now how do you do this fast you need to use graphical processing units very very standard like everybody is basically Bitcoin mining yeah that's the same thing here you just need to run the three quadrillion hashes okay and you're done that then returns a set of matching IPS per topic username about 65 536 in expectation it's going to be some Randomness around it but basically when you observe the topic ID and the username you get a set of matching IP addresses okay now that's still a lot of IP addresses okay so let me give you the intuition how how you then go with simple statistics to the true IP address okay so if my IP is this IP here and I have a first post which is on the left hand side that was the username a24e I do my hash inversion which I just told you it's the hashing the quadrillion hessions that I do then I get a matching set of ips okay for this particular username for this particular topic which in this case here is of size 65 668. if I post from this IP in a different topic I get a different username that's the stuff here on the right hand side okay so my username is now 607 if again after doing the hashion version I get a set of matching IP addresses in this case here it's 65 907 IP addresses okay which IP address occurs in both sets here just one okay because that's the true IP address and all the other IP addresses are noise IP addresses they're randomly distributed because of the Avalanche property of the shore one hash okay now this is easy when I know that there are two posts and a post coming from the same place okay how do I do this more generally when I don't know that stuff comes from the same place okay and when I have many many more posts and topics okay what we can do probabilistic identification of active IP addresses so identifying the true IP address is possible because the true IP is always present in that matching set like I showed you okay the other noise IPS are going to be uniformly ID over the ipv4 space due to the short one Avalanche property if I change just a tiny bit in the input it gives me a completely different output that's the Avalanche property and that leads to this uniform distribution of noise IP but the true IP if I count it up all the possible IPS that I observe okay well in the case before it showed up twice okay and all the other ones just showed up once okay if I do this many many many many times across many many posts well the true Ops are going to show up much much more often than the noise IPS now here we can then help again get help from the statistical properties the probability of a noise IP appearing in a topic follows a hypergeometric distribution okay the number of times a noise i p IPS in a week or any time window follows a poisson binomial distribution okay so let me give you an example of that what that means okay let me go with a particular attribution example okay so this is somebody posting in this topic here topic ID is one seven five nine zero one I observe that I observe the username at 6B 42 okay now let's go and check how we recover now the true IP address for this we start with 2 to the 32 possible IP address that's the 4.3 billion that it comes just from the ipv for space the hash inversion narrows it down to 65 385 matching IP addresses in this in for this post here now we ask a question of those 65 385 IP addresses how many also explain other topic usernames in a seven day window okay how many sort of show up in matching sets of other posts around that time well the vast majority 58 367 never show up in any of them okay six thousand six hundred and two twenty seven show up in one of them okay and that's exactly pretty much what we expect by it to happen by chance yeah 378 explained two other ones again what we'd expect by chance 12. zero zero very much what we'd have we'd expect to happen by chance now for those of you who are very quick with addition you'll notice that I've gone up to 65 384 because all the way down here is one IP address that explains 103 other topic username sets yeah now that's very much not expected by chance this is likely the IP address that posted in this particular topic for that post now we do essentially IP attribution as an optimization problem we find a small set of these active IPS that explain the observed data subject to locality and significance constraint and this definitely has errors resistible mobile and they are going there in the paper the simple intuition of this optimization approach is just that 65 000 IP addresses can explain any given post one IP is going to explain many other posts in that time window what is the likely origin IP of this post it's probably this very highly explanatory IP the essentially this is a sparsity argument that the number of users numbers of possible IPS is much much smaller than the 4.3 billion possible IP addresses okay now what we can we do here okay well here's another feature that we're exploiting about the hashing okay namely if we selected a wrong substring of that fashion okay and said all the usernames must be coming from say position 11 to 14 rather than position 10 to 13. then I'd only be getting sets of noise IPS I would never have the true IP in there okay so when we use that incorrect substring of the hash that only generates noise IPS can and we can run sort of again compute the p-values of How likely is it that this showed up just by Noise Okay and we can do this for the incorrect cache which is the orange line here this is the p-value distribution of the poisson binomial test the minimum p-value for a particular IP address for a given post and you can see the orange line is much much more to the right than the green line because that green line that's the correct one and that has all those minimum P values okay that have FIP addresses that attributed to post okay now we can also use this comparison between these two to determine the p-value thresholds that we're going to be applying okay at what point at what p-value do we decide okay this is probably the IP address okay that is assigned to this post okay we're going to assign IPS two posts only if they're minimum p-value is below 10 to the minus 11 okay it's a lot of stars that you would have in our your regression table for that okay now we can do red several robustness checks for attribution here so the first one I told you already is the incorrect hashing set the other one is bogon addresses so what are bogon addresses these are nearly 600 million bogon addresses which occupy about 14 of the entire ipv4 address space these bogon addresses can never post to any website or in particular here to egmr but they could be attributed by our process okay two posts by mistakes but our process attributes zero posts to book on IP addresses for any of the 7.1 million posts that we have in our sample there's several other robustness checks per day you can check them out on your own time now with these methods what tools do we get we get a panel data set linking poster IPS across topics and time we get a geolocation of these posters which is high quality at State and Country level and can go down to City it gives you information on isps internet service providers universities organizations corporations hotels there are many questions that one can answer with these tools okay the ones we are going to be focusing on today is who are the posters on this side and I'm going to dispel some Notions that people might have about this is just people at lower ranked universities or this is just graduate students okay and it's not just that it's just a few bad apples it's very very widespread and the toxicity of said is very widespread okay let's get into geolocation which is the simplest thing of the 7.1 million posts okay we attribute an IP address to 4.7 million posts um we recover from that 47 630 distinct IP addresses now I want you to bear in mind that these are the most frequent posters these are only the power posters okay that we recover here there are many many more infrequent posters and the paper has an estimation of how many IP addresses We Believe have ever posted to e-control Market rumors and then even when you just take the posters they are gonna be even more viewers as reflected also by the gigantic monthly visits to this set the vast majority of these posts comes from countries with top research institutions in economics and finance exactly the places where you expect them to come from the time pattern of post is that there's been many many millions of posts since the time that we study this website it has an average of 70 70 000 monthly posts about uh 1100 monthly unique IPS that are being added as of 2022 there's a steady increase of posting volume over time but there's a very large traffic increase to the website uh during kobit 19 okay where you can see that it's primarily driven actually by this blue line which is off topic and non-econ posts they're really exploding during that time um now what's much more interesting is okay where these posts coming from and not just which countries are they coming from which which cities are they coming from the majority of posts come from large cities in the United States Chicago New York Philadelphia some fraction also comes from large cities outside the United States such as Hong Kong Montreal and Toronto perhaps not surprisingly there are two smaller U.S cities that show up here with leading research institutions Cambridge and Berkeley about 11 of the posts that we attribute with an IP address okay originate from IP addresses of universities or research institutions okay I've on the right hand side here I have I give you essentially the research institution share of post so take get up all the posts from all the various universities okay who are the leaders in all of this okay and you can see as by the parade of colors here that it is pretty much everywhere it's in top 25 places it's a non-top 25 places it's all said non-universities and in fact posts come from every single R1 Institution are these deletes of Economics that are posting on here now one of the most elite places is presumably discomference let's look at the posts that are coming from the Royal Sonesta there's nothing coming from the Royal Sonesta to egmr except when July July 11 that's when it starts now what's taking place on July 11 to July 28th yeah what is not taking place in 2020 in 2021 speaking of Elites what do these University IPS talk about well they mostly talk about themselves okay as you can see along the diagonal they talk about themselves a lot okay and they also talk about MIT uh now I want you to remain somber because there is much toxic speech on this platform the average IP has 15 of quotes that are labeled toxic hate speech or misogynistic okay stuff that would get flagged immediately on all kinds of social network platforms so it's a very very high share and I give you here the sort of the share of attributed post label toxic hate speech misogynistic okay you might say oh wait a second maybe this isn't just people from non-universities okay or maybe this is just something else that's happening okay how tolerant for example am I to be on this platform to post on this platform and to post in topics that also have already at a toxic post so I yeah I can show you that the average IP here has about 54 of posts in top picks with at least one post labeled toxic hate speech and misogynistic so people are willing to tolerate toxicity and still Post in the same threads with that same toxicity this is happening at universities too okay so if you compare here the orange line which is the average non-university IP that has about 15 percent of posts labeled toxic or hate speech the average University IP is a little lower 13 lower is there less tolerance in terms of this being willing to engage in such talk in being willing to mix with such toxic speech in terms of contributing to topics that already have toxic posts again it is true that average non-university IPS are somewhat more willing to engage in topics with toxic posts okay but the difference is quite small now you might say maybe this is all just driven by lots and lots of power posters or lots of universities that are just very toxic and then once they're that's the ones that posting on this platform what I show you here is that this is pretty much everywhere and the toxicity is pretty much 15 10 okay it's not really driven by the volume of posting it's not driven by many other factors that you might think explains this but this is pervasive it's everywhere and I think we should not look away and hope that the problem just goes away thank you very much for your time
