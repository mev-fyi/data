so this is joint work with uh yushin junk who's at renmin university of china and uh it's not working again um i'll go with that okay i'll go with this okay thanks so um so um so this is um a work um about sovereign wealth funds uh and um to figure out how to go back uh and uh and it's going to be a paper about um the objectives and decision making of these sovereign wealth funds uh and there's not much information uh out there about this uh topic um there's a and i'm going to base this um objective function that we're going to write down based on uh what norway basically states as their objectives which are long run intergenerational so you want to live kind of forever in some way in the short run which involves economic stabilization so the question is how do you deal with this problem now there's a conventional wisdom out there about this issue um which goes against writing this paper which is basically that what we are going to find is going to be very similar to lifestyle portfolio choice models that have background risk and therefore you don't need to to write a paper like this and i'm going to challenge that conventional wisdom by saying that the specification of the objective function and the constraints that the sovereign wealth fund faces are quite different from what the self-interested household is facing and the key constraint is going to be a sustainability constraint i'm going to specify and the the nature of the background risk shocks so they're not going to be lower income it's going to be commodity prices and business cycle shocks and we're going to argue that a strategic asset allocation model with a long-term objective function that takes into account these objectives and constraints will be different from what you usually i get i'm going to ignore any job political constraints any governance challenges and we're going to focus just on economic issues now in terms of results you are going to get less aggressive allocations in the uh less of your wealth invested in the stock market as the sovereign wealth fund matures uh when the natural resources end so that's going to be the similarity with the lifecycle models um but there's going to be important differences when you unpack that so higher growth in this setting will generate actually more aggressive asset allocations as the sovereign wealth fund is richer you will need higher consumption from the sustainability constraint and that will force you to take more risky positions to increase uh withdrawals basically and then the the other part is that when you start looking at the correlation that these economies face when the correlation between the business cycle and the commodity prices is more small relatively small so that would be the case in a well diversified economy like norway the acid allocation and the withdrawal rates will react more to the business cycle than the uh rather than the commodity price shock so you're going to have higher withdrawals in recessions and therefore in those states of the world highest allocation to stocks now in undiversified economies where that correlation is very high that would be the case of saudi arabia you should follow the same strategy but the reaction to the to the shocks would be a lot different would be actually reversed there you should actually react to the commodity shock than to the business cycle shock uh so for lower commodity prices that are persistent you're actually going to take more money out of the sovereign wealth fund so the sustainability consumer will tell you to have higher location uh in stocks now in building up the objective function there's going to be a substantial number of other things so there's going to be some taxation capacity that the government has and that will affect that location that's another difference from the lifecycle model you're going to have a lower real interest rates affecting your location um you're going to have a classic well it's getting classy i guess reaching for yield behavior as uh real interested you're going to have high rest allocation to stop uh expenditure commitment like the private equity uh paper was earlier today but for a different reason we'll act like a habit and generate more risk averse behavior and if you solve the model without the sustainability constraint and you have an optimal withdrawal and you have higher growth or same growth as we have here uh in the compared to the to the sustainability model you're going to have actually a much lower sovereign wealth fund a much smaller size of the sovereign wealth fund so i'm going to go quickly uh through the um through the model and how this sustainability constraint works um the background risks will be basically business cycle shocks and commodity price shops there's going to be a deterministic trend you can think of it as a zero growth if you don't like trend because many of these uh developing nations do not have uh secular growth but uh you can think of other countries that do uh and the business cycle would be the deviation from that trend so that's kind of a classic way of doing it you're going to have persistent deviations from that trend that would be the business cycle you're going to have some innovation and that innovation will be a state variable you're going to have commodity prices the commodity prices are going to be a multiplication basically the result that you're getting would be a multiplication of the quantity you're extracting which we completely exogenous to keep this simple times the price of the commodity and that's going to last up to certain period t star t t star is going to reach the maximum level and after that point is going to go down to zero and of course these are parameters that will depend on the economy and the structure we want to uh you can easily adjust the real commodity price uh it's uh actually they're very non-linear those processes um but um but we're going to use an ar1 and the reason we're going to use an air one is because these are papers in the 90s by determining the rock that have argued that an air one at an annual frequency uh does a good job in capturing these non-linearities basically uh and that's going to be a key um state variable uh and the and the issue will be figuring out the correlation between this innovation in the commodity prices with the innovation in the business cycle we're not going to have any time varying expected returns for reasons that i can discuss later and so iid stock returns and the question is this objective function how do you specify it so we're going to have a a cra model uh where basically you think of the government and the sovereign wealth fund kind of uh thing together and you're going to have this consumption of government expenditures uh which is kind of what the government or the sovereign wealth fund is interested uh you're going to smooth this uh this uh this part and it's going to have some components that are going to be a bit um uh uh it's not going to be just a withdrawals from the fund so you're going to have one component which is theta yt theta yt will be the possible tax revenue that the government is having and remember yt will be time varying uh some governments might be able to rely on getting high tax revenues others might not so that will affect actually things in this model you can also set it to zero if you i do not like that another part would be an age uh times the deterministic part the age would be some government commitment that the government is having could be public sector wages let's say your defense defense commitment so again that would be zero that would be one component then the the part that is completely endogenous would be the dt and the dt is the payout from the sovereign wealth fund and that's where the sustainability constraint would be coming at uh that that that endogenous part will be a fraction of the accumulated wealth but that fraction will be basically determined by the expected return on your portfolio so depending on how much uh assets you have in the in the stock market that would determine that uh that kt so that would be essentially uh a function of your asta location that's kind of a sustainability constraint because when the when the resource ends when the pt times qt will be zero after the uh the end of the the research you're going to set it in a way that you're always going to be consuming basically on average the annuity of the wealth and therefore you're going to be satisfying the intergenerational constraint of living forever basically you can calibrate these models so these are relatively standard you're going to have some persistence you're going to have an equity premium id returns the growth rate in the labor income in the in the gdp in the deterministic gdp and then the correlation between the different shocks uh and that would be uh what the baseline model would generate now if you go to the second picture that would be the accumulated wealth over uh over this uh model will reach a certain will plateau at some level uh and the and the first chart would be that withdrawals which are basically essentially mirroring the the accumulation of that financial wealth uh and the and the picture at the bottom would be the share of wealth in stock uh which is going to have this uh similar feature the life cycle uh portfolio choice model so in that sense uh that that intuition is correct in the sense that you you take more risk early on given that you're expecting all these uh resources that are coming up in the uh in the top picture of the yellow line that's kind of the average uh resource that's going to be exhausted so you take a lot more risks and then when there is the interesting thing is when there is a higher growth rate in this economy you're actually going to take more risk and why are you going to take more risk they're going to take more risks because you want to uh take advantage of the the way the sustainability constraint works taking more risk means you can take more money out of the sovereign wealth fund to keep this uh average wealth essentially the same in both models [Music] now you can you can play with the correlations so this graph would be the effect of the commodity prices when you have a different correlation between the the uh the growth rate in the economy uh and the and the commodity price uh and the point of this uh is to show uh that when uh when you have when you have uh the top row is the um is the case when you have a low um uh a logo a low correlation then there's not a big effect on the and the commodity price the bottom one is basically you take a lot more money when out of the of the of the system when when the commodity prices are high whereas things get reversed when you have an undiversified economy so that's kind of uh so you can compare basically the policy functions in the top row uh with this ones uh and you can see that for the for a different correlation the effect of the shocks gets uh gets reversed so basically when you're undiversified as an economy uh you react more to the um to the commodity price and vice versa when you have the business cycle shot now you can do another experiment which is the uh varying the taxation capacity the taxation capacity in this model uh when you go from 0 to 0.2 um when you go from zero to zero point two uh you can uh so remember the taxation suppose is how much money the government is able to tax and rely uh rely on when they when they make these decisions if they if they do not have uh that capacity at all that would be getting the theta equal to zero then you behave in a more risk averse way so on average you take a lot less risk uh you withdraw a lot less basically so that's kind of something that is uh that comes out from this uh model then you also have the lower real interest rate effect so given that there is a direct relation between the withdrawal rates here and and the average expected return as the real interest rate gets lower which is the the bottom picture here at the lower as you have a lower real interest rate uh you you still need to uh withdraw um you have certain expectations of what to withdraw in order to keep the the average wealth the same you can think about it like that as the interest rate gets lower you are going to uh basically take more risky positions so this will be shifting upwards basically uh in order to be able to uh to uh to manage your withdrawals in the way that uh that you are that you want basically uh then there's also a habit effect which is uh just a parameter here but you can imagine changing it over over time we didn't do that but that's something for uh for the future now the other interesting thing is you can you can ask what would happen in this model if instead of having a sustainability constraint you had optimal withdrawals so you have let's say the sovereign wealth fund choosing both the withdrawals and the share of what's in stocks optimally uh over time uh and that would be the the blue the optimal withdrawals would be the blue line here versus the the other one and the so if you are doing things optimally uh the blue line basically is above the the red line above the model i showed you earlier uh in the beginning of the of the life of the sovereign wealth fund because you are constrained essentially by this um by this you expect higher revenues essentially from the commodity price so you're slightly impatient so you're going to be actually tracking uh your withdrawals are going to be tracking these um these um this commodity price revenues over over time and that will mean that the uh that you're going to be accumulating a lot less wealth uh when you're doing that as a result of this lower world uh and this would be the same as in life cycle the portfolio choice uh incomes with background list we're going to have a higher asda location in stocks now the interesting thing and we don't have this picture in this in this graph if you now introduce growth in the optimal withdrawal model the sovereign wealth fund will actually uh be much much lower so this goes up to 10 units of gdp uh if you have even a one percent growth rate uh in this model with optimal withdrawals because you know that the economy is growing over time you're going to be actually consuming a lot more and your uh your optimal um size of your silver weapon would be a lot lower basically would be one-third of uh what you would otherwise get so the so the the the punchline of all these is that you have a a normative model for strategic asset allocation for sovereign wealth funds uh you have a sustainability constraint that uh substantially affects this astral allocation uh and it changes uh quite a bit uh the the intuition that you would get from uh models with background risk this level of economic diversification affects the arsenal location decision and you have some reaching for yield implications because of this sustainability constraint if you also have an optimal withdrawals model that would imply much smaller sovereign wealth funds relative to the um that's gonna be constraint model so
