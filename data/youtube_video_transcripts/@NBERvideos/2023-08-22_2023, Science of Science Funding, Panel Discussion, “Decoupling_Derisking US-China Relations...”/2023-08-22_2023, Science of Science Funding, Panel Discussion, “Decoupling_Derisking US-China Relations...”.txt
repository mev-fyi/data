uh and so let me very quickly introduce you the panel members that we have here on board to to to open up that discussion here so we first will have a Mary lovely who is a very nice name is uh she's a H okay got it yep um so Mary lovely is a professor in economics uh specializing on trades and political economy here at the Syracuse University but she's also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute she has done a lot of research herself on U.S and China trade uh flows and policy here but is also very closely from the DC scene watching and and and Advising trying to advise the the political level in the in the US uh here she's also a co-editor of the China Economic Review here was a good editor here so I think she's really very good to set the scene the more micro trade scene here in which uh science will have to operate uh here um so then we will also have uh Philippa hero I don't think I have to introduce you Felipe and also why uh you you you're a very important part of this panel here because you already presented your research last yesterday or the day before but of course Philippe also is very much also engaged in trying to assess the effects uh of not only science but but also competition policy other areas here how that and and subsidies how that would affect uh actually uh this um this uh geopolitical tensions here and he will also be able to offer a European perspective uh on this uh here um and then we have uh we have Richard Freeman who again I think is no explanation here for you guys why he's a good member of this panel here he has very extensively worked on uh what the impact is of U.S China on on individual researchers and how they do research here also using his labor perspectives here on this so again a very important uh expertise that we can bring on board here and then finally we're also very lucky through Richard to have to link um I hope I pronounce your your name correct here she's our Chinese representative in this panel here so she came to to to the US to work as a postdoc with Richard uh here a couple of years ago uh she's now still working with with Richards on um on on related science collaboration topics here but she's also uh she returned to to China here and she's also helping to recruit Chinese students here to come to the US here so her experience from a personal perspective of how she perceives this this geopolitical tensions will also be very much appreciated so I think you understand how happy I am with this panel here so I'm very much looking forward and giving first to Florida to Mary to set the scene of uh of these two political tensions and what implications that might have for for your science Mary floresiers we are on YouTube and also on zoom and if you don't use the mic nobody hears you outside this room yeah thank you very much um it's interesting to think about one's own life in terms of kind of the sweep of History I know that sounds kind of grandiose but when I look at my own career I realize how deeply tied it was to changes in U.S China relations I started out as basically doing public economics then moved to trade which I adored um and then cited based on an invitation to join a project on whether multinationals were being drawn to low environmental standard locations I got into a project with the World Bank on China and of course from there I just kept working on China and was fortunate to be able to have access to incredible amounts of data through both my graduate students through purchases of data and through sharing with friends and colleagues including what most of you might be familiar with which was the large firm level uh census that we have had access to um Chinese census Customs records sorry um and of course all the administrative uh data that China produces through its yearbooks so just enormous amounts of data that have had you know a beneficial impact on cohorts of graduate students as well as many faculty um and they're just oodles and papers that have been written about that around that time the nber started with a China working group which then turned into just a China group and it was here at the MVR that I was actually asked to join the editorial board for the China Economic Review where I became a co-author and handled um I would say about over the course of the time I was there 250 to 300 manuscripts and at that time we were working very hard to get more chinese-based uh review referees and Chinese editors co-editors um so I stopped doing that in 2015. I'm not doing it anymore someone else is doing it as everyone who's done anything like that knows it's strictly a labor of love um and then um went to Washington right around the time for a sabbatical which I thought would be restful but turned out it wasn't because president Trump launched a trade War and the next thing I knew I was deeply in the midst of a lot of stuff and part of that is because I am a a Democrat and B um strongly pro trade and pro-international investment International Exchange which has led me to have some awkward moments at dinner parties let me just say that it's um so I'm going to talk about the environment particularly through a U.S lens because that's the lens that I know best I do have as you all know I have many uh European colleagues at the Peterson Institute and I'm very much looking forward to the presentations to follow um I might be a little scarred because yesterday I had a test I was called to uh be part of a debate um on the if you may not know the house select committee on the CCP um which is a very antagonistic let's say to charge us China relations um so my job was to um argue in favor of not revoking permanent normal trade relations with China um and not imposing further export controls Beyond what's necessary for National Security and not arguing for more outward investment restrictions this committee is not just a republican-led effort to get a lot of air time although it is that it is also a bipartisan committee so there are many on both sides of the aisle who wish to see us decouple I will use the Forbidden word decouple further from China so the atmosphere in Washington is um I would say deeply into the narrative that China poses overwhelming risks for the U.S and engagement with China poses overwhelming risks I you could say I'm too close and therefore exaggerating but I really don't think I am and I'm going to talk a little bit about what that means for scientific inquiry which is of course dedicated to uh truthfully representing what one finds and openly and transparently presenting how one arrives at those conclusions so just for the state of U.S China relations and this is just the environment in which we work as science and science funders there's a deep deep distrust on both sides of others motives and actions um I think there's deliberate manipulation of interpretations of others motives and actions for example if you do look at any of the tweets that were put out yesterday by the select committee the one they chose for me I think was highly skewed in One Direction so um is it deliberate interpretation we could argue about it but I think it's clear the direction of travel intensive surveillance of all interactions of Scholars I think we have to be aware that we are being uh surveilled frankly um I don't think we do a lot of I do a lot of track two dialogues through csis um also we at Peterson have a ongoing relationship with a think tank in China we never um think that those interactions are not surveilled um so I think that one has to just operate that way and say you're just and we would always anyway just do things that we think if we brought to light we would be proud of them right and I also think there's just domestic pressure on both U.S and Chinese Scholars to conform to the dominant Narrative of the malevolent motives of the other and this is I think the most important point that we're under pressure now you might say well what does that mean that's not hard to resist um let me tell you I recently wrote a piece that was critical of U.S trade policy particularly with regard to um the violation of what I think our obligations to the U.S has under the WTO and with a very liberal editor um in a policy related Journal not an academic Journal I was asked why wasn't I defending Biden's industrial policy well I said because I'm not an expert industrial policy and this is not a beast about industrial policy so I think that there is this pressure to conform even you know people will say yes they can see that in China but it's true here also I think we have to be honest about that now the implications for scientists let me um skip to and hopefully some of these other ideas will come up in the discussion I think that we are working an environment that stresses National Achievement and National Security I think is certainly must um impact on the on the hard Sciences but I think it also impacts on social sciences um what are the topics that people are allowed to discuss what do journals think are interesting um there is reduced opportunity for open exchange with counterparts pressure to view achievements of others as invalid or tainted reduced access to funding for travel joint projects or cooperation suspicion of expats working in our country better funding for competitive research that prioritizes domestic narratives rather than what one might think is the natural Arc of One's Own research and reduced access clearly to cross-border data some of you may know of a service called wind that provides access to basic underlying Chinese statistics and many think tanks already have had their subscriptions not renewed we are waiting it's important data it's publicly available data but you can imagine that the kind of research that I did in my graduate students did 10 years ago just simply will not be available to students moving forward I don't know about the Natural Sciences I hope that we will hear more about that just unique pressures on social sciences because I am a social science one surveillance don't think it's only for the Natural Sciences it isn't there's a pressure to reinforce dominant narratives in the choice of topic and findings and I think with the new counter Espionage law in China I think we have to recognize that some of our colleagues May risk uh Espionage charges if they share data so what does that mean I think for funders and editors and I'll conclude I think for us editors it's really really a hard job how do you find good referees for papers on uh that use data from China the referee has to understand the Chinese context um but it can't be partisan in the sense of not really thinking about why was this topic Chosen and and is this are there are the findings really valid I guess um don't don't just focus on method alone think about the topic Choice the framing and also data collection because I can tell you that is really where the rubber hits the road um what do we do about data access and replication when we have a counter Espionage law that makes it difficult for for data to be shared across borders and I think yeah despite all that editors have to work hard to keep the door open to Chinese scholarship Chinese topics Chinese views Chinese interests Chinese students who want to work here and beyond for funders I think they need to look beyond the current political whims in Washington right now if you want to to write a paper that's saying that Lake trade is bad because it hollowed on American manufacturing you will be funded quite um Pro what is just you know fully uh if you are if you think that actually the effective trade on on labor is very much over over exaggerated or exaggerated then well yeah let's hope you have your own money kid let's hope you inherited a lot um I think we the you need to win the funders need to insist on Broad surveys of the field of study have researchers really considered discoveries and findings developed outside the United States I think they shouldn't reward nationalist rhetoric it is so easy to do I have had so many pieces op-ed pieces blog pieces where editors have Rewritten the lead in ways that clearly head toward this nationalist rhetoric because that's what gets clicks and finally I think we need to continue to fund cross-border projects as difficult as it is okay thanks for making us so uh optimistic but uh just at the time when we need more academic research on really identifying the custom benefits of these choices and we need more data in order to be able to do that that's exactly the constraint that we are facing uh here but thanks to a very courageous researchers that we still have like here that we we hope we can continue Philippe you will be able to use data to identify what the actual costs are on signs uh here so floor is yours okay thank you so much so should we fear China um so they are in fact on China there are two exist coexisting views I mean one view is that China will soon overtake us okay and uh it's just a matter of I don't know what decades or less and that's one view another view is that uh with the current uh institutions that they have China will not make it uh that I call that the one Nations fails view that in fact China is doomed because they are not Democratic they don't have good institutions to that favor Innovation uh uh and so they they are bound to not be able to fall into what you could call a middle income and not be able to either catch up or let alone uh you know leap progress okay uh and so now question is China research catching up with the US that's okay and uh how much does Chinese research the U.S service that's okay first of first kind of question that we ask and very much what I will talk about is based on Research joint work with Luke and Rafael and David Stromberg and other courses which we presented indeed uh two days ago but I will talk about I will broaden beyond that so uh first I mean if you look internal patterns uh you uh there is clearly in terms of number of patterns uh more than a catch up of China Visa the U.S of course they are not all fantastic patterns if you look at triadic patterns or other metrics of good patenting U.S is still ahead of of China well ahead but but still there is a trend towards uh catching up and his colleagues that he has been uh you know presenting for several years now and and shows that you know if you take particular Technologies and you look at the relative contribution to of China to this uh China is in blue and you see that there is a collapse of Japan and the rise of China in particular and and uh and U.S is kind of uh and and Europe is kind of uh but anyway it's not uh it depends it depends it depends but China you can see the rise of China and the collapse and and the decline of Japan so that's kind of telling and now you can look at papers so if you look in terms of number of Publications uh China is in uh and that comes from uh you know uh so that comes from the work we did on using scopper's data but uh you see first that there is a kind of catching up of China catches up with uh even goes beyond us and catches up with Europe in time of number and interview also a number of top-sighted and of course the problem is that whose sides okay and uh and so you you have to think that China is doing much better than the one Nations that's not true the question is that are there overtaking us so uh um and there there is an element of what I could call optimism on our side is that in fact uh uh China the Chinese research uh you know reliable to a lot of extent and collaborations with us uh you can see that the the green curve is the is the number of top-sided papers Chinese cited papers and and and uh and you see that that you have the catch up but if you restrict no attention to those without uh uh a U.S course or someone based in the US you see it falls from there to the airport and so you can see that it makes a big difference if you take out uh U.S coasters then you slow down the catching the catching up process considerably this shows the shell publications of of Chinese researchers with European versus U.S coasters you see that there is a continuous increase in the collaborations with you at the end but in the US it was a sharp wise and then you had the China initiative and I will say a few more works that in fact in reverted the the trend okay so you since the this initiative was implemented you have a sharp decline in the share of Chinese publication with U.S wholesalers so what do China initiative was it was something launched with under Trump uh uh to invite Chinese regime I believe Chinese economic Espionage it would mean more complicated administrative procedure reduce access to funding exclusion of targeted researchers and so what we did in the paper is to look at the the China initiative implementation as a quasi-natural experiment and look at its impact on the volume quality and direction of Chinese research I want to summarize because I want to repeat the thing is that essentially what we found is that there was a negative but non-significant effect on Publications but the negative and significant effect on citation on the number of Chinese Publications in top five percent journal and on the average age index of course therefore those Chinese researchers that used to have strong links with a U.S coasters prior compare and the control group is childhood researcher who used to have uh strongly with European researchers we do a different deal and that's that's the result that's the average that's the that's the that's the the main effect the ATT regression okay so that's uh that's the so you can see that there is a negative effect on the quality of Chinese research uh of this China initiative now you could say well but how about the U.S side and there you have the work of Zia and kosars that shows that you are pretty much similar things happening on the on the U.S side first the share of uh papers or Publications by Americans with Chinese doctors went down after the China initiative mirroring exactly what we saw on the Chinese side but also you have a negative effect on uh on science they look at PubMed citations and they find also uh significantly negative uh for those researchers that used to have strong uh Chinese uh the Chinese so it affected both sides oh yeah yeah you're right you're right right okay that's right okay so I I have to stay still it's very hard a challenge for me you know I have to be attached like release you know okay okay exactly so now you could say well could you compare the the effect on the Americans and the effect on the on that's something we still have to do but one one hint already is that what we show here is that the magnitude of the decline uh increases with the extent to which the other country dominates in the field and since there are more Fields while the U.S dominates then Fields where China dominates our presumption that we will we are working on this is to show that the effect is negative on both but more negative on Chinese research overall that it should be on U.S research okay so that's the thing now that's what where we are okay so China to in a nutshell is not as bad as when Nations fight would say but it's not as terrible as you know this Australian Report with the alarming report to say that we are finished China has won that the guardian did a kind of pay article on that in March last March we are not as as bad as the Australian report says that we are not uh we are not that's not uh we are not as threatened by China and China is much better than what what nations fell would say what about the growing your head will China take over hello it's true that China spans a lot in our own they spend enormous amount and they have a very you know forceful industrial combined with you know the RnB police sequel so that's very evil but there is one thing is that first uh uh there is the kind of uh there is Xi Jinping and and uh and the political tightening in China and for example this paper by a semoglo and coasters you know now uh more and more you require the thread of departments the member of the Communist Party okay and uh what they show is that uh following appointment of new department heads you can see the research of uh other researchers in the lab lining up much more with a research agenda of the height of the department so they become much more confirmed so there is something changing in the fact that you know will there may be more conforming and less Innovative and less like opinion Innovation when you try to do like you're the boss of your lab you are less likely to be Union innovator that's the idea uh there is also something that you know uh uh misallocation in typically firms found below Frontier should be doing imitation firms beyond the certain threshold should be doing Frontier Innovation but there are frictions and the frictions imply that you are more like this and when you increase the friction you go from there to and for example the Liberty will tell you that compare China and Taiwan typically uh when you are closer to Frontier we know that you have a lower growth rate okay and you could compare r d and non-rnd firms in Taiwan uh in Taiwan you see because you do more r d when you are closer to Frontier it makes that authority of Commerce will receive more than what you could do because they become more Innovative you see and whereas in China you see on the left-hand side you see no difference between r d intensive and non-rnd intensive firms which shows that r d doesn't make a huge difference in China compared to Taiwan Taiwan RND investment is retargeting Frontier firms they're thereby you know reducing the extent to which they grow less when they are Frontier because they can rely more on Innovation so I think that's interesting because it shows that you know there are there is something to the fact that there are institutional barriers limited competition uh those The Limited Freedom that's something that you know I think is a break is a kind of impediment to becoming fully Frontier innovator and Union innovator and it's true that to some extent China could do very well and can you vary because it relied also on collaborations where with countries where there is more freedom like the U.S and of course when you have the the Chinese hello now I want to just end up how should we add vis-a-vis China uh uh there is one view on that which is to say uh you know be do the Trump kind of policy or the right exactly the debate that you were you were mentioning interview to The Economist to say well of course on the one hand there is the the you know the sensitive Technologies where those were you have to be careful and Vigilant but on the other hand uh we won't be able to overcome climate change without China there are major challenges on demography on on climate on on war in Ukraine on many where we need uh a collaboration with China and we were all relieved when they got out of zero coffee because zero kovid of China was uh stolen worldwide rules and we were already when they got out of it because they say suddenly we can resume growth so we had a kind of schizophrenic attitude in the league China we were there praying that they would get out of zero covet but we said on the other hand we have to be careful so we have to come out you to see to to over welcome this schizophrenia and find a good Midway I call that the Kissinger approach but you can go that differently and I think and about Europe I mean uh something and am I and well is that though what we show is that researchers the treated Chinese researchers those who used to collaborate a lot with us after the the financial the collaborate weight with U.S commissaries and we have good reason to believe that they reallocate turkey to European coasters so Europe you know such uh could take advantage if you have this kind of very tough policies of U.S Israeli China of course it it may be an opportunity for Europe to say well you know we can Bounty at least benefits from it thank you very much the challenge to for the mic to no no no that's fine I think it was really also a very good view on how we see already the effects of the trends with China in micro effects here um and which will likely to be continuing with what we have seen from from Mary which he was discussing you um but also I think very good points to to make that we should perhaps also really not be so afraid uh here is that we we should actually be less schizophrenic but still realistic that's my first yeah that vigilante yes and Europe yeah we'll see what yeah so uh with Richard we will be going even more uh more zooming in at the micro level the researchers what kind of mechanisms actually at the micro level at the level of of Institutions would actually play out and how that affects actually the the more macro so this will be the micro picture to the micro results here's the Richards floor is yours and okay I'm gonna talk about the not just micro but it's totally different um right I think more important place with the US and China um are Partners connecting together um and that this background it's implicit in all appears of things as well um percent of world papers as countries the US and China are the two biggest but it's important for the Americans to understand that China is and just in the in the in the last three four years has become by far the biggest uh they surpassed us if you put all the EU together the EU is and he and that you saw that in his slide um is is is is bigger in that sense but China will surpass the EU uh shortly there's a huge change in the world uh the US and China are by far each other's greatest research Partners that's being measured by collaborative papers we are together that's it we do more papers with China than we do with Canada well Canada's got smaller population we do more than we do with uh the uh Britain which is a long historical tradition again some of this is because China's big and there's lots of people but we are are each other's best partners and then third and very important for people in higher education is we are China's best partner this is the place mostly they want to come the Chinese scientists and students want to come here um they fill our Laboratories the postdocs any place you look Chinese students and on the other side there's not that many U.S students who go go to China that had been going up after covet it's this this um this is very little I'm going to be talking about two kinds of researchers one is diaspora researcher now that just means someone who is born in mainland China and comes and writes papers with a U.S address they are at a U.S laboratory producing U.S quote papers that are counted as part of the U.S if you count things by address and then return e-researchers and that's people who go back to China after having written a paper in the U.S and they could go back and forth and there's some people who are dual authors uh it says let me see if I know how to move this down there no which one this one which oh the arrows at the bottom whoops no but only it wasn't me no it still doesn't move no this is weird um we got an expert or something yeah it's just it's it's a PDF produced push cool right you fixed it up so it's working okay I'm in trouble today oh there we go looks like it's working now okay thank you apologies um I want to first convince you that the a large fraction of U.S papers are indeed done by Chinese people chinese-born people working in the US so I I hear breakup papers by whether it has a China dress and if it's a U.S paper whether it has a U.S uh excuse me a china-born person and it's 20 is in 2018. um it hasn't gone down since this is an interesting fact 27 of the papers in the U.S have Chinese presence in the diaspora um and that is far bigger than the collaborative papers between the two countries I'll come back to that in a minute in China it's the same thing it's the returnee people from the U.S uh who go back to China and now they're doing their research at the China address but they have written a paper in the U.S which makes them in my measure a returnee and they are uh it was 38.3 percent of of the of the of the papers in China this is an incredibly powerful um activity it's I treat these two these two kinds of researchers as they have a lifeblood of the U.S China collaboration and again it far outnumbers the number of people writing collaborative papers which is the standard way we do we we would measure these things second um the papers in the U.S that have a diaspora author on it tend to be getting better journals and they get more citations so by some metrics these metrics they are and you can do all kinds of regressions of whatever it is um uh Etc is it just a new NBR working paper G and Freeman um which came out last month that they'll give you details I'm not going to give any details and the same thing is true in the China if you they have a U.S experienced author a returnee the papers get more citations and more side scores we checked whether this is just due to the fact that Americans are more elected to decide Americans Chinese are more likely to cite Chinese by looking at the rest of the world sites to the papers and that also says these are particularly good papers so we have what looks like a very successful collaboration of of of of people and you know it makes great sense China into your 2000 it was not very big in in in science they get people educated in the U.S they go back and the U.S makes great use of these these these Wonderful Chinese everybody here oh but by the way my my data is solely for for the uh natural and physical sciences medical not social sciences is much more complicated and uh because of some of the uh you know issues that that Mary first discussed from a U.S context and this is true in China too of course finally I want to just give you some more things to understand how tightly tied we are with China um the collaborative papers have on them an extraordinary number of either diaspora people writing in the U.S or returnee people writing in China the the the number I would go with is 79 of these papers have either one or the other and if it was a hundred percent we would say this is a necessary condition the 79 is close enough it's really very important and then the other statistics there uh two the people who play this role these diaspora and returnees their commitment is is over their careers we see it they're more likely in China to to to do something at one point in their life with Americans um and and the and the the uh and diaspora people in the U.S are more likely to work on Chinese things as well so this is it's our data was for one year 2018 but goes throughout their their lives and then um citations the a paper in the U.S which has a Chinese uh born author diaspora paper is twice as likely to cite a paper in in in uh China then then some some other paper in the U.S and the same thing China papers cite the U.S papers well if you got a returnee in China that person is familiar with probably educated in the U.S they certainly worked in the U.S because they were out of the U.S addressed and so in the collaboration and in the citation networks these are like this these are the biggest Partners the US has ever had in its research and now for the from Americans we have to understand China is appears well China's not dominating the the universe but they are growing way up and it's going to continue for a good number more years they are the number one producer of papers in the world their citations to their papers again it's not at the same level as the U.S has been going up we did one calculation I didn't have it I didn't put heaters in our paper which you said well what's the share of citations now of China and the US so quality and you take China's lots of more papers than the us about 50 more now but their citations are less you multiply the two things together it's about the same but the share of global citations in the next few years is almost certainly going to go up China so the US is getting a beak plus from having this partner in research and um and I use the word decoupling here I said when we were working on this paper in the in the spring which I said oh well wait a minute everybody's yelling about the US and China should break up and we shouldn't be friends so we started taking a look the D and I and I just said here in diasporin attorneys we found no evidence that these people were stopping their collaborations my same people I work with in China I still work with and it's it's it hasn't it hasn't declined we do see when this search stirs up in peers they the different way uh a decline in joint collaborations so it's harder to collaborate with a Chinese researcher um than it was so papers with both addresses Falls that's it falls much more in the uh uh in China as a share of all papers than in the US well why because U.S papers are not increasing much uh China papers are still growing massively so in one sense the U.S has become less important to China um but we'll see in a minute who China now is is collaborating with where they're not collaborating with the US um and that'll be interesting where we do see evidence of this decoupling um okay this decline of collaborative papers it's it is on the margin of Scholars and and students and so here we've got data the share of Chinese International scholars in the US with a some comparison to India and what's going on is the Chinese year has taken a big drop and here the zero uh uh covet policy was very important it's very hard for people to zero covet to move we will see for the rest of this year how much that goes back up so but it took a big big drop and whereas other countries there was a real cutback of all these International trips I've come back China has not and so I give the figures for the stock and then I give you the flow of visas visas granted and what you see is uh we gave twice as many visas basically to India us people to come as research Scholars than we did to China that's the that that was International Scholars now for students it's very similar and um what I think will be if there's going to be a decoupling it's beginning to be because the U.S will not be having so many Chinese people coming to the U.S becoming the next generation of diaspora workers around researchers and I'm almost there last one good and and then the flip the flip back then they won't be going back to China so it's in these it's in the margin of the flows of people uh that that the partnership or relationship is endangered the last page the last thing is if this hap happens what is going to be the what are the two countries going to do well China during this period of time when they're producing many many papers there's been a big increase in the share of Papers written with Europeans Japanese and other people always going to the west and I then looked and said how many were there to Iran and Russia and it's Zippo there is no increase so the the the partner for China if it's not going to be the U.S at least looks on the basis of the behavior of the Chinese research Community is other Western countries and that's I would say fine uh or with this the U.S having this uh the the decline in getting an international collaborations that's where we're looking for this and clues we have increased our things with uh the EU as well as same as China has um and there's some countries have surprised me Arabic countries but this King Saud University offering giant sums of money and who knows what else for people and we've seen an increase in India so I I view the the I'm looking that's not the from the political side but in terms of science here and if if we have a breakup of the U.S and China of our of our relation the tightest and biggest and most my view successful research collaboration between two countries okay China has a choice of going to Russia and Iran which they won't and it's Europe and that and and that's I think fine performance they're dealing with Democratic free countries and not villainous countries uh uh Etc the US's choice is going to be and I think you see this in some of our policies let's get a lot of Indian researchers to come in that's also not horrible or any in any way shape or form but there's they're going to be some costs of transition as we shift in this China shifts and we do uh I talking to the scientists I don't have a survey to report or things I would say most American scientists would say we want to keep our relations with China and I think most Chinese scientists have the same view so I view this as a situation of the science Community saying this works this works don't mess with it and the political Community saying uh we don't I trust my Chinese colleagues to the anthem um they may not be as cool as the French colleagues of course but but they're wonderful um but that's not but the political thing and that's a thing we all have to think about thanks a lot Richard so you really really identified how difficult it would be for decoupling given the fact that it's so tightly knit here uh in terms of really persons interactions veterans uh and and um uh diaspora are important disease and how this might in this finish in the short run maybe still be stable but the long term May certainly become a problem here I also noted this trade diversion uh here that maybe Europe could be benefiting and some others but the question is how good is that for signs in total this uh this diversion here and then I also noted a decoupling between science and the political uh here so that's uh even if we show how important it is to stay connected to the political discourse is completely different here but I'm very happy that we also can can have the view of a chime Lin uh here because she really illustrates at the micro at a very micro level all the challenges that also Richard already identified here how difficult it is for individual Chinese researchers here to come to the US how attractive is this other allocate other uh going to Europe as an alternative or not and how does this feud in China as well here so we're very happy to have you here still yeah and uh so give yourself thank you I'm happy to be the Chinese calling who reach out to trusted okay thank you so much and okay I'm happy to stand here because uh you know you cannot imagine how hard I came here a week ago I transferred from my University through to Beijing first because there's no still no direct flight from my hometown Sichuan to us so I transfer from tandu to Beijing one day before my flight and I fly from fly from Beijing to Doha and stay here for three hours and uh fly from Doha certainly to New York but finally I got a flight from Doha directly to Boston okay so it all took more than one day for me to come from China here but you know that is maybe the quickest way because there's still no direct too much flight this is one reason why we are the coupling because physically we could not be coupled right okay that's a joke so uh I I might introduce myself I I used to be I work with Richard in the past three years during the pandemic time and I came back China last uh last July and then I am a teacher and also professor in Chinese University the hometown of the panda so so besides the research I also give lectures to students who are Our Hope of future scientists scientists so I pay more attention to about their future about their work especially in our economic so-called social science field but you know uh this here is some this I give lectures to undergraduate every year for two courses and one lecture to graduate from a Chinese students so I think I have some uh experience to say okay it does work oh okay so we called hi guy hey hey I need your help so this time is the PowerPoint it doesn't work Richard has a PDF okay okay thank you that's just so thank you so much okay okay uh here I want to show the number of the Chinese Mainland International students all around the world uh according to 2020. you see uh the whole this is the whole number overseas are having on board first one is the United States and the second one is Australia and a certain one is the UK and the total number uh is uh maybe a half of the United States now International Chinese mainlander student and I just like a richer said and Philip said maybe after the pandemic because some decoupling policy our students will transfer to other countries but from the data we can see whoa wow so yeah he must be here all the time what what magic could yeah okay uh we can imagine uh okay after uh so imagine if uh United States uh keep growing to attractive Chinese I mean students to come yes of course but uh finally uh unluckily this attraction cannot become real because they couldn't come for any reasons so because under this circumstance the situation changing so uh because of the work so uh you guys are Imagine which country to be the number one okay let's go okay here good I have a magic too so stay here stay here okay stay here so you can see uh yeah we transferred to Europe especially to UK this this might be the first time the Chinese Mainland international student uh surpassed the uh United States because because uh the United Kingdom attracted more in uh last year and for the Academy here in the past Academy year uh while China Remains the largest source Country For All Foreign students in the United States that's true but it decreased very sharply so another Edition from the academy year in the past the five Academy year the people I mean the international students who I went UK increased very very yeah significantly ah so uh this means uh physically decoupling from the result the students they prefer to go to the rest of the U.S I'm not sure whether uh UK or Australia or Canada or France but that rest of the USA well so more data comes from uh some maybe sensitive topic I don't know firstly we talk about the steam subject that means science technology and engineer ring and Mathematics wow so uh in June 2018 before the pandemic uh there have uh some very strict restriction on these four uh subjects uh who are always attractive to Chinese students who wants to come to learn a lot about uh just as Richard said uh no matter after their study no matter they go back China or still remain on USA to continue their researchers this this four I mean subjects are very attractive but uh due to another uh you know former president Trump how he hates China I don't know hmm uh a special issued to suspend the entry into you you United States of certain Chinese students and researchers and not only for these four subjects but only for some specific Chinese universities that means if you had uh experiments in this University no matter what subjects you are even though maybe uh economics Arts you cannot you cannot you you can hardly get the research comma to come in U.S and uh this is the number just a rechargeed to us the Visa students issued to Chinese students decreased year and a half that means uh even though you could come you could get the offer you couldn't come physically because you don't have the Visa so you can just imagine who ranked the first yeah India uh twice more visa to India students than Chinese students so maybe decoupling with China means coupled with India more and my experience okay okay yeah because I give lectures to to students so sometimes we will ask me to write a refer or recommendation letter for the for them to apply for the outside University you know during past the three years I write only one letters for one of my students who applied for U.S university only one and the rest of the 13 students I mean the 13 letters went to UK Australia Singapore and Hong Kong that's amazing because before this time I have found half yeah I already encouraged my students to go aboard no matter which uh which country you should look look forward but before it's half a half half of my students went to American University but during the past three years just one huh so so the consequences are just uh it's not real it's just my thinking maybe too optimistic but we don't want to be the enemies but we always want to more uh collaborate with China and the US so the last but not the most I'm still thinking about it what we could do so maybe first to add a flight between China and the US okay thank you very much
