this paper fiscal multipliers in the coven 19 recession is joint work with my colleague yuri garrod nachenko at berkeley peter mccrory of jpmorgan chase and dan murphy of the university of virginia in the paper we ask uh the key question we ask is how fiscal multipliers are affected by covid type shock now we start from our knowledge of what happens in recessions and work that in particular yuri and i have done in the past suggest that when you have a recession particularly a deep one and there's a lot of slack labor markets lack in the economy multipliers fiscal multipliers might be very large because it's possible for demand to have a big impact on the labor market before hitting constraints but the recession at the beginning of the covet 19 pandemic though very very significant in terms of gdp loss and increase in unemployment was a very special one because in addition to the decline in economic activity several other things happened at the same time there were supply shocks effectively some sectors became it became much more difficult to produce more costly for example food processing meat packing they had to take extra precautions there were demand shocks as consumers shifted their demand from what one might call dangerous goods like ocean cruises uh to safe ones like video streaming and finally there were government policies layered on top of changes in individual behavior such as quarantines uh which have potential influence as well so our strategy in this paper is to use measure of a measure of fiscal policy which we argue is largely exogenous to short-run economic conditions which is federal government defense spending payments to contractors to estimate the effects on employment and consumption of fiscal changes fiscal shocks early in the pandemic either april 2020 or april through june 2020 and what we assess is the impact of government spending on economic activity and how this impact was affected by the adoption of strong stay-at-home orders that is orders put in place by local or state governments to limit the extent to which individuals could leave their house for work or for purchases uh just to remind you the the economic and social environment early in the covid crisis there was a very very sharp drop starting in in the levels of economic activity and mobility and in this graph you see measures of retail mobility with the black line work mobility with the red dashed line which tracks retail mobility pretty well this is people moving to make purchases or to to go to work and then a decline in consumer spending which while moving at the same time didn't decline as much in part because people were able to do some consumption uh remotely that is without actually going out on the other hand there was really no uh observable change in the pattern of defense spending payments uh the variable that we're using to uh to measure fiscal changes across locations and uh this was very uh intentional on the part of the federal government in fact the federal government took various actions during this period to make sure the defense contracting activity could could continue such as by making workers at defense contractors essential workers and by facilitating payments uh during this period so it was very much the government's intention to keep to keep this activity going even as other activity fell now the stay-at-home orders that we look at as a measure of government policy in addition to fiscal policy i are drawn from a paper uh another recent paper uh beckett all and one of the co-authors of this paper peter mccrory is a co-author on our paper as well which measured state home orders across core bay statistical areas cbsas metropolitan areas of different sizes as of the week of april 11th uh and so really the most uh that could have applied as of that time uh would have been about four weeks where i live for example and in the bay area uh that's where we were we we were very early adopters of state homeowners as you can see from uh from this graph it varied by size of city smaller areas less heavily populated areas the green uh sorry the red line tended to be less aggressive in adopting stay at home orders uh the green line the biggest cities are the most aggressive and we define a binary variable either strong state home orders or not uh at three quarters of a week that is areas because there was really very little right there areas to the right we treat as having stay at home strong stay at home orders areas to the left we treat as not having strong stay at home orders and we put in controls for city size and so forth to make sure that that's not uh confounding our results and i should say that when we're measuring the effects of stay at home orders we're measuring the effects of stay-at-home orders as well as the conditions that might have led to stay at home borders that is to the extent that an area might have had a high incidence of disease and those in charge of the city decided it was appropriate to have a strong stay-at-home order one would expect that the stay-at-home order would have an additional impact but there also would be an impact of the conditions themselves that led to it we're not really distinguishing between the effects of the state home orders in the underlying condition uh we're really just talking about factors including government policy that would have led to declines in economic mobility and activity as you can see uh areas with stronger stay at home orders were characterized by bigger drops in consumption in the left panel and employment on the right panel uh relative to the period just before coping 19. so perhaps not surprisingly areas that had stronger stay at home orders did have bigger drops in economic activity on the other hand uh one's controlling for obvious other variables that might be associated with department of defense spending there were no changes in the changes in department of defense spending from the previous year across cities is uncorrelated with uh with uh stay-at-home orders so as i suggested earlier the defense spending pattern across the u.s and the changes in this pattern from one year to another really are not related to sort of high frequency current factors economic and social factors in a particular area and that makes it a good uh measure of exogenous fiscal policy changes so our basic empirical specification uh is to relate changes in employment uh from the previous year delta y i i had a particular area i to changes in government spending year-on-year changes in government spending for the year ending in april uh 2020 uh delta g and then the state of uh lockdown or stay-at-home orders either having a strong stay at home orders or not or high or low and then the interaction variable which is highlighted here is the one that we're interested in that is how much is the impact of government spending affected by uh which state you're in whether you have a high or low lockdown and we scale all these things by this the local payroll size in the previous year just to make sure that we're uh doing things on a relative basis and here are our key results the main results we find for employment are that for areas with low stay-at-home orders there were significant effects on employment whether one looks in april or april april through june the effects are a little bit smaller and april through june in part because the economy had already recovered there wasn't as much slack in the economy by the end of the second quarter of 2020. we also see that there really isn't much difference when one looks at different city sizes so this wasn't uh just for large cities or just for small cities it and if one scales this and sort of says well what was the uh fiscal cost of creating a new job for a year uh scaled by the just looking at a month or three months we find that for the results through for april it amounts to about fifty thousand dollars per job year and that is uh a pretty pretty inexpensive relative to the literature suggesting that the fiscal impact was was actually pretty big in areas with low state home orders on the other hand for areas with high state home orders there was basically no impact on employment which suggests that these areas either because of the stay at home orders themselves or because of the conditions that contributed to them that that made people unwilling or or not able to go out um really mitigated the uh potentially large effects of fiscal shocks on the other hand when we're looking at the effects on retail spending there is essentially no no impact uh these are you know largely insignificant results in some cases having the wrong sign suggesting that consumer spending really didn't didn't react and this is consistent with other evidence we have from that period that it was later in the period when uh individual when households began to get checks from the federal government um a lot a very large share of that was was saved rather than spent because in it households really were not in a position to spend money in the way that they normally would in a recession when uh when getting money from the government um what this suggests is that the employment effects that we found in the earlier table we're really coming directly through the fiscal spending that the government was doing through department of defense contracting and not uh also through indirect effects that is uh is considered consumer spending induced by this these initial increases in income which then might have fed back into higher employment and other results that we uh show in the paper uh confirm that this really is a story about uh slack in the labor market and not somehow very large consumer responses uh associated in some other cases with recessions so to summarize what are our key findings our our key findings are that cities with stay at home orders had weakened effects of fiscal policy unemployment actually sharply weaker the fiscal impact uh appears to relate to labor market slack that is there's doesn't seem to be any additional contribution coming from high consumption responses at least in this case and again it's important to stress that this is for a very unusual period one hopes uh that uh the covet 19 led to not just as a deep recession um and we also suggest in the paper that this leads us to the conclusion that economic recovery requires strong public health responses to remove impediments that is again to stress the state arm orders aren't necessarily randomly assigned uh you know simply for the purpose of seeing what effect they have in many cases they were viewed as necessary for public health and without measures to ensure public safety there may not be any alternative to stay-at-home measures um and and this means that there may not be much of an impact of fiscal policy we also argue in the paper based on some work that yuri and dan and i have done recently uh that the shape of fiscal policy uh to deal with uh declines in economic activity has occurred during covet 19 and might occur in other similar situations might better be tailored to specific um firms that are um uh that are particularly in in distress because of big shifts and temporary shifts in economic activity rather than the more common prescription of res for recessions of just general government spending or general transfers to household thank you very much for listening
