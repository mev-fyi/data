hello i want to talk to you today about some new research that uh i've been working out with several colleagues um uh about the age specific the age specificity of infection fatality rates for coven 19. this is joint work with bill hanaj who's a professor at harvard public health school uh gideon merowitz katz who's an epidemiologist in australia and uh kenzie cochrane and sheamus walsh who are recent graduates of dartmouth college um this paper is a systematic review and i'll explain in a moment what that is um it's a meta-analysis and then the end of the paper we look at the public policy implications of what we found so let's dive in the first point is that it's challenging actually to assess the severity of carbon 19. there are several reasons for that one is a lot of cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic um someone loses a sense of taste for a few days or they have really severe headaches some people have described it as the worst flu they've ever had and those asymptomatic and myosin black cases may not show up in any kind of official case reports um another problem is that live virus tests which are called rt pcr um you know there's been variations in availability of those tests over time across different places i'm in the extent to which those tests have been used more for some demographic groups um and less for others in cases where we have good measures of this for example um younger people tend to get tested less than older people and so there's systematic differences across demographic groups um an alternative which has become um you know a very you know much much more common across many locations in the last several months is what's called a zero prevalence study where um they collect specimens um and do antibody tests to detect what fraction of the sample um has been exposed to the virus um those zero prevalence studies uh can you be really helpful in in in assessing how many people have infected but there's a lot of variation in the design of those studies in the sample design and how they report their results one consequence of all this is there's been just this enormous divergence in results about how coveted how severe is co but how dangerous is it and that's fueled in very intense controversy in the public square about how public health measures and communication should respond to this uh to make sure that people are protected um just to give an example here in new york city um this is data as of mid-july um there's eight million people living in new york city there was a zero prevalence study done very carefully by the new york department of health using a a randomized sample that's represented the general population and they estimated that about 1.6 million people in new york city were infected with covid um as of uh that date um about two-thirds of those were symptomatic cases only a tenth of the estimated infections were showed up in case reports twelve percent a fraction of those uh required hospitalization the net bottom line is that only one percent of the infections resulted in fatal outcomes so it's like finding a needle in a haystack but what you should realize is one percent is a very serious very dangerous disease by comparison that's 20 times more dangerous than seasonal flu so here we have at least one benchmark from new york city and again it was a study of new york state and we'll look at those results later but this gives us at least one benchmark a reference point now what are we going to do in our analysis first is to do a systematic review there's a lot of studies i'll show you in a minute we got to sift through them not just zero prevalence studies but also looking at countries that have done tracking and tracing that can be really valuable accompanying evidence because it doesn't rely on antibody tests it's actually using the rtpcr results the next step is to do a meta regression for the included studies and to analyze the relationship between the infection fatality rate and age and each observation in the meta regression is coming from a specific age group for a particular location we also do some out of sample analysis i'll mention that in a minute and we compute population ifrs that's the technical term that means um of the total number of infections in a given location across all age groups what fraction of those resulted in a fatal outcome and so that's a really important way to think about severity of cova okay so the systematic review um we exclude studies that are from non-oecd countries we recognize that developing countries have challenges in health care systems and in reporting of public health data and so that just was beyond the scope of our study we also exclude in a systematic way non-representative samples from hospital patients or blood donors kidney dialysis patients and in the paper explains exactly how we made those decisions so i won't go through them now um then the next step is to do assessment of zero prevalence some studies reported raw prevalence they call it serum positivity the problem with that is that the test sensitivity and specificity are not perfect and so one of the things we do in the paper is to adjust for test characteristics and again the more details there you can read about in the paper and the final step is how to measure fatalities we look at all confirmed covert deaths including nursing homes including hospitals and including people who die at home in all the cases where that data is available and we look at fatalities as of four weeks after the study midpoint let me just show you a picture here why we settled on that is the baseline criteria um the cdc has documented and others have too that um from the point that someone's infected um it takes some time to develop symptoms this figure shows you what happens on average um after the onset of symptoms um the fatalities sometimes happen within a week or ten days but sometimes it's several weeks or a month or more and then there can be a week or two of reporting legs before it becomes part of the official reports so it's really important not to look at fatalities at the same time as the cr prevalence study was done rather to look four weeks later if you want to look at the total um tally that the total death count that corresponds to the number of infections at the time of the study okay this is what's called a meta-analysis flow diagram um it's a it's a standard way of showing meta-analysis of how you sift through the studies you start in this case with 1149. a lot of those are excluded because they weren't oecd countries or they actually didn't report zero prevalence results they had several problems in the paper but it wasn't a problem study so then we review 116 studies in depth we exclude 83 of those for the reasons i already mentioned and what we end up with is 23 zero prevalence studies which includes nine national studies england uh france belgium spain italy portugal um i'm sure i missed one um um anyway you can look in the paper 19 national studies and 14 regional studies including a bunch of regions within the united states as well as five countries that have done comprehensive tracing and what it gives us all together is 108 observations for the meta regression that means 108 um eight specific category where we have zero prevalence and the confidence interval for that age category in that location and then a few more observations that we use for the autosample so here's the results and it's remarkable well i didn't know what we were going to find when we got into this i thought it might be just a total mess but actually there's a remarkably consistent pattern here once you select out um the the studies that we excluded for systematic reasons you start to see a very consistent pattern now in this case the red line is the meta regression estimate it's a log linear regression um so this is on a log scale um the confidence interval is the 95 confidence interval around the meta regression um the the meta regression tech method uses random effects which allows for random deviations across um different observations of different age groups and different locations um so the prediction interval refers to that the different dots in this plot some are representative samples um they designed the study to be representative of the population some are what are called convenience samples which could be that these were samples that were for uh laboratory tests um so they're not as representative but maybe still reasonably representative and then the green squares are the five countries that did comprehensive tracing programs that we identified and again very consistent pattern here um you know clear upward sloping relationship between ifr and age but it's a log scale so what we also do in the paper is to show it in human terms which is what happens to the ifr in percentage points as you move from one age level to another and here we're just showing above age 45 because you can see at the bottom of age groups they all get squeezed down here at very low ifrs but as we go forward into the middle age groups and older adults you can see that it's a very very dangerous disease now we do a lot of sensitivity analysis terms that uh many of you will be familiar with because we're doing stability tests across age categories and we document that this logalia relationship is remarkably stable across the whole spectrum of age groups um and other things that you might be less familiar with like forest plots or funnel charts that are standard in meta-analysis um but not as standard in in many economics and econometrics papers um so then the next step is to look at population ifr and again i wasn't sure what we'd find but this graph seems pretty compelling that once you've screened out some confusing zero prevalence studies or countries that didn't really succeed in doing comprehensive tracing and you move those to the side um you start to see very clear patterns what we're seeing in this picture is that the meta regression explains roughly 90 of the variations across locations in the population ifr i i personally thought that was i did not expect to find that strong of a relationship but what it's telling you is that for example salt lake city and iceland new zealand and geneva have very low population ifrs half a percentage point lower than new york city that we saw before spain lithuania and italy is the highest tier almost three percent population ifr so it's an enormous variation in population ifr across all these different locations but the meta regression tells us that 90 of that variation can be explained by differences in the composition of the age structure of the population and most importantly differences in the extent in which different age groups got infected whether mostly infections happen in young people who aren't very vulnerable versus older people older adults and elderly people who are extremely vulnerable to covid and that's the message of this chart just to put it in context uh we have in the paper comparison with auto vitaly risks and we in the paper he show you for britain too but here just look at the us what you notice is that for people under 35 kobe's actually less dangerous than driving a car um and unfortunately that partly reflects the extent to which some young people don't drive very carefully but as you move into the middle age groups you start to see that kohler becomes 10 20 50 100 times a thousand times more dangerous than driving a car extremely risky and i think a key message there is that for a middle-aged person like me i'm 58 years old to go into a crowded restaurant where there's a substantial risk of my getting infected with cove from someone sitting at a table next to me is a risk that i might not be willing to take that would be like driving an extremely dangerous car or or even worse i'm doing something like free solo climbing which i personally wouldn't do i have a family and i just wouldn't take those kind of risks and so for me it would be irresponsible to put myself in a position where i could be infected with cova because the risks are simply too high the bottom line here is that covert is not just dangerous for the elderly comet's dangerous for middle-aged adults and i think that's important for us to understand as we think about public health measures and communications another key point here is that the population ifr of covet should not be viewed as a fixed parameter that has been done in some economic studies and some other kinds of studies but really i think the message here is that protecting vulnerable age groups can reduce population ifr from one or two percent or more all the way down to uh the success that geneva had and that that salt lake city had um they still had covert infections they still had fatalities but they did a much much better job of protecting older adults and so there's a lot of open issues here this is just one paper more research needs to be done in the role of gender race and ethnicity and comorbidities and influencing ifrs across age groups and understanding more of the differences across locations but we think this is a important start so let me stop there
