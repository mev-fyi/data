uh the u.s inflation rate has fluctuated erratically since the onset of the pandemic and that's led to a big debate about whether movements and inflation are transitory or permanent and there's a great interest in trying to identify what the underlying trend or core level of inflation is once we filter out transitory fluctuations and i'm going to describe some work on that topic that i've done with co-authors at the imf okay here's the background which most viewers of this video will be familiar with um these graphs show the headline inflation rate in the consumer price index since the beginning of 2020. and for each month the graph on the left shows the monthly cpi inflation rate at an annualized level and the graph on the right shows for each month inflation over the previous 12 months which is the statistic which is commonly cited in the media when people analyze inflation if we look at the monthly data on the left we can see quite erratic fluctuations in the headline inflation rate at the start of the pandemic in april that the inflation rate plunged to negative eight percent and then it jumped up over the following two months and then fell again and then jumped all the way up to 10 last summer and back down and up and so on when we look at the 12-month rates the monthly fluctuations get smoothed out somewhat uh but still there have been dramatic movements compared to the recent past for the two decades before 2020 the inflation rate stayed pretty consistently not far from the fed's two percent target uh and here we have seen very big uh deviations and of course uh toward the end of 2021 the upward jumps out started outweighing the downward jumps and if we look at the 12 month average as of november uh 2021 uh the last month of data available as i speak uh the 12-month inflation rate was 6.9 and that's the level which is higher than anything seen since the 1980s and that has obviously alarmed many observers that we have a big inflation problem now these inflation movements have partly reflected developments in the overall economy but they've also been strongly affected by unusual events in specific industries and this has gotten a lot of attention so at the beginning of the pandemics the the downward plunge in inflation had a lot to do with huge price decreases in pandemic related industries like travel um and there was a big spike in used car prices last summer which caused a big increase in the inflation rate uh and so on they've also been big ups and downs and clothing prices the prices of financial services uh and other industries okay here's where the concept of core inflation comes in economists tend to think that inflation movements resulting from big price changes in specific industries or transitory so in april 2020 when the inflation rate went down to minus eight percent we didn't think we were moving permanently to deflation um so this has led economists to try to develop measures of underlying or core inflation that filter out the transitory effects of shocks in certain industries and give a more stable measure of inflation and one which is arguably a better predictor of where inflation is heading in the future than just the current uh headline inflation rate um and so what my co-authors and i are interested in is how can we measure core inflation uh in this episode now the concept of core inflation is not at all new it dates back to the 1970s which of course was an era of high and extremely volatile inflation and the method that was developed in the 1970s for estimating core inflation was very simple it was just to exclude the prices of food and energy when computing inflation rates and that was a successful way of filtering out uh unusual shocks to inflation because in the 1970s the industries that had big price changes were food and energy industries so inflation excluding food and energy gave a relatively stable measure of core inflation in the 1970s and actually has continued to be successful uh from the 1970s all the way up until february 2020 uh the inflation rate excluding food and energy was quite a bit more stable than the headline inflation rate evidence that it was a good measure of core inflation okay here's the here's the problem uh the success of the fed's core inflation measure inflation excluding food and energy has broken down in the last two years uh so here we have the headline inflation rate in blue inflation excluding food and energy in red and excluding food and energy is almost as volatile as the headline inflation rate so the fed's measure of core inflation is actually quite closely follow the ups and the erratic ups and downs and headline inflation with some exception the last two or three months when um the core measure is filtered out the effects of rising energy prices so the fed's measure of core has not risen as much as headline inflation but still all in all over the last two years if we think a core measure of inflation should filter out short-run fluctuations and headline of the fed's measure has not been very successful now this graph illustrates why the fed's measure has not been very successful so here we're looking at the example of one month uh april 2021 and this is an interesting month because it's a month when the headline inflation rate spiked up to about 10 percent it was the beginning of a run of several months of high inflation that led to the outbreak of substantial concerns about inflation last summer so for april 2020 the graph is a histogram of industry inflation rates it shows what fraction of industries weighted by the importance of industries in the economy had inflation rates in different ranges and we can see a couple of things uh first of all in most industries nothing dramatic happened so there are a lot of industries with inflation rates clustered around zero but also quite clearly there's a big skewness in the distribution there's a big tale of industries with inflation rates that were very high notice by the way the numbers on the horizontal axis are not annualized so 10 inflation in a month is well over 100 at an annualized rate um so there are probably no surprises and what industries had uh big inflation rates so the famous used cars shows up uh car rental prices had an even big increase uh although that's a much smaller part of the economy than used cars um now and the key point is that the uh industries and the tails are not food and energy so the industries in red or the food network energy industries uh nothing special happened in those industries so if you filter out the effects of food and energy prices it doesn't make much difference uh food and energy inflation uh inflation excluding food and energy for this month was about ten percent the same as headline inflation um okay um all right now this is probably not news that used car prices went up a lot and that affected inflation um this kind of pattern has led some people to do ad hoc adjustments to the inflation rate to try to reduce the effects of outliers so people in the media compute inflation rates excluding used car prices some people go a little further and have inflation excluding the prices of any auto related uh goods or services so you get rid of used car of car rental prices uh as well um other people have made lists of industries that have been strongly affected by coved and said let's exclude the prices in all these industries to get a measure of core inflation instead officials have sometimes gone so far is to say let's get rid of all the prices of goods which can be affected by supply chain problems and just look at the prices of services as a measure of core inflation and all these different approaches take out some of the big price increases and give you a lower inflation rate we think however that this is not the ideal measure ideal way to measure core inflation for one thing it's complicated to keep track of all the prices in different industries and to decide each month which prices we exclude from our inflation measure which prices should we include also this kind of ad hoc way of taking out certain prices is subject to abuse in every month there are some industries with higher price increases than other industries and if you're out to make the inflation rate look lower you can take out the prices of whichever industries have the highest inflation rates for that matter if you want to make the inflation rate look higher you can take out the prices of industries with the lowest inflation rates so what we would like to have is some approach that effectively filters out crazy fluctuations and used car prices or whatever else are outliers in the distribution but which does so in a simple way that's easy to implement and doesn't require subjective judgments about which industries to include or exclude fortunately uh such methods exist and in fact have existed for quite a while so what we want to advocate is a good way of measuring core inflation is what we call outlier exclusion measures of core arguably the simplest of these is the cleveland fed's weighted median inflation rate and this is actually quite old it was developed in the 1990s and we think that this measure should have been getting more attention for for quite a while and the basic idea of the cleveland fed measure is just to use a median or in other words if you look at the histogram look at the midpoint of the distribution of industry inflation rates um and that gets rid of the effects of outliers if you have an industry uh which has a higher inflation rate than the median if you move it you know way out uh to a very very high inflation rate that doesn't affect the median so a median is an effective way of filtering out outliers and it does it very simply and automatically now another version of the outlier exclusion class of core measures which has gotten some attention is the dallas fed's trim demean which it applies to the p personal consumption expenditure deflator measure of inflation which is something the fed likes to focus on the dallas fed doesn't just look at the median it takes the histogram and it chops off the top 24 of the uh inflation rates and the bottom 31 of the inflation rates which is a different way of making sure that whatever way out in the tails gets gets removed now in practice these two measures are quite similar there are esoteric issues about the pros and cons of trim means versus medians and why the dallas fed cuts off different amounts from the top and the bottom of the distribution but i won't get into that right now at the bottom line is that both of these methods and other variations on these methods are quite effective at removing the biggest uh price changes um and isolating a stable measure of core inflation even before the pandemic there was considerable research on measures of core inflation that found that these measures were less volatile than xfe inflation inflation excluding food and energy and also more closely related to economic slack uh the the economic theory the phillips curve says that poor inflation should be related to economic slack and there's evidence that these outlier exclusion measures have that property now in fact uh the bank of canada uh in revising its monetary framework periodically did a lot of research with canadian data on different measures of core inflation and in 2016 uh the bank of canada officially decided to get rid of their previous measure of core inflation uh which was quite similar to inflation excluding food and energy and instead to adopt a weeded median and a trimmed mean as their primary measures of core inflation so that's canada in the united states the federal reserve is still using a 1970s era measure of core inflation inflation excluding excluding food and energy which was effective at filtering out um uh big industry price changes in the past but not in the last two years so uh so we think there's been evidence for a while that there's a case for moving towards the weighted median of tremendous measures of core inflation um but that evidence we think has become much stronger in the last two years because our preferred measures have been quite a bit more stable than inflation excluding food and energy which is shown in this picture so in this graph um again we have monthly inflation rates annualized on the left and 12 month inflation rates on the right we again have the headline inflation rate but now we compare it to the cleveland fed's weighted median and again whether you look at a weighted median or a trim to mean doesn't matter very much for this kind of picture and what we see here is that even at the monthly level um the the black line the weighted median effectively filters out the erratic ups and downs in the headline rate so we do not get a plunge in inflation in april 2020 we do not get the big upward spikes um last summer um if we look at the 12-month inflation rate the weighted median is very smooth it changes very little month to month it changes somewhat over time but those changes make sense from the point of view of macroeconomics uh and in particular from the point of view of the phillips curve that says core inflation should be related to economic slack so basically what happened is that in 2020 when the economy was weak core inflation is measured by the way the median drifted downward and more recently in 2021 uh we've seen a rise in core inflation which is what one would expect given the economic recovery and the fact that we have a very tight labor market with a very high level of job openings so overall uh the way the median is performed well we think as a measure of core inflation now finally if one accepts the idea that this kind of outlier exclusion measure is a good measure of core inflation that has some implications for interpreting uh where we are right now so again let's look at the latest available data 12 month inflation as of november 2021 again it's pretty alarming if we look at headline inflation either for the cpi or for the pce deflator it is not so alarming if we look at the current level of the median cpi inflation rate or the dallas fed's trimmed mean for the pce deflator inflation rate so median cpi is 3.5 percent it was just about 3.0 percent on the eve of the pandemic so not that much higher um a pce deflator inflation rate of 2.8 percent uh is not alarming the fed has said that it wants to overshoot its long run and target of two percent somewhat um to make up for the fact that inflation was below 2 for a long time after the 2008 financial crisis so maybe 2.8 percent is not that far off from what the fed would like now i do want to qualify that and say how alarmed we should be with inflation depends on whether we look at the snapshot of where we are right now or whether we look at the direction where we're heading so again going back to the graph if we look at the black line on the right the level is not too high but it's heading in an upward direction so if it continues to head in an upward direction for a few more months the inflation situation will get more and more alarming so so in the end i am definitely not going to prognosticate about where inflation is heading in the future that has worked out badly for me in the past as well as for other people in the past so i'm going to retreat to the safe position that we need to carefully watch incoming data to see what happens to inflation you know the one less vacuous thing i'll say is that watching incoming data we should focus on the cleveland fed media inflation rate and the dallas fed trimmed mean inflation rate as good indicators of what's happening to inflation and not pay so much attention to the more widely reported headline inflation rate and inflation made excluding food and energy
