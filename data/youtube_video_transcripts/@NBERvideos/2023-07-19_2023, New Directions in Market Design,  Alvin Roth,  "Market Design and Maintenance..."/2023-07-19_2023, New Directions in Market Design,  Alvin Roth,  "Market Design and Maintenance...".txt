okay so so I was asked to speak a little bit about the fact that this is sort of 25 years after uh economists started getting involved in Market design and you know I should emphasize that market design is an ancient human activity right not invented by economists but um but economists have finally gotten the confidence to to start talking about the rules of the game and and to help think about markets and how to fix them when they're broken and and so some of that started about 25 years ago and what I'm going to do today is is just take you back to three of those 25 or so years ago design projects and tell you what's become of those markets today and what their current problems are because uh because Market design isn't one and done markets live in in complicated environments that change so it's a little bit like like building a house after you've built it or or extensively renovated a house the world changes and you need to do new things maybe maybe you in the interim you've bought an electric car and when you built the house they weren't electric cars so now you need to redo the electrical system and that's the case with markets too because um because the world changes so uh so I'm going to tell you about three now venerable Market design projects one is the market for new doctors that's a market that in its current form actually started in 1951 without the help of of economists and I got involved in about 25 years ago in 1995 uh and and the the efforts then were around building and designing centralized centralized Clearinghouse that would solve problems of congestion in the process of making offers and acceptances and as you'll see today that market is having new problems of congestion not with offers and acceptances the the centralized Clearinghouse is working fine but in the earlier process of applications and interviews problems that that are also going to come up when I talk about the market for new PhD economists uh which again you know well it doesn't predate the the uh the the entry of economists but the that market really became thick only in the 1970s when the job openings for economists got started and that created a thick market for for economics some of you in computer science for instance maybe in job markets that that are less thick now you know where Word of Mouth still passes you know uses what um is how job notices are are circulated um but but we're having some interesting developments in the job market for new economists that have to do with the fact that interviewing has moved earlier than the meetings and that some of the coordination effects that used to happen from the national meetings are not happening anymore and then finally I'll talk to you about uh kidney exchange where you know first kidney Exchange in the United States happened in in 2000 economists including so I'm sitting here uh have been involved in that since shortly after and that's a market where where there's been continual adaptation and the difference between the first two and the third Market is the first two are labor markets that really happen only once a year and so they get tested and and refined and and attacked uh only occasionally of course kidney exchange happens every day so uh that's something where in order to move kidney exchange along we've been in a process of constant renovation if you like okay so so to to fix ideas let's think about how practical Market design is different for mechanism design and here's the sort of famous for Which diagram which says if you're a mechanism designer you control a universe in which you can create the strategies that players have in the games that they play and and design them in order to get uh desired results uh but of course if you're a market designer you're mostly designing marketplaces and the mechanism sits in a small Corner in a small part of a large economic environment and that economic environment can change over time and it involves other strategies than the ones that involve in participating in the mechanism in particular people may have to decide whether to participate in the mechanism or not uh and it may involve other players as well and these things are these are a changing environment and so the things I'm going to tell you about today have to do with Marketplace adaptations to the changing environment and so let me start with the labor market for new doctors which has just completed you know yet another year of activity but but it has a long history starting in 1900 when when internships were developed so so now in order to be licensed to practice medicine in the United States it's not enough to have an MD degree you have to be licensed and to be licensed you have to do some kind of practical training in a hospital that's today the first year of it is still called an internship is today called a residency um and what what happened in the early 1900s was the dates of appointment got earlier and earlier uh from year to year and we're going to see that something like that is threatening to happen in the economics PhD market so so keep that in mind uh and and various kinds of fixes were made that that worked only in completely about the the times of appointment dates and the uh the processing of offers and acceptances there was congestion lots of things had to happen in short times but eventually uh in in the 1950s uh a centralized Clearinghouse was developed which which had high rates of orderly participation uh it worked well for for quite a while but one of the things that changed in the in the external environment you know outside of the mechanism was the composition of the medical labor force so in the 1950s almost every new graduate with with an MD in the United States was a man and by 1970s about 10 of the graduates were women and today it's it's fully half and so um so what we started to see was was Couples uh going on the labor force needing two jobs and that the Clearing House wasn't working well for that and that's how I got involved in uh starting in 1995 uh redesigning the algorithm so would be friendly to the new demographics of of Medicine so for a long time now that that's been in place for a while and it's been working very well last year we had something like 1200 couples uh so so uh you know 2400 doctors going through the mattress couples uh so the the way the the that mechanism works the the mechanism sitting in the larger market is people uh formulate rank orderless here's my first choice my second choice my third choice on both sides of the market for for so doctors are ranking positions residency programs residency programs or ranking doctors then it goes through a deferred acceptance algorithm appropriately modified uh and then they they have a celebration on Match Day and there's there's a scramble the scramble actually happens earlier than match day so its results can be announced on Match day but that's the mechanism it's been in place you know it hasn't been changed in the last 25 years seems to be working fine but before you can enter that mechanism you have to form those preferences and uh one of the big things that's changed over time is that applications have become electronic that's of course not just true in medicine it's true in college admissions it's true in economics uh so that makes it easy to apply to lots of places so there are over time there have been increasingly many applications and then uh programs have to decide employers have to decide who to interview and that's hard to do when you have hundreds of applications for each position and so they've had increasingly many interviews because if you're going into a match a centralized Clearinghouse that's going to use the Deferred acceptance algorithm it's good to have long lists of preferences because you're not sure where you're going to end up so if you go on lots of interviews you can have long lists and be on Long lists of preferences and they've been running into congestion problems too many applications to look at too many interviews to run how to decide which ones so they've started to adapt signaling which I'll tell you about more it's also something we developed in the economics Market about 20 years ago uh but they're but they're having a lot of discussion about this and some of it is um is not to what Market designers would consider to be to the point uh the the a lot of the discussion talks about this whole process as the match and and it fails to notice which parts are working well and which parts are working badly so there's been a symphony of suggestions in the medical literature about what to do one of them signaling which I'll talk to you about another one is interview matching where's itai has been prominent in that who's here uh uh limits on applications or interviews which you can imagine have some serious Market design too much consequences and you have to think of how you were going to limit applications and interviews and then there was one that I'm going to tell you about just because sometimes you have to play defense in Market design as well as offense uh there was a really ill-conceived proposal for an early match which was gonna gonna in in OB GYN In Obstetrics and Gynecology there was a proposal that got some traction to to have two matches and the first one would require each employer each program to only match half of its positions after which another match would be done for the other half so those of you who know about stable matching know that this is a crazy idea because people may matched in the first match wouldn't necessarily get matched to to where they wanted to be because where they wanted to be only had half its positions available in the first match so so if I was someone who was going to be you're you're an employer your second choice and you have two positions and you're only allowed to use one of them in the early match you matched to to someone you like better than me in the first choice and I matched somewhere else in the early match and now in the late match we both uh are sorry not to be able to match to each other but we're already matched to someone else so this is something that that would create instabilities and would also harm many applicants and and proposals and and proposers it took a long time to to convince the medical community that this was a bad idea and we may possibly have done that you know etai and I and some colleagues have have a paper just last month uh going through years of data to make the simple point that I just made uh and and the you know the last line is you know it produces lots of instabilities things like that you know looking at the years of data but but what seems to be the winning uh political argument is harm more applicants than it would help and so I think but I'm not yet sure that this proposal is is Dead on Arrival but um but you know part of Market design is is playing defense protecting things that work against ideas that would uh would vandalize them okay so I want to tell you about signaling in in the medical market and let me just remind you that that uh about 20 years ago uh this large Committee of uh of the American economic Association instituted this procedure where new economists going on the market can signal that they're interested in interviews so there's a process of applications and interviews in economics new PhD Market also uh there was there's congestion you know uh lots of universities get many many more applications and they have positions we used to uh interview with the meetings that's changing but one of the things we did to Oregon and help organize the interviews was to allow uh signaling of interest in interviews well the Medical Specialties knowing about economics that that's been a a big part of their discussion uh specialty by specialty have decided to use signals and in economics uh do we allow people to have two signals that's partly because of concern about what allowing many signals would do but but but in in uh medicine they there's been some experimentation so we're going to learn more about this and many of those numbers are small you know so adult neurology allows three signals anesthesiology allows five but orthopedic surgery allows 30 signals okay so the thing about 30 signals of course is that when you allow 30 signals now now I'm an employer and you guys are new doctors and I think you have 30 signals and you couldn't even send me one you must not be very interested so 30 signals are starting in the data to act as a soft cap on the number of applications you can still submit 120 applications but you only send 30 signals and you're you're this is going to help organize the the interview uh process in a way that may or may not be good because we still have to see whether uh lots of the same people will get this get all the interviews uh or or whatever but but um but that's in process they've only done that a year and In Obstetrics these are the these are our colleagues who were also interested in the early match they've decided to have uh 18 signals three gold and 15 silver so we we avoided that in economics also for uh but but haven't seen their data yet so uh so this is in progress in other words they're having they they had trouble in the past in congestion with order offers and uh acceptances now they're having trouble with applications and interviews and that's an important part of the market you know a lot of my colleagues who who help operate the match say this has nothing to do with us you know we're the the mechanism at the end of the road and and what I sort of say to them is you know if you run a popular restaurant and the city tears up the road in front of your restaurant you have a problem even though the food is still good if people can't get to the rest let's go up uh you know the market is having a problem and so so we're you know deep in discussions about that okay so because I because because medicine their early problems started with unraveling and and proceeded also in in you know other Specialties over time and because I'm going to talk to you next about economics I want to remind you what unraveling looks like and what it looks like is year after year when you look at the interviews and awkward process they get earlier and early okay when you know unraveling is a process where the market is in disequilibrium and the market this is gastroenterology it's another Medical Market uh but but the the market not only gets early it gets diffuse in time so the black dots here are interviews the yellow dots are uh offers and uh and what you see is lots of lots of offers start to be made before other firms have even started to interview okay here's a different graph of the same thing each of these horizontal lines is some employer when they when they could possibly have made their earliest offer and what's the latest possible date that that offer was open to so these lines are much longer than they are in reality but we're working with noisy data but what you see we drew a red line I drew a red line here in the middle uh what you see is uh a lot of programs are finished making offers before other programs have even started and that's what the idea of exploding offers come from is that you might be a hot item on the market but the places you're really interested in are planning to interview in higher late in the year you get an early interview and offer and you have to answer before you know whether you can get a job later so that's a problem that uh many markets have unraveled and uh it seems to you know the market design issues it seems to have to do with markets where you can make exploding offers and where commitments or bindings Okay so so let me now tell you about the market for new PhD economists and many of you have some point participated in that market uh and some of you might might be just about to okay so here's a picture meant to remind you of the picture I just showed you uh of the medical Market the the market for new economists begins with job ads in the in the Joe the job opening for economists and now a number of other sources as well uh it's become electronic over time it wasn't always so it's now easy to make lots of applications so an application is no longer as strong a signal of Interest as it once was when when applications needed their own cover letters and uh and other accoutrements uh so there are lots and lots of applications and reference letters which also now go through clearinghouses and in economics we've developed a signaling procedure to help relieve some of the congestion about deciding who to interview uh and those interviews used to happen at the aea meetings in first weekend in January but they didn't this year and over coveted they didn't they they happened uh by Zune and zoom meetings are pretty nice it turns out so they may not be going away um so uh so the congestion problem is easing in maybe in interviewing because you can interview over a longer period of time but now we don't go through a centralized Clearinghouse we have flyouts which because the interviews are getting more dispersed in time the fly outs have been getting more dispersed in time and offers are now more dispersed in time that is the having the AAA meetings and all the interviews the second weekend in first weekend in January uh used to discipline the the time at which offers could be made and how dispersed they could be and that's no longer the case so uh you know so now the process of fly outs and negotiations and second visits uh are taking place over a longer period of time and this is sort of an early warning it hasn't gotten tremendously out of hand yet but it looks like we might be starting to see the beginning of unraveling in the economics PhD Market with dispersed early offers with early deadlines so we've been collecting they has been collecting focus groups and there are a bunch of markets that move earlier than the economics job market but higher economics phds so the European Market has earlier meetings uh the agriculture Aggie agricultural economics has uh goes earlier marketing marketing departments sometimes hire PhD economists they go quite a bit earlier uh industry the Nash the association of business economists uh has a Tech Conference in November that's a job market conference so lots of people who hire economists are going earlier than the AAA meetings uh but so are other economists so uh many economics departments aren't allowed by their Deans to make multiple offers for a position safe to make offers sequentially so they really want to know you know you're our first choice but if you're not going to come we really want to go to our second choice quickly so let us know by tomorrow uh and and uh you know that that makes it hard to for the market to function the way we like um and that includes many liberal arts colleges includes many federal agencies which are regulated not to make multiple offers uh and then there are some late movers among which are the Elite research universities typically who benefit from everyone being able to look at everyone because if you're at Harvard or Stanford or MIT you you have some presumption that maybe people are interested in in your job should you make them but also lots of universities don't convene until late in January they want semester systems and and they're you know there they are and some of their candidates who they interviewed are are gone by the time they can get their committees together so here we're in a period of disequilibrium as well which I'm not optimistic about I've I've studied many markets in disequilibrium of this sort and I guess that we're going to go through some more but there's there's been efforts to uh to have guidelines and uh the finance Association has had the the toughest guidelines which said that the American Finance Association doesn't consider early acceptances before they pick the date I think February 20th to be binding that is they said as we have successfully done in some medical markets they said if you get an early offer and take it you can change your mind because there's a a date before which you're not supposed to have to make a firm decision incidentally in universities we do this with Graduate Admissions and so April 15th is a magic date for for Graduate Admissions and the Council of graduate schools has just such a policy which says if you accept an early offer you can change your mind before April 15th uh so so when if you're involved in recruiting new PhD students you've seen rules like this but it remains to be seen whether they're gonna these rules whether you can in fact convince new Finance graduates new economics graduates and the people who hire them that that it's actually feasible to accept an offer and then change your mind that works in some cultures and not in others in gastroenterology that turns out to work so we made such a rule in gastroenterology and it's not that we see lots of early offers and changing Minds it's that we stopped seeing the early offers and that allowed gastroenterology to move into a centralized Clearinghouse at a much later date than they've been hiring we tried to do the same thing with orthopedic surgery and orthopedic surgery said there's no way that someone is going to accept an offer from some senior surgeon and then later change their mind but it turns out the orthopedic surgery professional organizations have much more compulsory power than the American economic Association does so what they did in orthopedic surgery they said if people make early offers we won't allow them to present papers at our at our national meeting so uh so so we're gonna have to explore in economics what we can do and what we can't I'm hopeful that if we can move the the elite universities to a to a say they're keep them at their traditional position that the weight of that will will stop some of the unraveling that lots of the candidates for these earlier positions are people who might turn down the earlier positions if they if they think they by waiting could get a much better position and that might temper some of the very early offers but it remains to be seen okay so lastly let me talk to you a little bit about kidney exchange which also predates the the work of economists uh the first kidney exchange was uh was done in in the Rhode Island Hospital in in the year 2000 in the United States and a kidney exchange is a a way of taking a pair so very quickly you can get a kidney from a live donor because healthy people have two kidneys and can remain healthy with one there's a big shortage of kidneys so so increasing the availability of transplants is a good thing uh here's a pair that that that make that's hot it's basically incompatible donor one can't give the recipient one but could give to someone else's recipient and vice versa so kidney exchange is looking for exchanges of kidneys where where you can get more uh more more transplants and in 2004 uh uh typhoon and not go and I helped Frank Delmonico and a number of his Surgical and and medical colleagues to form the first inter-hospital kidney exchange which started to make the market thick we've formed a program New England program for kidney exchange which United the 14 transplant centers in New England and allowed them to exchange kidneys uh and that was that got off to a very slow start when nephe finally closed its doors uh many years later in in 2011 so seven years later they'd only managed to do 83 exchanges because it turns out there's lots of difficulties to overcome and one of them is that those you know simple paired exchanges aren't really sufficient to to to make the market thick enough because of the the problem that jevin's told us about about the double coincidence of wants it's it's hard to do Straight border but one of the things we learned to do over a period of years is long chains started by non-directed donors so a lot of kidney exchangers today look don't look like those two pairs but they look like like you know someone starts off and gives a kidney to to a patient who whose donor then passes it forward and those chains can get quite long you know this is the picture that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine this one appeared in in People magazine and uh the the last the last donor left hanging there because she's blood type A B this lady named uh Helena McKinney uh took two years it was sort of a mistake to end with her but it took two years to find her an appropriate uh recipient in the kidney exchange pool and she she was good and she extended the picture to have another dozen people in it so sometimes you can get a lot of exchanges going and that's helped a lot uh those really became part of standard practice only in 2011 uh work that that and others have done uh and and so in the US we we are growing the number of kidney exchanges right in 2021 you can see covet in the in the picture uh you know here's the kovid year uh um living donor surgeries or elective surgeries so at the beginning of cobit they just shut down uh but you know we're we're going up and so we we get about not quite 10 of the of the living donor transplants in the U.S are now done by kidney exchange so you know along that road are many Market design Innovations uh you know so I could tell you about Victory after Victory but it's in a war that we are losing right so diabetes is epidemic uh the there are roughly a hundred thousand people on the waiting list for deceased donors uh right now there are six hundred thousand people on dialysis so so you know this this story is far from done so one way to and one reason is far from done is some people are very hard to transplant they have lots of antibodies they uh they they need a very big pool a very thick Market to find a compatible kidney so one thing to do is to try to erase National borders so so here's a picture that shows you uh per million population donation in blue of deceased uh donors and in Orange of living donors and what you see is in which countries with good Medical Systems we we are still mostly uh depending on on deceased donors but in poorer countries it's hard to set up a widespread deceased donor program because you need you know good hospitals everywhere whereas you can have living donation at a few good hospitals in your Capital so so as you as you see countries that do fewer you see they depend more and more on living donation and so there's an opportunity for them and also across borders to expand kidney exchange where where it'll be particularly valuable in places where they do lots of of living donation uh so our first attempt at doing this uh was inviting a Mexican pair the lady standing next to me in the picture that with the yellow uh dress is uh Marisol Robles and uh she entered an American chain that would have ended with donation to a deceased donor because the American donor was 67 uh and and lots of American surgeons think 67 is old which is puzzling because you know I remember I wasn't so old when I was 67. but um but but anyway you know that that's become something that we can try to do because they don't yet have active uh kidney Exchange in Mexico although we're working hard to build it there not Everyone likes this you know one of the things I study is repugnance uh so here's a uh the head of the Spanish organ transplant organization saying that the ont the the national transplant organization of Spain has uh prevented the entry in Europe of a new form of organ trafficking proposed by a winner of the Nobel prize in economics uh so so she and I are at buddies we we and we we were on the same panel in uh Buenos Aires at a big biannual meeting this past summer uh but fortunately the this idea of Crossing Borders in and making it easy because it's gaining ground here's an article on the Lancet by by a bunch of moral philosophers including Peter singer who's the sort of the founder of the effective altruism movement and he says uh he says a lot of things he says a lot of sensible things but he finally he ends with you know misguided objections should not be allowed to prevent the global kidney exchange from realizing its potential to reduce suffering and save the lives of rich and poor patients alike so so we're getting some we're making some progress there and we're making of course progress in the places where we do this so here's that that particular kidney exchange that I just showed you was on the front page of Newsweek an espanol where where they said you know this was in 2017 I think just as U.S president Donald Trump is seeking to build a wall of thousands of miles on the border with Mexico a tile a surgeon an economist joined forces to exchange organs between citizens of both countries so so I think there's a prospect that what we'll be able to do in kidney exchanges is somewhat if not a race lower International borders and that that will be a good thing but it's not an easy thing uh but but just incidentally on that front I I got to go to Abu Dhabi uh in the summer of 2021 for the first kidney exchange between Israel and the UAE and the story there is both countries are small both of them have populations about 10 million and that's not enough to to do kidney exchange on a scale that allows you to to transplant the highly sensitized patients but so so I think it's an important thing for small countries I'm on my way this weekend to Croatia with that message there's only four million croatians but um but another way to think about it is you know before I showed you the the graph that the doctors like which is how countries do uh per million population but of course you can also look at who's doing lots of transplants and people are doing lots of transplants if they have lots of people so after the US there's China and India and Brazil and extending kidney exchange there in those places has has different problems so for instance in India they don't allow non-directed donations so there's a a wonderful uh transplant nephrologist named vivekute in Ahmedabad in the state of Gujarat who who have had an opportunity to work with and he arranges long cyclic exchanges you know here's a 10 pair cycle and needless to say there's lots of logistics and planning and getting agreement he has everybody in this cycle meet beforehand so not anonymously which is how we do most exchanges in the US and anonymously here's the meat non-anonymously and all agree that we're in this together and this is sort of a market design Innovation that comes a little bit or resembles what's been done in microfinance of of getting a bunch of borrowers to agree that they're all in this together and will be mutually responsible for each other uh so we're trying to help him uh change the law but in the meantime there are Market design solutions that let him make progress so and and there are you know you can get good transplants so uh so here I am watching a surgeon in Ahmedabad with a da Vinci robot so fancy fancy surgical technique the patient is off to the right the when I came into the or the the surgeon got up and and we shot his hand to shake hands and he wasn't wearing gloves and I wasn't wearing gloves you know he's not in the sterile field so there's a there will come a time with even more reliable internet when he doesn't have to be in the same hospital so there are going to be other ways to to erase boundaries um so let me end here by saying that uh you know the the marketplace that we designed the mechanism that was designed sits in a larger economic environment the larger economic environment is changing and so part of Market design like building a house after you build the house you have and you have to maintain it and and you know building a house and renovating it and and then maintaining it one just melts into the other you know I say this as someone who moved into an house about 10 years ago and we've stopped renovating it but we still know how to reach the contractors because every now and then something doesn't work the way it used to uh thank you
