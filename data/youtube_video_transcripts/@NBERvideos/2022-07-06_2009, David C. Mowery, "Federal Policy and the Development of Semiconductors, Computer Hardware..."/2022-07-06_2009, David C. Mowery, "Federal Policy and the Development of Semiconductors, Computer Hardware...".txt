at mit perhaps we get in touch in boston okay uh good morning ladies and gentlemen let's get going again so if you could take your seats thank you i would like to introduce uh for our second panel of the morning we have two presentations and the first is by professor david mowry of the house school of business at berkeley and he will be talking about the development of u.s information technology focusing particularly on computers and semiconductors david over to you well it's a pleasure to be here uh i'm uh as suggested i'm the first of a tag team talking about the broad i.t sector and i'm really focusing on these three what effectively are new industries that come out of the u.s economy and the post-war period semiconductors hardware and software and i want to emphasize a couple of points here first is that these new industries really benefited enormously from federal r d investments particularly defense-related r d investments but the effects of federal policy on the growth of these industries to accelerate uh innovation uh relied on additional policy instruments particularly in the areas of federal procurement defense related procurement anti-trust and i.p policy and i think this this reflects my focus in particular on sort of a broader uh conceptualization of uh innovation as it relates particularly to energy uh technologies which is as ashish aurora mentioned we need to worry a great deal about the speed with which these technologies can be commercially applied and adopted in addition to the speed with which they are created and i think this is an area where federal uh policy was particularly uh significant in uh certainly in semiconductors and hardware and to a lesser extent in software the other uh theme i think that comes out at least the theme that i see in my remarks is the institutional innovation you see operating in all three of these areas during the post-1945 period we have universities playing a variety of roles we have industry playing a variety of roles and and the feds as well uh intervening in unusual ways so i i think that has uh at least some implications potentially for the energy field the the last area where i think the i.t story may be uh more complicated in its implications for energy r d particularly uh for climate change as we sit here today is that much of what i'm talking about is federal policy at the dawn of these industries during a period in which federal agencies and federal spending constituted a much greater share of both the r d spending in these industries and the demand for the products of many of these industries in the energy field we face a very very different situation and that i think has some cautionary implications for the ease with which we draw conclusions uh from this story for energy r d so let me talk about semiconductors uh first and then i'll talk about hardware and software really summarizing kind of the early history of federal policy and and innovation um the origins of of the uh transistor really date back to a program of uh r d that began in the 30s and expanded considerably during wartime d on semiconducting materials that focus particularly on electronics and radar technologies taken up uh and expanded by bell labs during and after uh world war ii the bell labs research team headed by william shockley however was very much engaged in a race uh a discover a basic science race really with uh with university researchers at purdue but having beaten the purdue team who were federally funded uh signal corps u.s signal core funding to effectively invent the first transistor industry subsequently really takes the lead in developing the technology and and i think one of the greatest illustrations of the gap between industrial and academic uh research in this field particularly uh in applied areas was the fact that frederick turman then the provost at stanford university when shockley semiconductor was enticed by turman and others to locate very close to the stanford campus sent one of his very junior faculty members uh jim gibbons uh out to shockley semiconductor to sort of camp there for a couple of years and learn about semiconductor technology in order to develop uh sufficient know-how and understanding of the technology to be able to teach uh semiconductor technology and particularly processing technology so you have a situation here in which universities were trying to learn from industry uh reversing the usual stereotypical progression here uh the bell labs uh presence in semiconductor technology transistor technology was particularly significant because bell labs was the target of a federal anti-trust suit that influenced in many respects the uh decisions by bell labs to open up its uh technology portfolio to other industrial and academic actors under partly an indirect effect i think of the anti-trust suit was at t's sponsorship of seminars on transistor technology in the early 50s and much more significant was as part of the settlement of the federal anti-trust uh suit the cro the decision by at t both to limit its commercial exploitation in non-telecom markets of transistor uh technology to limit its activities as a seller of transistors and more importantly to license to its very large portfolio of patents so this really a step opens up the patent portfolio of the leading industrial practitioner of this technology and equally importantly it establishes a a tradition if you will of extensive cross-licensing of technologies in this industry because at t in exchange for its licenses requested a reciprocal cross license so you have a great deal of cross licensing that that emerges within this industry the military became extremely interested in transistor technology for applications in both computers and guidance and navigation systems and uh invested substantially in uh r d within the industry initially really investing heavily in production process technology but over time moving into trying to support the development of uh product technologies interestingly however and again revealing this the importance of federal procurement demand the the firms that over time entered the industry uh accounted for a relatively small share of r d contracts however they grew rapidly to occupy a much more significant role as sellers and uh to the military and to the defense related agencies of transistor and related semiconductor components so you have again this issue of the the procurement lever uh in some ways uh being of great significance to new entrant firms uh and in some respects outweighing the early significance of r d spending texas instruments enters uh uh really pursues the development of the integrated circuit in the hopes of gaining a large uh dod procurement uh contract in the late 1950s primarily for guided missiles and this too is an illustration of one of the direct effects as well as the lingering and ongoing indirect effects of procurement policy on the industry's development dod awarded procurement contracts to relatively new firms supporting entry in addition this allowed these these uh entrants to ride the learning curve down to lower the costs of their products and to support the adoption of these technologies in non-military applications as the price went down their attractiveness for commercial applications in a broader array of industries and products expanded and importantly the requirements of dod procurement contracts directed as they were to new firms with uncertain production uh capabilities dod required that these firms have as a backup a second source for products so that there was no single firm particularly a new firm who was the sole supplier this require in turn induced a great deal of exchange of know-how and production technology among firms so you have once again a lot of know-how flowing among firms not just through cross licenses but through the effects of these uh second source requirements so summarizing the semiconductor story and galloping along over an extensive history here really r d funding is of great importance particularly in the early years but procurement policy both the magnitude of procurement purchases and the policies that were uh implemented as part of these procurement buys were also extremely important antitrust and procurement policy reduced entry barriers and supported these inner firm flows of technology the the potentially very strong exclusionary effects the ability of patent holders to block others from either entry or developing similar products we're to a great extent limited but by both the licensing by t of its patent portfolio and the cross licensing of patents uh that develops and at t's potential dominance as a commercial producer as a as a supplier of components also was forestalled uh by the um uh by the settlement of the uh of the usva tnt uh suit what is interesting as well i think is the extent to which this military influence on the evolution of the semiconductor industry declines over time and i think one of the as military demand declines as a share of overall industry output and as military r d declines as a share of industry r d spending the clearest illustration of this is the very high speed integrated circuit program of the 1980s and 90s which really represented an effort by the defense department to sort of get back into and redirect and reattract the interest of commercial producers of semiconductor components in the military market uh and and in effect the hsic spent a considerable amount of three-quarters of a billion dollars or so on r d and related procurement with a view to trying to bring these uh firms back in to a role as major military suppliers but its effects were quite limited simply because so much of the non-military market and uh r d uh uh budget had expanded uh significantly so the the federal direct federal influence through these historically important levers over the evolution of semiconductor technology in the industry i think it declined significantly now computer hardware presents a very interesting contrast in in some ways and similarities in others likes the transistor like semiconductors computers uh really originated in world war ii uh uh military r d programs but interestingly and in contrast to the situation in semiconductors universities were initially uh some of the key players not just as sources of basic research but as sources of technology development harvard was uh and the university of pennsylvania were among the the pioneering uh developers of some of the earliest computers and mit through lincoln labs really was the prime contractor if you will for what was the first major federal application of computer technology in a defense related uh uh area the uh the semi-auto automated ground environment uh sage uh air defense system very large system of linked computers that ran a set of radar installations to warn against uh soviet uh bombing raids so universities begin as major sources of really development as well as basic research over time their role changes as industry comes in as an important player in the development area nevertheless industry is substantially supported through federal r d supporting us over half of overall computer-related r d at major firms during the 1950s dod and the national science foundation however also begin to invest heavily in the creation of essentially a human capital and academic research infrastructure during the 1950s and 1960s federal agencies make major contributions to uh academic r d and also uh purchase the mainframes that really form the nucleus of many university computer science departments at places like duke and stanford and elsewhere and you see that phd granting computer science programs grow rapidly in number from a very small a very small number of programs in the mid 1960s to more than 150 by the mid 1990s also the role of the feds as and particularly the military agencies as supporters of r d was not combined with tight restrictions on access to this research and i think there are a number of examples of efforts by defense department uh program managers to maintain access to these programs by civilian and industrial researchers as well as academic uh researchers you have the the seminar at the university of pennsylvania and right after the development of the eniac computer sponsored by dod and opened more or less to all comers once again in the procurement area procurement playing a very important role uh in the computer indus computer hardware industry new firms uh key players as winners of contracts here too we have a a an anti-trust suit the settlement of which in the same year as usva t also mandated licensing by ibm a potentially dominant uh well what became who became a dominant player nevertheless uh mandated licensing and cross licensing of its computer uh related patents so antitrust plays an important role here procurement in addition to the uh important uh federal uh presence as a supplier of r d funding federal uh procurement buys the federal presence within the market for computers as was true of semiconductors declines over time although the federal agencies particularly in agencies such as the national security agency the federal labs involved in nuclear weapons design remain important customers for very high-end and supercomputers by the uh by the 1970s and 1980s so summarizing policy here once again anti-trust policy plays an important role in computers supporting both competition among firms entry of new firms and through particularly the licensing of patents interfirm form flows of knowledge r d spending uh motivated largely by national security needs but nevertheless open and open to a much greater extent than national uh than federal uh r d programs in the uk or france open to civilian researchers and the creation of this infrastructure in largely in universities for training people and uh and conducting uh fundamental research interestingly procurement uh particularly during the 1960s and 70s uh federal procurement uh really discriminated particularly in non-military areas against the dominant supplier of hardware ibm in a policy that was quite the antithesis of most european government policies toward their domestic computer industries uh but nevertheless was a policy that spawned and supported uh greater interference competition in the hardware area software the third of the the triad here i think is an industry where that really emerges from foundations laid by federal policy and and industrial investment in the hardware industry but it but the development of software as a standalone or a separate uh technology and industry also is heavily influenced by uh by federal policy and here too you have the creation of a major institution for training very early software developers neither in universities nor in government but in what was effectively a think tank the sage program uh the software component of which was managed by the rand corporation and placed enormous and unprecedented demands on developers of software for what was a very complex software intensive system the sage program really becomes operates as one of the first trade schools for software developers very little at capacity in universities minimal capacity in federal labs limited capacity in industry sage really becomes an important source of early skills development in in this area hardware procurement influences the development of other important standardized software languages uh including cobol which was common business oriented language really developed uh in response to a dod request in the late 1950s so what becomes a a a a broad standard broadly applied standard software language really originates in a dod procurement demand and this plays out through the software industries development as it emerges really as an independent industry in the late 1960s partly because of discouragement of of computer buys from ibm by federal procurement policy you have the development of computer services firms uh particularly in the dc area serving federal clients during the 1960s and a very important uh decision by ibm to separately price its hardware and software products in 1968 undertaken under pressure of an anti-trust suit facilitated entry by independent software developers in addition the uh i think the market for software in the u.s develops in ways that support the growth of an independent industry you have platforms standardized platforms broadly applied in a number of applications developing in both the mainframe and subsequently in the personal computer industry and particularly in the personal computer era the rapid adoption the growth of a very large installed base really creates a if you will a petri dish for a phenomena that our next speaker shane greenstein has talked about in in other contexts user driven innovation you get a lot of users out there experimenting with this new technology and they in turn spawn a great deal of of innovation i think that is an area where there may be some analogs and implications for uh for energy r d and it underscores the importance in some cases of the rapid development of a broad installed base intellectual property rights formal ip in this industry in in software remain relatively weak relatively uncertain because of uncertainty about the patentability of software uh code really uh prior to 1980 the same year that life forms were uh determined by the supreme court to be patentable diamond v dear another supreme court decision uh reaches the same conclusion about software effectively opening the gates and what become floodgates to patenting and software but prior to this time you really have a relatively uncertain and weak environment of formal ip rights finally as was the case with semiconductors you have once again in the in the 1980s an effort by dod to come back into the industry as a purchaser and try to influence the direction of technology development this is the ada software project dod sitting on this enormous pile of software in myriad applications throughout numerous weapon systems and elsewhere desperately wanted to standardize and simplify it's it's software universe and attempted to do so by once again attracting industry to develop software subject to the uh the parameters the requirements of a new architecture ada which ultimately turned out to be unsuccessful in large part because the defense department simply did not any longer constitute a significant uh sufficiently significant portion of demand or development funding so a few conclusions here again i think uh the scale of federal investments in all three of these sectors but particularly semiconductors and hardware during the post-war period was very significant but the the structure of these i i t related r d programs was arguably at least as important competition once again emerges i think is a very strong theme in looking back at this history competition among performers of research competition among commercializers pluralism a number of different federal agencies competing as it were for um for budgets for r d budgets and enabling developers to play one agency off against another again a diversified portfolio results also reliance by federal agencies on extramural performers of research rather than federal laboratories federal policy extending beyond r d and really influencing through a variety of of instruments the adoption environment demand inner firm technology flows uh and and the like and obviously playing an important role in uh in uh the the training of the people who played uh in turn played a critical role um the uh the structure of the procurement as i said earlier uh new firms playing an important role as winners of contracts and again uh the uh effectively these these procurement competitions occupying a role not dissimilar from what people view as a a prize competition in the energy space um i think also important is this the evolving role of intellectual property rights here in all three of these industries for a variety of reasons at during the foundational period formal intellectual property rights did not play a major exclusionary role either in in limiting entry or in limiting access in many respects to technology by by firms in the industries dod's influence in all three of these areas also declines over time and i think that as a as i said earlier is a is a reason to think twice about borrowing quickly or easily from uh from this history uh for energy last slide what's different about energy i think again uh we we haven't actually read each other's uh slides in advance nevertheless i think great minds are working alike here in the sense that demand comes through as a key influence obviously in in the i.t uh history and certainly is an area where energy looks different uh from i.t the demand side and certainly policy to support stable demand and to price externalities in energy has been at best inconsistent and i think that has some implications i think also that there are some challenges in the energy field that arguably uh these uh early developers and and program managers in it did not face first as was suggested earlier is the fact that energy particularly in the adoption area you really are competing with a very large installed base of mature technologies and that is is an enormously uh significant contrast secondly by virtue of the fact that these technologies are themselves more mature government is not likely to be able to play a comparably dominant role as either a purchaser potentially very important or as a funder of the research and development so here too i think we're sort of much further along in history in energy than we were in it and that has some implications for how we apply such lessons as i've tried to convey from i.t for this particular for the energy r d space thank you we have time for a couple of questions uh yeah jeff alexander with sri professor i'm kind of curious if you could talk a little bit more about the diffusion side of the computer hardware and software story uh one part that i don't see emphasize very often and you make some allusion to is the role of service providers like systems integrators and one of the clauses of the or provisions of the ibm anti-trust suit was that they were prohibited from marketing computer services under their own brand and that allowed eds and anderson consulting and so on to play a very key role in teaching enterprises how to use information technology more effectively that's where if you comment a bit on that and if you see that as having some relevance to this discussion well yeah i think i think it's uh certainly if you look at where the software industry came from many of the people and some of the firms uh originated as services firms and that in turn i think did reflect uh to some extent the the settlement in the ibm antitrust suit but also even prior to that this um procurement demand from federal agencies for services and by and large these agencies non-military agencies primarily being uh directed not to source from ibm for these services so both of those created a space and is one of the reasons that you actually have a historic concentration of services uh and i.t firms in the washington area because they were serving this this federal procurement uh market dick van outer with the science technology policy institute uh dave you mentioned the uh role of ti and others coming in supported by the government uh particularly in the production end of the ics what's interesting is one of the second sources was westinghouse which was essentially a fairly large scale incumbent that did not actually have the original technologies and they failed they just totally failed and you also have the situation with ibm in the as a large-scale incumbent in the computer industry uh not reacting to the changes in the in the marketplace very effectively allowing for the pcs and other things to enter in do you see any possibilities that this could be the one of the lessons from the these other industries in terms of dealing with the large-scale incumbencies or is this because we have a problem of a large-scale incumbencies of customers consumers in terms of large-scale uh power production companies etc and fuel providing companies that actually the incumbency is on the wrong end of the stick on this one that did you have monopsonistic uh situations here yeah well that that yeah that's a three or four questions um i mean i just a further footnote to your ibm observation ibm was also a major recipient of r d contracts in this molecular electronics program run by the air force that went nowhere but i think again i think entry new firms clearly an important theme in the i.t story and uh to the extent that federal policy encouraged that i think it did have a very positive uh influence on both the performance of innovation and also cost reduction and the spread of applications that this may be an area where certainly in some segments uh you know energy faces much more significant uh barriers i think there's certainly if you if you move away from traditional uh energy sources in uh in generation um clearly they're they're we're seeing more entry by non-incumbents uh in in uh alternative sources like wind power and the like whether and how one will see entry uh in in in transportation fuels transportation energy again it will probably come through competing technologies rather than entrance competing with the incumbents in you know petroleum refining and the like but i think to the extent that federal policy in the energy space can tilt in favor of entry clearly it seems to be a theme that spans a number of these different histories that we've talked about this morning david thank you very much [Applause]
