our colleagues at the macarena university institute for social research who supported us in in this project and especially our colleague and friend wilberforce kasama mugawa without whom our time in uganda would have been much less productive so the title of this talk is rhodes agriculture and economic development in africa the case of uganda this is very much a model driven exercise and so it'll look a little different from some of the other papers that we've seen over the last day or two uh as a background and i'm not telling anybody in this audience things that you don't already know you know large fractions of uganda's population are living in rural areas that's about 85 percent and most of those are actually working in agriculture that's 73 it looks as though people working in the agricultural sector have very low productivity relative to non-agriculture so in spite of the 73 percent in the labor force in agriculture the sector as a share of gdp is depending on which year you look at hovering around 20 and just the simple arithmetic of that tells you that average productivity and labor average labor productivity in agriculture is much less than it is in non-agriculture in fact it suggests a difference of a factor of 12. i don't know how literally you would want to take that as a measure of relative of marginal products or of wages but there's something going on here that's a big difference and it squares a little bit with the fact that poverty is relatively concentrated in rural areas poverty rates in rural households run at 34 and for urban households about 14 so there's a big disparity across urban and rural parts of the country this is fairly typical actually of a lot of countries in sub-saharan africa so we're going to focus on uganda that's the country we went to but we're gonna our model is a fairly stylized one and i think the story we're gonna tell is gonna be one that could be characteristic of a number of other countries as well what does the agricultural sector look like again no surprise to those of you who are micro people and have spent time in the field we're talking about a rural rural uganda being an area where most people are working on smallholder farms producing primarily staple foods on small plots of land major crops are food crops cooking bananas matoke is the major crop cassava maize and beans if you look at household survey data 75 to 85 percent of households report growing each of those crops so lots of people producing very similar stuff on very small plots of land those four crops together are over half of cropped area and cash crops so coffee uganda is obviously a significant coffee producer and cash crops are important too but together they account for less than eight percent of cropped area and part of what we're doing we're going to ignore things like coffee and tea even though they're economically significant for uganda as a whole we're going to be thinking of an agriculture sector that produces food for domestic consumption and i'm going to argue that that's not a bad assumption overall again there is a large farm sector it's not negligible but there's about 400 registered enterprises in the data that are farm businesses they've signed up with the government as enterprises and they employ a lot of workers they employ 28 000 workers and you can do the arithmetic and find an average farm size for those farms average employment size is pretty big but small holder farms are you know there's 4.2 million agricultural households in the agricultural census data and they employ something north of 8 million workers so again largely the story i'm going to be telling is one that focuses on these small farms that are producing food crops for domestic consumption uh just to belabor the point a little bit this is within that there's even there's even a further division there are some farms particularly uh close to cities in peri-urban areas that the food stuff they're producing is relatively high value horticultural crops fruits and vegetables for sale to the city there are people selling they're people selling staple starch foods to the city as well but if you look at the data on the fractions of output by crop that are consumed at home these are very high so roughly 70 percent of the matoke the cooking bananas that people produce are consumed within the households where they're grown 84 percent of the beans 77 of the cassava about half the maize so some of the maize is marketed and so what you see is people households that are trading relatively small amounts of their output they're often selling in local markets the kind of image that i have in my mind is people going to the market selling a little bit a bag of coffee or a dozen stocks of sugarcane to buy some non-agricultural consumption goods the things people talk about getting from the market salt and soap and kerosene so things for which there's no good home produced substitute and then farm tools and chemicals and uh you know if you have a lot of money you might buy a bicycle or something so here's you know just to show you that we went uh here are your intrepid researchers talking to a guy who's marketing a bag of a bag of sweet potato or cassava i guess it is taking it to the market center um sort of going a half a day to market a bag of cassava so from our perspective there's a bit of a puzzle here part of the puzzle is why are so many people concentrated in a sector where they seem to be relatively unproductive um and within the sector why is there so little specialization i mean you can understand perhaps having lots of people working in agriculture but if you kind of believe in adam smith you might expect to see a little more specialization in exchange so that's the puzzle roughly that we're going to be looking at the set of explanations we're going to consider and i'll get more explicit about these as we get to the model uh i'm going to revisit these in turn but just very briefly one possible explanation might be that agricultural productivity is very low people are just bad at producing food farms can't produce enough surplus to support a very large urban population and it's strictly a technological problem an alternative story might be that non-agricultural productivity is really low and you don't put any people in the cities because there's nothing useful that they can do there they're just not very good at producing manufactured goods that would be an alternative explanation we'll look at that as well a third explanation and one i'm going to spend a little bit more time on is that if you're in a high transportation cost environment it makes it expensive to ship food from urban areas to cities or even to ship it across from one market center to the next or from one farm to the market center and that might limit the size of urban populations and make non-agricultural goods very expensive in rural areas and drive down the demand so we're going to spend a bunch of time on this in a sense it follows jenny's work very nicely and it's going to we're going to tell some related stories this is not so much an explanation but i stuck it here because i'm going to show you some results looking at this in a little bit but you could also imagine that population growth has something to do with the number of people you might just be increasing population more rapidly than you can increase your capacity to feed them in cities and so that's going to look a bit like low agricultural productivity so let me show you a little evidence that all four of these things are going on in uganda we're going to want to do some quantitative experiments to see which of those seem to be big parts of the story and which might seem to be lesser so i'm not going to spend a lot of time on any of these except the transportation one evidence of low agricultural productivity there's lots of lots of evidence none of it particularly conclusive but i thought i'd just show you a couple of things uh if you look for example at yield which is a bad measure of tfp output per unit of land but yields for maize are 30 of the world average they're 40 of yield in brazil which is agroecologically kind of a comparable place and if you look at other crops you see similar deficits relative to countries so here are comparisons to brazil this is maize it looks pretty bad sorghum coffee they're somewhat less productive cassava's not bad they're nearly equivalent in terms of yield for cassava the beans numbers are very small so it's a little hard to tell but they have about half the yield of brazilian beans so that's suggestive it's certainly not conclusive i'll talk about low non-agricultural productivity there's really even less tfp data for uganda on this average productivity is obviously higher than in agriculture we already saw those numbers but very low by world standards and if you were looking for one point of for kind of a comparison of tfp or productivity in a cross-country sense you might look at what they export are they producing stuff well enough that they're competitive at the world level and the answer is no basically there are very few manufactured exports or non-agricultural exports soap hand tools electric current is a funny export and then a few minerals there will be some petroleum exports coming up in the next few years so let me spend a little more time and make a little more serious kind of argument for what's going on for the differences in in transport costs so first just to look at some data on remoteness and there's fairly good data gis maps of where people live and of what kind of roads and road quality are available so according to one gis analysis of this about three quarters of the population live more than two hours from a market center a market center is not a big wholesale market these are like these are like jenny's rural markets these are places where you could actually go and find a market at which you could buy and sell stuff a quarter of the people live more than five hours from a market center and the the measurement of distance here is travel time which takes into account whether this is something you have to walk or something you have to you can ride a bicycle on uh maybe a useful measure is this one average distance to a health clinic is seven kilometers and 77 percent of people report that they walk to get to their health clinics so people are far enough away from uh from right it's one thing to walk to a health clinic not very good if you're feeling sick but by the time you have a 50 kg bag of of maize on your head that's far roads are really bad again for anybody who's spent time in rural africa there's no surprise here this is uh especially in the rainy season roads are terrible roads wash out you have to get down you have to walk around this is actually not a picture from uganda but it tells a story that i think would be instantly recognizable to anybody from any place in sub-saharan africa in the dry season things are a little better but not much the wet season wear and tear on roads leaves things rutted and difficult very difficult to access and just to give you a sense of what the transport system looks like you've got to get goods into the city uganda is fairly it's an interesting special case because the staple food or one of the staple foods matoke a cooking banana is is sold fresh so it's not unlike a grain which is dried and has very low moisture content this is both fresh and therefore heavy and also highly perishable so we're going to be thinking about a world in which transport costs are perhaps even a bigger deal than they are for for millet militant cowpeas in in northern nigeria um the marketing system you know you take matoke you bring it to the market and you can buy it eventually in whole bunches or in even individual fingers so there's a well-developed trading system we're not going to be thinking too much about the kinds of barriers to trade that that jenny and co-authors are looking at in which people are unable to transact with others in the market we're going to assume that a lot of what's going on in in [Music] price dispersion is going to be driven by transportation costs um but we would consider other kinds of transaction costs as being lumped in together with that so again the roads are very bad measured transport costs are high and these price these spatial price dispersion levels are very big measured transport costs you know this is a back of the envelope comparison and it's not exactly the one you would like to make but if you look at the cost of moving 100 kg of agricultural goods final goods 100 kilometers so that's my unit cost for trucking my toke from umbarara to lira it's 5.43 cents as near as i can calculate it the going rate for corn in the u.s midwest is 25 cents a bushel for 100 miles which if i did my conversions right works out to about 57 cents per 100 kg per 100 kilometers so there's a factor there's an order of magnitude difference in transport costs that's my benchmark there's an order of magnitude difference in transport costs between the midwest u.s and and these are actually these are actually major wholesale markets in uganda so i'm looking at this is the cost in the u.s for going from a farm to a grain elevator or from one one local grain elevator to another so this is actually a transport cost in uganda along what paths for main roads so my favorite statistic um again to make the case that transport costs are something you would want to take seriously here is if you look at uganda's paved road density in 2003 and paved roads are not necessarily that's not necessarily the right measure for road quality they have about 16 000 kilometers in an area of 200 000 square kilometers if you look at britain at the time the romans left in 350 a.d they had 12 to 15 000 kilometers of paved roads in an area of 240 000 square kilometers so you wouldn't actually want to make the case that uganda is 1700 years behind britain but there's there's a lot of room for improvement in transport costs my last category was population growth uganda's population growth is now one of the highest in the world at 3.2 percent um you can all do the math but i'm going to show you some results in a minute in which we look at the effects of increasing population by about 10 percent that's not a that's not a crazy size increment to look at okay i haven't gotten to the model yet specific questions we want to ask or how would the economy respond to each of the following an improvement in agricultural productivity and improvement in non-agricultural productivity a reduction in transport costs and some kind of population growth we're going to look at how we think these things would play out in terms of changing the allocation of workers across sectors how they'd affect the prevalence of semi-subsistence agriculture and how they'd affect welfare to ask those questions we're going to use a model we're going to use a general equilibrium model because we're really interested in how the sectoral composition of the economy changes and for that we're going to need to think in a ge sense and we're going to need a model with at least two sectors and with transportation costs because that's something we want to take seriously we're also going to want to distinguish between the two parts of the agricultural economy the one that's a little bit more commercial and market oriented it's closer to cities or closer to main roads and then this kind of semi-subsistence economy which is the one where we think the poverty is really concentrated and where we think the development problems are most acute so the literature we're following here you know if you go back in the development literature there's a nice paper by eswara and kotwal there's more recent literature in in two sector models and we're also going to be drawing on our own work with stephen parente on models of structural transformation so in that work what we've done is the basic story is a very very simple one and actually what we're using here is a static model so it's going to be even simpler but the idea is simply we're going to model a closed economy that has to produce its own food and an economy in which until you can feed yourself adequately you don't move resources out of agriculture so the movement out of the number of workers you can support in non-agriculture depends on how productive you are in agriculture the more productive you are in agriculture the more workers you can move into other more workers and more other resources you can move into other activities and so we find in our earlier work that the subsistence requirement can slow down the process of structural transformation can slow down the rate of economic of economic growth over time the model we're going to look at here is going to have that flavor but we're going to have three regions we're going to have a city we're going to have a close rural area and then a remote rural area and we're going to have a non-agricultural manufactured good you could call it that's produced in the urban area and food is going to be produced in both of the rural areas you can use intermediate inputs that are produced in cities to as inputs into agricultural production so think of think of agricultural implements or think of bicycles i guess they're not quite an input but think of chemicals and then we're going to have transport costs so iceberg transportation costs in this case that are associated with moving any goods from one region to another and then we're going to have uh families that are allocating members across the three regions to maximize some kind of aggregate family welfare we're going to have preferences that are non-homopathetic in which you particularly value agricultural goods at low levels of income so this is again consistent with a lot of the previous literature on this and we're going to have ces production functions in in agriculture a function of land intermediate goods and labor so just a standard ces production function and for lack of any interest in doing anything more complicated just a linear production technology in manufacturing the transport story is also pretty simple we're going to have iceberg transport costs which just mean that you lose a fraction q1 of your output when you transport goods from when you transport any goods between the city and the close rural area and you're going to lose a fraction q2 when you move any goods between the close rural area and the far rural area we're going to let people move costlessly which is a big assumption i suppose but we're thinking that the cost of a bus ticket isn't that big it's something we could take more seriously feasibility is just given by the fact that the sum of agricultural goods that are produced has to equal some of what disappears as consumption in each of the regions and what disappears due to melting away in transport and the same thing is going to hold in the manufacturing side and then the labor market the number of people you can use in each sector is given by total population not going to claim that this is a detailed calibration so this is in the spirit of a numerical exercise but we've rigged things in such a way that we want to capture some key features of the ugandan economy so we have a ces production function there's an intermediate goods share of about 0.2 a labor share in the ces function some of these numbers let me point out a couple of things you should pay attention to the first is the transport cost from the city to the close rural area so we're fixing that at 10 percent you move goods between cities and the close areas and 10 of them vanish in smoke and then we set it much higher for the remote areas so we've got that at 0.6 and then we've allocated 10 percent of the land to the close area and 90 to the remote area we don't know what those numbers really ought to be the model isn't literal enough that we might that we can claim that these are matching anything so we'll play around a little bit i'll show you some results when we play around with what these numbers are just to give you a sense of a benchmark and numerical equilibrium here this is what we get and i'm just going to show you two two sets of numbers the first is the fraction of the population that lives in the urban area the close rural area and the remote area using this set of parameters and then the use of intermediate inputs in close agricultural areas and remote areas and just want to point out that what we're picking up here is we've got a little over 70 percent of the population living in remote areas where basically they're using they're using i'm missing a zero here they're used or i flip these somehow they're using very little of uh i've got them flipped they're using something like just under 0.02 of intermediate inputs and then we have about 20 percent of the population in urban areas so we're we're getting pretty close to hitting a target here of an 80 percent rural population since i haven't claimed to we've rigged these numbers to produce these results you shouldn't think that's very interesting what i want to show you is how the results change as we start to play with different scenarios when i do that i want to think about making welfare comparisons how much better off or worse off people are in this economy under these different scenarios since i don't have i'm not backing out prices and i'm not measuring gdp i need some kind of a welfare measure and the measure i'm going to use is i'm going to consider relative to the benchmark consumption levels so i know how much people consume in each region in each scenario and what i'm going to ask is what proportionate change in the consumption bundle of of agricultural goods and manufactured goods in each region so how much would you need to change that vector of consumption to achieve the same utility level as as or how much are you that's right how much are you if you increase the benchmark consumption bundle how much do you have to increase it to be equivalent to what you find in these scenarios i think that'll make more sense when i show you some numbers so this is my same benchmark again i seem to have flipped the column headings here but this is my same benchmark equilibrium the first scenario i'm going to show you is one in which we increase agricultural tfp by 10 percent and then i'm going to show you what happens if we leave agricultural tfp unchanged and increase manufacturing tfp by 10 and then there's a series of other things so just to show you what happens if you increase agricultural tfp by 10 percent it drives up right you don't know ex-ante you could imagine that would pull more people into rural areas because they're better at producing agricultural goods in this model it actually pulls more people into the city because it's become you have more food available to provide to the cities so you've got more agricultural surplus and so this gives us a an increase in the urban population from about 20 percent to 26 percent and the big impact is coming because you're pulling a lot of people out of the remote regions you're actually pulling some from the remote regions into the closer regions so you drop the number of people living in semi-subsistence from about 71 to just over 62 percent um the welfare gain that goes along with that is that that's roughly the same as increasing everybody's consumption allocation in the benchmark by about a third so that's a significant that's a big impact on welfare let me contrast that with what happens if you increase non-agricultural tfp by 10 percent in which case you don't move the you don't move the allocations of population very much at all uh so there's very little impact on where people are working if you're if what you're doing is changing non-agricultural tfp because you still don't have much extra ability to feed people right you can't move more people to the cities because you simply don't have more agricultural goods to supply them with and so the welfare gains that are associated with this scenario quite quite a lot smaller next i want to show you two scenarios in which we see improvements in the transportation situation so the first one we could model an improvement in transportation in a couple of different ways here the first one i'm going to show you is what happens if you expand the close area relative to the remote area right so we're just going to change the proportion of agricultural land that we're describing as being in l1 versus l2 and the second way we're going to do this is we're going to think about reducing queues and just making transport costs smaller for both in both cases so either way these are generating fairly large shifts in the urban fraction of the economy so we're seeing the urban population going up from 20 to 28 percent or to 26 the big one is obviously that if you change the size of the the close area you make room for a lot more people to be allocated there and so in a sense expanding think of this as expanding the transportation network that feeds into the cities and that has a fairly big effect on how many people are living in connected areas and so you're reducing the fraction of the population in remote areas this has both of these interventions have comparable welfare gains to what you get from a 10 percent increase in agricultural tfp so that's the number where i'd steer your attention to finally let me show you what happens if you increase the population in this model by 10 so that's three years worth of population growth here's what's kind of interesting it not only it actually reduces both the absolute number so my population here goes from 1 to 1.1 and the absolute number of people living in the cities actually falls the fraction certainly falls and the fraction of people living in remote areas rises the story here is that with higher population and very little ability to support people in the cities you can't really if nothing else has changed you can't really support any more people than you did previously in the cities and in fact you can support them less because there's diminishing marginal return to labor in rural areas those workers as you add them in rural areas are producing uh proportionally less surplus than you had before so um let me move on and show you the next set of results here how am i doing fine so a couple of lessons all three channels viewed separately lead to declines in agriculture's share of workforce the biggest impacts are from agricultural productivity and increases in the fraction of land with good transportation access to the city nothing nothing i've said here nothing i haven't said let me show you quickly a couple of what i guess i think of as interactions if i did econometrics but what happens if you change a couple of things at the same time because it turns out that the effects are not simply additive so i'm going to show you again relative to the benchmark what happens if you have these increases in in productivity and reductions and transport costs taking place simultaneously so that sounds like a lot but these are still a 10 increase in agricultural tfp a 10 increase in non-agricultural tfp and a 10 reduction in transport costs these don't seem like crazy size interventions and what you'll see is a fairly large drop in the fraction of people living in semi-subsistence and enormous impacts on welfare over here and the gains that you're getting in welfare terms in particular so the changes in the fraction of population in urban areas look sort of additive relative to what you got if you change these things separately but the welfare gains are bigger than additive so what are what's going on here and what are key assumptions um in an effectively closed economy which is what i'm arguing is a reasonable story for uganda perhaps but not a reasonable story for some coastal countries with great access to trade and to ports but if you have if food is something that's very important when you're poor if you need to feed people so if you take seriously this kind of non-homophoticity in preferences improvements in agricultural productivity have to matter for how much of the population is in rural areas producing and consuming for themselves agricultural productivity increases release labor to other sectors high transportation costs are going to tend to keep people stuck in rural areas where they're producing much of what they consume and where they're consuming much of what they produce lots of things missing from the model so trade is missing from the model again this would not be a good model of an economy that imports a lot of its food from somewhere else my you know transportation improvements look great in the model it's also important to mention that they're really really expensive so i haven't done with this framework i haven't used it to produce any kind of cost benefit analysis but the numbers show that um road building costs a million to a million and a half dollars per kilometer for paved a two-lane highway in in africa so before i would jump in and say this is a great investment you actually want to think through what those what those costs are there are also environmental impacts there are health impacts that we heard about from road accidents so these things are all missing from the model i guess i should stop here this is again your research team in the field and i'd like to thank again the organizers for inviting us to do this work
