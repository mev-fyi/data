paul it's an honor for me and for all of us to have you here today i think we all recognize that you have been one of our country's great public servants so thank you for giving us this opportunity to ask you your opinions on some of the important issues in federal reserve history during your years in the treasury and then at the fed i'll ask some questions for about half of our time and then we'll open to the group for other questions let me start with your experience at the treasury department president nixon suspended gold convertibility in 1971 and that led to the collapse of the bretton woods arrangement so i have three questions about that first what was your view at the time about the desirability of that policy and in retrospect what was your view or did we not have any choice about it at all exchange rates at the smithsonian but it was not a very reasonable outcome from my point of view because i didn't think the change in exchange rates were big enough to instill confidence and the united states didn't accept any responsibility itself by way of any kind of convertibility to support it so the foundation wasn't there for a long lasting solution in my view but my thought always was we do this and then we would redesign the international monetary system president nixon had no interest in redesigning the international monetary system i think it's fair to say nor did mr connolly have much interest which led to uh i think a more unsatisfactory situation internationally where it was easy to make the impression that we were being irresponsible so given that you didn't get the second part of what you were hoping would happen does it still look like the right decision in retrospect or as you say there was really no choice you couldn't negotiate something well i think that was the right decision the question was what happened afterwards and i uh the whole international exchange rate situation got out of hand uh federal reserve policy in my view was not particularly credible at that point i was in the treasury uh every time i went on a trip abroad i would try to get the author don't ease up while i'm abroad anyway [Laughter] uh and you know the inflation took hold as you know and it never was really brought under control for some time and was an unsatisfactory economic situation some people think that that was related to the fact that we'd gone off uh the gold convertibility so how much do you think that actually actually contributed to the inflation that happened in the remainder of the decade i didn't think we had any choice about the gold convertibility i suppose you know we could have devalued as we did eventually and then try to defend a new thing but didn't have enough credibility to to do that but i i think we didn't accept any kind of constraint during that period the early 1970s and the exchange rate fell abruptly at one point or several points and we never had a reaction until late in the decade and i think there was a lack of discipline that would have been useful at the time which was not recognized and wasn't acted upon so let me move forward to a later time when you moved from the new york fed in 1979 to become chairman of the board of governors consumer prices by then were rising at more than 10 percent a year and you decided to push short-term rates up even higher than the rate of inflation as we heard uh earlier the market pushed those absolutely with a little facilitation from folks on constitution avenue anyway that succeeded in bringing inflation down to six percent in 1982 three percent in 1983. so i've got several questions about about all of that first of all why do you think inflation had gotten so high at the end of the 1970s well i i guess i have to say the federal reserve policy uh contributed to it but there were there was the oil crisis in the early 70s and then repeated again in the later 70s you know it made profound impression on me if nobody else that arthur burns in his valedictory speech was entitled the agony of central banking and there was a long lament about how in the economic and political setting of the times the federal reserve by extension presumably any central bank could not exercise enough restraint to keep inflation under control it's pretty sad uh story and you know if you were going to follow that line you were going to give up i guess and i didn't think you could give up and if i you know if i was in that job you that was the challenges of the chairman of the federal reserve now they inherited certain challenges so some people thought at the time that it was just going to be too costly in terms of lost gdp and higher unemployment to get down from where inflation was at that point down to low single digits so i think there was a recommendation at least among some academic economists to stop further increases in inflation but not to try to bring inflation down because that would be so costly well the favorite word at the time which was very popular within the federal reserve but i think probably popular in the academic community generally was gradualism uh i don't quite remember they said don't bring it down at all but you know take it easy it'll be jobs i don't know years decades or whatever and you can do it without hurting the economy uh i i never thought that was realistic the inflationary process itself brought so many dislocations and and the stresses and strains you were going to have a recession sooner or later the idea that you was this was just going to go on indefinitely and it was inflation rate up to 15 percent and it's going to be 20 the next year and uh i mean one little story i think of all these stories but shortly after we began this somebody i think arthur levitt who was the head of the american stock exchange florida and some businessmen they tend to be small businessmen to talk to me at the federal reserve and i had them for lunch and i gave him my little powder about it's going to be tough but we're going to stick with it and the inflation trade is going to come down so forth and the first guy that responds it's all very fine mr volcker but i just came from a labor negotiation which i agreed to a 13 wage increase for the next three years for my employees and i'm very happy with my settlement i always wondered whether he was very happy two years later but but you know that was symbolic of the the depths of he he was happy at a 13 wage increase because he managed to get a real wage decrease yeah that's right that's what he was figuring here but did you have a sense of how what the quote cost would be that is how high was unemployment going to be how long was this going to last i had no sense that interest rates are going to be so high i you know i we knew that disappointment i guess any central banker can be disappointed with this kind of thing when in october we took the you know the full planetary measures and emphasized the money supply and so forth i thought this was all done to convince people we were really serious that you'd already raised a discount rate two or three times in the space of two or three months the last increase in discount rate was by a four to three vote and i was at near fight uh federal reserve chairman now it was all right me i know i have four votes we had to raise it again i'd still have four votes and another three but that's not the way the market interpreted they said ah they're at the end of their string they can't command the unified majority anymore on the board so you know it's the end of the day for any federal reserve restraint so i decided we had to change the playbook a little bit and we threw everything we could into the october announcement and i had this naive hope i knew the short-term rates would go up but i thought ah we will instill confidence and long-term rates will not go up long-term rates went up too that's about as much as the short-term rates which was a disappointment but it showed how strong their psychology was but the inflation came down i think much faster than outsiders in any case expected uh remember the the tax cuts that were put in place were based on the idea that inflation would continue to increase tax revenue because of bracket creep we hadn't ended the bracket adjustment process and yet inflation as i quoted a minute ago was down to six percent in 1982 and half that the next year so were you surprised at how fast the process worked i don't know very surprised but i sure was relieved and i i didn't know how long that could have gone on you can you say a little more about what it took to persuade the fomc and the board to go along with well first of all raising interest rates quite visibly and openly is not the easiest thing in the world for central bankers or anybody it's not a it's much easier to lower interest rates than it is to raise interest rates i think it's fair to say in almost any circumstances and that 4-3 vote that i referred to reflected something of that reluctance uh the federal reserve there had been over the some time earlier three or four years earlier there was some pressure in the open market committee to adopt a much stricter money supply approach so it wasn't entirely unknown to the federal reserve now that approach had always been rejected when it was raised but there was a little bit of feeling i knew among some of the open market committee members in particular outside the board the reserve bank president certain amount of sympathy so you had some kind of among some people some kind of instinctive support and i think you know people were upset and tired about the way things were happening they were looking for something different something new something that had some hope and they realized that over dramatize this is the last chance that's over dramatizing it but people were willing to get together and they didn't have to well we did have a big discount rate change at the time too but uh everybody could get together on the new uh the new policy and we knew pretty well that you know would have a sharp impact on short-term rates and it was meant to be highly restrictive no doubt about that um but the board the market committee was pretty united if i remember correctly history has you warning president carter that something like this was going to happen getting his at least implicit consent and then when it actually happened he was a very unhappy man and acted up i uh i don't think it was quite that way uh i was there and i wasn't you know i uh when i was appointed which was what a month or two earlier i had made clear to him that i thought federal reserve policy was too easy at the time and if i was going to be chairman i was going to be advocating a stronger policy and i remember i thought that i wasn't going to be appointed after that conversation but uh i was appointed anyway showed the difficulty of the time uh and then when it came to uh to making the so-called october decision i had warned the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the economic advisers at the time charlie schultz and don reagan and i was bill miller was secretary of detection we had to go to the imf meeting in in belgrade and i told them on the plane this is what i was uh planning to do and they were not too happy about it but they didn't you told them on the plane going two-bedroom great and by saying that's an important it was important for another reason uh by some bit of serendipity uh uh schmidt who was in i guess chancellor germany had requested that we stop and talk to him in hamburg and i don't know how many people here know uh helmet schmidt but he could be pretty assertive to say the least and he wasn't exactly happy about the united states and he's out there and lectured us for about an hour about the irresponsibility of the united states and letting this inflation get out of control not having tight enough policies and what was the matter with us we were leaders of the world you better shape up and do something and i sat there you know rather happy about this lecture but uh we went to belgrade and you know i was aiming for an announcement later that week this is probably a weekend i don't remember exactly but and the president was informed about it not by me may have been a deficiency in my part but i didn't tell him i would have told him i guess when i got back but he'd already been told by the time i got back and he took the position i'm told that i don't like it much but i just appointed the guy and i'm not going to make a public fuss about it and there were one or two people in the administration that i knew kind of came to me and said go ahead and do it uh no that wasn't the unanimous view but uh it was not a [Music] you know there was no sharp rubber man there was no he he went on television though and he um triggered some legal provisions which had some effect oh no not then you are thinking this was a catastrophe so i apologizing you may not remember this this is relevant for the national bureau of economic research i resent them this was later when interest rates got up to i don't know 20 or so maybe by the end of the year and carter announced a budget which was very poorly received and you know my reaction nothing was happening the federal reserve staff kept saying look at how this recession the recession is beginning there was no recession and despite all this the economy kept rising and carter was obviously under pressure so he triggered a provision in law that permitted the federal reserve to put on credit controls and so he said i want to put on credit controls i want to show i'm on the team sort of and i we're going to go together and i got to change the budget i'm going to make the budget more restrictive and i want to announce there'll be credit controls and you can i guess we were going to tighten policy again that was all part of the package you weighed the titan policy it will announce the credit control so we didn't like the idea uh because expansion and credit was not a problem at the time uh and we didn't want to get in all the mess of managing credit controls we thought it muddied the picture but i felt well i didn't like it how can we rebuff the president of the united states who is asking us to put on credit controls theoretically we could have said no but uh he managed to ask you on television well i i guess maybe he did so it was not a secret to the american public that he had that view you know anyway this was a this was a phenomenon engraved in my mind so we decided all right we'll put on the most modest controls we can think of we will not put on any control over anything to do with housing which is the biggest source of credit i think we exempted automobiles there's nothing to matter with automobiles so the only thing that was left was in those days it was of some important single payment kind of a consumer credit that was not installment credit that was not related to housing or cars it was not a very big area of the market but we said okay you're going to have a reserve coin and credit cards if credit cards exceeded past peaks you would have a reserve requirement and we did that knowing but now in march the peaks and credit card use comes in november and december and we were way below it so there was no possibility that this was going to become effective for some time and this is all announced a big big white house ceremony uh all right let me let me move on tomorrow but the economy at that point fell like a rock and people were cutting up credit cards sending in the press the president will foyer automobile sales dropped within the space of a week or so and the money supplied we didn't know why the money supply was dropping all of a sudden the money supplies down three percent in a week or something you know how everybody was paying off their credit card debt by drawing down the demand deposits and the money supply falls and we went into what the national bureau of economic research determined was in the recession while it was recession alright the economy went down but it was an artificial as soon as we took off the credit controls in june the economy began expanding again and then things really got tough but that was you know a really good argument about uh so let me look a little further down uh the road even after inflation had dropped to three percent um you kept the market kept um interest rates very high uh treasury bills were eight and nine percent so we had real rates of on treasury bills of five and six percent so why was it uh why were they so high well geez i don't remember at one point well first of all when the economy began expanding it was expanding very fast so there was no problem with poor economic activity at that point you had the potential banking crisis of continental illinois and this bank little bank in oklahoma that went busting but it sold a lot of loans to continental illinois and other banks and there was the threat of a banking crisis and when continental got in trouble that had an effect on on on bank you know overnight bank lending and that kept for a while that was during the election period actually kept interest rates higher than we anticipated and really higher than we wanted to there was quite a debate on the board at that time whether we should react to what seemed an artificial increase in interest rates by by easing our policies or whether we would tough it out and we finally did ease a bit this is what we talked about 84 i guess but you still have very high real rates short rail rates was it a concern about inflation coming back i think it was just i mean i put myself back in that position i think we were totally satisfied with what the economy was doing and why would you you still had some inflation why would we easing up when the economy was expanding six or seven percent a year um getting back to where we were everything was fine so so let's turn let me now turn to more recent uh events after you left the fed first about the crisis and then about current policy there were of course many causes of the financial crisis and i don't want to review all of those but i want to ask what role do you think the fed played in causing the crisis and how could fed policies have prevented it well i i make a point that didn't quite come up this morning but i i think it's important and it's underrated uh during the decade of after the change of the century and we had this very mild recession it was part of your recession in 2000 to 2001. i remember i was a meeting with you and you said it wasn't a recession i said it wasn't a recession but the national bureau of economic research later said it was a recession but it was hardly visible i think it's i don't even think it shows a decline in the current figures uh anyway um [Music] we had these low interest rates we were running a big balance of payments deficit got bigger and bigger more and more money came from japan and china in particular in asia interest rates were kept very low and it seemed to me inevitably this was the kind of doomsday scenario sooner or later that you couldn't go on to the point of borrowing over what five six percent of the gdp and interest rates are very low and parts of the economy were expanding very rapidly and what to do about it i mean i made a speech about it once i didn't say anything except we've got to make sure we maintain price stability i didn't directly criticize the federal reserve at the time because i wasn't sure i mean i would have been happy if you'd been a little tighter frankly but i didn't think that was going to cure the situation because it was really an international monetary problem that there was no discipline on either the united states or on china to take and nobody even raised the question and it all ended up very unhappily so that kind of fed the boom in the united states and i think the federal reserve and other rep banking regulators did not catch up with this i don't know what anyone ever would but they didn't and it got out of hand and collapsed in a way that i i wasn't anticipating particularly but it did it i had no idea myself i'm just sitting around how how big the subprime mortgage problem was i mean it startled me when i you remember these little personal incidents i was at some meeting where i was asked to comment on the us economy i guess in the spring of 87 question what about that mortgage market i said i don't know much about that mortgage market but i can't believe the financial system is so weak that this minor business and the mortgage market would upset it when i got back i called some friends in the federation how big is this subprime mortgage thing i must commit the answer i got from the first was i don't know and then they called me back later and they told me well it looks like it's over a trillion dollars i had no imagination that the subprime mortgage thing was over a trillion dollars and it was a phenomena of what three years maybe from a standing basically a standing start in three years it was a trillion dollars and obviously that was kind of the focal point of the crisis when it when it finally came but uh i looked at spanking regulation stuff is very hard to deal with but i think there had been a relative lack of interest in it which was unfortunate um let's talk for a moment about the volcker rule which i remember you're saying at the time that's my favorite rule it's your favorite rule well if i had a rule named after me i would probably be my favorite rule uh as well i was at an international level meeting and last weekend and somebody had a paper saying that was the most important part of financial reform i have never said that but she said so yes so that was my question how important was proprietary trading which i take it is the essence of the uh the volcker rule how important was it as a cause of the crisis well i didn't know where i'd rank it as a cause of the crisis it was a contributing factor in the sense that led to a lot of once the crisis started the proprietary the exposure on proprietary trading and and money market funds and hedge funds you know this crisis kind of started with the hedge funds of of bear stearns which came under pressure earlier that this thing began shaking psychology and so forth and that was an essentially a proprietary trading operation i i have seen figures that say the banks lost as much money in in 2008 as they made on proprietary trading and hedge funds and the whole previous decade all in one fell swoop but obviously the weakest part of the banking system was bad loans the difference is banks are there to make loans and that's an essential part of the economy they're not there in my opinion to trade for their own account basically and that's the distinction that i started making was obviously a complicating factor if it wasn't the prime factor in in the crisis and the worst part part of it in a way in my view is is a cultural psychological question it's not just the risks that are involved directly for the whole institution i take this jp morgan thing they lost six billion dollars or whatever it was with one little play in derivatives market and one big play in the derivatives market and then they can survive six uh billion dollars but what is the psychology that leads people to take that kind of risk and the traders know that the rewards are huge of a kind that have not been at all normal in commercial banking now or in history and when you got that kind of cleavage between the culture and let me call it the investment banking side of the house and the traditional commercial banking side of the house obviously the people in the commercial banking side i said well i want to make money too maybe i can make some big risks and i'll look i'll get some mortgages together i'll package them up we'll securitize them and stick them out and we'll make a commission on it and and it's not a relationship matter we're gonna stick this out we'll stick somebody else with it uh it's a different culture the guy that is most eloquent on this surprises me because he was never friendly to the federal reserve it was john reed had a citibank at the time and he was a leader in uh commercial banks uh going in the investment business they bought solomon you may recall and solomon that subsidiary went bust later not too much later but it was part of citibank so nothing happened uh but he is very vocal mia copper we made a mistake it destroyed the culture of the institution and that's my major worry about it um another thing you've worried about uh the size of the big banks and if i remember correctly you uh you were in favor of breaking up the big banks uh the administration is that true well i don't know what time you're talking about but you know when i left the federal jury no no not when you were at the fed no during this crisis oh during the court i never took the view to break out the victim i want to limit their size which i guess is in the law someplace not very effectively i know i i see a lack of my imagination or something i don't see how my how do you break them up a with a lot of disturbance but even you broke them up and you couldn't break them up into small enough pieces so that they wouldn't be systemically significant or whatever we call it now you you know you break up jp morgan in half or chase in half for the same bank bank of america slice them in half and they're still so they're not two trillion dollar banks they're one trillion dollar banks they're still too big so that view which uh i've heard attributed to you shouldn't have been attributed to you about breaking up not wanting to break them up let me um let me ask you i wouldn't mind it i mean if somebody else does it i won't um one of the questions that came in let me read the high interest rates of the early 1980s caused severe debt problems in emerging economies were you surprised by this and what options did you consider no but you know it's an interesting question but this was a this is something like i supposed to the subprime mortgaging the 70s were characterized by a lot of liquidity growing out of the oil crisis and the excess money that the arabs had and all the rest and that money was flowing through the big banks to latin america in a way that arguably looked unsustainable arthur burns to his credit was to paul revere on this thing he go around make speeches this can't continue we shouldn't be continuing we've got to do something about it uh i was in new york fed then and we tried to do something about it which was totally ineffectual i must say uh but it went on and nobody was willing to say if you did something that was really effectual that's a word uh you would have had a crisis in latin america if you shut off the flow so nobody much wanted to be all that aggressive and then finally go through natural occurrences interest rates have gotten very high but i don't think it was just the high interest rates the bank suddenly stopped lending to mexico so you had a crisis and once one stopped they all stopped uh it was an interesting question of phenomena this has been building up figures were known the president of mexico then left one guy was being told by his own finance minister and central bank governor we ought to stop this or slow it down and he sent some people around to talk to foreign banks and say is this a problem they all said no this was in the summer of 82. or summer of 81 it would have been because now we come to 82. so he said he got rid of the finance minister wasn't getting rid of the borrowing that it was financed it's true and uh the borrowing continued until the winter when a couple of banks stopped lending and you know mexico ran out of money so do you do you had a big crisis now the high interest rates contributed to that but didn't make you know that they hadn't been in effect all that long and it was a problem no question the high interest rates aggravated the problem so what were you going to do you're going to conduct an easy money policies and go back and all the policies undertaken to try to save mexico which wouldn't save mexico anyway so now we did say mexico but but by other means i it wasn't just mexico people forget and this is a commentary on age this was 82 how many years ago was that 31 one two years ago i hear all this talk about crisis nobody ever remembers the latin american debt crisis memories only go back to somehow the banking crisis in 1990 didn't make the leap back to 80. the big u.s banks and some of the big foreign banks had more exposure to latin america than they had capital so it wasn't something you could just say okay knock off the loans by 50 or something everybody would be happy they all would have been bust uh so you look for other approaches and took a decade so mr brady came along and settled let me move even more current after you left the fed the [Music] board adopted or congress mandated the dual mandate and the board has set quantitative goals for inflation and unemployment so if i remember in your time there were no such specific goals and you would say something like the job of the fed is to achieve price stability right so i remember that so i exercised the word gradually every time so my first question is what's your opinion of the dual mandate i'm against it you're against the global mandate i want to say a little more than that well i think it confuses the situation in the federal reserve the danger for the federal reserve now is that implicitly or explicitly given the circumstances it has acted and is asked to act in an extraordinary way and it implicitly is kind of gives the impression that the federal reserve has the keys to the kingdom uh that they can achieve price stability and low unemployment at the same time and no matter what the budget is and all the structural problems in the economy and the dislocations in the economy monetary policy will solve all problems i think that's a bad message to give because i don't think it's right i don't think it's possible anyway and i do think it confuses the situation to say it says there's a trade-off between tri-stability and economic performance and employment and i think in any over any reasonable period of time there's not a trade-off and that the best contribution of the federal reserve can be to maintain price stability i don't like this frankly to targeting but that's a minor point and you know that two percent is okay and 1.5 is no good and you know that's the way it's i know everybody kind of knows what stability is and it's a there's there's more than one measure of prices uh so i think it's confusing i think it it makes their job more difficult that doesn't mean that policy would be one inch different today than it in fact is there is no immediate inflation problem inflation threat so they can be comfortably very easy that's what they should be so it doesn't imply any difference actually and you see there's any political possibility of moving away from the dual mandate anytime in the future i think if the federal reserve stopped talking about it nobody else would talk about it somebody can do this research that law was passed or amended humphrey hawkins act in 77. just two years before i became chairman of the federal reserve fresh legislation i do not remember the word dual mandate ever passing my lips and all the time that i was chairman now i could get by with it because translation was very high and somebody asked me the impact in economy i said you know look over time the best thing we can do from the economy is getting rid of the inflation and you know sitting there saying with 15 inflation well then we didn't have high unemployment but even when the unemployment rate got very high and the inflation rate was still 10 or whatever it was say oh we gotta let's let's get the inflation rate up a little bit so we can get the uh unemployment enemy to make sense uh but literal reading of the dual mandate presumably that's what you would do and so i think you better ask the advice i would get the current chairman of the federal reserve have a chance to do that now um so that probably tells me something about what you think about the idea of unconventional policies or maybe it doesn't seem well i think this crisis required some unconventional policies there's no doubt about that extremely unconventional is the kindest way you can say about it when you go back uh a few years ago i uh [Music] and at this current just talking about this current version these so-called qe tooth uh you know it's a matter of judgment i don't get alarmed about it and i'm not a you know i think they can manage their way out of it i mean chairman's make that quite clear i think he's right um it does have a dangers of speculative you know it's got pluses and minuses and the pluses i don't think are very large and the minuses don't seem to be tremendous right at the moment either but uh i mean since i can say it if i was conducting these problems i don't really understand why we're paying interest on excess reserves when we're worried about getting interest rates as low as possible the federal reserve pays more on their excess reserves and the banks can get from lending to each other sorry why why spend them so you would stop paying interest on excess reserves am i expecting i say would you stop paying interest on well this is right it never dawned on me i mean limitations of my own imagination i was always in favor of paying interest on required reserves uh but the idea of paying interest on excess reserves never occurred to me until the federal reserve began doing it i can see in some circumstances it may have some advantages but i i think you're going to find some disadvantages too someday you have to make that rate pretty high if you're going to do it i guess um when you want to tighten policy and we'll see how that goes you mentioned the word deficits let me read another question that came in can the u.s continue for long as the financial global hegemon with the persistent large fiscal deficits well you know what's a large fiscal deficit uh a large fiscal deficit is what we have yeah we do that's what we have i think it's hard particularly the uncertainty over you know the decades ahead when medicare and social security and so forth seem to widen the deficit uh but the deficit that's more to the point to me is is the balance of payments deficit i mean i think we're back in a way in the tripping dilemma which i think this was not mentioned this morning that we were in a position in the bretton woods system that with the other countries basically wanting to run surpluses and build their reserve positions a reserved position in the united states inevitably weakened weakened to the point we no longer could support the convertibility now you don't have any credibility anymore but how long can we expect as a country or world to support how many trillions of dollars that the rest of the world has well so far so good and the rest of the world isn't in very good shape so we look pretty good at the moment but suppose that situation changes and we're running big deficits and however many trillion it is now it's another trillion or so at some point there is a vulnerability there i think for the system not just for the united states and i we ought to be conscious of that and do something about it i it's not so easy to do something about it because that comes back to the whole question of international monetary reform which is a favorite subject so the chinese have been major buyers of u.s government debt they've been able to do that because they have a they have had a large current account surplus that surplus has come down from 10 a few years ago to less than 2 percent now if they pursue the policies they say they're going to pursue it could easily disappear in the next couple of years how should we think about the implications of that for the u.s well i think that's good news from the standpoint of what i just mentioned that china is not the only other country in the world but china was an important accumulator of dollars and if they stop accumulating the kind of worry i just expressed are somewhat alleviated but it's not gone because our deficit continues continues now our deficit is smaller too but hopefully can remain smaller i i i hate to see our deficit go back to where it was i'd like to see it i would talk about current account deficit i'd like to see it disappear but i sought to make it disappear and no question about that well on that semi-optimistic note let me thank you again for taking the time to and giving us your views about all of this thank you
