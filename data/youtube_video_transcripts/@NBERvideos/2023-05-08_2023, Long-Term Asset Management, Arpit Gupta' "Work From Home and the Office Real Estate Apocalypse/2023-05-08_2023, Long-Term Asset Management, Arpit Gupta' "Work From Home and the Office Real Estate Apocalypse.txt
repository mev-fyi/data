so much for having me here on the program I think that's my third time presenting here at creative conference this is Joint work with Brenda Mickel over here and staying with Norberg Columbia so I want to start off with a quote so this says commuting to the office is obsolete because it's cheaper easier faster to do with the 19th century not to move information and with an office work to where the people are so I like this quote because it's from basically when I was born and so for my entire life people have been predicting the death at the office and essentially our research question is to ask whether this moment has finally arrived so this is an important question to answer both because commercial real estate is a large asset class one of particular importance to institutional and long-term investors so the size of the overall commercial real estate universe is something like five trillion dollars office is a pretty big part of that in New York City alone we have over 170 billion dollars worth of commercial office and I think it's also important to understand how the valuation of commercial real estate is changing in order to help understand broadly the shifts in society that we're seeing around remote work to sort of quantify how important this technological disruption is so we're going to do two things in this paper the first thing we're going to do is show that they've been large shifts in office demand that really do appear to be driven by remote work we're going to see huge shifts in rental Revenue over the last several years that's really coming predominantly from the quantity Dimension so many fewer leases are being signed there's an element of flight to Quality in this this is not affecting all properties homogeneous you know in the same way but in fact younger more expensive buildings are holding a better relative to older buildings which in turn implies there's a possibility for a big stranded asset problem because you have these older buildings that are seeing huge drops in their value because of these technological disruptions mean that people don't really want to use them as much and when an argument really does seem to be shifts around remote hybrid work that appear to be driving these trends next we're going to take a structural asset pricing approach to try to Value how important these shifts appear to be in the office Market this is actually a difficult challenge because commercial real estate is a very illiquid and opaque asked class so we're going to bring to bear new data sources and a new modeling framework to try to understand conceptually how important are these shifts for the value of commercial Office Space so to do so we're going to try to learn what we can from publicly traded instruments to the extent that they exist use information broadly from the overall universe and understand both cash flow and discount rate effects and here's the bottom line so our estimate is that the value of New York City office fell by over 40 in 2020 so that's a period And We had both a recessionary environment as well as a lot of remote work and you know going forward we project about a 40 drop in value by 2029 so this appears to be a pretty persistent shock with a lot of uncertainty and dispersion around those estimates shown by the shading of the blue which corresponds to the uncertainty and the risk around how sticky work from home is really going to be right and so there's some sample paths shown in red where we really stick with remote work and those are much worse situations for commercial Office Buildings so uh there's a lot of literature here um just two kind of quick strands I want to reference one is there's actually pretty large and growing spatial equilibrium framework so these models and these papers approach this problem by solving for one spatial equilibrium in a pre-work from home World in a post work from home world the way our approach differs is that it really takes more of a finance perspective and so considers risk Dynamics and the transition path of how we get from one equilibrium to the other and the other strand of literature pertains to understanding remote work more broadly so my discussion has done a lot of great work here trying to quantify and understand how large and important these shocks appear to be okay so let's start by talking about how big remote work is and what it's been doing to the office so a simple way of figuring out how much remote work there is is to use this data provider many people have looked at called Castle so this uses Turn Style data so effectively when you swipe into an office it tags your physical entry and what we sort of see here is that if you just go to any office building and just sort of count the number of people that are there you see about half as many people physically in the office compared to the number of people that were there before the pandemic and these rates are kind of stabilizing over time um and you can see them for a couple of different cities here basically you see that there's been a huge shock to how much remote work there really seems to be and this is kind of happening you know not just in the pandemic itself but really going out several years since then whereby you know the whole rest of society is back right we're all here in this room we're all traveling the flight's going to be really packed when you try to cut back so the whole rest of society has really come back with this one exception this is the one really durable shock that the pandemic has left is this kind of shift to new types of word patterns now we're then going to ask okay what does this mean for the office so to do so we're going to use this data provider called comstack which provides us really we think good coverage of office leases starting from after 2015. so we're going to have a lot of markets here and the first is descriptive fact is just to count the revenue that is coming in for office leases and so there's a 17 decline in leasing revenue from before the pandemic through May of 2022. we're in the process of extending this out uh further but it's sort of a similar pattern if you go out a few more months so where is that stock and rent in leasing Revenue coming from a lot of it is coming from the occupancy Dimension so you can see that here we're now asking about contractual occupancy so this is asking how much office space is being rented or is available or vacant and so for Manhattan you can see we went from about a you know 12-ish vacancy rate before the pandemic to now getting closer to 20 to 25 percent uh the situation in San Francisco is even more Stark so that went from about a six percent vacancy rate to really historic levels of vacancy in the office closer to uh closer to uh you know 25 or in some sources you'll see 30 or 35 vacancy rates in San Francisco this is actually a quite dramatic shift especially taking into account the fact that most leases are fairly long-term in nature right so you'll sign a commercial lease for a period of time and so actually only a fraction of commercial leases have actually come due over this time period and so the fact that you see such dramatic shifts on the occupancy Dimension tells you that so many people that are leasing office space have been exiting those leases when those leases have been coming due over the last couple of years we also look at rents so rents have also declined we measure rents through a measure called uh net effective rent so this takes into account other leasing terms not just the rent itself like tenant improvements and so on and so forth so in New York City we see about a 16 decline in rents in 2020 and a little bit of a recovery since then this rent decrease is not uniform across properties but it really affects older lower many many buildings more we can see this by measuring a rent gradient so this is plotting the rent of a building against its age and we see is it before the pandemic you know there's a gradient meaning that newer buildings are valued more than older buildings and this gradient actually gets more steep so the newest buildings the ones that have the highest rent range so that ones that are the most expensive within their sub Market are actually retaining or even increasing their value while the buildings that are really old that are really low in rent are seeing much larger decreases in demand so this pattern is actually somewhat surprising because I've just shown you there's a huge demand shock people are really demanding much less office it's not X anti-obvious that people would actually upgrade the quality at the same time there's a drop in demand and what I think is going on here is that firms are trying to substitute towards higher quality office space in order to encourage and incentivize workers to come in to the extent that they do have back to office plans okay so a lot of shifts in the office Market are they really associated with remote work to understand that we have looked at this data provider called scoob so they have estimated back to work plans for 3 000 firms in the economy so that covers over 40 million employees and we have linked those back to office plans so like how many days of the week are you planning on coming in and two that firm's office choice and what we see is that if my firm is really trying to get employees to show up four or five days a week the decline in that firm's change in space is not nearly as dramatic as if the firm is really moving fully remote uh going to you know zero or just one day a week and hybrid work is somewhere in the middle so that also is actually not obvious because you know people don't go to the office on Saturday and Sunday and yet you still need office space and yet what it seems is that firms that have moved to hybrid work plans have been able over time to figure out staggering and other ways of consolidating their employees so that you don't need to demand as much space so you can do that for instance through hot desking having employees reserve space as needed and this allows firms essentially to lower their office demand proportionate to how much remote work that they're doing so these individual firm decisions aggregate up to Industry and City levels so we can measure different Industries here and we estimate how much remote work the industry is doing um and we can measure how much space that entire industry is demanding in our comstack data set and we see that the more remote the industry is the more you know the less space is being renewed by that industry right and the same thing at the city level so here we're measuring the whole city-wide vacancy rate and we see that the cities that have more remote work are seeing larger declines in vacancy are seeing more vacancies show up uh overall all right so I've shown you so far that there are these really large shifts in office demand that seem to be driven by remote work we're not going to try to quantify these shifts a little bit more in the context of a structural model so this is going to be a fairly you know straightforward conceptual idea right we want to value a building based on the present discounted value of you know future Revenue minus costs one of the key complications in doing so is going to be to recognize that in this context the revenues are going to come from leasing revenues and we're going to have to take into account these costs as well and then finally think about what's the right discount rate to apply to the valuation of an office building so one of the contributions here of the paper is to come up with a framework and modeling tool for thinking about the asset pricing of commercial buildings okay so to do so we're first going to start with economic states of the world so we're going to have a Markov transition state variable which will have the usual things the expansions and the recession so that that part is all pretty normal we're going to introduce two new components here a work from home expansion any work from home recession the idea is the economy can now travel between expansions recessions while there's also a lot of remote work going on in the economy and those two transition paths between expansions recessions in between remote work and not remote sort of independent decisions now we need to price the the SDF in those two different states and again we're going to have sort of a separate shift or process to Value the state prices in the non-work from home period and add an additional component to figure out what's happening in the work from home regime for revenues we're going to have these leases and we're going to make a simplifying assumption that we can express all the leasing Revenue portfolio in um caliber style framework right so I just have a certain portfolio of leases and some random fraction of these cowboy style are going to come due every period that's going to add to my stock of vacant leases and so what am I going to do for my Revenue I'm going to release some of my leases that are coming to you this period I'm also going to add new leases for my my vacant stock and that's going to result in a new state variable The Next Period which is my new stock of vacant space and as I release this the space it's going to the the rent by which I do so is going to be determined by that aggregate state and finally their costs which are divided up into variable costs which depend on occupancy some fixed costs that act as a little bit of operational leverage and finally some additional costs associated with transactions okay so to calibrate this model we're going to fix a lease expiration parameter that matches what we see in the data overall to get the average lease duration right and we pick some depreciation uh which is close to the amount for tax purposes the really hard part is going to come when we try to figure out what are the cash flows that are going to apply for these different states so for expansions and recessions remember those are the standard economic States we're going to look at historic rent growth data in our comstack data set going back about 20 years across a few different regimes right so basically look historically at what rent growth has been like when the market is doing well versus market doing poorly and then to measure what's going on in these work from home States we're going to look at the first year of the pandemic we're going to call that a work from home recession we estimate the rent growth in that period as that was the as the bad work from home recession State and then we're going to look at what happened the next couple of years as reflecting a work from home expansion period and we're going to assume that the changes in rents that we observe in those periods are going to be symptomatic of future cash flows that building owners can expect in these economic States all right uh so then uh we are looking at estimating renewal and vacancy rates so we match vacancy rate movements for New York City and estimate lower demand for the pandemic period and then we include Supply so we base that on historic values and expansions and recessions that are depreciation with lower Supply in the work from home period reflecting either cancellation of construction plans or conversion of some of this office space into residential now to estimate State prices here we've got a pre-work from home SDF that's pretty standard it matches the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium in both expansion and recession States the new part here is to allow for additional work from home risk so what you know what is work from home risk and how would we measure it we have here the idea that we don't know how long we're going to stake in this work from home regime and it generates a new source of priced uncertainty and risk for commercial real estate firms to estimate this we need to follow me back procedure where we generate a portfolio which intuitively you can think of as going Wong Zoom stock and short Carnival Cruises and we're going to find that this long short portfolio co-varies with the Returns on publicly traded office REITs in a way that did not happen before so it looks like office reads are have a new priced risk factor that is associated with something like the technological disruptions associated with remote work and we're going to use this to basically get an additional risk premium that office buildings are facing we can also do everything else without this without this risk part and just do everything Cash Flow side as well and then finally we're going to have to estimate how persistent remote work is so this is going to be a little bit challenging our best guess of doing so um is going to look at you know estimate everything else and basically match the observed decline in New York City office reads over the pandemic so the New York City office reads for NATO green and Empire State trust they don't own very much of the office stock in general they own the higher end part of the office stock so we want to use the model to kind of extrapolate and learn something about all of New York City Office Buildings but we think we can use the return for these office reads in order to pin down the persistence parameter for How likely it is that remote work is going to persist year and year and the basic intuition is just that the more persistent remote work is going to be given all the other parameters I've laid out the larger is going to be Equity decline in these publicly traded office reads and so the realized decline was something like 22 percent uh in the first period of the pandemic and that pins down a persistence parameter of 0.8 meaning that every year there's an 80 chance we stay in the work from home uh work from home state um and you know but we can do all sorts of robustness around that specific estimate so these are the headline estimates again so we estimate for New York City overall a 40 uh decline initially that seems fairly persistent in the long run with this risk and uncertainty around it reflecting the model's movement across different work from home States different expansions and recessions the a plus building was a match that overall decline for the for the for the reef that's held up value a little bit better and so the flip side is at the lower quality buildings the older buildings are going to experience a much larger decline in value we've also done this for other cities so San Francisco sees a much larger decline in value whereas Sunbelt areas like Austin have you know seem like they're recovering in value a little bit better so there's Geographic dispersion reflecting some of the variation we see in remote work practices okay just just a couple minutes left I want to talk about the bigger picture implications of these findings so one simple exercise is to kind of scale up our estimates across the whole country we estimate something like a 400 billion dollar loss for the value of Office Buildings across the whole country um and these losses are not just contained to Office Buildings but spill over to other adjacent uses like retail inversion is a big discussion here so good examples actually across the street you've got the Tribune Tower which is a double-stranded asset problem first is a newspaper disrupted by the internet and then second the whole office building was converted into uh you know luxury condos that's possible for some buildings particularly older buildings that have narrower floor plates it's actually quite complicated it seems like for newer buildings um and so this is a long-term process that will likely take a you know a long time to kind of uh play out here's something that might be of interest to group this is who owns commercial real estate debt and Equity so you see that the debt ownership this is for all commercial real estate is heavily concentrated in Banks not surprisingly plus insurance and Pension funds uh some and some are securitized as well here's the equity ownership just of Office Buildings do you see that these are also broadly held across a number of different categories of institutional investors and user operators so we think that the clients in value are going to broadly affect a lot of the overall ecosystem here um the securitized debt is actually created and has credit default swaps written against it so we actually look at the pricing of those credit default swaps and it's a little bit complicated long story short the market is currently right now pricing in about a 20 default rate for office loans um you can kind of see that because the you know especially in the last couple months you see a huge decline um in those cmbx indices here which correspond to the price of purchasing default protection insurance against the performance of these underlying commercial mortgages uh remember I just said Banks were one of the biggest holders of the debt here to be plotted uh Bank exposure this is for all commercial real estate um and you know just take away here is that a lot of the banks that are currently failing right these are the smaller Regional Banks they're the ones that have a lot of commercial real estate exposure so just to wrap up um why is this important to understand well the the chain of events we were concerned about is one that you have a decline in real estate value that hits tax revenue for cities that then forces adjustments of less spending more taxation which then drive out migration in a destructive spiral so we think that said you know cities are ultimately anchored by the value of all this office in commercial real estate so understanding these Dynamics is very important thank you look forward to the congressman discussing
