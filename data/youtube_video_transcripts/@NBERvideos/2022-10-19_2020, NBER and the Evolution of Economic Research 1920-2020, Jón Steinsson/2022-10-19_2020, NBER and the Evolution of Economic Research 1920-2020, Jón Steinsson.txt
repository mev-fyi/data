the NBR was originally uh put together and organized to construct objective facts about the economy and the key figures in the founding were were Malcolm Rory and Nahum Stone um these were men as Jim discussed that had very different views about policy and they deliberately put together a group of people from different schools of thought from the extreme conservative to the extreme radical so as to be able to produce a set of facts that were considered scientifically produced impartial and non-partisan the original projects are the projects that have already been discussed in the first two papers the initial project was a project on the national income which eventually led to the creation of the national income and product accounts and then in the first quarter Century the the MBR also did very important work on business Cycles now in these first 25 years the contribution of of the MBR to monetary economics was was relatively modest and the focus of of my remarks are going to be about the contribution to monetary economics so I'm going to move on to kind of the second 25 years of the bureau's history now the singular contribution of the MBR to monetary economics is the project on money and banking that was headed by Milton Friedman in close collaboration with Anna Schwartz for a number of decades uh starting in 1948 but um there's if I if I let myself define monetary economics slightly broadly to include the development of Keynesian macroeconomics I think there's one other very important contribution uh to monetary economics that needs to be discussed even in a very short discussion like this that's only 20 minutes and that is the development of the permanent income hypothesis by by Milton Friedman now um Milton Friedman's book a theory of the consumption function was published by the NBR in 1957 which is of course well known but uh it's perhaps not quite as well remembered that a lot of the motivating facts that led to the development of the permanent income hypothesis were also largely done at the MBR or published by the MBR so you may not remember but both Franco Modigliani and Milton Friedman cite three uh seminal contributions empirical papers basically that they they think of as having led to the development of the permanent income hypothesis on the one hand and the lifecycle model on the other hand and these three empirical papers are Simon kuznitz's 1946 book using uh the estimates from the national income product counts back to 1899 to to analyze various questions and one of the results that kuznes comes to in that in that book is that there has not been a secular increase in the savings rate over those uh half that half a century now if you remember um the at the time uh Keynes had formulated a consumption function and one of the main you know main main features that this consumption function was a marginal propensity consumed that was less than one and people at the time believed that this implied that we should see a secular increase in savings over time as income grew and people were very scared of this because they thought that that savings would would outpace our ability to invest and eventually we would get into secular stagnation so Simon kuznets is a result in in that book was you know kind of an important result undermining the leading interpretation of keynes's consumption function at the time uh the second study is a paper by Dorothy Brady and Rose Friedman in 1947 that's also published by the NBR uh in this paper they reanalyzed budget studies that were used at the time to estimate consumption functions and they they found that that when they estimated consumption functions over time this consumption function shifted up as as the economy grew and so this basically was microevidence that made sense of as kuznes's result that this aggregate savings rate was not rising over time and it again was undermining the leading uh leading interpretation of uh the Keynesian consumption function the third study that is that is mentioned by modigliano Friedman is a is a study by Margaret Reed which is unpublished and this is uh they say the the first study that introduces the concept of permanent income so two of these three studies were were published by the NBR and to some extent were were done in the NVR so I think it's fair to say that the MBR played an import important role in the development of the permanent income hypothesis now back to Friedman and Schwartz's project within the MBR on money and banking so Milton Friedman takes over this project in 1948 and starts working closely with Anna Schwartz who had been working on this project since the early 40s now the original goal of the project was on the one hand to construct reliable data series on the money supply back to the Civil War and to the present now at the time there was a lot of controversy about how you define money and so on so they have various measures of money that they're setting out to measure and in addition to that they're interested in measuring lending and investing investment activity in the banking system now so so one of the big goals of the project is data construction and there's a sense in which they're trying to do for money and banking what the NBR had already done for for national income uh before that now there's a second part of the project which is that they're going to use this this new data to think about the causal effect of of money in monetary policy see on outcome so that's something that is you know in addition to just the data Construction now um this project originally was supposed to just take three years as they started working on it uh the project grew and grew and grew and eventually took several decades the major outputs from the project um the the biggest outputs are these four books three of which are by Friedman and Schwartz so there's the monetaries through the United States published in 1963 uh the monetary statistics of the United States published in 1970 and monetary Trends in the United States and the United Kingdom published in 1982. in addition to that another major book that came out of this is Philip kagan's book determinate determinants of the effects of the change in the stock of money which is published in 1965. in addition to this a bunch of other smaller articles in particular a very important paper by Friedman and Schwartz in 1963 on money in the business cycle are are outcomes that come out of this project now obviously the most influential single piece of work coming out of this project is the monetary history but I want to start by talking a little bit about the monitor statistics before I turn to the monetary history so the monetary statistics in in the words of Friedman and Swartz was first into draft but later into print so they started by constructing the statistics and these statistics so this book is basically reporting all the details of how they come up with these statistics um and and this is basically the foundation for all the rest of the work in the project so it's a very important piece of work this is a book that largely settles the baits that had been going on for a very long time about the definition of money so basically after this book the definition definition of money is pretty settled they introduced the modern language of M1 and M2 and they present estimates of M1 and M2 in the case of M2 back to the Civil War in the case of M1 back to the founding of the fed and also compile a bunch of uh other monitor Aggregates and estimates of the money supply that have been constructed by other people back to the founding of the Republic so it's a major major piece of empirical work that that the Mantra statistics are and it's the foundation of the rest of the project however it's the monetary history that's the most uh most uh influential piece of work this is a watershed the publication of Montreal history is a water chart moment in economics its influence in macroeconomics is immense is actually so immense that it's kind of hard to describe because um all kinds of words like Keynesian meant very different things before the the publication of the monetary history and and the montre history played a very big role in changing the way we think about so many things that when you read this stuff back 50 years ago it's very confusing because they're using words in really weird ways from a modern point of view uh like the word Keynesian um so the basic argument in the monetary history is a very very simple one it's that money and monetary policy are an important contributor to inflation and business cycles and from a modern point of view this is a super unconvented un controversial thesis you know it's like duh yeah but at the time this was a radical view there was a dissenting view from the prevailing Keynesian thinking at the time that was that this was not the case um now as I said today in the post monetary history post vulcer disinflation world it's universally accepted within Academia that inflation is always in everywhere a monetary phenomenon to to use a phrase that Milton Friedman popularized in in other writing um but you know a lot of you that are young in in the crowd might not remember that in in the pre-monetary history and pre-voker uh uh United States um the prevailing view in Academia was that this was not the case that actually monetary policy was not effective not important for business cycles and not effective at managing aggregate demand and managing inflation and that inflation should be vanished using fiscal policy or Price controls or wage controls uh or such things now it's important to keep in mind that even though this is what's called the Keynesian view this view is not held by Keynes before he died and it was also not held by the Federal Reserve in the 1950s as uh David and Chrissy Romer have discussed in their work um now the the basis for this view of the keynesians in the 1950s that money didn't matter was partly uh theoretical and partly empirical so um they thought of interest rates as the main transition transmission mechanism of monetary policy and Keynes had basically downplayed the importance of interest rates for consumption and then there were uh estimates at the time that seemed to suggest that that investment was also not very responsive to interest rates so it looks like things are not very responsive to interest rates so it can't be that money matters so that's one kind of pillar of this view another pillar of this view was that that in the Great Depression interest rates were very low so it must have been that money was very easy during the Great Depression and yet the economy collapsed so then monetary policy can't be very important and a third pillar of this view as far as I can tell is the fact that from a theoretical point of view on a Keynesian model if you're at the in a liquidity trap where interest rates are very very low then changes in money supply have small effects on interest rates so money is is kind of ineffective at changing interest rates now interest rates don't affect output very much or you're doubly in this in in a situation where money doesn't matter and it was the case from 1930 to 1951 that interest rates were pegged at a very low level so you were in this in this setting where uh according to the model uh monetary policy was not very important now Friedman Schwartz challenged this view that money doesn't matter in in the monetary history they do this in several ways so one of the things they they do in the in the book is to document that all posts were post-civil War uh downturns were preceded by monetary contractions and in particular uh the Great Depression saw monetary contraction that was enormous a 35 collapse in the money supply so this uh you know in a sense presents a different view of whether monitor plus it was easy or tight it seemed from this point of view that monetary policy was quite tight during the great great contraction which is what they called it now the lasting influence I think of the monetary history is not this timing argument it's more the the arguments that they make about causation running from money to Output okay and that's a much more complicated set of arguments than the timing arguments now the way in which they make these arguments is informal it uses A Narrative Approach but if you view what they're doing from a modern point of view and and use the modern language what they seem to be doing is trying to identify exogenous monetary policy shocks and then looking at the effects of these shocks um the the analysis of a great contraction is perhaps the most famous uh such analysis um they uh they point to tight Mantra policy so their interest rate increases in 1928 and 1929 so excessively tight monetary policy as uh one of the causes of the great contraction they then talk about the failure of the uh Federal Reserve to prevent massive banking panics throughout the Great Depression and that turning a garden variety recession into the Great Depression they point to uh the the dramatic increases in interest rates in the fall of 1931 defend to defend the dollar when uh Britain goes off gold there's a very contractionary Mantra policy shock during a time when the economy is collapsing and finally they they look at 1936 in 1937 and and and and and see very tight policy as a cause of the second round of the Great Depression the very large recession that occurs in 1937. now um after the publication of the monetary history there have been a number of different critiques of the analysis in the monetary history and kind of from all kinds of angles so one of the most famous critiques is a critique by Peter teman who argues that free administrates over emphasized the importance of money and causing the initial downturn um the basic argument is that if money was tight interest rates should be high but actually interest rates were low now from a modern dynamic point of view this View kind of misses the fact that if you have Tight money you can create very deflationary Dynamics and then even though nominal interest rates are low real interest rate might be very high and there's a little bit of controversy about this in literature but it seems that real interest rates were very high so money uh was tight even though nominal interest rates were low there's a set of different critiques of the monetary history that has to do with the kind of Fairly simplistic view of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy that Friedman and Swartz had in their analysis so so for example there's a string of papers that us that thinks that Friedman sorts under emphasized the role of Banks and Credit in the economy another string of papers that says that they underestimate the influence of interest rates on the velocity of money and therefore on um on the Mantra transmission mechanism some people go so far as to say that feed administrates had no theoretical framework to base their analysis on now it's true that they don't have any equations and they don't formally set down a mathematical framework but when you read what they're doing it's pretty clear that what is what their analysis is grounded in is a fairly simple Keynesian model a model that has a quantity equation so MD equals py kind of equation on the demand side of the economy and then some kind of Phillips curve on the supply side of the economy now it is true that that model has a very very simple monetary transmission mechanism and so some of these critiques have some bite in terms of of the analysis being somewhat simple on the more empirical side uh there's a there's a line of critiques that have to do with the timing assumption so the idea that that money uh the down tournament money leading the downturnment out uh output being a convincing argument that that money caused output I think in a modern uh you know modern the modern Viewpoint is that that wasn't particularly convincing um there's also critiques uh that the you know there's no econometrics uh but but then even people that that like the fact that they're using um The Narrative Approach have argued that they've applied that approach uh too informally that there may have been unconscious bias in the selection of dates and there was no formal method to analyze the effect so Friedman is famous for saying that there are long and variable lags if you take that to an extreme of course there's kind of like no testable predictions in the in the whole thing so you have to kind of um maybe be a little bit more formal about that and then there's the critique which I think is you know from a modern point of view when you read this stuff today there there is there is the the critique are these arguments about causal the causal effects convincing there might be confounding factors so in particular if you look at the 1937 event there are some important potential compounding factors like type fiscal policy and labor Strife during that period now I think despite the fact that some of these critiques have bite it's fair to say that that uh and I'm gonna steal a little bit of uh of my discussions Thunder and say that that Friedman and Swartz won the war um so Friedman and Swartz argument went from being a very controversial kind of radical view in the 1960s to be to be a conventional wisdom in the 21st century and I think Ben Bernanke summed it up pretty well in 2002 he was a governor at the Federal Reserve at the time and this was at a conference that honored Milton Friedman at his 90th birthday where he said I'd like to say to Milton and Anna regarding the Great Depression you're right we did it we're very sorry but thanks to you we do we won't do it again it's nice that Bernanke got to be you know chairman of the FED when they had to not do it again um so um so when you look at this whole history um it's it's kind of interesting from a modern point of view that um that it looks like monetary history had this pure this Wilderness period post Cane's pre-monetary history all of a sudden people believe that monetary policy didn't matter um and it really feels like this this Wilderness period for the whole field of monetary economics and I think Friedman of Schwartz in conjunction with with what Paul Walker did at the Federal Reserve basically brought monetary monetary economics back to life and it's hard from from today's Viewpoint to even believe the leading economists in the 40s and 50s thought that monetary policy was not important for for inflation of all things in addition to that you know the word Keynesian economics you know when you read this stuff Keynesian economics means that money doesn't matter in the 1960s today Keynesian economics means that money does matter so it's extremely jarring to read this literature from the 1960s such as the influence of the monetary history now um I'm almost out of time and maybe that's a good thing because um I you know I'm the very much youngest person in this crowd and I didn't live this period since 1978 as as much as some other people on this panel um now the Empire has dramatically changed since 1978 there's much less emphasis on data construction much more emphasis on conference is much wider membership of the MBR what is the influence of the MBR since it been since 1978 it's a very hard question what's the counterfactual now I do believe that the influence of the MBR since 1970 has been very large I don't think there's like a competitive market in these kinds of things and if the MBR wasn't there there would probably be a hole where the NBR is at the moment um just to give you like one sense of the influence of the MBR since 1978 let me flash up some of the papers that have been published in the NBR macro annual since it came into the being in 19 uh in the 1980s now these are some really really important papers okay so and I'm just giving you like the top top few so some of the most important papers in macro and monetary economics have been published by the MBR even in the post-1978 era so these are this is one page worth this is another page worth um here's a Page worth of books that are very important uh especially around uh uh you know the development of the new Keynesian model some of these books are are really key key contained key papers that were important in the development of that uh that line of uh of study but you know despite that I think the singular contribution of of the MBR to monitor economics is the Friedman Resorts project they created the modern data on monetary Aggregates and they were instrumental in leading monetary economics out of the post the 1936 Wilderness the years that that the field experienced [Applause]
