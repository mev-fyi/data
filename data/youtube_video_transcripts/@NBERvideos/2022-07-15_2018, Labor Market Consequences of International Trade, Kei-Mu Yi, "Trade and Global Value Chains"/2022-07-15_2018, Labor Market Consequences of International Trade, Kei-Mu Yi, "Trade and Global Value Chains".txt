so these are the topics i'm going to talk about i'm just going to present some evidence on the growth of world trade and the growth of global value chains and then i'm going to talk about some mechanisms through some research that i've done with unhili on how global value chains can mediate or propagate tariff liberalizations into changes in inequality especially changes in the skill premium so just by way of context you know gordon's this thorough broad sweep of all of the research on trade and the distributional consequences what i'm going to talk about is just a small sliver in the pantheon of the sweep that gordon did so let me start with a picture that we're all familiar with the growth of world trade this is a picture of the export share of gdp from 1970 to 2016. i've got four countries uh korea mexico the united states china and the world in the interest of time i'll just focus on the world which is the line in red and you see this general upward trend and in 2008 uh right before the great financial crisis uh exports as a share of gdp exceeded 30 percent uh worldwide and that was uh about two and a half times larger than it was in 1970. so this is one of the most commonly cited statistics as you know of uh the globalization of the world's economies uh since world war ii now a key feature of this trade growth has been an increase in vertical specialization global value chains there's a lot of terminology out there global supply chains the fragmentation of production etc and each of these terms comes with it many definitions so from the outset i just want to be precise about what i mean by global value chains and the basic idea is when a firm or an industry or a country uses imported inputs to make something a product and some of that product is subsequently exported then you have a global value chain and the key feature of that is that some portion of that product is crossing multiple national borders so one way of thinking about it is it's not intermediate goods trade it's a subset of intermediate goods trade it's that subset that is effectively crossing multiple borders while the production is uh occurring so that's what i mean by global value chains and you know in the literature and in the media we're all familiar with particular examples in the 1990s it was the barbie doll in the 2000s it was the iphone and there are many other micro examples of this but we don't have a lot of aggregate data on it or we didn't have a lot until recently so i just want to report a couple of measures of these global value chains that are consistent with this definition that i just gave and one of them is value-added exports and the other is this measure of upstreamness of our production from final demand so let me start with value-added exports the idea of value-added exports is to measure the domestic value added embodied in exports so one way of thinking about production is production occurs from the use of value-added labor and capital in particular and then also intermediate inputs and some of those intermediate inputs are sourced domestically and some are sourced from abroad now those that are sourced domestically are produced themselves from some domestic value-added and from some other intermediate inputs some of which might be sourced domestically and some of which might be sourced abroad so you can kind of peel back that production process all the way in some sense to the end where ultimately you can break it out into just domestic value added and foreign value added and what value-added exports does is all that peeling back into those two categories and it measures as i said the domestic value-added component of of exports now it's typically reported as a share so the idea is of one dollars worth of exports how much represents domestic value added versus foreign value added and obviously one minus that share would be the contribution of foreign value added and one minus that share this contribution of for foreign value added to be clear is the uh amount of foreign uh value-added embodied in say in a domestic good that is then subsequently exported so this measure directly captures this multiple border crossing idea that's central to the way i've defined global value chains so it's typically calculated with data from input output tables and i'm going to show a couple of pictures in a second but one thing i want to mention as a caveat is that to the extent that countries rely a lot on special economic zones china has done that for example with the shenzhen zone and before that mexico had all these border plants the maquiladoras to the extent that countries rely a lot on those these measures of domestic value added using input output tables will tend to overestimate the domestic value-added content and underestimate the foreign value-added content so with that caveat let me show some pictures from data from the oecd the same four countries i showed before korea mexico the united states china and then also the european union and you see um a general downward trend so again that means that uh this by the way goes from 1995 to 2014 so the last two decades and so the general downward trend just means that the domestic value added content has been decreasing over time of exports or in other words the foreign value added content has been increasing now one exception if you look at the purple line uh that's uh china as of around 2003 uh china's uh domestic value added content was pretty low um lower than mexico's or korea's for example but since then it's been increasing and i think that's consistent with some other facts that we know about china in the last 10 years but overall the trend has been downward um as most of you know the vast majority of international trade is in manufactured goods so let me show a calculation on the domestic value-added share of manufacturing exports and this draws from work by rob johnson and guillermo nogueira who along with kupman wang and wei and a couple of others have really been the leaders in uh pushing the construction and implementation of these measures so this picture goes further back to 1970 up to 2009 and what this chart shows is that the domestic value-added content of exports globally has fallen from about two-thirds to one-half again the flip side is that the foreign content has increased from about one-third to to slightly over a half so that means in some average sense the typical manufactured export good globally embodies more foreign value-added than uh domestic value-added so this measure of value-added exports shows i think pretty clearly at an aggregate level that global value chains the presence of them has been increasing over time so let me turn briefly to this other measure upstreamness of production so the idea here is it measures the distance of production from final demand so again just thinking about a typical production process a firm or an industry makes stuff and then some of that stuff is sold to final consumers or to firms for capital investment but some of that stuff is also sold to other firms to be used as an intermediate in their production process and those that stuff that sold to other firms to be used as an intermediate in their production process when they make their good those goods are further sold either for final consumption or again as another intermediate so what this upstream measured upstream this measure counts is how many steps how many intermediate good steps do you go through before you reach the final consumption so these are measures that paul entras and davine shore as well as several other people tebow folly and others have constructed and again you can use input output tables to calculate them and uh and and again the the the idea of this measure is it to the extent there's greater upstreamness that's consistent with having longer production chains and longer global value chains and so antares insurer report that uh upstreamness in the world between 1995 and 2011 increased by 10 percent so again this is uh consistent with uh increased global value chains so that was just a brief uh summary of aggregate global countrywide measures on global value chains and i think they show pretty clearly that these have been increasing so now i want to shift gears and talk about the uh the role of global value chains in mediating and propagating change trade liberalizations into changes in inequality and changes in the skill premium in particular and so this part these next few slides draws from joint research with unhealy at the university of maryland so the motivation we had two motivations one is the facts that i just presented on the increasing prevalence of global value chains and the second is some of the research that gordon talked about in the past there was a lot of empirical research that evaluated the effects of increased international trade on inequality and uh and a lot of this research was also summarized in this excellent survey paper by nina pachnik and penny goldberg and what they found in their survey is that when you had these bilateral liberalizations that inequality or the skill premium tended to increase in both countries and so that was an interesting finding because that was inconsistent with kind of the dominant uh theoretical paradigm the which comes from the hectural lin model this stouper samuelson mechanism in which one country's skill premium should increase but the other country the country that has a comparative advantage in less skilled intensive activities to the extent that the less skilled workers benefit from the trade liberalization their relative wages should rise and hence in that country the skill premium should fall so uh this empirical this fairly robust empirical finding across a number of studies was inconsistent with that paradigm so basically the goal of our paper is to leverage this increase in gvcs but also try to build a theoretical framework that allows for more transmission mechanisms so that an increase in the skill premium in both countries can be an outcome and and in particular build in global value chains as well as endogenous labor supply and then use that framework quantify that framework gordon talked in his uh talk about ge general equilibrium that's what this framework is uh just a general equilibrium framework with some numbers attached to it and use that to evaluate the quantitative effect of the china shock and just focusing on the bilateral reduction of barriers between the u.s and china and then look at that effect on the skill premium so i'm just going to try to summarize our framework in in one slide so the global value chain aspect comes from this first the way we're characterizing production it occurs in multiple sequential stages each stage uses some value added and a composite intermediate but the key part is that the downstream stages used the upstream goods as an input into its production process so that's the way that we're bringing in the global value chain part and then we have a richer labor structure than is typical in these models in that workers our potential workers are heterogeneous so they vary in their type their college and non-college educated workers but even within the type they vary in their skills and their ability to succeed in different sectors and occupations and they're just going to pick the sector and occupation that maximizes their wage so some of you may recognize this as the roy model so we just are mixing essentially a global value chain framework with a roy model in terms of international trade we can have the stages separated and sourced in principle by different countries but of course we're going to have trade barriers both they could be political or technological barriers and uh and and then at the end of the day international trade is going to be motivated is going or is going to occur through a comparative advantage that can occur across different dimensions relative uh factor supplies or relative technology differences and these can also vary across stages of production finally so we've got the production side the labor side international trade then our framework is going to deliver implications for the skill premium in response to uh reductions in trade barriers and as i said it's a it goes beyond this hector lin paradigm in in that we're going to have several other potential uh several other transmission mechanisms hence giving the potential for an outcome where the skill premium can rise in both countries following a tariff a trade liberalization so that's the framework in terms of taking it to the data we use a three countries set up with the u.s china and a composite rest of the world we in this paper we just have two stages of production an upstream and a downstream stage we have three sectors agriculture mining manufacturing and services the value added on the labor front occurs through five occupational inputs that vary according to the tasks involved so for example managers is one production workers is another and then there are two worker types college educated and non-college educated there are a lot of parameters in our setting this might seem like a fairly simple setting but it's fairly rich there are a lot of parameters and we choose parameters either some that are coming from other related studies and other parameters are chosen so that the model has implications for shares of output relative wages uh etc that are consistent with the data in the u.s china and the rest of the world so that's our framework and then this is how we put numbers to it and then we're going to run our main simulation exercise which is this reduction in u.s china trade costs by 50 percent so this is the main result i'm just going to focus on this result that we get when we run that simulation we find that that the model implies an increase in the skill premium in china of about two percent an increase in the skill premium of the us of about one percent and basically no change in the rest of the world so what's going on here i mean one advantage of using you know models of course have pros and cons but one pro is that we can tease out kind of the intuition the explanation and some of the forces at work and it is driven by comparative advantage but in our framework we have both comparative advantage at the sector level and at the stage level and in our framework china in terms of understanding the result for china there are comparative advantages in manufacturing but it turns out that manufacturing draws in the less educated workers so to the extent that this liberalization moves china more towards manufacturing that's actually going to be a force to reduce the skill premium but in addition uh china specializes in downstream stages and then it turns out in the parameterization of our model the downstream stages are relatively more skill intensive than the upstream stages so these uh so to the extent that china moves more to the downstream stages there's going to be greater demand for the higher skilled occupations and it turns out the more highly educated workers move into those highly skilled occupations so that's going to be a force for increasing the skill premium and you can tell by the final number the fact that it's positive for china that this stage level comparative advantage effectively it dominates the sector level comparative advantage so um so that's so that's kind of the story for how our model can imply an increase in the skill premium in china for the u.s it's a little bit more of a standard result the both the sector and stage level comparative advantage work to increasing the skill premium in the u.s [Music] so but kind of the summary of what we have is that owing to the presence of global value chains this trade liberalization basically leads both countries to take advantage of stage specialization as well as the usual sector specialization and that can deliver outcomes where the skill premium can rise in both countries we have other tables in our paper that try to isolate the specific role of global value chains and we find that it does play a key quantitative role in generating this outcome so those numbers that we got how do they compare to the actual changes in the skill premium basically uh they can account for about one-third of the increase in china's skill premium between 2000 and 2007 and about one-fifth of the increase in the u.s skill premium in the 2000s so just to wrap up uh i showed some evidence in the increasing prevalence of global value chains and then i showed how uh then i talked about this uh research with unhealy on how global value chains can act as a propagation mechanism from trade liberalization to changes in the skill premium and that's really the main conclusion and then if i might want to take a step back you know we can also talk about some of the recent policies pursued by the current administration and owing to global value changes this is something i think all of you are familiar with the the policies especially vis-a-vis canada and mexico could uh backfire and just as an example uh uh this work by dick ortare who combines uh input output table data with firm level data it's basically shown that the typical u.s import from mexico embodies about 50 percent u.s value added so putting a tariff on u.s imports from mexico it's effectively putting a tax on u.s firms so i'll stop there thank you
