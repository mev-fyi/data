the topic title is central bank digital currencies challenges and opportunities we left it really broad because we have a broad set of perspectives uh from our speakers whom i will introduce in just a moment let me first tell you why we think this is the right topic to discuss at this time central banks around the world are very actively considering whether they should introduce a central bank digital currency which would be an obligation of the central bank used for payments in the general economy um the european central bank which is we're delighted to have dr ulrich binsau uh from today and i'll introduce him properly in a moment is considering the introduction of a digital euro china is already in about to release a digital euro that it's developed over the last years and the united states is still considering uh the costs and benefits it's not even to the point yet of discussing development of the technology beyond research and in the united states the payment system uh is actually lagging in quality the those of europe and china in terms of efficiency and so you might think the order is backwards that united states might have come first in this area but the federal reserve has not decided what to do in fact different governors have different views on this vice chair quarles just this week gave a speech in which he pointedly called out christine lagarde the president of the european central bank asking why would a cbdc increase financial inclusion if you get it through the banks and the if you have to get it through a bank why wouldn't you just get a bank account uh another governor of the federal reserve uh chris waller has said cbdc is a solution in search of a problem neither of those two governors see a need for it governor leo brainard on the other hand is more sanguine about the idea and said she cannot quote unquote wrap her head around the idea that the united states would not develop a digital dollar given the fact that many other central banks are actively developing it so the us has yet to decide it's going to release the federal release of paper in the coming days about costs and benefits but is still far from developing a digital dollar so this is a very very uh active area of discussion has impact on financial markets on the payment system on banking on the franchises of banks in the area of deposits credit cards and payments generally it's a big deal and that's why we called together three of the top experts in the world to speak about this i mentioned dr ulrich binsale ulrich is the director general of market infrastructure and payments at the european central bank and the author of central banking before 1800 a rehabilitation but beyond being a thought leader on central bank digital currencies and other aspects of central banking ulric is actually doing it he is running the digital euro project for the ecb and i'm sure he'll tell us about that we also have professor monica piedzesi stanford university and nber she's the joan kennedy joan kenny professor of economics at stanford university and the author of many uh papers that you're all familiar with but in particular the author of credit lines bank deposits or cbdc competition and efficiency and modern payment systems with professor martin schneider our third speaker today is marcus brenumeier the edwards sanford professor of economics at princeton university and the director of the bend time center for finance at princeton university and the author of the noted recent book the resilient society he has also been a thought leader on central bank digital currencies in part through his paper with dirk nepelt on the equivalence of private and public money so i'm going to turn it over to our three speakers we've allocated them each uh eight minutes sharp that i've told them that i'm a menacing timekeeper i have my stopwatch out uh and then we're going to have a bit of crosstalk and then we're going to open it up for q a from the floor uh so uh ulrich would you please uh lead us off thank you thank you daryl for inviting me and for allowing me even to use a few slides which i hope you can you can now see and so i have basically these three questions i will quickly answer why cbdc from the ecb perspective then say a few word about the project we have formally launched and and briefly something on monetary policy and financial stability dimensions of cbdc so first why cbdc according to the ecb and i think it's it's it's very simple society and payments gradually digitalize in some countries it's very advanced sweden is a famous example china as well so you have a declining use of cash payment is a network activity at some stage the whole thing you know collapses or cash use can collapse and then there is basically no central bank money available any longer or used in practice and the whole construct we have been relying on for now quite a while the two two-layer monetary system in which commercial bank money is supposed to be convertible into central bank money becomes a rather theoretical construct so for this from this perspective offering cbdc is nothing else than to preserve the current ecosystem the current monetary system which has always relied on a mixture between central bank money and commerce bank money and the convertibility of commercial bank money which should not be a theoretical concept or cannot be a theoretical concept so central banks just move with time with changes in society digitalization and stay in business for policy reasons and maybe on top of this one could say tackling sovereignty concerns is a topic in europe um while the rail you you said kindly that the europeans would be more advanced than the americans in terms of payments i mean that's not true for the payment instruments used a day-by-day basis by people where you know american companies have been extremely successful in europe and and have let's say power market power and uh you know if you extrapolate that into the future they have growing even market shares also in the newest segments of payment and if you add to this a perspective of global stable coins then there is a sovereignty issue for an activity as important for society as payments is so um now we have launched this digital europe project and an investigation phase so the ecb has not said we will issue a digital euro that is still open that decision has not been taken but a project has been launched this is the first project i have seen in the ecb which is launched without it having been decided to use a product that is being developed in in the uh project but this relates to the you know lead time and the importance of being able to issue cbdc presumably at some point in time so the investigation phase will last two years and will clarify the scope and use cases and here there are some example of use cases point of sale e-commerce person-to-person business to personal online offline cross-border payments programmability the list of possible use cases is very long but a project also needs to focus we cannot you know address every use case and have the broadest possible scope such a project would be unmanageable we have to focus on something and deliver something valuable in certain segments while in the long term of course then we can expand further then other functional requirements like the form factor mobile payment will it be a card will it be a feasible on a desktop privacy traceability remuneration limits inclusiveness all sorts of functional requirements you have to set in the investigation phase and the distribution model what is the role of banks or other regulated intermediaries in distributing it then the so-called business model so any um payment a private payment instrument like a card scheme has a so-called business model you know someone pays and sustains the ecosystem you know involved delivering services like in the case of a card scheme there's a merchant fee the merchant fee is used to pay the scheme to pay the issuer of the cards and um because typically the user doesn't pay and the question is how how is that translated into cbdc or is cbdc just for free but what would it mean to be for free have no merchant fee if all the private payment solutions rely on a merchant fee big questions and and then of course the question of suitable technical solution central account token yeah there are lots of you know focus on those questions but if the word token is used you know it can mean so many different things but definitely the technical solution is also in scope of this investigation phase and we have i mean again if you go deeper and ask yourself what do you want to exactly do there are lots of i would say deep questions you indeed have to shed light on like probably you want to minimize industry investment costs for implementing and supporting the digital euro you want to not have you want as a central rank not be too dependent on the industry because you want it to be a separate product where you can put the parameters as a central bank and then you want a distinct value proposition also something that is not you know just a little button that you switch on your payment app and then suddenly you pay in central bank money but probably something which is for the user distinguishable and at the same time you don't want to crowd private initiatives so those are lots of things that you combine them you you know this will all determine your function requirement how you really will design the issue and that's also part of the investigation phase last point i want to cover is the no harm on monetary policy and financial stability so central banks don't view cbdc as a tool of monetary policy certainly central banks don't want to discontinue banknotes so there's no consideration whatsoever on you know policy space you get at the zero lower bound through cbdc because you don't you get rid of banknotes central banks don't want to get rid of banknotes so that's not the topic and central banks also as far as i can see don't say ability to put interest on cbdc is an extra policy instrument you could use in an intelligent manner i think that would overload the monetary policy ambitions and the central banks are not really talking about that and then you have the issue of bank runs which has been identified so the financial stability issue so both together you know bring you to that you need you know some restrictions and just to take maybe on monetary policy again the euro area has a monetary policy stance where aaa short-term government bonds have a yield of minus 60 base points so it's totally obvious you cannot offer digital euro unlimited at zero interest rate because you would immediately tighten your monetary policy stance everybody would go into digital euro and yield level at the short end would would jump by 60 basis points so you need either limits or remuneration negative remuneration and one one you know option i had explored also in the working paper is a tiered interest rate approach you don't want you know holders to have to pay a negative rate on the first digital euro they hold so one way to solve this is give them a certain amount which is remunerated never worse than bank notes so zero let's say at the moment but for higher holdings i mean treat it like an investment asset and accept that if your monetary policy stance wants to see short-term aaa debt trading at -60 basis points yield then you know put the interest rate on large cbdc holdings at let's say minus one percent currently to be quite certain to not interfere with the policy stance and this also gives you a tool against the bank runs and it's just a bit more elegant than the limit which reduces the elasticity of the usage of cbtc that's all from my side for now thank you perfect uh monica you're up please thank you very much for having me on this panel uh so i wanted to talk about the world in which uh cbdc gets will get introduced so basically it's a market for liquidity and we all have liquidity needs that are unpredictable so they with some rate b there these liquidity needs arrive and if you find yourself in the situation where you want to buy something you have two ways to pay currently you have deposits that you have to hold before you buy something uh and then you withdraw these deposits when you need them or you can arrange for a credit line with your bank and you draw down the credit line when you need it the sellers of goods they receive deposits after they sell you uh their items and so all these payments are arranged currently by banks that provide us uh deposits and credit lines uh so let's uh assume for the moment that banks are not special for anything else they're just special for providing us with deposits and and credit lines i'm taking a liquidity-centric view here of banking and so what are other frictions in the world so i think of farms as having balance sheet costs so they have some costs kappa proportional to assets to the length of their balance sheets they also face leverage constraints so banks in particular face leverage constraints so when they issue deposits they have to back these deposits with some assets and so phi here is some maximum leverage constraint that they face okay so if you think about this world that i just described and you think about how to organize payments in a way that maximizes welfare you would want to do it with the shortest possible balance sheets to save uh balance sheet costs and so how does this work so suppose the market for liquidity only had deposits uh here are the balance sheets uh the buyers hold some deposits that they have at the bank the bank has to back these deposits with some capital uh some assets uh that it holds okay so this is what happens before the trade then now the buyers get a liquidity shock they want to spend and so they so b of them uh actually spent that shows up as an asset on the seller side um so these are deposits on the seller side and nothing happens at the bank level because the bank just now has fewer deposits from buyers and more deposits from sellers so this involves long balance sheets including of firms that buy and were not natural holders of deposits because they faced this balance sheet cost they would rather not save and deposits in some sense so they are not natural savers and also you have high precautionary deposit holdings if your liquidity needs are very unpredictable so if v is small if you don't know whether you want to spend you have to hold a lot of deposits before you actually spend so this world is involved with long balance sheets that are costly so what happens when you introduce credit lines uh credit lines are a contingent liability uh that is off balance sheets so before trade the trade uh you don't see anything on balance sheets it's just that the buyers have arranged for a credit line with the bank uh and so this credit line is l i'm going to call this l and so once the liquidity shock arrives uh b buyers will draw down their credit lines and pay uh for these items with the seller the seller has no choice the seller is gonna get deposits uh and so what happens at the bank level is that the buyers by withdrawing uh by drawing down their credit line create an asset for the bank that becomes an asset and the deposit of the seller becomes a liability of the bank and so what happens here is that the drawn credit line backs the deposits of the seller and so this is a word with short balance sheets because we don't need to have precautionary deposit holdings before the trade so you see empty balance sheets before the trade when firms buy goods for example when they invest or they buy inputs they will use credit lines because they have a balance sheet cost so they don't want to use deposits they prefer credit lines uh and so what the what happens at the bank level is that there is now a complementarity between deposits and credit lines and that makes it cheap for banks to handle these payments because deposits and drawn credit lines show up on the both sides of the balance sheet and that shortens balance sheets so now think about introducing cbdc into this world what's cbdc it's a new product in the market for liquidity that is offered by a deposit-only intermediary the cbdc comes with a new technology so the central bank has its own balance sheet costs it's not free for the central bank to introduce it so it has its own balance sheet called kappa star it has its own maximum leverage ratio five star um and let's suppose for the moment that the central bank offers these things at marginal costs so in the world where banks offer only deposits then the only thing that matters is whether this technology is better whether it's cheaper for the central bank to offer deposits compared to commercial banks what happens if it's cheaper is all depositors switch to cbdc banks will go out of business but because i've assumed that banks are really only good at providing payment instruments it doesn't matter this is good for society to introduce cbdc so that's one case but this is not the world we live in we live in the world where we're currently paying with deposits and credit lines so cbdc is not complementary to credit lines because it's offered by a an intermediary who only does deposits uh central banks have not started thinking about offering credit lines so in this case it's destroying complementarities and so then it will only be beneficial if this new technology is really much better and so that what this mechanism relies on is an externality among liquidity providers it creates costs for banks in general equilibrium if these uh if cvdc steps in and you have the same argument when stable coins uh get introduced or you have money market mutual funds it makes it more costly for banks to handle these payments when i talk a little bit about market power so the a common argument is that banks have market power in deposits and so by introducing cbdc uh you introduce a product that competes with deposits and that makes markets more competitive and so that's a reason why welfare may go up and so the question is is that a good argument for government intervention i would say not really because there are many product markets where you have market power by firms uh should the government produce all these goods to provide competition for these farms i would say no that's not the role of the government it's better for just the government to allow for competition from private farms they will compete away the market power and deposits so allow for stable coins allow money market mutual funds or the narrow bank to compete with uh banks and deposits more generally this will interact with other import fractions um that we have and so it's going to be ambiguous for welfare uh how we think about introducing cbdc because banks also have for example market power in the loan market and so then there are papers that show that if you introduce cbdc uh in a market where market banks have market power not just in deposits but also in loans uh the effects on welfare are highly ambiguous uh so um this is one thank you thanks so much monica very clear uh marcus uh you get to uh to go last and please go ahead well thanks a lot darryl it's a pleasure to be part of this uh panel and uh i would like to say a few words uh as ulrich and monica pointed out i will go a little bit beyond banks so traditionally of course we have central banks issuing cash to the households and reserves to the banks and then they're multiplied and issued and inside money to the households and i would like to extend it a little bit also the introduction of cbdc will also affect not only the banking sector but also fintech and platforms and i think that's important to take into account too not to have a trust a narrow banking view and so what are the big trends of course the one big trend is that as already pointed out the physical cash is losing on relevance so the anchor of the unit of account has to be preserved in order to maintain your loss of monetary sovereignty there's this whole phenomenon of digital dollarization or uranization or reminization whatever you want to call it so each country especially small emerging market economies are worried to lose their monetary policy power and that can't do any monetary policy anymore the second trend is that we move really from a bank-centric world to a platform-centric world where the information gatherings and information advantages are actually not with the banks but with platforms and you know with abilities with big data artificial intelligence machine learning deep learning there's a flip in the information advantage typically a customer has the advantage and has get some consumer surplus net flips there's instead of other selection we have inverse selection and then we have the digital tokens and stable coins and so forth of your smart contracts and programmable money and all of these things will really fundamentally change their financial universe and the question is where should cbdc come in and what does cbtc do in this world so first with the banks and they'll keep this fairly short because monica was already outlining it cbdc's will compete with the banks and that's fine and the question is in crisis time it might undermine financial stability that's a big concern cbdc's creates an additional safe haven and depositors can run into cbdc's and you know that makes bank accounts more likely and i'm worried about this less so because you know the central bank can always channel the funds back to the bank if the bank is solvent the central bank can channel it back so i think this worry about the bank running probability increasing is overplayed i think the bigger worry is if you don't have cbdc you have a run on your currency so it's a whole run on your system especially the small emerging economies you run out of the system in a different currency and then it's much harder for the central bank to protect its own financial system and that when you're with cbdc they run at least into something which stays within your country and i think that's more important to keep in mind now now in normal times that's what monica was pointing out you know do you want to have cbdc's competing with bank deposits and erode the profit opportunities for private banks and monica was very much pushing a lot of synergies between lending and money creation in particular with credit lines and you know that's essentially uh cbdc will compete with the private banks and take their profit away and perhaps you want this profit because there's natural synergies or you would like to have a franchise value with banks in order to limit excessive risk-taking they have a franchise value and they don't want to lose it or you need the franchise value to stay in the regulatory perimeter otherwise that go outside of the everything moves to the shader banking system or you want to have as a government this franchise value because you convince the banks to fund your pet projects as politicians and you would like to have this too but the question is why if you want franchise value for the private banking sector why should it be granted through market power on the deposit market why can also subsidize it otherwise why is this subsidy going through the deposit market and there's a third argument you could say you know you want essentially the deposits with the banks in order to make bankrupts more likely to be as act as a disciplinary rule like a calamitous khan diamond raj on a story but you know you don't really need them to issue inside money just issuing short-term debt is enough it doesn't need to be money short-term that would be enough to do so but the bigger thing i would like to emphasize here is essentially um [Music] what's the code what does cbdc do with respect to fintech and platform so cbdc will also compete with all the new forms of money and the tokens provided by platforms and of course one thing is you have to provide stable coins which are tied and packed to the let's say dollar or the euro then you preserve the uniformity of money uh it's all the stable coins will not create a separate unit of account and this way monetary sovereignty is better preserved but these stable coins are run grown and require some lender of lost resort so they're pretty much like a bank or a money market fund and you have to help them out again now if you think about platforms they're different their platforms digital platforms which improve the matching technology because on the platform you have better matching and you also issue some digital tokens there's a payment technology and then the whole issue with granting credit through smart contracts come into play as well and that's you know is is really going on on this modern and there's more modern platforms and there's an interaction between the matching technology the digital token with payments and also new forms of credit and the question is should cbtc be then the legal tender for all digital transactions so whenever you want to pay you always can play with cbdc and there are different forms of interoperability you have to keep in mind so one argument would be you know there's always platforms they all want to create their own walls and stay within walls and reduce inter ability to have more platform power and lock people in and this way uh the problem is as i log in in token world that if somebody has a token it's very expensive to swap the token for dollars you have to pay an exchange and exit fee for example and digital platforms would like to offer their own tokens in order to lock them in in the same ecosystem and this way and if you have some exchange interoperability you can't do that and offering cbdc as legal tender would actually help that because you can always say you know you have to accept cbdc as legal tender so this would actually make the whole platform competition across platforms much more powerful because on each platform you can use the digital euro or the digital dollar or whatever the digital currency is as legal tender so that's one argument in favor of cbdc as legal tender another argument which goes in the opposite direction is that if you issue tokens on a platform you can grant credit and you can enforce the payment much more easily the repayment of the loan or the credit much more easily through smart contracts like some smart forward contracts if your future sales revenue you have to sell it on this platform and the platform will see the sales when you come in and they will immediately use it to pay back your loan so in these platforms you have this commitment power which you don't have if the cbdc's are legal tender so if they're if you sell your product and you can pay somebody can pay you with cbdc you can still pay it on the side and the platform will not see it if it has to be paid with the platform token the platform will see it and then you know this way it automatically through smart contracts the credit will be paid back there's an operability in use it's a different operability and this would actually speak for a setting where you don't want to have cpc as legal tender because it would undermine this additional commitment power platforms have and then there's as another if you think about the competition between an existing platform a potentially entrant platform where a new platform is coming in and thinks oh what will happen and let's suppose we have private credit tokens and people have credit and loans with this private token uh the new entrant can destroy the old platform because it kicks it out and then actually these uh creditors that would benefit from destroying the old platform or the incumbent platform and this way it actually if a new platform comes in with new technology is new to open arrangement new plot a blockchain platform then actually it would destroy the old platform and this way could actually threaten the incumbent platform to take over and create a lot of havoc this way and then the old platform is actually paying fees or some tribes essentially to make sure that the new new entry is not coming in in this case it's very distortionary so you would like to have a setting where there is a techno technological interoperability between the old and the new platform so the new entrance doesn't have too much threat to come in to kick out the old platform and a replacing technology in this way uh hurting the old platform ethics benefit of the creditors of on the old platform so let me sum up in my few remarks i think cbdc is very important it is a cash substitute cash is going away you want to maintain monetary sovereignty this is very important probably less important for the u.s or europe but very important for emerging economies who are constantly under threat for digital dollarization or whatever you want to call it uh there's some other the foreign currency moving in or some private firms uh currency moving in like libra or something and the question is do you want to be offensive or defensive so many emerging economies will be defensive to protect their own monetary sovereignty you can also be offensive to take over somebody else's country's currency and payment space but the bigger thing is do you want access to your own citizens direct access then you need cbdc and you want to compete with the banks and how do you want to compete with the platforms and with respect to the bank competition it's a stability issue so it's a bank versus currency runs i think if you have cbdc's you i don't think you make bank runs more likely but it makes it less likely of a run on your currency and the question is why do you want to ground bank's market power and monica pointed out one aspect of this but the question is why do you do it through market power if you want to subsidize somebody uh why not other forms of subsidies or transfers and then the question is cbdc's will compete with the platforms and also might enhance the competition across the platforms and the three forms of interoperability concepts which are very important to distinguish right as legal tender might destroy some of that and finally i would like one more sentence when we move from a setting we have currently to a new platform-centric financial sector the transition itself will also come with a lot of financial stability risks thanks marcus uh a great review of the topic uh before before i uh get into i mean it would take two hours to have a proper discussion of all these costs and benefits uh so i'm gonna i'm gonna pull a fast one on our panelists and then on everyone there you've named a lot of costs and benefits central banks are grappling with these right now and there are different stages i'd like to know uh whether you think most major economies will have introduced or general use a cbdc within 10 years yes or no i'm gonna start with uh monica because she's smiling and are you saying yes or no yes i i think they will introduce it uh i think it's the um as currency is going to go out of circulation uh central banks will want to be in that space of providing electronic payments i i think that the this idea will sound very good uh even if there's pros and cons i think at the end the pro argument will win uh well rick i'm going to give you uh a bit of an out because you're a policymaker and you're not speaking i'm presuming you're not speaking on behalf of the ecb but just as a safety so that uh nobody reports that you're saying the ecb will come out with this you could restrict your answer to all currency zones other than the eurozone could you answer yes or no will most countries have cbdc's within 10 years in common use i mean most not because 10 years goes very quickly and this is a big thing you know so if you say most in 10 years that that's too strong but uh but the the direction is clear and and and some will have it in 10 years and more will have it in 20 years that's good that's pretty specific considering your position uh marcus uh you're i would agree i would say the us would move last and might not happen in ten years and the reason is twofold first of all in the financial industry is much bigger sway in the us and and the other aspect is that u.s is also a global currency and you don't want to experiment with the major global currency you see how the others do it and how it plays out and you learn from the experience and then adopt it later on
