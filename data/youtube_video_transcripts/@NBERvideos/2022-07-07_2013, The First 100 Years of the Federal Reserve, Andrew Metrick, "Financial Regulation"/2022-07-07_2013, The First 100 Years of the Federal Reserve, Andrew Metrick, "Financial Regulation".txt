thanks a lot neil and thanks for the invitation as neil said this is co-authored work with my colleague gary gordon who is sitting here and i'm going to try to go through a hundred years of regulation in 20 minutes i'll start with a thank you to rick mishkin for dressing like me today so i'm not the only one who is obeying the normal summer institute dress code changing it around so uh what i'm going to talk about is for anyone who's seen the paper i relatively quickly go through a lot of the main topics in the paper focus on the beginning i'm focused i have 100 years but i'm going to focus most of the attention on uh the night the the founding of the fed in the 1920s and the great depression this is where we think we have kind of an interesting theme that then holds and continues throughout all of the fed's history and is still with us today oh that's the first few topics talk about the legislation the new deal period and then the transformation of banking that kind of ended the quiet period um and a variety of things that we know have happened recently such as the financial crisis and the dodd-frank act so the main theme from looking at this regulation over 100 years regulation by itself is not tremendously central to what the fed has been thinking it does i think for most of its history if you just think about regulator but the lender of last resort function is really something that sits right in between being a supervisor a bank supervisor and a monetary authority and the fed was as we've heard people talk about founded in large part to prevent financial crises and the discount window just its main way to go and do that and create an elastic currency from its founding and going forward had a variety of functions and our theme here is going to be the tension between those functions and how that has actually limited and created uh barriers for the lender of last resort function to to work as well as it can and that that's still with us kind of created that with some confusion in the 1920s and that's still with us so that's what we're gonna what we're gonna do okay so first just our one slide to think a little bit about what why we regulate finance at all uh why is it different than the shoe industry so you know what are we what are we thinking about and we usually start with the idea that there's significant information asymmetries in this market and that there are also potential negative externalities kind of two different things on the information asymmetry side for many financial transactions we're going to just think that the seller has and sometimes the buyer a lot more information one party has a lot more information the other that's a market failure should go in and do something about that and and we do that's not mainly what the fed does unless we're going to count the cfpb really as part of the fed it's mainly done by the sec this the cftc the cfpb the ftc and a variety of state authorities that would be very involved in this kind of consumer investor protection side of financial regulation more interesting i think uh for for us in this room and for the federal reserve are the potential negative externalities of liquidity demand so in crisis times what is obvious is that liquidity is a limited common resource and everyone wants it and in normal times what happens is well we create lots of additional liquid securities when i create a liquid security i don't consider the externality that's going to cause to the system if all of a sudden at the same time during crisis people are going to demand it okay so going back to to doug's work with phil dibig we kind of have a nice formal way to think about that and really it's the in the normal times we can get an over creation of liquid securities so we have to think there therefore how do we deal with these two problems and that's a tension that's going to be there from the beginning okay at the time of the the fed's founding we've heard some of this already today it was uh the the prevent banking panics through the creation of an elastic currency and we're going to do that predominantly through the discount window this is right in the preamble to the federal reserve act as is improved supervision whatever that means there's a notion that at the same time that we're going to be lending to people we're going to need to be supervising them as we heard this morning from julio the founding of the fed was also the product of numerous compromises and those compromises ended up embodied somewhat in the discount window and its function so one of the things um and this is also in barrican green's paper one of the things that it needed to do was have a national market a very a very deep market for bankers acceptances so that dollars could compete with pounds and that's somewhat similar but not exactly the same as elastic currency you really need to be in the business making sure that we have a deep market for buying and selling uh real bills and then the other thing was politically weak and at the time really needed to be nice and this continued for some time until after world war ii to be nice to treasury and let them borrow cheaply particularly during and immediately after world war one so the discount window had a lot of these functions and as we'll talk about later the discount rate for quite some time was below the the prevailing rate on commercial bills so that's going to that that's obviously going to create a lot of people borrowing from the window who don't necessarily have to it's a cheap way to get so our paper has uh no theory and very limited data mostly stuff we stole from other people so no regressions but lots of quotes so really i'm back to the days of junior high school when i would just take quotes i'd say five page paper i can do that and so i'm just going to show you a few of them here i mean i'm not going to read all of them but the basic idea is that at the time that the fed was created the idea is it's going to prevent banking panics not be there when the panic starts but rather because it is there everyone will know that when banks need liquidity they'll be able to go to the fed they'll be able to borrow and thus we're not going to have a crisis this is a very important point which i had no idea uh sadly because of the the weak education that we get these days i had no idea of this important history that it wasn't just being a lender of last resort in the crisis but rather because it would be there we wouldn't have a crisis to begin with um try to find a good quote here is from from robert owen who is this is the middle quote senate sponsor of the federal reserve act you can see gives assurance to businessmen of the country that they never need fear of currency famine assures them absolutely against the danger of a financial panic and then in the middle of the next paragraph the controller of the currency announced in 1914 with the new federal reserve act financial and commercial crisis or panics with their tenant misfortunes and frustrations seem to be mathematically impossible so sort of the law of physics is such that we cannot have this you're very happy about that ben right so you don't have to nothing to worry about here move along all right so then what happened in the 20s very important is that in 1920 1921 we had a deep recession and recessions of this severity during the national banking era always led to a banking panic how can i be so confident saying always it was in gary gordon's dissertation okay so ran regressions and showed that if you ever got pig iron down too far you would have a banking panic and indeed that that that's what we would have expected in 1920 from that same regression it didn't happen okay and why didn't it happen well it seemed like the fed was kind of doing its job discounts and advances comprise the major majority of bank reserves by 1921 82 percent of the fed's balance sheet the moment 60 percent of member banks were using the window and the discount rate was below the commercial piper rate so it's really easy to go and do that okay so the 1920s beginning that's how it starts and everybody at that time was of the opinion all right what just happened the fed saved the day this is exactly what was supposed to happen okay so again i have a bunch of this is evidence these are why the paper can go into econometrica look for a really good quote at the end here and there's a lot if you look at the paper you'll see we we have a lot of quotes even after christy and david and neil made us take many of them out there's still many there by permitting rates to remain below open market rates and credit to be expanded during the period of deflation of prices it has prevented the present business depression from degenerating into an old-fashioned panic so all over you can find quotes contemporary quotes are like okay this is yeah we were used to seeing panics no panic this time okay so that's important here's what we see happening this is um from talman my screen seems a little messed up um the red line is the discount window borrowing you can see how high that went this was actually a lot of money in 1921 so we're over 2.5 billion and it starts falling off uh after 1921 rises a little bit or or what at the time seemed like a lot in 1923 1924 and then kind of falls off never really hitting levels discount window borrowing this red line is going all the way through 1935 it never really hits a big level again which seems funny so why weren't people borrowing from the discount window as we started to hit the great depression and the answer to that question is because of these conflicting goals the fed the fed or and and and the markets all together created a certain amount of stigma towards borrowing okay now what what was that um here are a variety of quotes again um this this is from the federal reserve's annual report in 1926. okay i'm just going to start reading from the middle the funds of federal reserve banks are ordinarily intended to be used in meeting temporary requirements of members and continuous borrowing by member bank as a general practice would not be considered consistent with the intent of the federal reserve act that seems logical but if it starts bothering you that the banks are borrowing so much what do you do so if you're going to try a variety of things okay and they're they're bothered also by the fact that the the purpose of the borrowing we heard this uh in in julio's session early this morning they want to distinguish between speculative security loans and loans for legitimate business so the 1920s were a very interesting time right and and we heard the word penitence this morning and and i think that's just a great way to think about it we hadn't thought about it that way before right we were banning alcohol in the 1920s as well right we really morally it just seemed wrong you were coming you were borrowing from our discount window you're using it for speculative purposes what are we going to do one thing that the fed tried was to have different discount rates for different types of collateral and it turned out surprise surprise that the banks were able to work around that so it was not really workable right so what happened this is what chandler says so it's not us it's chandler so it must be right in short the whole attempt was a failure loans on securities continued to rise up until the eve of the crash and restrictive efforts were not selective credit of all kinds credit of all kinds to all kinds of users was restricted governor harrison later claimed this whole moral suasion effort aimed at borrowing member aimed at barring members made banks less willing to borrow the fed in the early 1930s whether or not this is true it is plausible we'll take plausible okay so really what we have going on in the 20s is variety of things we want to help england get back on gold and we want to help england stay on gold and so we're keeping rates want to keep rates low to let them do that but if rates are low everybody wants to come borrow and speculate into the stock market well we can't let them do that so we're going to really push back we're going to say no we're going to yell at them we're going to let it leak to the market that they're borrowing and they're weak we're going to do all everything we can moral suasion direct pressure those were the words that were used and it worked okay we saw in the previous picture that the amount of borrowing went down so what happens then the fed energy depression here with a stigmatized window i'm not sure if that's an actual word you can say before windows stigmatized but we're using it so there's a stigmatized window and we argue in this paper with with support of quotes from chandler and friedman and others that that that understood at the time there was a reluctance to borrow by banks so they didn't borrow here we go into the depression thinking we can't have bank runs bank runs are mathematically impossible uh and now we start seeing that banks are in trouble they weren't borrowing they were afraid to borrow and they really just started to run out of money and we did get bank runs so it was puzzling we think at that time to everybody now where banks did to borrow in some federal reserve districts they did borrow banks did a whole lot better but in many places the stigma was there and the stigma was strong more evidence of the statement can be seen in extensive borrowing by uh of the reconstruction finance corporation which was significant there were 17 000 banks in existence just prior to the banking holiday of 1933 only 12 000 survived half of those were borrowing from the rfc okay rfc borrowing itself leveled off following new rules for disclosure of borrower names bloomberg sued in 1930 no i'm sorry that was it came later but others had had forced the names to be disclosed on the house floor uh and here's what happens if you look at the picture the black line is bank barring mostly when we think of rfc loans we think wow they were loaning to to projects and dock workers and docks and things like that and there's a lot of bank borrowing and it went up a lot to 500 million dollars again a lot of money back then uh in 1932 which is when they started releasing the names on the house floor and it leveled off so the rfc was on a rfc had had some stigma created all right i have spent 14 minutes on the first 14 years of the feds so now i have six minutes left for the rest so let me go fast i'm just going to put this up and talk about the main things here okay so there's a whole lot of new deal legislation which is very important now now we're going to realize we had a problem some key ones people don't often talk about the emergency relief and construction act of 1932 which created the rfc that's also where we introduced section 13 3. so first introduction of section 133 there were amendments later particularly in the banking act of 1935 that made sense what i want to say here and i think is important is the fdic was originally written in as an amendment as a as part of the federal reserve act so we have deposit insurance very much thought of as part of this same role of the fed we have a long quiet period now from the new deal this enables me to skip many many years a long quiet period where very little of excitement happened in in the regulatory world from world from from afternoon deal legislation until the late 1970s except for two things i should have mentioned on the previous slide uh the fed treasury accord which did in 1951 which really finally gave the fed a much more independence from treasury and if you look that's the bottom of interest rates and then they just start going up and up and up and that's going to matter okay and then the other thing was the bank holding company act of 1956 which provided a lot of opportunities for the federal reserve to have much more oversight over the banking industry especially in the long run so beginning in the late 1970s what do we see we see a lot of competition largely coming from this rising interest rate environment so this is why we cannot separate monetary policy from regulatory policy they're not different things it's fashionable and i think correct these days to talk about how monetary policy and fiscal policy are really very closely linked can't separate them the same really seems true of regulatory policy starting in the 70s in the rising interest rate environment money market mutual funds began to really compete hard um with banks we see they go from 76 million in deposits in 1980 or money market mutual funds and assets to 1.8 trillion in 2000 there were a variety of changes made in the early 80s to allow banks to compete so regular regulation was reacting to the higher interest rate to the changes in monetary policy so the didmaka we see that in 1980 and then the guard saint germain in 1982 that are going to enable uh banks to compete now what happens we get an snl crisis anil wants me to talk a lot about that all i'm going to give him is this little slide um running out of time post-crisis legislation financial institutions reform we have foreign and then regal neal and graham leach bliley so anil wrote a whole paper about this you can read it it was in the it was in brookings yes it was in brookings um but what's going on here we have to clean up after the snl crisis so we had a rising interest rate environment again monetary policy connected with regulatory policy and we're going to have to react to that by cleaning things up afterwards all right i'm going to skip basel and go to the financial crisis so what happens the fed begins the financial crisis with two major impediments to its lender of last resort function stigma so among eligible banks if you can go to the discount window there is still stigma it has stuck since the 1920s and there is a lack of reach to many important non-bank institutions and markets so we're no longer able to lend to everybody who is necessarily doing uh liquidity transformation there's a policy change in 2003 to create several different categories of discount window lending attempt to combat that stigma it didn't completely work the term auction facility the taf was designed to get around that problem december 2007 and seemed to work pretty well i won't get in trouble for saying that at the nbr conference there was extensive use of thirteen three powers during the crisis that expanded the reach of the fed so these two pieces dealing with stigma and dealing with reach uh were both dealt with creatively but they were not you know we weren't able to completely work around them so what happens in dfa first section 13-3 powers are restricted so now only broad-based programs are allowed more congressional oversight i'm not sure how worried we should be about that but certainly we it's restricted compared to what it was before the fed has been granted authority as a primary regulator for systemically important financial institutions and utilities stress tests this is very much a strong supervisory part of the supervisory toolkit now it's permanent and there's a key role for the fed in the orderly liquidation of non-bank financial institutions okay the biggest gaps we think that are still left are in the regulation of shadow banking and of all these places where you need to have more reach and in cross-border issues so where does that leave us the fed plays a crucial role as lender of last resort to prevent and mitigate panics the role must be combined with regulations and oversight in normal times to avoid build-ups of risk that would make the panics more likely or be costly to safety nets so if we're going to insure them we got to watch them this has been a difficult balance for the first century what are our challenges going forward first the expanded lending programs we took them all away it's a sense if we go back to the way we think about the founding of the fed the idea was we're not going to have panics because we know this thing is there or we took these away should we have taken them away or can is there any way to get them back do we want them back okay is there any way to destigmatize the lending programs we do have this is just a challenge right we can't do all the things we want we want to be able to do if we if the our main technique for preventing panics is viewed as stigmatized and then finally we've heard this word macro prudential before but what do we do in normal times what are the tools we should be operating in normal times how are they different from what the tools were over the last 100 years in order to be able to watch over the safety net and we're seeing a lot of that now with changes in the capital rules different ways that we're thinking about supervision but i think the jury is still out it's going to be a long time and a lot of work for a lot of people thank god makes our jobs interesting okay that's it [Applause]
