okay thank you for the opportunity to present this research this uh paper is risk perceptions and protective behaviors evidence from the covid19 pandemic i'm kate bundorf from duke university this research is in collaboration with my colleagues from stanford grant miller maria paliakova and jalu streeter as well as colleagues from westat jill dematius and john wick we would like to gratefully acknowledge support for this research from westat which provided in-kind support for designing and fielding the survey the research questions that we pursued in this project are as follows first we were interested in how risky people thought everyday activities were with respect to covenanting infection and health outcomes early in the pandemic in addition we were interested in whether those risk perceptions varied in ways that were consistent with the objective risk of infection or the objective risk of poor outcomes conditional on infection our second question is we were wondering whether people who believed that covid risks were greater would reduce their activities more so were subjective risk correlated with with with economic activity and finally we wanted to know whether people believe their behavior changes in response to these risks would have differed in the absence of government restrictions we we have pursued these questions but by designing and fielding a survey and the survey is called the coronavirus attitudes and behaviors survey it examined the perceptions of covid19 risks and behavioral responses to the pandemic the survey was administered relatively early in the pandemic by westat between may 7th and may 26th in 2020 what the westat researchers randomly selected residential addresses to receive an invitation by mail to participate in an online survey ultimately we had 1222 respondents that's about the 10 response rate and the responses were weighted to be nationally representative based on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics westat has been kind enough to make all the data publicly available from this uh from this data set and you can use the link below uh if you're interested in looking not only at the data we used for this uh for this um study but also for the other questions that we asked okay one of the first things we asked was about people's perceptions of coven 19 risks so we asked when people were undergoing particular types of economic activities what did they think the subject what was the probability of infection what the you know what were their subjective perceptions of the probability of infection when engaging in particular activities the activities we focused on were going to a movie in a movie theater eating in a restaurant in a sit-down restaurant and using shared transportation services such as shared rides or riding in a plane using personal services such as going to the gym or getting your hair cut we also asked about grocery shopping we asked people the in for each of these types of activities what was the probability they would be infected with coven 19 when they engaged in these activities and the scale was zero no chance at all to a hundred you know certain to happen here we give the results in the blue bars of the probability of infection across all these different services and as you can see this is the probabilities were relatively high people believed there was a 62 percent chance that they would be infected with covet under shared transport you've been using shared transportation and a 40 chance when they were grocery shopping at the time of our survey the prevalence of covet 19 in the u.s was approximately 0.5 so clearly these are much higher than the objective risks although this is a relatively common finding in the literature in the literature that on average people evaluate these risks higher when asked the question in this way that green bar at the end is um represents a series of questions when that we asked um about the risk of a poor outcome or the risk of severe illness conditional on infection and people also believed that that was relatively high okay next we took those perceived risks and we correlated them with demographic characteristics to see the extent to which people's risk perceptions were consistent with epidemiologic evidence at the time so the way to read this graph is we estimated a regression where we had the perceived risk on the left hand side and the demographics on the on the right hand side and each of these lines represents a point estimate in a 95 confidence interval from a variable in the regression so if you look at if you look at the for example the non-hispanic black and the hispanic characteristics the fact that those point estimates and confidence intervals are to the right suggest that people who identified as non-hispanic black or hispanic thought their um their subjective perception was that their risk was higher than other folks of infection as well as um their risk for outcome conditional on infection was also bottom you know the risk was higher and engaging in these different activities um the results for age were a little bit different in the sense that um folks who uh folks were older they didn't necessarily report that they had had a higher risk of infection but they did report that they thought their their likely outcomes would be worse conditional on infection that's also consistent with the um the evidence at the time the one place in which the other the um this correlation differed from the evidence that was available at the time was for men men thought they were less likely to be infected and they were less likely to have a poor outcome conditional on infection next we asked people about their self-reported activity reduction so this was a question basically saying how have you changed your activities since the pandemic began and one of the categories the category that i'm reporting here is the proportion of people indicating that they reduce their activity a lot at the time that we fielded this survey the um uh most people were under some sort of activity restriction right so the blue bars represent people's responses indicate in the actual case of activity restriction we also asked people a hypothetical we said well if activities restrictions weren't in place in your area how would you have changed your behavior and as you can see with the blue bars people reported changing their behavior a lot right so people um reported for restaurants for example that um 79 of people said that they had reduced this activity a lot for grocery shopping 40 percent of people said that they had reduced this activity a lot when asking people the hypothetical question they still said that they would have reduced their behavior in the absence of these activity restrictions but by less that's basically saying these red bars are shorter than than than the blue bars right so still activity reduction based on their private choices but not as much as if they um as when the activity restrictions were in place in this slide we put together our measures of perceived risk and our measures of behavior change so the idea here is to relate the extent to which people's perceived risks is related to their um their changes in behavior what i'm plotting on the slide is what we call the belief elasticity the belief elasticity is the percent change in the probability of reducing activity a lot associated with the one percent increase in in subjective risk so what the height of the bar is showing you is how responsive behavior is to people's perceptions of risk in a higher bar means it's more responsive in the blue bars we're plotting the belief elasticity under the situation kind of the actual situation where people were exposed to activity restrictions and you can see that the uh that people were responsive to their um that people's behavior was responsive to their perceived uh their perceived risks of infection um for these for these activities the red bars however are higher that's basically saying when we ask people how much they would have changed their activity in the absence of these types of restrictions their their responses their activity changes were more responsive to their risk so to summarize our main findings we find that people substantially overestimated the risk of contracting program 19 early in the pandemic although they overestimated the absolute risk we think that people had more accurate perceptions of their relative risks how was there a risk compared to other people or how high was their risk compared to other people we also find that people who believe that they faced a higher level of risk were more likely to report avoiding economic activities and then government mandates that restrict economic behavior attenuated that relationship between subjective risk beliefs and protective behaviors the implications of our findings we believe that our results show that you know people believe that a substantial proportion of their behavior change associated with these that is often associated with these government regulations regarding economic activity probably would have taken place in the absence of these regulations so people's private decisions guided their reduction in activity this is important in thinking about the development of models that evaluate the effects of policies designed to restrict behaviors in addition we think that our evidence is consistent with government mandates reducing an externality that lower risk people who in the absence of of policy might uh privately choose to invest in fewer protective behaviors it will reduce the externality that these low-risk folks are exerting on high-risk individuals and finally we think this idea of the relationship between subjective risk perceptions and behavior is important to consider in policy so both policy makers and researchers should think about subjective risks how they're formed and how they influence behavior as a policy mechanism thank you
