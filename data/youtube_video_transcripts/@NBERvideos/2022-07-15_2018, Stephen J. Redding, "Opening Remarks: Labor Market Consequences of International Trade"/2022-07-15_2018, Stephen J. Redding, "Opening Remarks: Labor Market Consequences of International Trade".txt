international trade creates aggregate welfare gains for economies as a whole in the sense that it raises the real value of aggregate gdp and there's quite a lot of consensus in this research about how big those welfare gains are so the sort of consensus estimates which were summarized in a recent mbr digest article in in april 2018 either for an economy such as the united states which is relatively large and relatively closed in terms of a low share of trade trade as a share of gdp these welfare gains range from around two to eight percent of gdp uh depending upon the precise assumptions you make and those gains can be much larger for smaller open economies such as belgium which has a much higher share of trade and its expenditure and there the sort of consensus estimates range up to 20 to 30 percent of gdp uh but the the flip side of that is is that although international trade creates those aggregate gains it raises aggregate gdp as a whole another important insight of this research over the last 25 years is that international trade can have very strong distributional consequences so even though aggregate real gdp rises individual workers individual firms individual industries can experience real income losses from international trade and these distributional consequences can be large as is going to be discussed later on in today's proceedings
