okay thank you very much uh for including us uh this is a paper with joran ma who is here in nicola ginaioli who is not the motivation of this paper is pretty straightforward which is that particularly for an nbr presentation which is the use of expectations data is obviously theoretically central to economic decisions but expectations data have also been a part of the toolkit of economic analysis from the very early days of the nber and br has published many volumes held many conferences on the use of anticipation data in macroeconomic it appears that this kind of research has taken a nosedive has not disappeared but has certainly become much less central in the last 30 years in the aftermath of the rational expectations revolution and the reason for that is pretty straightforward as youth has pointed out more than 50 years ago models dictate what expectations rational agents should hold and so it is the model that tells it what expectations are so anticipations data are redundant so there's a nice quote from prescott from 1977 like utility expectations are not observed and surveys cannot be used to test the rational expectations hypothesis it's a bit of a strange quote because you know i think we understand why utility cannot be observed it's a little less clear why it is when you ask people what is going to be the return on the stock market over the next 12 months and they say 10 percent in what sense that is not observed and so that in part drives our perspective so our view is that expectations data provide economists with valuable information for understanding decisions and for distinguishing alternative models if you would like to see an extraordinarily articulate statement to that in fact there is a paper by charles manske in econometric about 10 years ago that articulates this point of view we think that whether expect survey expectations predict behavior is an empirical question and whether actual expectations are rational or not is testable and informative about models people use and we use these points using data from two separate sources or two types of studies the first is really a review of a paper i wrote with robin greenwood on investor expectations and stock returns and the second is a bunch of new results on duke data on expectations of chief financial officers and corporate investment so let me talk about stock returns and let me make four or five points which i think are very very important the first point is that you know common criticism of expectations data is that somehow they're noisy or incoherent what this table shows is that is two things the first thing it shows is if you look at data on expectations of future stock returns from six different surveys of very different groups of investors that these data give you extremely consistent pictures of expectations the correlation of expectations of returns across surveys are extremely high so this is gallup survey of investors the survey of chief financial officers professionals that i'll use later the survey of american association of individual investors invest intelligence which is a survey of newsletters schiller's survey and michigan survey hugely huge correlations in expectations of returns okay so it's really hard to argue that this is noise the other point of this graph of this table is to show that if you look at the last row that investor expectations of stock market returns are very highly correlated with inflows into stock market into stock mutual funds which is to say that people actually seem to be acting on their expectations in terms of their investment choices the second fact about the expectations data is that they're very very extrapolative which is to say that expectation of future stock returns are highly correlated with past returns so what you see on this graph is two lines one is gallup survey expectations of future expected returns the red line is uh past 12-month return on the s p 500 they line up incredibly well it seems that this is true for all the data sources which is to say that when stock market has gone up people expect it to keep going up this is the same picture with chief financial officers who are professionals who make point estimates of expected returns and are unlikely to be confused this is probably the single most important fact in this data which is we have a variety of economic models rational expectations model of financial markets which generate measures of expected returns as a property of the model so we then can then compare or correlate expected returns generated by the model and the data on expectations of returns what this figure shows is that these numbers are highly negatively correlated which is to say that when market participants expect the stock prices to go up the models of expected returns rational expectations by the expected returns uh expect low returns that's uh uh pretty obvious what's going on in the in the models when valuations are high when stock prices have risen consumption is high marginal utility of consumption is low so people are willing to accept low returns in equilibrium in the data when stock prices have gone up people actually in fact part of the reason they have gone up is that people expect them to keep going up it's a very strong negative correlation across data sets across measures of expected returns from different models finally when expectations of returns are high and expected returns are low actual returns going forward are low so the models have been built so in fact they're rational expectations models but in fact what appears to be in the data is when people expect returns to be high actually expect returns to be high realized returns are low so what are the points of all this the points of all this are several fold first of all survey expectations are informative they're clearly if you if across data sets they don't seem to be noise they're very consistent across different surveys of different types of investors they're predictive of investor behaviors you see from the flow into data on stock mutual funds they have a clear extrapolative structure okay so there are two ways you can go with it one is to say that the expectations data are all crap and we should go with the models seems to be a much more natural message to draw with this is that the survey expectations reject the rational expectation model of asset prices and this is true about more models than we've just described and the trouble is with the models rather than with the expectations data let me turn to sort of the meat of this paper which is another topic quite central to macroeconomics which is expectations and corporate investment the reason we are able to write this paper is that over the last 20 years kem harvey and john graham of duke university have been collecting data from chief financial officers of large u.s corporations it's quarterly survey since july 96 covers mostly large corporations they post the aggregate data they were kind enough not quite to share with us the micro data but to let us use the micro data as long as we uh don't touch them because they are confidential they have a paper that uses some of the micro data but one could do a lot more with them so the c4 expectations uh among other questions what you get out of this survey is that you get data on expectations of next 12-month earnings growth for unfortunately not longer term next 12 months and you get data on plan next 12 month investment growth and again these are cfos and they give numerical answers we supplement this with the data on forecasts of earnings growth by financial analysts which people have used before so the first point is that cfo at least in the time series and analyst expectations of future earnings growth are highly correlated that may not be surprising the analysts may be getting their data in part from the cfos now to organize the discussion we use a fairly straightforward adaptation of the queue theory model except we don't make the assumption of rational expectations so the investment rate is a function of future expected profitability rates of profit if you make the assumption that profitability is quite persistent which seems to be true in the data you can approximate this equation by the second equation uh in on this slide which is to say that the invest planned investment is approximated by uh expected profits and if you log linearize this you get the equation that we try to estimate which is that planned investment growth in the next 12 months is a function of expected rate of growth in the next 12 months so we're looking at the beginning of the period and we're looking at planned investment growth planned earnings growth and we're looking at that relationship which comes out of this approximation of the q theory model specification is very similar to barrow and lamont we look at invest actual investment as well and not just investment plan lamont makes a very articulate case for using investment plans and they've been done in the literature as well so this is what the data look like again you know the rest of what i'm going to do is basically elaborate on this relationship but the cfo earnings growth expectations and the next 12-month investment growth plans seem to be lining up very closely with each other and that's the nature of the data this is a slightly different look at this this is cfo earnings growth expectations investment plans uh where we look at the fitted investment plans and realized investment and again you see that these series track each other uh pretty closely let me show a few regressions uh so this is regressions of planned next 12 12-month investment growth on expectations of earnings growth again at every quarter we look this is in the aggregate data first and i'll show you micro data in a second every quarter you look at growth expected growth of profits in the next 12 months relative to the previous 12 months expected growth of investment in the next 12 months over the previous 12 months and you run this regression the coefficient is about 0.6 which is to say that when people expect earnings to grow by one percentage point they expect they plan to increase investment by 0.6 of that if you uh and the in the time series the r square of this regression is very very high if you compare it to standard q theory at least for plans uh if you add q which is not obvious why you would add it is barely statistically significant if you look the past 12-month aggregate stock returns which barrow shows is a very good proxy for the change in q you get some incremental explanatory power but you see that the expectations variable is still large and explains a lot of the variation and of course we have planned 12-month investment growth in the regression as well if you try to control for alternative theories of investment you basically don't get much mileage so the gray rows are tests of the theories that suggest that what determines investment is discount rates or required rates of return and this was the a suggestion proposed by cochran and tested by lamont and so you can put in the proxies for discount rates into these equations and they generally don't do very much you can test there's a set of ideas in investment about how this cash flow constraints that matter for investment these are very very large firms and we have a lot of micro evidence to suggest that cash flow constraints are not that important for investment decisions of these firms but if you look at if you want to proxy for cash flow constraints by uh pass by change in net income over assets which the the theory would suggest you should use you don't get very much this is a finding that other people have had as well if you look at uncertainty measures allah bloom you get a bit of explanatory power but not very much again you know the at least if you judge by r square incremental r square the expectation variables do very well there may be a reverse causality concerns i'll go very quickly through that it seems to us pretty implausible or if you calibrate it it's pretty implausible that investment over the next 12 months is instantaneously going to add so much to profitability as to explain this evidence we've done some robustness checking the paper doesn't seem to be what's going on if you look at realized investment rather than investment plans get a very similar picture plans and investment are very closely correlated and you get very important role of expectations finally on this if you look at firm level evidence you get smaller coefficients maybe 50 smaller you still have somewhat greater significance of past returns but the expectations variables remain extremely big and have a lot of explanatory power relative to other variables now the last thing i want to talk about is the structure of expectations this is again what the data look like so we look for every quarter at realized minus expected 12 months earnings growth that's one of the series here this is the blue series and the red series is uh past 12 months earnings over assets and the data seemed to us and i'll show you some tests uh pretty clear which is to say that when profits are high expectations of earnings growth are higher than realizations which is to say the errors are on the other side this is the same thing with analysts you have a very similar structure to what you see with cfos which is to say when profitability is high they tend to be excessively optimistic about earnings growth if you look at this at the aggregate data you know you see this i mean the picture was pretty clear in the evidence as well you can try to control for various things but when past earnings over assets increased by one percentage point earnings growth in the next 12 months on average slows down by 0.12 and the cfo is only expected to slow down by 0.03 which is to say there's a lot more mean reversion they expect you can do this with individual expectations we have a fairly short time series so it's there are many complex issues about the validity of these tests but you get a very similar results which is to say when past year firms earnings over assets increased by one percentage points actual earnings growth uh over the next 12 months on average slows down but 0.06 cfo only expected to slow down by 0.01 so what we have again in the end similar patterns in aggregate and firm level analysts expectations analysts overestimate future earnings growth when past years was favorable and underestimated when past year was rough past earnings are predictive er highly important publicly available information that matters a lot to cfos and analysts so it probably is implausible to argue that they neglect it uh evidence uh appears consistent with extrapolative biases and again some similarities very clear similarities between the the study of investor expectations and returns that i've mentioned in the first half of my presentation and the evidence on cfos so what's the what is what are the bottom lines expectations data appear to be extremely helpful in understanding corporate investment expectations appear to exhibit systematic extrapolative errors so the data do not seem to be consistent with a rational expectations hypothesis there is a set of questions that we leave open that we don't answer this is my last slide what is what are the plausible models of actual expectations uh you know we have two extremes here so we we don't think we want to go back to the world of pure adaptive expectations which people don't think about the future at all but it also seems to be that the other extreme of looking at purely rational expectations seems to have significant problems uh with the data so is there an interesting or reasonable compromise i don't think we answer this question and the other question we obviously don't answer is that this is a building block this is some evidence and the question arises of whether you could get these errors and expectations to add up to enough to get something in terms of economic fluctuations of over investment or overbuilding and we leave those questions to future work
