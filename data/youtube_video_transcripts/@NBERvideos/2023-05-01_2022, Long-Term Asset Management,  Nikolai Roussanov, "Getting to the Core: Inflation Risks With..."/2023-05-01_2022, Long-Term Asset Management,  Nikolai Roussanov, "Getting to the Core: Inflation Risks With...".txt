thank you very much can uh can everybody hear me yes okay well uh thanks a lot for uh not just uh having our paper in the program but for organizing such a great conference i think you know as a last presenter i should say that so thank you guys for uh for doing that um so this paper with uh with two former working students up this clicker is going back and forth uh zhang fang and yang liu who are both at hku and given the time difference probably are no longer uh with us on zoom and it's uh about getting to the core inflation risks within and across asset classes and we started working on this paper pre-covered so at the time and played the inflation risks that people were worrying about probably that there was going to be too little of it or not at all um and of course here we are today and i guess uh the views have changed a bit and i think well maybe that makes the paper a little bit uh a little bit timely um so i don't need to say any more about inflation news being important um more kind of generally we typically have a hard time identifying macroeconomic factors that matter for um for for us at prices and inflation is one of them um but now if we think about from the perspective of long-term asset management right we might want to know how can investors protect themselves or hedge again against inflation and at what cost right what is the price of risk associated with with inflation now conventional wisdom uh has it that there are real assets quote unquote that are good inflation hedges such as you know foreign exchange commodities real estate um and perhaps stocks right because stocks are supposed to be claims to real uh real cash flows um and as far as the price of inflation risk we have hard time finding kind of a consistent answer it's clear that there is more reasonably clear that there is a risk premium in nominal bonds but in other asset classes it's hard to it's hard to see whether there is um there is one so we are revisiting um that conventional wisdom and uh and maybe a lack of consistent evidence in this paper uh by by taking a pretty pretty straightforward approach and drilling into the composition of inflation and in particular by decomposing it the way that the bls does and the way that the fed likes to do into the core and non-core some people call it crust components energy and food and really we're going to focus on energy as a as a counterpoint uh to the core as the kind of the two key components and focus the less on food and we're going to look at eight asset classes um and we're going to show that all the conventional wisdom is not quite right in the in that none of these eight asset classes um provide a consistent hedge against core inflation and the assets that we typically think of as real like commodity for example a hedge against energy inflation reasonably well but again not not against core and and we argued core is the kind of the important component that investors should care about and in fact if we look at the price of risk that we estimate it is indeed that the core inflation that investors do appear to care about because that's the price of that risk that is consistently negative and reliably so across all of these asset classes as well as within asset classes um i will once we kind of get through this evidence we will talk about how this um this uh this result impacts the discussion of the stock bond correlation that has been changing over time that we spent some time yesterday in the asset pricing session discussing with the uh pietro's discussion in particular of the paper that was presented and uh we we built a very simple uh new keynesian style model that qualitatively kind of explains why we see these uh these results it's not a quantitative model really so i will probably spend very little time on it if if at all in this presentation i will skip the literature and get to directly to the empirics so if we decompose inflation into its three key components core energy and food uh we see kind of the important distinction in that um and well core is of course the most important and largest component seventy percent uh of the of the basket but the bulk of the volatility is actually contributed by energy which is by far the most volatile component uh even though it's relatively small as a component of the basket it's also the one that's least persistent right so people kind of focus on the volatility but it's equally important the fact that almost all the persistence in in headline inflation comes from the core um and energy almost looks like nearly uh nearly a random war the meaning uh unpredicta unpredictable um so clearly they have this this decomposition is informative to the fed the fed uh likes to to focus on core not we're going to focus on core cpi they like for pce uh but the fact that uh these components behave differently suggest that they may be kind of important to not just the fed but the investors in different in different ways so what we're going to work with we're going to work with innovations to these inflation series to extract innovations we just put put them see put all these series into a var together with variables that we know predict uh expected inflation well like interest rates also pe ratio the graph here shows the time series of the innovations to the headline core food and energy and i think that's instructive to look at the volatilities of these series over time to understand kind of where the shocks are to headline inflation in particular coming from in particular in the great inflation air in the 70s and the 80s you can see um that it's mostly in the core and food and very little of it was in the energy whereas after uh kind of after the volcker era core inflation has been very very smooth um as well as kind of declining and low whereas the bulk of volatility in the headline inflation has been coming from energy in particular when people talk about deflation during the financial crisis and great recession almost all of it is coming from uh from energy core never went negative actually uh but but the big drop in energy prices here is what drives the big drop in headline inflation uh over there um so again this just suggests that these these shocks behave differently and from here on we're going to kind of work with these shocks separately in particular we're going to focus on headline versus core and energy and we're going to spend less time on food we're going to look at eight asset classes that comprise equities both u.s and international bonds treasuries agencies and corporates uh currency portfolios and commodity futures and reits and we're going to look at each as a class as a portfolio as well as look at the cross-section of test assets within uh within each asset class so this is well one picture hopefully that that kind of tells tells this story um these are the inflation betas by uh asset class and the purple is the beta on headline inflation with the confidence bands around it um and the blue bars are the uh basically confidence bands around the theta on core inflation and the orange ones are energy and you can see that of course all bonds load negatively on headline inflation as well as the core um energy actually we have slightly positive floating for corporate bonds um equity has kind of been significantly negative in the full sample data on headline inflation but very very strongly significantly negative core beta and pretty positive and pretty well barely significant and the full sample very significant in sub-sum samples um energy inflation data what about these so-called real asset classes like currencies commodities and uh reits and maybe international stocks basically the picture is the same in that wherever you see a somewhat positive uh or maybe strongly positive in case of commodities um so headline inflation data it all comes from energy and core inflation betas are either very strongly negative like there are for reits and international stocks or basically zero like they are for commodity futures and uh and currencies now uh what if we were to try to estimate the price of risk and here this is kind of the simplest thing that we do in there and that's surprising to estimate the price of risk we do macbeth regressions of uh returns on um on inflation betas well if we did that with either the just the eight uh average portfolios or the entire cross-section uh for headline inflation you see obviously nothing right there's there's really no uh well no evidence of a risk premium associated with these betas instead if you do this with core inflation and energy inflation you see a very kind of stark picture that average returns line up very strongly with the combined betas on these two uh on these two inflations and and the really the driving one is the coral though energy does help a little bit and this is very robust to controlling for a host of macroeconomic other macroeconomic factors that really are not none of them are priced basically in the presence of of core inflation we can also do this within each asset class so here we're taking a large cross-section of portfolios within each asset class that that i just just showed and basically do these pharmaceutical regressions within each asset class and uh again this kind of a striking fact is that the top row here is the risk premium that is estimated within that asset class uh and you know obviously they're not exactly the same but they're pretty close they're all roughly at the negative one bit one percentage point per month what's with obviously some standard errors around it all almost all are strongly statistically significantly different from zero uh the only one is commodity futures uh very very volatile as a class with kind of hard to estimate uh price of risk but basically all of these prices of risk come out roughly the same across all of these asset classes and if you look at the bottom uh bottom sub panel the betas on headline inflation if you estimate them as a clause by asset class they're all over the place of the most some of them are negative some of them are positive many of them are insignificant uh you sort of basically get nothing um and and if you look at energy that you can kind of see why that happens because there's some some asset classes that very strongly load positively on on energy as i said early corporate bonds uh you know to some extent to some extent stocks and of course commodities um whereas others lower either negatively or or not at all and again when you put them together you get these kind of inconsistent numbers for headline inflation you can also use this as kind of a standard uh fama fama point you can use uh the the filemaker cross-sectional regression slopes as returns on effectively of data mimicking portfolios or factor mimicking portfolios and you can estimate sharp ratios in these portfolios and these are all fairly consistent uh across asset classes uh if we use core inflation but again are all over the place for uh for the other two now um so why why why is that why should we expect um core inflation in particular to be such a kind of strongly uh negatively priced source of risk well you know one one of popular hypothesis is fama's the proxy effect hypothesis right the fact that uh the relationship between stock returns in particular in inflation has to do with the fact that stock uh well inflation is proxy for some other real real variables and high inflation is bad news for for the real economy and uh and that's what shows up in the stock market and that does to to a large extent uh come out to be true again we're using here long enough sample to detect that negative relation between uh inflation and the inflation today and subsequent next quarter or next year gdp consumption or dividend growth um interestingly well it sort of works for headline it it works even better if you use poor inflation especially for dividends or corporate payouts so for consumption of gdp it's sort of it it looks about the same but for dividends you have much stronger predictability of dividends dividend growth with uh core inflation than with headline inflation and for energy you get basically nothing um again as suggesting that energy if anything sometimes goes the other way suggesting again it's the core inflation that if if there's anything related to real conditions so of course you the an important observation there is a great great inflation right the stagflation era but the relationship holds even in a more recent sample although of course much less statistically significant since we have a lot less very variability in the right-hand side variable there another question one may ask well is this is this cash flow news or is it just discount rate news right is it because the fed raises rates in response to inflation uh for example that uh that that tank stocks and other asset classes or maybe if inflation rises inflation risk premium rises and that also goes down so we could do a kind of a standard uh news decomposition into cash flow news and discount rate news and we see that for core inflation it shows up in both cash flow news and uh discount rate news and positively for discount rate news and negatively cash flows both basically go in the same in the same direction because obviously higher discount rates bring down prices just the way the same way that the lower cash flows do interestingly you hear a lot about uh the effect of rising rates and rising inflation on on tech stocks and growth stocks uh that having to do with maybe duration so suggesting a discount rate effect if anything we find the opposite we find it that's the value stocks that are more sensitive to the discount rate effect uh of core whereas uh whereas the uh the growth stocks are more sensitive to the cash flow effect um energy there's not much there's a little bit of a of it of a discount rate effect there's no cash flow effect uh interestingly uh of of energy on these uh on these portfolios now uh another kind of way to to to think about it is that while is is all the effect of inflation on stock prices in particular due to again this the fed response uh to what uh what you know to do what inflation comes out to be uh we can do this by looking specifically at the days of uh inflation announcement so so narrow window right after the uh after after uh inflation announcement and we can use fed fund futures as well as the professional forecast of inflation to to get together from the magnitude of inflation surprise um core inflation surprise seems to move uh fed fund futures a lot more strongly uh and much more reliably significantly upwards obviously than headline uh interestingly and in fact controlling for for core headlines it does doesn't matter doesn't matter at all so it is the core inflation that moves the fed fund futures again not surprisingly given that we know that the fed uh primarily looks at at the core so what about stocks so stocks negatively react to uh to core as well as headline inflation news by controlling uh for for headline core it's still quite significant although it seems like stocks respond to to both and controlling interestingly for the fed funds futures surprise um again the effect is basically there so it's not that the stocks only react to inflation because the fed uh is expected to react to inflation uh finally uh i i mentioned that i would get to this that this time varying exposure of um of of different assets potentially to inflation might tell us something about this puzzle of changing stock bond correlation that we talked about yesterday so the fact is that a correlation between stock returns and bond returns was positive and certainly the last several decades of the 20th century and then became negative roughly around the end of the century you can debate whether that's 1997 or 99 but we made it cut off at 99 but we don't take a very strong uh stand on it so our way of of approaching this changing correlation has to do with again with the decomposition of inflation into uh core foreign energy because again both of course stock returns and bond returns are correlated uh with uh with inflation but these correlations have changed over time in particular if you look at the betas of stocks and treasury returns on headline inflation they were both negative in the first part of the sample but in the second half of the sample stock returns uh have a positive data with with headline inflation so that suggests that perhaps in fact there is at least two to to some extent a nominal uh or inflation related channel to this changing changing correlations um and when we do the decomposition into core and energy we see that that change in correlation is only due to the energy component so core inflation is negatively related to both stock and bond returns in the first part of the sample and in the second part of the sample now again the second part of the sample is a bit shorter the inflation volatility is very low so significance is not particularly great but actually it's even less significant for bond returns than for for stock returns so uh i wouldn't make too much out of that but if you look at the energy which has been much more volatile and a component of inflation especially in the 21st century that's where you see this changing correlation or changing data of um energy on both stocks and energy inflation from being negative in the 20th century effectively to positive in the 21st uh century whereas again uh the bonds of course are always always negative so we argue that uh that at least a big chunk if not all uh of the changing correlation between stocks and bonds over time has to do um has to do with this changing role of energy i i'm basically out of time oh wow okay so um this is uh then what i'm going to do is i'm going to completely skip the model the model is relatively straightforward but basically we add um we add to in standard new keynesian model we added an energy good that has both the supply and uh and the demand shock um and and basically you can you know trust me at this point that in addition to kind of standard new keynesian new keynesian markup shocks we get all the action that we need i'm going to very quickly skip through my slide since i apparently i talked much slower than that okay i'll um let's uh let me take let me let me get to this point which is which is well okay thank you i will i will i will i will say the following uh in these new keynesian models uh corn core inflation positive core inflation shocks are contractionary right so they they they raise marginal utility of consumption so it's not surprising that the price of core inflation risk is negative because they're contractionary they they shrink not just output but also um for dividends corporate dividends so they're they're bad for stock returns hence we have this negative relation between um core inflation and stock returns bond returns it's obvious uh foreign exchange it's less obvious perhaps because we think that you know inflation raises uh kind of the the nominal price level and that makes my currency less valuable but because it's contractionary it raises the marginal utility of of the of the domestic investor it raises the stochastic discount factor so the real exchange rate actually goes up and we show that this this real effect dominates the nominal effect and so you also get uh it is negative data on on foreign currency and the only one that doesn't kind of unambiguously go in this negative direction is the is a commodity futures uh asset class where you know inflation effect is kind of ambiguous on the one hand core output goes down so it's kind of contractually that pushes prices commodity prices down on the other hand uh of course there's a nominal effect uh to this old price is going up including commodities and in fact this is one asset class where we get the data of uh the core inflation data to be zero which suggests that this is what's driving it although there's some you know some commodities behave differently from others which we can discuss in the q a um and for energy for energy there is uh both the kind of the the price of risk in the betas are much much more ambiguous because of this role of supply shocks and demand shocks basically what happens is that both positive as long as as long as commodities and sort of energy and and core goods are relatively substitutable both supply and demand shocks are our positive ones are expansionary so the lower marginal utility of the investor but they have different effect on energy price right good supply shock lowers the energy price and good demand shock raises the energy price depending on which of these shocks is more important the price of uh energy risk can be either negative uh that's the first term uh or positive so basically if the if the supply if the supply shock dominates it's an egg it's a negative price of risk because supply shocks kind of are are bad uh in that they you know the lower the lower the amount of energy you can consume uh and if it's a demand shock the main trucks are good they're pro cyclical uh and they've raised the energy price uh that the second part uh is is positive and i'm now really almost completely done uh the the point that i wanted to make with this is that the change in the the data from the 99 to 2000 has to do with energy becoming much more pro cyclical in this half the sample and i'm going to conclude and thank you
