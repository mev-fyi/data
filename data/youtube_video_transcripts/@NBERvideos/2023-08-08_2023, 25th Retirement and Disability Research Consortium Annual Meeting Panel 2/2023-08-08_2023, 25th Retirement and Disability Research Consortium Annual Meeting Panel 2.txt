we we started off with a good uh panel on uh racial and uh I think differences the second panel uh switches over to talk about recent uh declines in SSDI and SSI applications the moderator will be uh Jeff hammeter Jeff is an economist at the office of research demonstration and employment at Social Security Administration he has a PHD in economics from University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana Jeff pemader's research focuses on transition age Youth and SSI so the rules will be the same as before we have uh one hour panel if you if you want the live captioning please uh look at the bottom of your screen and click on the CC so with that let me turn over the audio to Jeff hemeter thank you good afternoon and or good morning wherever you might be it's my pleasure to moderate this panel on the decline in SSDI and SSI applications we have three presentations and I'll just introduce them and then we can get started first up we'll have Laura quinby a senior research Economist at the center for Retirement Research at Boston College Dr Quimby is a labor Economist focusing on the employment of older workers as well as Retirement policy at the state and local levels including public pensions and State Auto Ira initiatives she'll be presenting her work on what fact factors explain the drop in disability insurance roles from 2015 to 2019. next we'll have uh Leela rabinovich the director of policy and development at the center for sorry Center for economic and social research East at USC she is a qualitative social science analyst with extensive experience of research in both domestic and international contexts her expertise centers primarily around health and aging social protection and financial well-being with a cross-cutting interest in gender and behavior her presentation is on a mixed methods study on work disabled adults who do not apply for Social Security disability benefits finally we'll have Don Carr an associate uh professor of sociology and the director of the Claude pepper Center at Florida State University her mission is to identify and leverage factors that bolster older adults ability to remain healthy and active as long as possible Dr Carr's presentation is on racial and ethnic differences in job characteristics and disability retirement as a reminder as Dr Leitner said please put any questions in the Q a throughout the the presentations both that I'll turn it over to Dr Quimby stage is yours great thank you and everyone see my slides if you could make them full screen there you go thank you yes great so first off thank you very much for inviting me to share my paper Lucian Liu at the center for Retirement Research what factors explain the drop in disability insurance roles from 2015 to 2019. and of course the standard disclaimer applies that the views are our own so as many of you know I'm sure in 2015 the number of individuals receiving di benefits began to decline reversing a persistent upward trend and this decline really caught the notice of policy makers and researchers alike because it really helped contribute to a significant Improvement in the DI program's finances and I should say right off the bat that the DI rules continue to decline during covid but I'm going to focus my analysis on the pre-covered period so to understand the structural forces underlying this drop we start by comparing flows into and out of the DI program before 2015 the number of new awardees di benefits always exceeded the number of beneficiaries leaving the program due to re-employment uh transition to the retirement program or death and the causes of this increase in the program rules are now well understood thanks largely to work by Liebman and others first policy reforms in the 80s expanded the eligibility criteria for benefits and then the baby boom generation was aging into this these more lenient eligibility criteria and at the same time the secular rise in female labor force participation meant that more women were becoming eligible for benefits and they too were aging into the more lenient eligibility criteria but in 2015 the number of new Awards finally fell below the number of terminations which implies that the DI roles began to drop overall understanding why this occurred requires going back in time a little bit and first noting an acceleration in terminations that began in the early 2000s this was due to the Baby Boomers who were on di starting to reach their full retirement age and being automatically transitioned to their retirement benefits the oasi program at the same time in 2010 the new the number of new di Awards began to drop precipitously and this is going to be the focus of the rest of my presentation because it was really a major contributor to the decline in the roles overall this decline in new Awards corresponds to a drop in the incidence rate or the likelihood that insured workers end up on di of course there are two reasons that the number of new Awards can drop either the insured population is actually declining or the incidence rate is dropping in this case the insured population actually grew slightly between 2010 and 2019 which points to the incidence rate as the driver of the drop in New Awards none of these observations are particularly novel and in fact three factors have been proposed in the literature to explain the falling incidence rate these include population aging which may be reducing Reliance on di as the baby boom generation becomes eligible for their retirement benefits and improving labor market after the Great Recession may have made di less attractive to workers with some remaining work capacity and policy changes at the SSA in this paper we focus on field office closures and a comprehensive retraining of administrative law judges which I'll return to these increase the difficulty of applying for Di and reduce the share of applicants who were accepted however a preliminary look at the data rules out population aging as a probable driver first off application di application rates are increasing in age as you can see in the leftmost chart and they remain high even as workers become eligible for early retirement benefits at the same time the insured population was aging which implies that the average age of di applicants plotted on in the rightmost chart increased substantially after 2010. conversely however the business cycle is a good candidate to explain the drop analysts have long noted that di applications and unemployment rate track each other very well as you can see in this chart here the red line is the DI application rate over time the gray line of the unemployment rate and they really do follow each other over the business cycle so it seems likely that as unemployment was falling in the aftermath of the Great Recession the DI applications would have been falling as well and policy changes also clearly put downward pressure the leftmost chart here shows the decline in the number of SSA field offices SSA closed about seven percent of its field offices During the period that we are considering field offices are an important source of information and support for prospective applicants and additionally um at this time the Social Security Administration undertook a comprehensive retraining of the administrative law judges who adjudicate many of the benefits appeals cases as you can see in the rightmost chart while the initial allowance rate for Di benefits held steady over this period the final allowance rate did drop significantly now at the time we wrote our paper the this retraining of administrative law judges and more generally the policy changes that were going on is to stay at this time were not widely discussed in the academic literature I recently came across an excellent analysis by coins Masterson strand who are in fact looking at just this and so our paper isn't going to be able to incorporate their much more detailed analysis yet but we do look forward to to um thinking about that more in the future foreign I just described we estimate the impact of each factor on the incidence rate starting with population aging so for this we use us to save administrative data to calculate age specific incidence rates in 2010 we then multiply these age specific rates by the share of the insured population in each age group in subsequent years this re-weighting procedure shows what the incidence rate would have been had all the factors remained at their 2010 levels we use regression analysis to find the impact of the business cycle specifically we combine administrative data on di applications with insured population counts and unemployment rates from the current population survey by state and year we then use a regression to estimate how one percentage Point change in the unemployment rate affects the DI application rate this is a very standard procedure in the literature and our results are very consistent with prior studies the coefficient from this regression is then multiplied by the total decline in unemployment experienced nationally to yield a drop in applications due to Falling unemployment and lastly this estimated drop in applications is multiplied by an assumed allowance rate to show how falling unemployment affected the DI incidence rate from 2010 to 2019. the last factor to the analyze or the policy changes at the SSA and we approached season two stages the first dot field office closures we rely on previous research by deshpami and Lee who show how each closure impacted di Awards in the local area we simply aggregate across all the closures occurring during our time period adjusting for the share of the population residing in affected areas however as I mentioned a few minutes ago we lacked clear evidence on the impacted alj retraining when we conduct our analysis so what we decided to do is attribute any remaining difference between the observed incidence rate and the counterfactual rate that is accounting for all the factors I've just described to the alj retraining policy however in a future version I'm very much looking forward to using the results from hawaiian's Masterson strands to further decompose this residual into the portion directly attributable to alj retraining and an unexplained portion so to get right to the result as expected the business cycle and alj retraining emerged as the key factors driving down the incidence rate population aging put slight upward pressure on the rate of 0.02 percentage points the business cycle drove it down by 0.14 percentage points or nearly half of the total drop field offices accounted for only a very small portion of the decline negative 0.01 percentage points this is because During the period we considered only a very small share of the population were actually affected by the closures and alj retraining or this um this residual accounted for the remaining half of the drop or Point 13 percentage points so to conclude the drop in di roles between 2015 and 2019 was driven by beneficiaries aging into the oasi program and a steep decline in the incidence rate the following incidence rate was caused by a strong economy and fewer benefit approvals by the aljs um looking forward of course the trajectory of the program will depend on the impacts of covid which we did not study as well as the structural forces that I've been discussing um but with the finances of the now on stronger footing we believe that policy makers have more room to consider whether the program is well balanced between its twin goals of encouraging labor force participation and protecting vulnerable people so with that I will um I will pass it off thank you great presentation um we'll now turn over to uh director robinovich for her study on Olympics method study on work disabled adults who do not apply for Social Security disability benefits okay hi everyone can you see my screen we can but you might want to make it bigger if you can present it is that the um if you could use this slide show time I am there we go okay okay it's all better yes okay all right well usual disclaimers I'm going to be talking about our mixed method study on work disabled adults who do not apply for Social Security disability benefits um this is work I did with Michael authors uh Dr jungle and pasta osawa who are also at the center for economic and social research um Laura just saved me some time so I'm not going to talk too much about the declining applications um I do want to note that our presentation focused mostly on understanding from the um individual perspective uh what might be happening with the participation Gap in Social Security disability benefits so what what is happening with adults that maybe um entitled to disability benefits but are not applying for those benefits so uh in particular we want to understand a little more about how these individuals make decisions about uh applying for disability benefits and more specifically how they make decisions to not apply for these benefits um so what we did uh in the studies first phase we tried to get a sense of the makeup of the population of Interest the work disabled adults who have not applied for disability benefits and especially how they compare to those that have applied um for benefits from Social Security so we use data from the understanding America study which is a nationally representative online panel of more than 10 000 households in the US and we looked at individuals who had reported being work disabled uh reported one or more chronic conditions had low current income and were age 64 and under um so we did a group comparison between the work disabled adults who had never applied for benefits and those that had looking at how they kind of deferred um broadly in terms of some basic demographic characteristics cognitive ability and some perceptions of disability benefits and and what it means to be a beneficiary um and in our side-by-side comparisons our work disabled adults who had never applied for uh disability were younger had more education household income were more likely to be married more likely to be wide and more likely to be non-hispanic and these all remain true after controlling for agent education although the result for ethnicity became non-significant and we also looked at differences by location with rural versus Urban and gender and without the age and education with and without the age and education control and they were not significant um looking Beyond these demographic characteristics we found that those in the never applied group have better quantitative skills overall after controlling for education and age um and we also found they have a lower perception of stigma surrounding being a disability beneficiary only around half of this group received any stigma whereas a much larger proportion of the group that have applied feel this way of course this is a good link to the quality work this variable doesn't tell us very much about how individuals themselves interpret the concept of stigma how it affects application decisions but we learn more about this from the qualitative interviews that we turn to now um so for the component the qualitative component we talk to 50 individuals with work limiting disabilities also recruiting recruited from the uas to understand more as I said about how they make decisions uh about applying or not applying for disability benefits um so of course we're unable within the study to replicate the process of disability determinations we can't identify individuals who would be awarded benefits if they applied so we just used our selection criteria to screen participants um that Facebook disabilities and may uh be the type of people that would apply for benefits um given the fact that they are not working because of a health condition um so a little bit of a snapshot at what our qualitative sample looked like we did in the end have a few individuals who were screened in who had in fact apply for benefits um when we talked to them the reason they were screened in either because they misreported in our surveys that they had never applied for benefits or they applied for benefits after completing that survey so in this presentation I only will show you results for respondents in the never applied group we did have trouble recruiting men for our study ended up with an 86 percent of the sample being female we would have wanted a more even split but we had very significant time constraints so we moved forward with uh the sample that we were getting even after extensive efforts to to reach out to and recruit um more male respondents some results um one of the first issues that participants raised regarding their application decision making it was around their their diagnosis their treatment and their medical care and how this affect their thinking and behaviors around applying for benefits so some participants reported very long delays in receiving a diagnosis in the in the first place for their symptoms which was a barrier to applying just to give you a sense I'm not going to read all of them but just to give you a sense of how people talked about these issues this one individual said my Livery small malfunctioning if they can figure out what's wrong then maybe we can reverse the process but it's been a year and they still can't figure out what the heck is going on with my dang body um we had uh participants that talked about how their acute Healthcare needs overwhelmed any considerations about applying for disability they have too much going on in the um in terms of their their Healthcare and figuring figuring out what was wrong and getting the right treatment um and so this is kind of applying for disability it's something that they understand is time consuming and difficult and they push it to the side because it is just not feasible given the demands of their condition especially in the early months and years um and we also had part with participants of course that uh reported having disabilities but not receiving the care that they needed um not having uh a healthcare provider not having any doctor's notes as this person in the on the slide mentions and this of course also uh operated as a barrier to applying for benefits another uh frequently cited reason why many interviewees haven't applied instead they expect their application to be denied so within this overall expectation of denial there were three kind of main narratives um one group of participants believed that they would be ineligible but may not have officially confirmed to anyone about this it's essentially a guess um there was a second group uh that reported knowing others who had a difficult time applying or receiving benefits this acted as a kid's incentive um they they would know someone uh that uh one of the interviewees we talked to said experienced a long and terrible road with their application and that was not something they were willing to put themselves through and uh and there was a third group that just believed that Social Security denies everyone and so it's just not worth it um the the difficulty or the honorous nature of the application process itself was the most frequently mentioned reason for not applying for disability and it interacted very very closely with this concern about high chances of denial so the equation had both of these elements uh to it so broadly there were two sub themes within this perception of the honors process um there were people that explicitly talked about the time involved the effort involved um the money sometimes involved in obtaining all of the medical documents that they would require um and there was a second group that also talked about the emotional cost of this process um which is you know less discussed in the in the literature perhaps um but it was a very significant barrier to application so on top of dealing with the time and the effort that it takes to move through the application process we had interviewees that felt that it is also very emotionally taxing and they're not prepared to put themselves through that process and that it would adversely affect their health um there were some people that were especially discouraged by the idea that they would have their disabilities scrutinized and questioned um and this acted as a very important deterrent for some of our participants so we initially expected um stigma to to be a significant factor um and and to come up often in the narratives about why people were not applying for disability benefits even though they were experiencing a work disability stigma is typically understood as a set of negative beliefs that a society or a group of people have about something and what we found instead was that participants were much more swayed by how applying for benefits would affect their own self-concept so this is this the soft concept is made up of references and feelings and ideas that a person has about him or herself and and these are expected to influence how people act um and so we had a lot of participants talk about how applying for disability would feel like quitting or becoming reliant on government losing agency one male participant with the qualifying condition said it would be like checking out and and this was stopping several of our participants from taking the steps to um applying for for disability um obviously we know that information can make a difference in parent take-up not just for social security for other benefits as well and and uh in other programs and in our study we we identified two overall information barriers and the first one is behavioral it's around whether and when there is an initial impetus for looking for information on benefits and eligibility and we find these consistently in this study and in others that people may know about benefits uh but that actual information seeking the the steps that one has to take to look things up and figure out how to go about applying for benefits often requires an additional push so it's not just about knowing that they exist and that you may be eligible but it's also having an additional impetus to often external to taking those steps and and but this also sometimes means that individuals will hear something from a third party that leads them to believe that they will not be eligible and so then they don't make the effort to check out um check that information out from an official Source or to to do their own uh due diligence and a second barrier is just about the accessibility of information itself and for some uh people there could be additional barriers then then for the general population so for instance we had a Hispanic participant that noted that transportation and language concerns prevented her from seeking uh information about how to apply for disability benefits um financial reasons were cited by participants uh in in in several ways uh some noted that they uh knew the benefit the benefit amount would not be sufficient to survive on and so they um declined to to participate um there were other participants that were concerned about how receiving disability benefits would interact with other assistants or benefits that they were currently receiving or were expecting to receive um and that those interactions would end up um acting negatively in in their in their Financial Security and there were also um people who there was a subset of individuals who had the opposite story they filled out their financial situation was not urgent um and so they didn't really need to apply for benefits it wasn't worth their time financially there were secure as it was so our last Quick slide um we wanted to understand a little more about the population of work disabled adults who may be eligible for benefits but haven't applied still work in progress we don't have a full understanding of all of the possible policy and practice implications of our findings we have some initial Reflections we'd love to hear feedback and qualitatively that we see obviously the decisions to apply or not for benefits are very complex they're interlinked different factors operate together in different ways the perception of the high cost of applying coupled with the perception of low approval rates may be discouraging a lot of disturbing applicants and this is a problem if one only looks at how to solve one side of that of that equation um the uh part of the burden of applying may be related to Social Security related factors like Social Security Office closures like Laura was mentioning earlier and other things but there were other administrative burden factors that were noted by participants very frequently that had to do with the health care system and how they interacted with their providers and how they they obtained or weren't able to obtain the necessary documentation and finally there's the issue of stigma and self-concept we do not find that that stigma operates very strongly there's something about cultural perception of what it means to oneself to apply for disability benefits that may be operating instead um and so with that I will stop here thank you that's a great presentation great uh look at some of the reasons there so our next presenter is Dr Carr uh who will be presenting on uh racial and ethnic differences in job characteristics and disability retirement hi thank you very much um so I want to First acknowledge my whole team um Amanda sonaga and uh our wonderful postdoctoral and graduate students who are involved in this project um and uh as a standard these are our views not that of the Social Security Administration and we want to acknowledge also the funding that was we've received to support this work so just as background um there's increasing evidence that our work lives have important implications on later Life Health outcomes and um one Concept in particular has become increasingly of interest in this notion of exposome um where these are kind of the outside factors outside of our individual behaviors that were increasingly evaluating including some of these structural factors that have come up in in earlier talks but we think increasingly that work contexts are especially important as we consider them as lifetime exposures over time and so um some initial work has shown that work context and and the kind of work environments that people are in do have effects on whether or not people go on to have to leave work early due to work disability um and so we're we're focusing on these issues with a particular notion of trying to identify um what are the kind of work characteristics and contexts that um we'll call bad jobs which we see as those that are the ones that predict early retirement due to health reasons and so um in addition to this we are also interested in building on um uh the growing evidence that suggests that some of the work environment factors contribute to disparities in um whether or not people leave work due to disability um in with regard to racial disparities in particular so uh just to kind of point out the reason why our data was structured like it is um we're evaluating this life course history of work engagement on work disability and leader life using some new data sources so first there's new life history data that's available in the health and retirement study it's come up several times already today the HRS but the the new lhms or life history mail out survey provides opportunities for us to get a more refined evaluation and accounting of of people's occupational history than has been previously available our team also um uh has released a new occupational Information Network database um that it makes it now possible to be able to look at the most refined version to date of these occupational characteristics provided by the Department of Labor um and connect it to life course history so bringing together the the life history module and this new onat database that we have released allows us to look at those life course exposures and allows us to look at Variations by social groups so our goal with this project was to evaluate the role of Occupational exposures in these racial disparities in disability retirement using these new data sources so we had three key hypotheses um and and I'll go through each of those first we anticipated that Black and Hispanic workers in line with previously research would be more likely to retire early due to disability um they would also be more likely to hold what we are calling bad jobs during their work lives and that these um bad jobs would be associated with early retirement due to disability we also have conducted some preliminary analysis we haven't completed this yet but we're exploring whether the association between race and ethnicity and disability retirement influences uh is influenced by exposure to these bad jobs so for the data sources um we are using health and retirement study longitudinal data as well as the slave history data and um these new ownet database that we released and I provide here just as a plug the public version which can be connected to any survey that has um detailed census 2010 data which is available on that website but we're actually using another product that we released this past year which we call that HRS own it which is a linked version to the HRS which we subsequently linked to the life history data so our sample includes those who completed the life history module those who had start in NJ end dates for at least one job in that life history module and that reached age 65 by the time they completed that module in 2017. so just to give you an idea of what that looks like this is like a picture of the survey where um individuals have completed their life history filled out their employment their job title start and end date and some additional details and so these data were used to create a new data database on their their work history which we were able to match with um the onet 2010 codes um some examples of some onet measures that we look at particularly here include um we kind of provide a couple of examples related to work activities um so for instance we looked at making decisions and solving problems and in this case we reverse coded so higher was meant to be the kind of worse kind of job environment where we we hypothesize making decisions and solving problems as a positive effect um so we also have things like work context and this is divided into different domains interpersonal relationships which includes things like having to deal with unpleasant or angry people or dealing with a lot of conflict in your position and physical work conditions like being exposed to contaminants um uh so so these were the kind of the the variations you can see some of the others I won't go through them but I can answer more questions about them uh later um so for this study we evaluated disability retirement and as I'm sure many people think about disability retirement it's not just Social Security Disability as as with has been discussed in some previous studies and the HRS we're actually able to capture all those people who left work due to disability even if they didn't apply for Social Security benefits for for their disability um so we actually test three different ways of measuring work disability the first is related to whether or not they report having a health problem that limited their ability to work um and uh we also looked at whether they stopped work because of medical leave and disability um and then if they identified when they reported that they retired that Health was a very important reason for their retirement so with the work context and and um work activities variables we have data on all of their work history starting from their first job to the last job and so we average their scores for each of these items and these scores range from about one to five for each and so we have an average over however many years they worked up until age 65. so I won't go into great detail here but we did conduct a variety of regression models to test our hypotheses first looking at race differences um and you know these are each in association with the hypotheses I I described earlier so first race differences in early retirement due to disability then we evaluated race differences in their lifetime exposure to these job characteristics that we identified as potential for being quote unquote bad jobs and then we evaluated the association between lifetime exposure to bad jobs and early retirement due to disability and then finally in our exploratory excuse me preliminary analyzes we then looked at the role of Lifetime work exposures in the association between racial and ethnic disparities in early uh retirement due to disability so in terms of the results first what we discovered is with this first hypothesis this was supported where we saw that Black and Hispanic workers were more likely to retire due to disability in terms of the second hypothesis we also saw evidence that Black and Hispanic workers were more likely to hold these these anticipated bad jobs and then in looking at those characteristics of bad jobs we did find evidence that those jobs in general were associated with early retirement due to disability and I'm not going into great detail here but just to be clear each one of these three definitions of disability we looked at there were some variations and I'll give you a little bit of a taste of that here in a moment um but overall these are the the main findings that we had so in terms of this kind of preliminary work we're doing to better understand the role of Lifetime exposures in the association between racial and ethnic disparities and early retirement we do find some some sort of preliminary evidence looking at work exposures being potential mediators in this Association so just uh to I'll go into that part just a little bit more here so to be clear above and beyond the what we identify as a racialized Pathways into occupations what we're seeing in these initial results are that bad jobs are a key factor that are leading to the disproportionate early retirement in minoritized workers and about half of the work measures we looked at do show evidence of reducing the association between race and disability meaning about half the measures seem to be serving as potential mediators here to to get a little bit more of a look and I know this is a little bit of a complicated uh table here but when we took the the top five characteristics explaining these disparities for each of our three disability measures there's a lot of overlap and a little bit of variation across these measures but what you'll see here is these top five factors all across all of them focus on spending time setting spending time bending or twisting the body and then there's some variation with other factors a lot of them related to sort of physical exposures but you'll see at the bottom some additionally related to what we'd call sort of Psychosocial factors like the ability to make decisions which was reverse coded so low levels of that so in terms of next steps we plan to conduct formal mediation analyzes um and do some Factor analyzes to think about if there's potential for an exposure index um our our models for this level of analysis analyzes only included um workers uh with no negative work exposure and we we want to include um not just the ones who have all levels but actually kind of look at whether or not these effects are conditioned on whether or not they had exposure so removing those that had zero scores on these exposures to see whether there's sort of a threshold that we can evaluate we're also thinking about looking at the role of educational attainment a little more carefully right now we control for educational attainment in our models but we're interested in exploring whether educational attainment like college completion status given a lot of evidence showing that as a sort of a pathway to different occupational um um lifetime occupational trajectories to be a potential factor and then we're also interested in looking at new research studies that focus on patterns over time so we're interested in looking at people who maybe move in and out of jobs over time to see those effects thank you very much so thank you actually all of you for uh great presentations
