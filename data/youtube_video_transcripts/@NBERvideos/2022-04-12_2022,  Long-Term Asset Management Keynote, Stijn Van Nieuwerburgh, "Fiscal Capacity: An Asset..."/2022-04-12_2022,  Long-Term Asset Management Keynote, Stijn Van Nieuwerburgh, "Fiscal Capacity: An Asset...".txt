thank you very much for having me i'm delighted to be part of the nbr long-term asset management conference and also want to thank nbim for their financial support so grateful to share with you some work on fiscal capacity from an asset pricing perspective this is joint work with zhenyang yang hano lostig mini shaolin zefang chen and i'll also talk about a paper with vadim allen of tim landfield and patrick schultz also would like to thank our research assistant jeremiah huber so what motivates our interest in this topic is of course the large rise in government debt that we have seen in the united states as well as in several other countries and this has really mostly taken place you know after the great financial crisis as well as after the covet crisis and both of these crises caused you know large increases in debt because you know counter cyclical spending uh went way up in order to boost aggregate demand think of this as automatic stabilizers maybe some additional unemployment insurance for example as well as because of private sector rescue operations bank bailouts in response to the gfc the paycheck protection program in response to the cova crisis as well as other budget priorities like an expansion of health care vaccine support after coving infrastructure spending and for example the buildback better plan that's on the table right now right then all of those measures basically rose that the gdp in the us from about 35 percent of gdp before the great financial crisis to about 75 percent and then from 75 to about 105 after the covet crisis now these changes in debt have taken place against the backdrop another important macroeconomic back drop namely that of declining interest rates you know both nominal and real government bond yields have been falling for 25 years now and you know as of a few months ago we're at all-time lows now it yields below gdp growth rates you know the rf is smaller than g constellation some have argued that the government that can simply that the government can simply roll over its debt okay and that in fact fiscal capacity may be unlimited now we're going to argue that this argument applies to a world without uncertainty but that economic growth is risky and from an asset pricing perspective we know that shocks to the growth rate of the of economic activity are important in the lingo of asset pricing they carry large prices of risk and i want to argue today that consideration of this aggregate risk has major implications for fiscal capacity and in fact lowers fiscal capacity substantially so there's really only one equation in my talk and it's the equation at the top of this slide and let me first tell you where that equation comes from right it comes from starting out from a one-period government budget constraint where the government spends some money it potentially could issue some additional debt and it can use these you know and it can generate some tax revenue and then it can use those resources to pay back uh debt that is coming due if you iterate forward on this budget constraint and you impose a no arbitrage condition on the pricing of individual government bonds and finally you impose a transfer salary condition then you arrive at this equation here which says that the market value of outstanding government debt so this is the value of the entire government bond portfolio has to equal the expected present discounted value of future surpluses of future primary surpluses and these surpluses themselves are the difference between tax revenues and government spending and so how much government how much that government can issue its fiscal capacity depends both on these current and future primary surpluses the s's in this equation as well as on how these surpluses are discounted the stochastic discount factor end now a basic tenet of asset pricing is that the discount rate should reflect the risk of these cash flows now the surpluses these primary surpluses they are the cash flows on an investment strategy that buys the entire government bond portfolio okay so picture a representative investor who buys all government debt that is being issued and receives all of the redemptions to this investor these primary surpluses are the cash flows so then back to the basic tenant of asset pricing what is the risk in these surpluses so i'm going to be thinking about the risk in these surpluses both in the short run and in the long run and so in the short run these surpluses are highly pro cyclical and that's because tax revenues are pro-cyclical and government spending is counter-cyclical as illustrated in this graph as you see the tax revenues are going up in expansions you see spending the red line in the red dash line is going up in recessions so this cash flow this surplus has the wrong way business cycle risk which means that the claim to these surpluses which you could think of as the government debt portfolio by virtue of that equation i showed on the previous slide carries business cycle risk and therefore it should have a business cycle risk premium this argument is really no different from the argument we make when we are when we explain the equity risk premium dividends are also pro-cyclical so they are being paid out at the wrong time when the stochastic discount factor is low therefore they carry a business cycle risk premium now in the long run there is long run risk in these surplus cash flows as well right and that is because in the long run government spending and tax revenue and therefore also surpluses must be co-integrated with gdp the ratios of government spending to gdp and tax revenues to gdp must be stationary so that means that the surplus claim which again equals the government bond portfolio inherits this long-run risk in gdp and to the extent that there is a long-run risk premium in gdp in gdp so there is a long-run risk premium in government debt now a long line of asset pricing research has argued that these permanent shocks in gdp are crucial and must carry a large risk price if we want to account for things like the equity risk premium right so this gdp claim you could think of it as an unlevered claim to aggregate dividends will you know also carry a large i may be slightly less large but because it's an unlevered claim but still a large risk premium and so this long this large long run risk premium is also why the transversality condition is you know more likely to be satisfied okay so let me explain that briefly as an aside remember when i was iterating forward on the government body constraint i ended up imposing a transversality condition now let me justify that that decision so if there's a substantial long-run risk premium in gdp and by co-integration in the tax revenue and in the government spending and therefore in government debt in the future which itself reflects the fact that you know the present discounted value of tax revenues minus surpluses from that point forward then you know that transversality condition which basically is the limit of the expected value of the debt as time goes to infinity that is likely to be zero and the reason is that you know that in the far future is gdp in the far future times the debt-to-gdp ratio you know by co-integration this element is stationary and so really you know whether this term goes to zero or not is all about is the question is all about what is the size of the gdp risk premium and so if the gdp risk premium is large enough then this transfer salary condition will be satisfied even if the risk-free rate is below the growth rate okay so to put this differently in the presence of permanent output risk that receives a properly high risk price you know as implied by the stock market for example government debt is is much less likely to be a bubble the argument of a tvc violation is that much harder to maintain so now that we've understood kind of both the short run and the long run risk features of this surplus cash flow we can now kind of discount these the surpluses at a rate that properly reflects that shorter and that longer risk right so just to summarize what i've kind of argued until now is that the expected excess return on a tax claim should be higher than the expected accessory return on a gdp claim because tax revenues to gdp are pro cyclical in the short run they are riskier than gdp in the long run they are as risky as gdp because of co-integration so overall they are riskier than gdp they should have a higher risk premium and you know conversely spending to gdp is counter cyclical in the short run in the long run it is as risky as gdp so overall it should be safer than gdp it should carry a lower risk premium okay now if i set all these three risk premia equal to each other then what i do is i construct an upper bound on fiscal capacity right the reason being that if i discount the tax claim by a risk premium that is too small i make it larger and vice versa when i discount the government spending by by a discount rate that is too large i make it smaller therefore i widen the gap between the tax and the spending claim i create a generous upper bound on fiscal capacity okay so that is the assumption we will make we will set these three risk premiums equal to each other and thereby we will be creating an upper bound on fiscal capacity okay so what's left to be done is to implement this and basically come up with a number for the gdp risk premium okay so i'm i'll be discounting surpluses you know using you know a discount rate that reflects both time value of money for that i'm going to use the zero coupon yield curve at the end of 2021 for maturities from 1 to 30 years plus a risk premium and as i just argued for that i will use the gdp risk premium what is the size of that gdp risk premium at the end of 2021 well i'll start from the observation that this gdp claim can be thought of as an unlevered equity claim and that the expected real return on equity at the end of 20 20 21 you know we think is about 5.1 okay that comes from a couple of different models so if we then unlever that equity expect a return and subtract a bond return to get to a risk premium we arrive at a gdp risk premium of about 2.6 per year so just to give you a sense for what that number means you know we could think of that as implying a price dividend ratio and a gdp claim of 65 right so here's my 2.6 gdp risk premium here's my nominal risk-free rate and then here's my nominal gdp growth rate so that means that for each percentage point in additional surpluses the us government gained 65 in fiscal capacity in the steady state so that's the that's the discount rate right so now i want to discount these surpluses what are the surpluses that i'm going to use to come up with a number for fiscal capacity at the end of 2021. so here i want to make it as simple as possible i am just going to go to the congressional budget office and just look at their forecast of surpluses for the next 30 years okay and so what the cbo does is it basically says you know under current law you know if we just follow uh you know all the plans for spending and taxes that have already been approved uh by the congress what will be the implication for uh the surplus of the us economy and the numbers that they come up with are plotted here in the graph they range from about you know negative two and a half percent of gdp to negative 4.7 percent of gdp by the end of by 2051. okay so those are going to be my first 30 years of cash flows of primary surpluses that i'm going to uh that i'm going to value that i'm going to discount what about you know and and as an aside you know these cat these these cbo projections historically have tended to be uh overly optimistic not because the cbo does anything wrong but because politicians have a habit of renewing short-term spending programs that are set to expire and let short-term tax increases expire and so if you look at the history of these projections you know relative to what actually materialized they have consistently been too high okay so you can think of using these cdo forecasts you know as my cash flows uh to discount as essentially again being generous and creating more physical capacity than there actually might be what about these surpluses after 2051. well for that i'm going to use the cbo projections for the debt to gdp ratio at the end of 2051. right so the cbo also forecasts interest rates it also forecasts gdp for the foreseeable future and so if we combine all of these forecasts with the forecast of the surpluses we can calculate the cbo's implied forecast for debts to gdp at the end of 2051 and that number is 202 percent of gdp okay so now we're going to make an important assumption we're going to say that in 2051 we're going to the u.s economy the congress is going to come to its census and it's going to start running surpluses and it's going to run enough surpluses to back up this 202 debt to gdp okay so then we can ask you know how large do the surpluses the annual surpluses have to be after 2051 to justify this 202 percent debt to gdp and for that we can use our price dividend ratio on the gdp claim which properly reflects the risk in these cash flows okay which remember was 65 so we can divide that 202 percent of debt to gdp by that multiple that 65 multiple to arrive at an annual 3.1 surplus to gdp right so to put it differently in order to back up this 202 percent debt to gdp after 2051 uh the us government needs to run a 3.1 annual primary surplus after 2051. okay and so that gives us kind of the second part the second half of of this cash flow of the surplus cash flow that we want to value right so we have the first 30 years kind of year by year cbo forecast and then after 2051 we use the cbo forecast for the debt to gdp ratio and assume it is backed by surpluses thereafter so now we can finally get at kind of our main calculation which is you know a measure of the physical capacity at the end of 2021. and so what we will do is we will discount these first 30 years of cash flows using a discount rate that i've explained right it's the sum of the risk-free rate of the zero coupon bond for each of the next 30 years and then added to that a gdp risk premium of 2.6 per year you know which reflects the risk in these cash flows the risk in these in these surpluses so remember the first 30 years are basically deficits as far as the eye can see so the present discounted value of these first 30 years of deficits turns out to be about a negative 21 trillion okay 21 trillion dollars worth of deficits over the next 30 years in two days and in dollars at the end of 2021. and then after 2051 remember we'll be running these surpluses the present value of those again using that same discount rate is 30 31 trillion dollars right so the the overall measure of fiscal capacity that we're getting from this exercise from this simple exercise is 10 trillion dollars so you know that then immediately raises a puzzle which is you know if if if this is our is an upper bound on physical capacity and this upper bound is only 10 trillion dollars you know we immediately know that that's below the observed debt to gdp ratio at the end of 2021 which was 23 trillion dollars right and and that's after we realized that this is actually a generous estimate of capacity because you know i've assumed it's an upper bound through my discount rate assumption and because you know it assumes this heroic effort where we will be running 3.1 annual surpluses after 2051. now let me also mention that this conclusion is not kind of driven by the particulars of using the cbo surplus forecast or by this simple model of just using a constant gdp risk premium to discount these these cash flows in fact in earlier work you know we we went about the same question you know with much more with a more sophisticated approach where we model the rich model for the cash flows for tax revenues and government spending that you know allowed for feedbacks from the macro economy from the debt level that the gdp ratio onto these cash flows and where we wrote down a much richer model for the stochastic discount factor which was consistent with the time series of stock and bond prices observed in the post-war u.s period and where we exactly priced the claim to tax revenue and government spending instead of relying on an upper bound that model had you know taxes risk-free that were specific to the tax and the government spending claim as well as risk premium that were allowed allowed to vary over time and if anything you know under in this in that model the the government bond valuation puzzle was even deeper than what i'm showing you here now a second point i want to make is that um when we have this surplus claim where we're running the first 30 years of deficits and then these large surpluses in the future we end up with a surplus claim that is very back loaded as this graph illustrates right what this graph shows you is the present discounted value of each of these surpluses relative to the sum of the present values of all the surpluses right and so you will recognize this is what goes into a duration calculation remember the duration is the sum of each of the periods in which the cash flows are paid times this this present value share that is being plotted here and if you do the math you'll find that this surplus claim has a very long duration of 260 years okay now think of this as the duration of the government's assets you know the government you know is going to earn these these surpluses so it's a very the government has a very long term long-duration asset if you think of the government's liabilities you know its portfolio of outstanding government debt that has a much shorter duration duration of only about five years it's fluctuated historically a little bit but it's never been very far from five years okay so what that means is that there's a massive duration dispatch here and uh when interest rates rise the present value of government assets will fall by much more than the value of the liabilities you know by virtue of that of that duration mismatch okay so to make this very concrete in the context of the specific numbers that i've shown you so far you know imagine a one percentage point parallel shift in the nominal youth curve holding fixed nominal gdp growth okay and then redo my fiscal capacity calculation okay you know hold the cash flows fixed and then kind of ask yourself how large do the surpluses after 2051 have to be in this new interest rate environment relative to what they were before and the answer is instead of running 3.1 percentage point surpluses after 2051 you now need to run 6.1 percentage point surpluses after 2051. okay so you see a massive increase in the surpluses for just a modest shift in in yields right in fact the one percentage point change in the yield curve is roughly what we've experienced just over the last several months now the implication of this is that if you want to restore fiscal capacity to what it was before the interest rate increase then the government will need to raise taxes or cut spending and we know from a long literature and public finance that these changes in tax rates are costly because taxes tend to be distortionary for example the work of barrow or bhandari evans golosov and sargent so this problem is of course very familiar to a pension fund or a bank this duration mismatch problem and you know it has a well-known prescription namely that the government should match its cash inflows which are these projected surpluses to its cash outflows the coupon and principal payments it pays on its debt by matching the duration of the treasury bond portfolio to the duration of these surpluses right and so right now we're very far from that situation it suggests a much longer duration treasury portfolio let me make one last point on this duration which is if you lowered the discount rate for the surpluses either because for example interest rates have been declining over time um or because maybe you thought the gdp risk premium number i have used is too large then that might increase your measure of fiscal capacity but it will worsen this duration mismatch issue so at this point you know i've only considered surpluses as essentially creating fiscal capacity now you may say what about u.s treasuries and their special place as a global safe haven asset and you know just the you know the onset of the ukraine crisis kind of brought back this point again that u.s bonds appreciated uh you know at times of like of global turbulence so we want to be mindful of this of this possibility and we want to calculate we want to quantify how important this this convenience yield aspect of use stresses might be okay so we're going to be using a number and that i think is a consensus number in the literature that convenience yields lowers interest rates by about 60 basis points historically uh you know and if we assume that that still applies today even though we had now have 100 dead to gdp then that would generate about 0.6 of gdp annually in additional tax revenues think of this as convenience yield or seniority revenues from this special feature of usd so we can then ask what what effect on our fiscal capacity measure does this additional convenience yield revenue have right so now we actually need one more assumption because remember under the cbo's projections the debt to gdp ratio will be growing in the next 30 years from about 100 percent of gdp to about 202 percent of gdp so we will assume essentially a downward sloping demand curve for save assets and and we will do that by assuming that this convenience yield revenue remains constant as a fraction of gdp even as the debt to gdp ratio doubles over the next 30 years right so you could think of that as the convenience yield as an interest rate will have over that same period and then we're going to discount that additional tax revenue that additional senior rich revenue from convenience yield at the same discount rate as as the surpluses right and so what that reflects is the idea that this convenience yield is a narrow measure of convenience it only applies to treasuries and therefore it leaves the expected return on a gdp claim for example or on the stock market unaffected okay so it doesn't raise the discount rate okay so under that conservative assumption uh this convenience yield generates about 3.7 trillion dollars in additional fiscal capacity right so instead of having a baseline fiscal capacity measure of about 10 trillion dollars we now get to 13.7 trillion dollars so the fiscal capacity bound still remains well below the observed that the gdp ratio of 23 trillion dollars at the end of 2021. now you may say well maybe convenience seals are just a lot larger than 60 basis points uh and in fact some recent research has suggested that they could be about maybe as large as 200 basis points but that research usually thinks of convenience sales as applying much more broadly than just to treasuries maybe also to high-grade corporate bonds or maybe you know even to all dollar assets maybe including equities and at this at that point once you kind of start going down this path you realize that there's two uh effects associated with higher convenience yields on the one hand you know as you increase the convenience yield of course you increase the additional senior rich revenue from convenience right so there's a cash flow effect if you like and that cash flow effect increases your fiscal capacity but as you increase the convenience yields you're also increasing the true risk-free rate on an asset that does not have convenience and if that you know that large increase in the in in the real interest rate if you like will then affect uh expect the returns on on a whole range of assets because you've now taken this broader view of convenience and so that's going to increase your discount rate which you discount these future convenience yield revenue streams and so you have two opposing forces here a cash flow effect that as you increase the convenience yield you raise convenience yield revenue a discount rate effect which leads you to discount those cash flows at a higher rate thereby lowering their present value so you could think of this as a laffer curve for the present discounted value of convenience yield so ultimately you're going to reach a point where the convenience yield if further increasing it actually leads you to reduce the additional fiscal capacity that you can generate for more convenience what all of that suggests is that convenience yields are not a panacea for creating you know physical capacity and may not in fact be large enough to generate the amount of government debt that we see how then to create more physical capacity well the most obvious answer of course is to increase surpluses so we do this simple calculation where we ask by how much would annual surpluses need to go up per year relative to the cbo baseline in order to justify the observed amount of debt at the end of 2021 and the answer is by seven percentage points per year right so if you raise them from about negative four percent to plus three percent uh you know each year over those 30 years then you know you would essentially now have an upper bound on fiscal capacity that inc that encompassed the observed value of government debt and as a byproduct you would be eliminating most of the duration gap because now you're front loading the surpluses right so in this calculation under the red line the duration of the surplus claim is now only six years and it's now pretty close to the observed duration of the bond portfolio but of course increasing annual surpluses by seven percent of gdp every year for the next thirty years is a major lift the second way you can increase uh you can create more fiscal capacity is by making the tax claim safer or the spending claim riskier kind of leaving their overall expected values the same and and and this point goes to the heart of my argument today which is that you know the riskiness the discount rate matters uh tremendously when you calculate fiscal capacity right so imagine that i was willing to violate this this observation that i made earlier that tax the tax claim is riskier than gdp claim which in turn is riskier than the spending claim and imagine that i was willing to lower to make it concrete the expect the risk premium on the tax claim by 100 basis points what i then will generate and everything else in my example stays the same i will now just through you know just by that one assumption increase my fiscal capacity bound from 10 trillion dollars in the baseline to 26 trillion and now i'm comfortable comfortably including the 23 trillion dollars that we observe in the data but remember what does that mean to lower the risk premium on the tax claim it means that we're requiring tax rates to go up in bad times okay so we are manufacturing risk-free government debt and ensuring government bond holders but only by loading the aggregate risk onto the taxpayers and shifting aggregate risk on the taxpayers at the worst possible time in a recession is obviously very painful and therefore politically very difficult okay but but but kind of you know this argument goes to show that thinking about the nature of risk in these in these cash flows is really crucial finally you could think about monetary policy as potentially creating fiscal capacity and this goes uh this this is based on some work with vladimir and tim landford and patrick schultz where we solve a structural model of the economy where uh you know the economy has just undergone a crisis which is the combination of you know negative supply shocks as well as a large aggregate demand check you could think of this as the great financial crisis for example and then that aggregate demand shortfall has pushed the economy into the zlb and in that situation in that state of the world we ask can unconventional monetary policy be useful and we find that in fact it can and it does and that qe can boost aggregate demand substantially so it can lead to an increase in gdp uh lower short rates because we're at the zlb lower long rates because qe in the you know in this model lowers the long-term bond yields and fewer hands and fewer long-term bonds in the hands of the public okay so all four of these forces reduce the debt service to gdp ratio and the debt to gdp ratio right and so you can kind of see this here the solid line in the picture shows you the debt to gdp ratio which you know increases after when the crisis hits and then kind of evolves afterwards after the crisis is over you could see if we if we don't do qe we have a higher that the gdp ratio than if we do q the solid line in the in yellow is below the solid light in blue moreover quantitative easing or unconventional monetary policy more broadly can also reduce the risk of having to raise taxes in the future state of the world that we call austerity right so you can see here we have about a 51 chance of getting into this austerity region whereas you know here only 39 right so qe can really help in response to a crisis now once the aggregate demand shortfall wanes once we're out of that crisis qe becomes ineffective so there's very strong state dependence of qe uh in response but it can lower the debt to gdp ratio in response to for example an event like the great financial crisis now in that same paper we also study what happens if we're in normal times and we want to finance an unexpected increase in transfers of say five percent of gdp you could think of this as you know it's 2021 uh you know the biden administration wants to spend uh you know additional five percent of gdp on the build back better plan and we envisioned that this takes place this conversation takes place in the context of a situation that already has a high debt to gdp ratio of 100 as well as high inflation and so what these graphs show you is basically how the economy responds to that unexpected increase in in in additional government spending transfer spending of five percent of gdp and it contrasts a world where we follow conventional monetary policy the the fed just follows the taylor rule with a world where we were deviating from the taylor rule by placing a little bit of weight on the debt to gdp ratio so imagine that the fed is accommodating uh the the treasury by essentially keeping the interest rates lower than they otherwise would be because of the high value of that okay and so what you can see is that in the red line you know we now can you know have a large increase in of inflation in response to this transfer spending where inflation goes all the way up to six percent of to six percent and this large increase in inflation then helps to erode the real value of the debt right so surprise and this basically generates surprise inflation and the debt to gdp ratio falls as it has over the last year or so and then even in the long run this conventional monetary policy that kind of deviates from the taylor rule and accommodates the physical authority creates a little bit of additional fiscal capacity that the gdp ratio that that the gdp ratio is about two percentage points lower than in a world where we follow the regular taylor rule okay now of course you could ask how often can you support can you use surprise inflation to devalue the debt before households expectations adjust so let me conclude when sources of aggregate risk reflected in bond and stock prices are adequately quantified a substantial risk premium on the surplus claim arises and once you take that risk premium into account measures of fiscal capacity shrink substantially what that implies is that bond yields in the u.s especially in the last two decades have been puzzlingly low there's a range of interpretations of that uh you know a range of resolutions of that puzzle possible could be that bond market investors fail to enforce the transfer salary condition but we've argued that that argument faces a bit of an uphill battle because of that uh that risk in um in in boundary and you know the risk the gdp risk second it could be that convenience yields are responsible for these deviations and that they maybe are much larger than we think it could be that investors hold overly optimistic beliefs about future fiscal rectitude or it could be the future fiscal rectitude in fact will be forthcoming once that to gdp levels are high enough which but maybe they haven't been yet so far right i think these last two explanations are difficult to disentangle from each other because they're both essentially peso explanations now i think we have we're having this conversation at a really interesting uh point in time where um you know in light of the high inflation that the u.s economy is currently experiencing monetary policy needs to now focus on tight on fighting inflation rather than providing fiscal capacity short rates will have to go up qe policy wind down arguably will lead to uh higher long rates and it will lead to more long-term bonds in the hands of the public there's also the possibility of the risk of a hard landing where gdp falls right so all for all of these reasons that service and the debt to gdp ratio is likely to go up in the in the near future second foreign investors and the fed scaling back u.s treasury purchases means that more rate sensitive buyers private investors either domestic or foreign will need to fill the gap and you can see that you know there's a large amount of treasuries currently being held by these price inelastic buyers the federal reserve and foreigners and so this is potentially a large change and then finally long-term structural surpluses in social security and medicare medicaid are turning into deficits due to the graying of the population and these are long-term trends that are underlying some of these cbo forecasts that we saw and so all of this leads me to conclude that fiscal adjustment may be unavoidable to keep the u.s debt safe and preserve its global safe haven status so let me leave you with this cartoon and ask whether 2022 will be the year that the bond market vigilantes wake up you can follow our work at www.publicdebtvaluation.com and i want to thank you for tuning in
