great so this is joint with seven bornstein my uc berkeley colleague since 2006 u.s households have received more than 18 billion in federal tax credits for weatherizing their homes installing installing solar panels buying hybrids and electric vehicles and other what we're calling clean energy investments so in this paper we want to ask who claims these credits how do receipts vary across income groups and does this distributional pattern provide any broader insights about program design we've been surprised in how much we've ended up talking about efficiency while we're writing a paper about distributional impacts so we got interested in this um because there's growing enthusiasm among u.s policy makers for policies that subsidize green products so kpmg does this ranking of major economies based on their greenness this is based on how much their government how much government action there is towards climate change or other green objectives so the us is first overall but what's really interesting is that they do a breakout of tax incentives versus tax penalties so tax penalties is like carbon tax gasoline tax on this the u.s is far down the list at number 14. the reason that the kpmg puts the u.s overall is that there's just this plethora of tax incentives for green goods now this two may seem very similar but they're really not and economists for a long time have pointed out that subsidizing green is less efficient than taxing brown there's a couple of things i mean but perhaps the most important is that subsidies technology subsidy is never going to get usage right you can get somebody to buy a prius or to install an energy efficient window but you can't get them to drive less or run their air conditioner less subsidies are also a very coarse instrument forces us to pick winners and for example there's a recent nbr paper by stephen holland and co-authors looking at electric cars and finds that there's just enormous heterogeneity and externality impact of electric cars from big external benefits in states like california where electricity comes from natural gas and renewables to big external costs in states like north dakota where electricity comes from coal with a uniform technology subsidy you're never going to get that right another problem that a number of recent studies have been pointing to and emphasizing that many subsidy recipients are infra-marginal getting paid to do what they would otherwise would have done distributional effects of clean energy subsidies have received much less attention and there seems to be at least among some a presumption that subsidies are equitable or somehow more equitable than first best policies here's a recent quote by billy piser many alternatives to pigouvian taxes involve smaller or negligible redistributions if distributional concerns matter and cannot be adequately addressed the welfare advantage of picuvian policies is far from obvious so we really we looked out in the literature and actually found very little on this but it wasn't obvious to us so certainly what's true is that whenever anyone introduces the possibility of a gas or carbon tax there's there's always an outcry about possible concerns about regressivity and distributional impacts but it just wasn't obvious to us at all that that subsidizing green goods was going to have better distributional impacts so what we do is we review clean energy income tax credits available since 2006. so we're first going to do just some pure description talk about what's covered eligibility requirements important changes we're going to look for evidence of impacts using shipment and sales data but that's going to be basically before and after comparison so we're not going to draw strong causal conclusions from that then we're going to turn to the heart of it which is to look at tax return data to see who claimed these credits compare the distribution impacts to tax credits in the carbon tax and then perform an answering analysis aimed at understanding non-refundability which ends up being very important so most of the most of the existing literature on on clean energy subsidies has correctly looked at efficiency questions and cost effectiveness questions there's much less done on distributional impacts most of the work on disrespectful impacts has looked at say the gasoline tax carbon tax and other first best approaches very little has been done on clean energy subsidies there's a paper by jeff dubin and steve henson that looks at an earlier round of clean energy subsidies and then there's two very nice papers by molly sherlock from the congressional research service which look at two of the four tax credits we're going to look at first and some of the years that we're going to look at we see our work as really building on that work so we're going to look at four different tax credits the first and biggest is something called the non-business energy property credit so we took line item irs data to just try to get a handle of what what where is this where are these tax expenditures going turns out the biggest category is energy efficient windows so that's 4 billion over the period 2005 to 2012. and then there's just an entire you know a laundry list qualified furnaces boilers acs water heaters etc etc the spending across years is actually pretty interesting so we had a policy like this this was like an example bob inman said you know we needed policies that were on the shelf to roll out roll out this is very much like that uh during the 90s and the 2000s there was there was no tax credit like this in 2006 that the credits introduced at a 10 rate it it's there for 2006 2007 2008 the credit goes away entirely but then comes back under aura with a vengeance with it's increased to a 30 tax rate and the limit goes from 500 to 1500. so you see this huge surge in expenditures in 2009 and 2010 only with over five billion dollars in tax expenditures in those years then goes back to ten percent in 2011 and 2012. so if you thought that this tax credit was really being effective in inducing changes in behavior you'd expect to see not a lot of take up of energy efficient durable goods in 2008 and then a surge in 2009 and 2010. so we pulled doe data on on sales of energy efficient natural gas furnaces central air conditioners heat pumps and a couple other minor categories 2009 2010 seemed like okay years for shipments but it's well within the rain well within the range of shipments we observe in other years so we don't address super strong conclusions but it certainly doesn't just jump off the page that there's this that we're getting a huge impact uh during those our years we looked at some minor categories too natural gas boilers and oil furnaces the same second credit we're going to look at is the is the poorly poorly named residential energy efficiency property credit the other credit really is much more about energy efficiency this is about household renewables the number one category here with 1.8 billion dollars in tax expenditures over this period is solar pv systems so spending follows kind of a similar pattern starts in the credit this credit starts in 2006 generosity's increased in 2009 but then it's not fallen off like the other one it's it's remained a 30 credit actually with no cap uh from 2009 it's going to go through through the end of 2016 if it's not renewed so this is a 30 tax credit just to be clear if you put a 30 000 solar panel on your roof that's a 10 000 credit so this is a very this credit has a very generous credit per per credit recipient what's true is that this credit has been in place during during an enormous period of growth in the uc in the solar panel uh residential solar panel market experts point to cheap solar panels probably being a bigger bigger driver than tax credits but there's no question that the tax credit has played has played a role here we're now the third credit we're going to look at is alternative motor vehicle credit which goes which goes to hybrids natural gas and other alternative fuel vehicles you wouldn't know it from driving around berkeley california but this is actually a pretty small credit uh ever in berkeley every other car is a hybrid but this credit nationally ended up added up to less that a half a billion dollars over the period we're looking so toyota's the real dominant dominant um manufacturer here so we broke them out from other manufacturers this shows hybrid vehicle sales and if you if if you were if you if you were involved in this at all you you'd know that this this credit had this very unusual feature which which was that it phased out for an individual manufacturer once that manufacturer had sold 60 000 vehicles so toyota the credit for toyota phased out in 2007 for most other manufacturers didn't phase out till the end of 2010. you see you see a spike in toyota sales in 2007 interestingly but you really don't see a fall off in hybrid vehicle sales in 2011 when the when the credit when the credit ends for hybrids if anything 2011 2012 and 2013 have been pretty good years for hybrid vehicle sales but again this is basically before and after comparison so we're not we're not making we're not trying to make very strong causal statements here uh last we're going to look at the electric vehicle credit which comes in later and uh uh has in a similar pattern kind of like the solar pv in that the entire growth in u.s u.s electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales has occurred during under the period of this credit so the credit comes in in 2010 and yeah and we see a large growth in nissan leaf sales chevy volt sales tesla model s sales so very hard in that context to make any causal statements the better the more credible evidence that uh that looks at the impact of credits like this is looked at state level variation in sales and in credit amount and found uh economic and statistically significant effects okay so i want to now turn to the distributional impacts and we're going to use irs variety of different irs data sets for this the nice thing about irs data is we're going to have this enormous representative sample very accurate measures of credit very accurate measures of income there are some inherent limitations that were that were want to emphasize first is we're going to obviously exclude households that don't file tax returns so we compared census to irs data and we think there's 26 million americans who are not represented by any tax form in 2012. those americans couldn't collect in these credits and they tend to be very low income so we actually think this exclusion anything is going to lead us to understate the degree to which these credits are received by high-income households we're also going to be forced to use annual income we don't have we don't have any measure of lifetime income but it would be very interesting and in future work to to get a better measure of kind of lifetime well-being of these households we're also not going to be able to get it all at the question of subsidy incidents so the statutory incidence of these credits is clearly on on the households receiving the credits but but we're not going to speak to the degree to which this the which prices of clean energy goods respond responded to the subsidies there's one actually really nice study on this by my new berkeley colleague jim sallee that shows near zero pass through with the alternate motor vehicle credit so here's the main results what we're going to do is divide households into agi categories these first five categories are essentially quintiles and then the last category 200k plus is about three percent of filers this is across all years in 2006 to 2012. and this is for residential energy credits which combines the first two tax credit categories i talked about so what we find is that about that that there's low take up the credit in the first three quintiles so the average credit per return and this is average across all returns those who take the credit or don't take the credit is under 10 it approximately doubles in the fourth quintile approximately doubles again in the fifth quintile and then approximately doubles again when you get to uh households who earn over two hundred thousand a year for the alternative motor vehicle credit the pat the distributional pattern is very similar about ten percent of the credit going to the bottom three quintiles about sixty percent going to the top quintile and then the electric vehicle credit we find is much high much more highly concentrated among high income among the high income categories ni essentially no take up in the bottom four quintiles 90 of the credit is captured uh uh uh received by the top income quintile and about 40 percent of the total credit goes to households who have an agi of over 200 000 a year uh we look in the paper to see whether this what what's uh to see whether this is coming from the extensive or intensive margin and it's and it's both it's both so higher income households are more likely to claim and claim higher higher amounts when they do claim now income's highly concentrated too so we wanted to we wanted to have a sense of how the concentration of these credits compares to the concentration of income for this we constructed concentration curve so rank all the filers uh by agi and then ask the question what what's the cumulative fraction of either credits or income that's received by that group here's what you get and so the interpretation is very simple here for example take the take the take point five go halfway down if you look at the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers receive about 15 percent of agi less than 10 percent of these tax credits it it swaps at about 75 at about 0.75 and then for very high income levels we're finding the credits are actually less concentrated than income for the alternative motor vehicle credit the pattern is almost identical again crossing at about .75 more concentrated than income at low income levels and less concentrated than income at high income levels and then the electric vehicle credit then is much more concentrated than income with a curve that's obviously much much below the orange income curve so you'd say wait a second you know these are tax expenditures aren't all tax expenditures don't all tax expenditures go to high income high income filers well cbo is very helpful here they just did they just analyzed the 2013 largest the top 10 tax expenditures for 2013 and here's the distributional impact so they find about 30 percent going to the bottom three quintiles and about 50 percent going to the top quintile so we're finding these clean energy tax credits are actually considerably higher more concentrated income than these than this than than the top 10 major tax expenditures we think this is pretty surprising because if you think about what these major tax expenditures are most of them are exclusions like like employer paid health insurance or deductions like the mortgage tax deduction in which case there's a mechanical relationship with income driven by increasing marginal tax rates these are all credits these are dollar for dollar regardless of what your marginal tax rate is so uh so so we're surprised with how highly concentrated these tax credits are indeed if you compare them to other tax credits they're much much more concentrated so here's here's concentration coefficients for the different tax credits and then the five biggest tax credits in the u.s in 2012. these are concentration coefficients so this is the area this is the area underneath those concentration curves divided by the entire area under the 45 degree line and so what you see is that the earned income tax credit for example is highly redistributed by design it actually has a concentration curve that's above the 45 degree line so that's that that makes sense but the making work pay credit child tax credit first time home buyer credit these all these credits are much more evenly distributed across across filers the one that's not is the foreign tax credit and actually the electric vehicle credit is not as concentrated but it's approaching the degree of concentration we see in the foreign tax credit so one of the one one thing that to note uh is that the the first four major tax credits listed there are all refundable and these clean energy tax credits that we're looking at are all not refundable and to tell you the truth when we went into this this was not even on our radar screen this is not something that i didn't think was going to be a big mover over a third of filers in 2012 had non-positive tax liability and those are thus are ineligible for these refundable credits so we've we we've eventually we've now convinced ourselves that this actually is does play an important role in the concentration of income that we're seeing um it's reasonable to ask does this matter would these would these filers with non non-positive tax liability be claiming the credits if they if they were eligible to try to get at this and this is not a perfect test but what we did is we'll let's just what if we just look at take up of these of clean energy tax credits against uh tax liability and project this down to zero and and if the intercept is positive that suggests that these guys with non-zero with non-positive tax liability would indeed take the credit and it does look like they they would at lower amounts than higher income higher income categories but they would um and thinking about it more deeply the whole idea of a non-refundable credit is odd um we looked this was new to us we looked around didn't find a lot of literature on this uh in fact the only thing we found on this was a really nice paper by peter orsakan and co-authors called efficiency and tax incentives that case for refundable tax credits says i really like this quote it's extremely unlikely that externalities and elasticities change in an abrupt and discontinuous fashion exactly at the point of zero income tax liability so what are why are we doing this we're we're motivated by externalities we've got two households both of them if they install an energy efficient window they're going to reduce externalities but yet we're treating them very differently based on one has zero tax liability one has a thousand dollars of tax liability it seems odd to us we haven't been able to come up with an economic argument for making these credits non-refundable putting it all together how do these tax credits compare to a carbon tax so here's some here's some bi quintile evidence from a new paper by rob williams and co-authors in the national tax journal a carbon tax would be disproportionately paid by high income quintiles tax credits are disproportionately received by high income quintiles for carbon tax has much better distribution distributional impacts this is really dramatic in the case of lump sum rebates to the far right here if we did if we if we rebated a carbon tax with lump sum rebates you could actually make the bottom three quintiles strictly better off on average even before accounting for environment environmental externalities and you know just more generally i think this makes sense the the top quintile in some of metcalf's metcap's work finds that the top in quintile spends about uh four times as much would spend about four times as much as the as the first quintile makes sense there's a there's carbon embodied in everything that we we consume high income income households consume more so they would pay more uh i want to con i want to wrap up i know i'm staying between now and lunch so uh and i do i do welcome feedback here but we're finding that these credits are going predominantly to higher income americans the bottom three quintiles received 10 percent while the top received 60 percent the most extreme is this electric vehicle credit which is real which is really uh targeted the tesla the tesla community driven by both participation rates and size of credit claimed by recipients and it's you know considerably more regressive than other tax credits and and a carbon tax we're also struck by the horizontal inequity here so 40 plus million u.s households are ineligible because they don't have any tax liability our results suggest that these households would claim the credits if they were eligible and i haven't even mentioned but renters and landlords are ineligible for both the win the energy efficiency window type thing and for the solar pv type credit that also seems odd to us we can't come up with an economic argument for excluding renters and landlords uh and that that is a significant share of the market so i guess i understand that there that it's politically easier to put through a subsidy it's easier to put through a subsidy than a tax but i think this choice i think it's becoming increasingly clear that this choice has real comes at real cost both in terms of efficiency and equity thank you you
