so we have one more presentation before our break I'd like to introduce Professor Ian Coburn from Boston University good morning thank you I heartily recommend you to read the the somewhat lengthy paper that Scott Jack and I have have written on this I don't have time this morning to to delve into I think some important details and subtleties uh the paper begins with a motivating example is to to think back a half dozen presidents and reflect on some science policy initiatives from the uh the 1970s and I think there's you know President Nixon in short order both declared war on cancer uh and uh launched project Independence uh and I think when we look forward from the third episode there's two very dramatically different experiences of these two sectors as the chart shows uh a breakdown of federal non-defense r d spending uh you can see that the blue the blue part there is is Health Energy is is this the green part and there's been really a dramatic difference uh it's and I think you know tracing out why that might have been what the implications uh have turned out to be 30 years later for the technological progress in this sectors uh is is very interesting uh one thing I think we can say about about uh the life sciences sector is that a capacity has developed in this country and in others which I think is is truly remarkable uh not just the ongoing you know ongoing stream of very important Innovations but also this kind of institutional technological capability to to get on and solve problems uh quite dramatically this is this is you know the nasty green thing there is the HIV virus uh and that the chart to the right you know shows what could have been uh you know the kind of disaster we see in places like sub-Saharan Africa uh taking off the United States but really nipped in the bud and to a great degree I think we're gonna you know attribute this to the ability of the life sciences system both fundamental scientific work supported by taxpayers and the commercial part of of uh of this sector to get on this problem and come up with a pretty dramatic uh uh response now HIV AIDS of course it's not cured these are these treatments are palliative rather than Curative but it's still I think a dramatic illustration many of the same stories can be told uh uh you know tremendous progress in in dealing with some you know very difficult problems in human health you know as a mental illness heart disease uh Sometimes some types of cancers and so forth so to first order when you think about you know what's going on in this section in terms of innovation and uh you know has it worked yeah absolutely uh clearly uh government support and government policy has played a very important role and in a paper we sort of work through and think what do we think of what do we understand as being key drivers of this life sciences Innovation System the first and perhaps most obvious I think is a very high level and a relatively stable level of Public Funding for basic research a lot of money gets spent through the Public Health Service uh some of the other agencies particularly NIH but also through some other programs that has contributed to and supports a process where we've developed a very large you know very highly skilled and highly specialized r d Workforce uh and that has taken place against some interesting interesting aspects of the economics of pharmaceuticals which are very different from a commodity product like energy and I think it's it's obvious but worth dwelling upon these changes public support takes place against the background of fundamentally very high willingness to pay for new products you know differentiated new products uh if you couple that together with insurance driven demand you know the restaurant where where he or she who orders doesn't pay and an interesting role of quite stringent regulation on the health and safety front by FDA about who is allowed to sell products this is generated you know demand factors which I think have been very conducive to commercialization building upon these infrastructural investments in basic science and Workforce Development uh fourthly we see this is a sector which in our view you know we the critical factor is that there's a bottom-up process of Project funding and project selection if you like much of the NIH budget and other agencies money is distributed to work on problems principally through a process of peer review an investigator initiated products you know the inmates run the Asylum here uh we also see this sector where you know the patent system seems to be working pretty well information communication Technologies and software people are really scratching their heads and I think they're very worried about you know the costs associated with the patent system which appears to be bogged down a little bit out of control in this sector at least so far intellectual property rights have worked pretty well and play a pretty very important role in allowing innovators to capture value from their from their work and and to Echo something as she's just said these intellectual property rights support and active and important market for technology lastly when we think we point to key drivers here I think it's the the pervasiveness and intensity of competition not just in the product Market but all the way through the value chain expand upon some of these ideas in a moment uh thinking about what has happened since the 1970s focuses us on on I think uh as economists on this you know the evolution of Industry structure a lot has happened uh in this business this is a gross oversimplification but it's a way of thinking about industry structure uh what I would call the good old days this was the set of institutional Arrangements prevailing in the 1970s and through into the 1980s which which created the Z drugs you know Zantac Zoloft Zocor uh and and so forth uh this is one in which there was a relatively distinct boundary between public sector science and Commercial science which was largely conducted by you know big Pharma is the term people throw around to describe large vertically integrated companies that do everything from bench science through to to sales and marketing as the industry evolved not least because of sustained support of basic science things got a lot more complicated on the one hand public sector science expanded and big Pharma you know shrunk somewhat we also saw a rival of a lot more different players the growth of Biotech Industry which operates at the interface between public science and Commercial science and the arrival of new competitors companies like Amgen uh Biogen or Genentech which operate in parallel essentially as large integrated companies rather than being r d boutiques or specialists in particular technology now the evolution of this industry structure has had very interesting effects on who the list of players are and how they interact this radical change in the science of de-emphasis of chemistry as a technology and increasing emphasis on biology reflects the transformation of fundamental science but it's driven by an as interacted with a variety of interesting economic phenomena these would include things like the emergence of new entities with familiar now with these these science-based entrepreneurship companies the the small scale close to University dedicated biotechnology firms but at the same time we've also seen the you know the rise in consolidation of academic medical centers and the the uh of a whole lot of infrastructural entities Venture capitalists patent lawyers University Tech transfer offices and so forth all of this sort of ferment in terms of of different types of organizations has been accompanied by an adaptation and adjustment of the large incumbent firms the federal agencies the universities and other established players in this sector the end results and this is not a not a picture of a biotechnology product it's not an engineered antibody it's a map of the industry drawn up by by some colleagues in sociology the detail is not important it's just to illustrate you know there's a this Maps out connections of different kinds Financial commercial technological between different kinds of entities Innovation today takes place in the context of this very complex dense interrelated network of institutions uh all of that has to do I think with conscious policy choices and uh you know some self-organizing evolution of this system with that as background let me now turn to to what we think are important lessons to draw for thinking about how to to promote innovation in in climate change and Energy Technologies uh Point number one and this is this I think is becoming a uh a constant theme in these in these presentations already you know it takes a lot of time you know the Investments that began with with Nixon and things like the war on cancer and setting up the National Cancer Institute and so forth pay off decades later uh and that is that is that is that is that is uh you know truly fundamental of thinking about these problems the fact that the clock needs to run for a long time I think focuses us also on the value of sustained funding or alternatively the costs of instability and one thing which I think has has built is built the capacity to innovate in this sector is things like labor market development you know a lot of people have to make long-term highly specialized commitments in human capital uh you know in an environment where the budget goes up and down that becomes you know kind of a kind of a courageous choice for an ambitious young person uh instability and funding therefore you know can only lead to to under under investment in specialized human capital or other kinds of Investments we look at the you know the decades it takes to take on problems like cancers uh you know the level of sustained attention and career development specialization you really need this to be operating in a stable Factor uh [Music] secondly as I pointed out you know the inmates run the asylum in the sense that much of the cumulative advance in biological sciences and biomedical Sciences is driven by investigation initiative initiated and peer-reviewed funding allocation you know there's not a lot of top-down command and control now there are Public Health priorities identified which steer funding you know there are political considerations who sits on on which committee uh you know can at the margin move funds around certainly the case too that the product market for pharmaceuticals also generates incentives with steer resources but this they're the basic Innovation agenda is driven by the Curiosity uh of individual researchers and I think it's that role of of curiosity academic freedom entrepreneurship uh you know outside of top-down command and control institutions which has generated A diversity of experimentation uh and and long-term benefits in terms of the accumulation and knowledge and the advance of science here thirdly competition this is a business which is intensely competitive at all levels and much of the competition is focused on Innovation being new and being first is really important in almost all of the activities that go on in in the Life Sciences in the world of universities and taxpayer supported research you know those intense darwinian competition amongst individual investigators between labs and between universities looking for grant funding and the Nobel Prize but that generates you know powerful competitive pressures to move forward to be first to be new uh taking a step away from academic research into the world of of commercial science now there's a very active interface now between the market and and taxpayer-funded research which is the biotechnology industry there are thousands of entrepreneurs working just off campus mostly funded by private equity and Venture Capital competing in this market for technology they're chasing after resources talent and opportunities to come up with new ideas move them forward and then sell them to to Downstream collaboration partners and then finally we get to the product market and pharmaceuticals uh again I think the noteworthy feature about this is you know the prices are high but it's also intensely competitive it's a fragmented Market driven largely by what we call a schumpeterian competition that is to say coming up with new molecules to compete against existing set of products that's uh you know one important dimension of competition another is that the market institution has been set up that's a kind of a push you know you get your new product it's patent protected uh you know or FDA protected for some period of time but then you get you know Savage competition for your products within your molecule from the generics that creates a powerful incentive to move on find new things uh keep going to Echo something that sheesh was talking about uh in terms of antitrust policy I think once you recognize the pervasiveness of competition it's connection and you know his role as a driver of innovation here I think it connects us to thinking about antitrust policy and how valuable competition is at all points in this process and that uh one thing which I think is remark about the life sciences sector there isn't really a choke point any of any of the levels of this of this chain we don't see domination of activity by by a single single entities or individuals that creates valuable competitive pressure also supports the diversity in experimentation [Music] fourth lesson you know transparency and openness life science is I think are uniquely close to to academic science and academic Norms you know murtonian science sharing priority disclosure uh you know turn out I think to to pervade a lot of activity not just in the world of universities but also in commercial activity you know these murtonian Norms support very valuable things which you know not obvious at first glance they support transparency and disclosure and these Drive I think the cumulative advance of Technology I think it's worth noting this occurs even in very close to the market commercial activity you know pharmaceutical companies conducting late stage clinical trials are still doing so largely under the rubric and in an environment which is pervaded by Norms of academic science we see things like you know pressure to disclose clinical trial results operate Registries a lot of the stuff is published and observed you know in real time and not conducted on the conditions of commercial trade secrecy now IP and patents play an important role in creating product Market incentives interestingly enough they seem they seem to manage to coexist with open science uh five or ten years ago I like many other people was very worried that the that the propertisation of science was going to you know cause a train wreck and that uh you know the reach of the patent system into basic science and universities was really going to choke things up now cause all kinds of problems with with access and sharing and transactions costs that doesn't seem to have happened in this industry people seem to have learned to live in the you know open science and an exclusion based intellectual property rights so far seem to be coexisting and supporting uh disclosure providing incentives to to innovate and uh driving as cumulative technological advance lesson number five is the product market and the role of rewards to innovators in the health area there's just an intrinsically High willingness to pay there's a lot of money on the table a lot of it can be captured by new products uh the institutions of this Marketplace I think are very important to the extent that they allow an innovator to capture a significant share of the social value associated with their invention new drugs are really expensive that means that the innovator is is capturing a lot of the the social value at least until follow-on competitor molecules arrival they lose Market exclusivity and the generics start to start to eat their lunch now that ability to capture value is driven principally by strong and workable intellectual property unlike these areas where IP seems to be controversial and difficult you know for a very long time patents have been ordering in you know property rights in this area that's historically broad consensus on the rules and norms for what can you patent you know what are the processes and standards how do you enforce them and stuff forth this IP system operates in parallel with very stringent regulation about who's allowed to sell drugs the FDA stands you know between commercial operators in the marketplace we have the hatch Waxman act and similar infrastructure around this which which operates in parallel and creates a combination of push and pull uh incentives for innovators to to keep moving forward my last lesson here is to pull together some of these sources to think about the value of diversity experimentation and adaptation I mentioned the plethora of new ways of organizing activity new entities like biotechnology companies and University technology licensing offices that sprung up that also needs to be seen in context with this willingness I think of the established players who dominated the industry in the 1970s and 1980s rather than resist or ignore these changes they've adapted accommodated and developed a fruitful way of coexisting so life science is commercialized that a large in the context of you know flexible Cooperative relationships across a wide variety of institutions and I think it's been the the emergence of a of an industry culture and government and you know in some a light touch from the government in terms of regulating activity which has allowed these entities to sort out amongst themselves and to organize themselves and to develop the ability to to interact uh which has been such a powerful force so to conclude you know the life sciences are special they're uniquely close to science you know they're a unique kind of product Market but I think there are some general lessons that we draw from thinking about this sector one is you know to focus on the cumulative process of technical change which it builds up on multiple Technologies and multiple sources and you know cancer wasn't cured by Nixon within you know the hope for three to five years by coming up with a Magic Bullet in fact it takes three to five decades to make substantive process substantive progress we do think however that looking at this sector points us to you know the value of sustained and stable public investment in early stage general purpose platform type Technologies and and secondly you know to to appreciate the value of and to support and encourage diversity experimentation and competition thank you [Music] thank you one question such a masterful presentation is that there are no questions
