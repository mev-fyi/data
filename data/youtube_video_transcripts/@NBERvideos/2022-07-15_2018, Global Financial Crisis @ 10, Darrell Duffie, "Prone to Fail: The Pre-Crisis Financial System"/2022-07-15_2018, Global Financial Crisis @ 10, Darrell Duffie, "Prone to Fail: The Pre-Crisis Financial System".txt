main points that I want to make today are related to my view that the core of the financial system was prone to failure coming from any kind of major Financial shock it didn't need to be a housing market shock the system was set up to fail not on purpose of course and I want to explain why I think that's the case so let me just give you my first Factor it happens to be in the poll that anneal and others at the University of Chicago have set up of around 40 U.S and 40 European economists I'm one of the U.S not actually Canadian economists that were pulled the first of 12 factors that were listed in importance as uh relevant to or creating the conditions for the financial crisis was quote flawed financial sector regulation and supervision uh and I sincerely believe that that um that was the primary cause of the system being set up to fail and I'm going to focus especially on supervision I actually think there were probably enough regulations on the books to keep the core of the financial system in a safe place but The Regulators didn't do that and I want to try to get out to the at least not all the way to the bottom of that because there are several hypotheses that I'll contemplate but I want to get as far as I can down into that so let's just start with the conditions in the core of the financial system and I'm going to be focusing mainly on the big Banks this is a big Bank story and the markets that connected the big Banks the big inner Bank markets for short-term credit for derivatives and so on okay so the the banks on which I'm going to focus are the nine big ones and before the crisis they were split into two groups that were called they were called investment banks that was Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Lehman Merrill Lynch and bear Stearns and before the crisis the other Banks were known as commercial Banks uh Citibank Bank of America uh JP Morgan and Wells Fargo now Wells Fargo's not going to figure prominently in this story because they were not as active in the kinds of markets that I'm focusing on but collectively you can see the leverage of these banks on this screen and the in the investment Banks stand out they're in the blue line at the top for the extreme levels of Leverage that they had now gross Leverage is not everything we're going to get to risk in a little while but this should already have been a warning sign that there was a lot of risk in the core of the financial system and don't let the scale fool you the other Banks so-called commercial Banks were also extremely highly leveraged you just don't see that their leverage has come down by almost a third since uh the beginning since pre-crisis and by the way these so-called commercial Banks I'm referring to the bank holding companies for three of these Banks the bank holding companies included enormous broker dealers and those are JPMorgan City and bank and Bank of America so a lot of Leverage but very low pre-crisis credit spreads that is this is the one-year Libor ois which is basically a measure of what creditors were asking above risk-free rates for giving credit to these Banks and pre-crisis it was on the order of 10-ish basis points now if you think about the amount of Leverage and if you knew about what wholesale markets knew at that time about the risks inside these Banks you might be surprised that these Banks were getting credit even at one year at 10 ish basis points and at five years at between 20 and 30 basis points those are razor thin credit spreads note not only did the credit spreads jump up post crisis but after the banks became much better capitalized they never came back down to pre-crisis levels and I'm going to make the case that this is associated with the belief of creditors pre-crisis that the banks wouldn't fail or at least they wouldn't be forced to take a loss if they did because the banks were too big to fail uh this is this total size of the assets of these nine Banks and have split out the investment banks in red of course three of them disappeared entirely or into the other Banks after the crisis but you can see the red assets are growing really fast even compared to the blue which are also going very rapidly pre-crisis so this the story the moral of the story here is if you give the banks extremely cheap credit it's like subsidizing gas to down to five cents a gallon if if the gas is really cheap you're going to drive a lot if credit is really treat cheap you're going to build enormous balance sheets this is the flowchart to failure and this is basically the story of the paper let's start in the bottom center suppose creditors believe in bailouts or if you pick up Andre's story suppose at least they don't believe that there's going to be a significant problem then Market discipline will fail because as I mentioned the banks will get credit incredibly cheap and they will build up enormous balance sheets they will become prone to fail now there's a safety check or there's supposed to be one which is that Regulators are supposed to be supervising these Banks but if Regulators supervise weekly which I claim that they did then that also sets up vulnerability of the biggest banks to failure and again coming from many different kinds of major shocks this is not to say that the housing crisis wouldn't have caused a recession or some major problems like the.com Bubble Burst but that the core of the financial system didn't need to collapse to the extent that it caused the economy to Crater like it did that is that the losses that occurred in the financial crisis were much bigger than they needed to be and that the failure of these largest banks as Ben bernanke's paper coming out into Brookings in September will document the failure of the largest banks generated extremely large losses in the real economy so in Andre and Nicola's words what were they thinking actually appropriated that title for this slide from chapter two of their book which is excellent and I listed at the top of the list what Andre just described in the first session which is a rationally low belief in disaster scenarios and that's already been well covered I want to turn to some other not mutually exclusive possible explanations for allowing the financial system to be set up for a failure and one of them was the point made by uh Steve Haber my Stanford colleague and Charlie calamaris which is that the system was quote Fragile by Design now that doesn't mean that they tried to make it fragile it means in the in their words and I'll quote Financial crises occur when banking systems are made vulnerable by Construction as the result of political choices so it's a political economy story that in the United States as opposed to other countries like Canada Australia and some of the others that didn't have such a major banking crisis in the United States political choices overwhelmed the structure of the regulatory system and the decisions by regulators third possible explanation this Reliance on Market discipline that I Illustrated in the flow chart to failure and I'm going to give you a quote from a speech by Alan Greenspan in 1997 about the ex that will signal the extent of Reliance on Market discipline that was rampant in my view in the regulatory Community before the crisis as early as 1997 when he said quote as we move into a new century Market stabilizing private regulatory forces should gradually displace many cumbersome seemingly ineffective government structures and he went on that that is and that sounds very greenspan-like uh and I'm going to pick up this story of Market discipline and the failure of Market discipline towards the end but I want to move on the next possible hypothesis is it was just too difficult within reason for Regulators to detect the problems that Andre described this morning and that I'm going to be describing today after all of the many Financial experts in his room I don't know of any and I'll include myself there that we're waving their arms saying uh it's in plain the facts are in plain sight we're we're heading for a financial crisis Regulators do your job and we had plenty of incentives at least as scientists to uncover the facts and we didn't so maybe we were subject to the failure that Andre pointed out this morning to put proper weight on disaster outcomes or maybe it was just too difficult Lehman Lehman's repo 105 was an example of the banks hiding their financial conditions last one which I want to focus a fair bit of time on is the failure and this is consistent with the calamaris Haber hypothesis the failure of the legislatures to assign to The Regulators a clearer Financial stability mandate and Don Cohn in a 2000 and 14 I think essay for Brookings suggested that every regulator on the U.S financial stability oversight Council should be explicitly assigned a financial stability mandate I want to focus specifically most specifically on the Securities and Exchange Commission because they were the ones that were supposedly overseeing those five large investment Banks pre-crisis here is a chart showing on the left for each Bank this is Merrell uh sorry Morgan Stanley Lehman very Stearns Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs this is happens to be 2005 but this is typical of pre-crisis on the left the actual net capital which is a calculation that these Banks had and on the right in the solid red color is the sec's required net capital now that seems pretty low relative to their actual Capital it is on average According to some research by Kai gizica and Michael ulruga the the red Bars were on average in the pre-crisis year across this panel to Banks about 12 percent of the actual capital in other words these Banks were essentially running unconstrained with respect to their leverage now there is this pink uh overlay above the red this is the early warning Zone if a bank enters into the pink it's required to report to the SEC that it's entered into the early warning Zone the why these are remarkably small numbers if you look at the required net capital there are basically a billion dollars or much less why so little because the philosophy of the SEC at that time was not so much to prudentially supervise for the failure of these financial institutions rather it was to protect the customers of these financial institutions from losses associated with their customer relationships I'm going to give you an example quote Michael Halloran who was the senior advisor to the chairman of the SEC in 2007 first quarter this is his testimony to the financial crisis inquiry Commission uh said that he asked the head of the division of trading and markets of the SEC this is the division of the SEC charged with supervising these five institutions he asked why can't we make them reduce risk and according to Halloran the reply he got was quote the sec's job is not to tell the banks how to run their companies but how to protect their customers assets I reviewed a law article by gdenas that showed a 545 pre-crisis enforcement actions by the SEC only one was somewhat related to Capital or liquidity of these institutions now what where does this focus on protecting investors come from well I'm drawn to think that this goes back to the Great Depression when the pakora commission uncovered enormous abuses of investors coming out of the stock market crash and uh in a political in a in a storm of political outrage the pakora commission led to setting up the SEC whose primary role was basically to protect investors another this in my view this Mission continues to give you a more recent example the Madoff Scandal which was an investor protection problem uh generated An Inspector General report at the SEC voluminous 457-page report uh the failures of the SEC to supervise these five banks leading into the crisis generated a 27 page report with a rather I would say stingy grumpy response from the head of the division of trading and markets now in the remaining uh time that I have I want to turn to the markets that connected these financial institutions and how they were also prone to failure and I'm going to focus first on repo markets the reason I'm going to do that is that in the United States there is extremely heavy dependence on bond markets for running our financial system the top black line in this chart shows the fraction of credit provided to the U.S economy not by Banks but rather through Capital markets and that includes Bonds securitizations commercial paper and so on and you can see that a collection of other uh currency zones or economies require substantially less China is growing from zero rapidly towards the median so the U.S depends very heavily on Capital markets and those five investment Banks and the broker-dealer subs of the large commercial Banks basically intermediated that entire system both derivatives and securities financing and trading um and I am going to uh disagree with Andre on the on the uh uh the importance of uh short run debt I do think that uh Doug Diamond's claim that Private Financial crises are everywhere and always due to problems of short-term debt does play a significant role here the question is what kinds of markets uh for short-term debt are important and I'm going to focus on repo the vertical axis on this chart is the amount of daily financing provided to um the largest banks these are the primary dealers uh pre-crisis the blue line is overnight and continuing which means the money can be pulled on one day's notice and you can the acts the scale is kind of scary it goes up to three trillion dollars and the blue line is growing a lot faster than term repo which is longer term this enormous buildup of overnight credit um was flowing through um a rickety I'll put it that way um set event Market infrastructure which I want to explain this will take a couple of minutes so be patient there's a lot of Plumbing in this diagram but it might be worth it let's start in the green the large green dot in the middle is the money market mutual funds who supplied a lot of not all but a lot of the overnight financing to the major dealers and those major dealers on financed through to the rest of the economy uh the the money market funds were getting that cash from large cash pools and to some extent from retail investors who had Alternatives which were to go to the banks or to go to the Securities markets directly when the major dealers got into trouble the money market funds could pull the money and even if the money market funds managers didn't pull the money their cash pool investors could pull the money and that's exactly what happened when Lehman failed within a week 300 billion dollars of financing had disappeared from the prime money market funds which was going directly into the major dealers even worse intraday that financing was offloaded to two systemically important Banks JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon which carried that financing over two trillion dollars in trade and my paper I document what might have happened had one of those two clearing Banks been destabilized from the failure of a major dealer intraday had it not been for the very Swift and Nimble action of the fed and the treasury to provide enormous amounts of emergency lending and for the treasury to guarantee the money market funds these are events that we don't like to see and which are difficult to arrange now the financial crisis as deep as it was would have been much much deeper now I want to turn to the other major Market on which I'm going to focus this morning which is the OTC derivatives Market this slide shows the size of the market not in notional because you've seen the hundreds and hundreds of trillions of notional and you kind of wonder what that means this is actual market value in dollars uh of these positions growing exponentially pre-crisis to about 30 trillion so well again what were they thinking well in 1998 brooksley born commissioner of the cftc suggested that this Market ought to be regulated this was back when the market was of a manageable size and there was pushback Alan Greenspan uh Robert Rubin and Arthur Levitt the heads of the other three main relevant regulatory bodies said no we don't want to do that and they proposed what they called Brooker dealer light record dealer light meant no margin requirements no Central clearing requirements no reporting requirements and at the time there was there were pretty there was pretty light Capital requirements on the derivatives market so it's not surprising its sort notice that these gross Market values come down post-crisis this is with the imposition of Dodd-Frank and Basel heavy requirements on this Market the fears that Greenspan Reuben and Levitt had that regulation would Stamp Out the vibrancy and activity in this market is not Justified although the gross Market values came down the market activity kept going up the reason the gross Market values came down is that the banks were a lot more careful about loading up unnecessary derivatives on their balance sheets they use Central clearing and compression trading to reduce the amount of balance sheet they needed to run the market at greater and greater levels of activity so the market survived in my last few minutes I want to come back to Market discipline thanks Jim this is a chart from some work I'm doing now it's very preliminary with Auntie bernt and e-chao Jew who are at the Australian National University showing the degree of solvency of these nine institutions uh starting in 2002 and coming up to early this year and the the scale is the following tangible common Equity divided by an estimate of the standard deviation of change in market value of the assets within one year that's a mouthful but it basically means how many standard deviations you are from failure Okay so pre-crisis pretty close to failure post-crisis way far from failure and yet in our study we show that credit spreads have gone up not down safer Banks but higher credit spreads so what's the story here this chart shows the credit spread at five years of one of these nine Banks based based on a fixed distance to default same kind of metric I just gave you which happens to be two standard deviations from default pre-crisis that fixed quality bank had a credit spread at five years of about 50 basis points post crisis around 150 basis points what happened well in my view it it is not the failure of imagination of investors to believe that the banks could approach insolvency rather it's their loss of faith that they're going to get bailed out both the failure of Lehman and post-crisis regulations Dodd-Frank and in Europe the bank recovery and resolution directives stipulate that these banks will fail that is they will not be bailed out and that the creditors the wholesale creditors will take losses now whether you believe that the Regulators can pull this off where I actually would even be willing to hit the button all it doesn't matter what matters is that creditors believe that they could take a loss if they do they will no longer Supply razor-thin credit spread cheap debt to these Banks and Market discipline will have a chance at least to work the numbers seem to Bear out that we are we have one of the elements in the flowchart to failure stopped and that is there is some element of Market discipline that's been reimposed on the market that's not enough the other key pillar of of financial stability is that The Regulators are given and accept a mandate for financial stability and um I think um well I'm not at all concerned about the FED based on their post-crisis self-examination their commitment is very high I'm not so sure about some of the other regulators
