all right uh so definitely during covet 19 this is joint work with the susan cherry he was a phd student at stanford erica jiang at usc gregor martin was at northwestern and atomic viscosity colombia so what do we do in this paper the motivation is pretty straightforward there's been not ongoing debate about various stimulus measures taken after the covet 19. most of this debate has been on pvp stimulus checks unemployment support but concurrently there was a significant amount of consumer debt relief that was passed uh in great recession we know that the nature and extent of this debt relief was significantly related to the recovery for example in work with my co-author tomik piskowski we looked at debt relief and what kind of effect it had on recovery related to out of sales growth house price changes and so on and what we find is that areas more exposed to debt relief had a significantly better faster outcomes for example here related to auto sales growth so what do we sort of want to do here we want to look at the setting related to cares act where a significant amount of debt relief was passed uh in the entire us the focus here is going to be on debt forbearance actions which is postponing loan payments we want to study them because like i said it's quite related to how recovery ultimately happens in these big events like the great recession uh what we are going to be sort of interested in this paper is uh to simply quantify the overall level of forbearance uh we want to understand the target uh who benefits from this both in terms of individuals and regions we want to understand what the role of government mandates is as far as these prevalence actions are concerned because forbidden doesn't only happen with the government it also happens in the private sector this was a very simple debt relief program relative to the programs that were passed in the great recession but yet there is a role for intermediary so we want to understand that why is that the case and then we want to conclude with some broader implications for debt relief policies as we come out of this forbearance actions that we have seen so just to give you a preview of what we're going to find here we're going to find that there's massive forbearance actions that have happened and at the same time there is a massive forbearance overhang that is right now dragging the economy so we are talking about 2 trillion dollars of loans which are under foreign action this amounts to about 60 million u.s consumers 70 billion dollars of debt payments as estimated as end of quarter first quarter of 2021 are under forbearance we think that this could have significantly dampened the household debt distress channel which was operated for example in the great recession and uh many have argued led to the great recession uh getting amplified but we find that the rates are highest in regions with highest covet rates and with greatest economic decline which tells us that the target of the program hit the target uh we also find that the private sector provided substantial forbearance about a quarter of the total forbearance or outside government mandates it's a simple program yet intermediary factors seem to matter so just to give you a sense relative to great recession as the cases and the crisis amplified in the u.s uh there was a substantial quick policy response the cares act had in its uh mandate uh a substantial number of actions in the household sector just want to contrast this with the great recession where also there was debt relief passed in the household sector but it took almost a year year and a half before these debt relief programs were ultimately passed this was a substantially quick response as can be seen with the cases and where kerzak came in so what did the cares act have it had these things which we'll study related to forbearance measures so these forbidden measures affected different parts of the consumer debt market the government-backed mortgages which is two-thirds of the mortgage markets were clearly affected here the idea is that the borrowers need to request forbearance there was also forbearance in the student loan market here it was automatic every loan was automatically placed in forbearance and then the mandates did not affect other parts of the consumer debt market like auto and revolving debt and the important thing for us is that loan forbearance is not reported as delinquent in the credit bureau reports which we'll be relying on so what's the setting setting is as should be clear related the crisis and the cares act we are going to be looking at debt forbearance actions in the 14 trillion dollar u.s consumer market uh this covers mortgages student auto debt and revolving loans uh the data is equifax data that we'll be relying on it's represented random sample so we have roughly 20 million consumers that will be tracking we have 300 credit outcomes the consumers are randomized based on their social security number so we can aggregate very quickly by multiplying by a factor we are also going to be looking at regional economic conditions using zillow data bls census opportunity tracker using the opportunity inside team uh the equifax data in particular is going to be very useful because we are going to be able to track the forbidden action on each loan and what is interesting is whatever we find from equifax data actually matches what the services directly report which we are able to verify in the paper so what's the first headline result that i want to show you the headline result is that if you look at in this picture uh how the unemployment rate has moved and how the delinquency rate has moved there has been a substantial one-on-one movement in terms of how delinquency spikes when unemployment rates spike except the recent pandemic which is shown around the dotted line the unemployment rate spiked tremendously but delinquency rates didn't and the answer where these delinquencies disappeared is in the right picture which plots the forbearance so right at that time forbearance spiked and that's basically the first red line first headline result that we have that there's a large increase in forbidden state relative to great recession and we think it can account for the low delinquency rate that you see despite recurrent unemployment and why is this important because it could have significantly dampened the household debt distress channel so one can do this in a more sophisticated manner where one tries to predict what the delinquencies would have been based on an estimated model which relies on unemployment individual characteristics house price changes and so on and we sort of do that in the left picture here the lowest line is what the actual delinquency rates are and the other lines are just telling you what the predicted delinquency rates would be based on an estimated model with different kinds of robustness and done and what you find is delinquency rates would have been much higher given whatever the trends were based on estimated model and what does this sort of reflect well it reflects that most of these delinquencies have gone in forbearance uh where the forbearance rate is broader on the right hand side so this was just looking at mortgages which is the largest part of the consumer debt market but this sort of pattern of forbearance increasing is true in student debt market is true in auto debt market is true in revolving debt market all around the cares act now student the levels might be different for example in the student that we are seeing that almost the entire market under for parents because that's the nature of how the mandates were passed whereas in auto debt and revolving door that the levels are different i'll get back to this variation across debt types very briefly if you look across the regions there is huge amount of heterogeneity but what is very clear is if you look at mortgages auto debt and revolving debt there is huge dispersion in the country with the darker red significant more more fair bearings but in student debt it's spread equally roughly because it's automatic like i mentioned earlier now in terms of some headline statistics that you should sort of take away there are a couple the first if you look at a majority of borrowers in forbearance about 70 in forbearance actually have missed payments but 30 do not miss payments so what that means is even though they take forbearance they actually keep making payments so it's almost like a credit line for them in terms of what's the largest relief debt category not surprisingly mortgages and auto debt which is where most of the debt is if you look at the aggregation what you find is that about 70 billion dollars estimated at the end of 401 2021 in different categories is under forbearance this is about 60 million consumers by any metric this is significant amount of debt relief uh even relative to the other kovid 19 stabilization programs if you sort of compare them next what we want to sort of do is to look at both the intensive and the extensive margin where was the take-up and conditional on take-up what was forbearance like so what we do first is stratify the distribution based on income which is on the left and on the credit score which is on the right and ask where is the forbearance take up more and not surprisingly what you find is less credit worthy and lower income folks get forbearance at a higher rate and you see similar patterns this is for mortgages but you see similar patterns for other debt types except student debt which like i have mentioned is automatic so it doesn't really depend on anything of these things i said that this is not surprising there is a little bit of a surprising element here in the sense that this seems pretty well targeted relative to some other programs for instance uh you can also ask that condition on forbearance where is the intensive margin here and you do the same sort of exercise stratifying on income on the left and credit score on the right and what you find is in contrast to what i showed you earlier conditional on take up higher income borrowers get much larger dollar of four billions per individual this is not surprising because it reflects higher loan balances and when you sort of quantify this what you find is about 64 of financial relief due to forbearance is going to higher income individuals so to summarize in terms of targeting borrowers based on their higher financial vulnerability and creditworthiness got a lot of forbearance but in terms of dollars borrowers with higher pre-pandemic income received a significant relief now i want to contrast this with the different kind of programs that happen for example stimulus checks now stimulus checks just target based on income this is a more refined program if you will so if you plot it regionally on the y-axis where is the dollar per in the adult in terms of stimulus money and on the x-axis the same thing with forbearance what you find is that forbearance is going in different regions relative to stimulus not surprisingly because stimulus only targets income and i just showed you that even higher income individuals got forbearance debt relief now is that the only variation that's not it originally we can sort of see that forbearance tends to go in most vulnerable parts of the population with respect to the pandemic there is enough research which shows that minority and black were affected more by the pandemic and in fact we find that forbearance tends to be larger in regions where the share of minorities and percentage black for instance is larger this is the same sort of picture that i showed you before we can also stratify this based on infection rate unemployment claims and percentage at risk industries again regionally and you again find that the forbearance tends to be larger in regions where code 19 has had a more of a adverse effect at this stage then we want to move to the second part of the paper which is looking at forbearance and trying to understand what's the interaction between government and private mandates government mandates and private forbearance that has happened first what we find is that there's a substantial amount of private forbearance about a quarter and what we then want to do is to try and understand using data what is the relationship between the two and what we are going to do is to try and exploit variation across debt types why because some debts some types of debt do get forbearance others don't and we are also going to exploit variation within that type because within the mortgage sector for example some parts of the loans get forbearance through government mandates others don't and what does that tell us about this so the first is me repeating the same picture that i showed you before but this time highlighting that mortgages and student debt who got forbearance worker under the government mandate but auto and revolving debt weren't and what this sort of tells you is that the private sector was also responding around the same time in terms of offering forbearance can we say more about this and we can what we then do is try to exploit within the mortgage sector this idea that part of the loans are eligible for government mandates in terms of forbearance and part are not so what is the idea on the left what i have plotted is the mortgage market and the vertical line tells you conforming non-conforming split the left side is conforming that's under the government mandate right side of the vertical line is jumbo loans which are not on the government market so before covid what's been plotted is forbearance rates and they're pretty similar after covert what do you see you see a substantial increase in forbearance in the entire market which is consistent with what i showed you before but if you look at the eligible and illegible regions eligible with government mandates and eligible what you see is that the government part of the segment has seized more forbearance than the private segment so this is something that shows up whether you do this visually or in regressions that the government side the conforming side of the market sees more forbearance you can also do this in the more classic different setting and you see similar effects quantitatively what you find is that there is a higher forebearing state on loans with government mandates about 25 higher but the private sector also is providing a substantial amount of mandates uh the advantage of a definitive setting is you can account for changes in distribution of borrowers and regional characteristics and so on the last part of the paper then tries to understand what is happening in terms of how the forbearance is being imparted and here i want to sort of focus on the importance of intermediaries for two reasons number one during great recession a lot of debt relief programs have passed they were complex programs related to the program that was just sort of passed related to uh in the cares act because they had verification npv tests and so on and the intermediary spec specific factors have been shown to significantly affect implementation of this relief so the question then is we have a very simple debt relief program there's no verification borrowers just need to request so do these intermediary factors still matter the second reason to sort of worry about this is that the intermediation market has seen a substantial change in the last decade with a lot of shadow banking also becoming dominant both in terms of originating loans and servicing the loans which is trying to figure out whether the loans are going to be making payments or not and that might play a role and indeed that's what we find here is just two cuts of the data to give you a sense on the left is forbearance rates of banks versus shadow banks and what it shows you is that banks offer forbearance at much larger higher rates than shadow banks and on the right is telling you if you look at in-house versus outposts outsource servicing there is a substantial difference too what that tells you is that if a bank originates a loan and also services they are more likely to do forbearance than if they sell the loan to someone in terms of the servicing rights those services don't tend to do as much forbearance so intermediary factors still matter and in ways that we might expect you could do it more formally which is asking the intermediary fixed effects matter for covariance rates in the paper we sort of argue that they do in terms of the usual tests one visual picture that i'll show you is that not only do they matter but there seems to be some sort of persistence in terms of what kind of actions intermediaries take so here is a picture where on the x-axis is pre-pandemic forbearance lender fixed effect and on the y-axis is post-pandemic forbidden cylinder fixed effect where the lender fixed effects is trying to just explain the forbearance rate on loans before and after the pandemic accounting for a bunch of covariates and what you see is there is a substantial amount of correlation here both in terms of banks and shadow banks which then tells you again that intermediary fixed effects are important and in a very persistent manner all right so let me just summarize then what i have shown you i've shown you that the financial institutions provided a huge amount of debt relief to consumers about six numbers and that you should keep in mind is 60 million consumers 70 billion dollars of payments not all consumers get forbearance and stock making payments about a third of those who get forbearance use it as a credit line not using it there is a pretty good targeting that the program did in terms of intensive and extensive margin we think that in absence of forbearance we would have seen about a 2 million increase in mortgage defaults which probably tells you why relative to great recession we have seen a stock uh departure in terms of household debt distress channel not uh showing up uh private actions rather than uh just government mandates also account for a substantial portion of the debt relief and one can ask why was there such an extensive response especially on the private side what has changed in the great recession there are two possibilities one is that maybe the private sector internalized some of the lessons from the great recession but we think more likely it's probably because the nature of the crisis everybody thought is temporary an exogenous aggregate shock which then tells you that renegotiation of the kind that we are seeing is reasonable to do there is a lesson that comes out here already for debt relief policies if you look at mortgage mandates borrowers need to request forbearance what does that result in only 10 of the eligible borrowers got relief but at the same time the self-selection is such that it seems to be going to less creditworthy and financially vulnerable borrowers contrast that with student mandates where borrowers automatically all of them got forbearance and that doesn't seem to result in a targeted debt relief program so allowing a choice of whether to request debt relief seems to be a reasonable way of thinking about targeted policy having said that there are friction still that uh uh hampered deadly programs like intermediate factors that we need to understand better the last concluding comment that i have is that we have a lot of forbearance for overhang like i said about 60 billion of forbearance that we need to worry about if you think about what are we talking about we are talking about on average about 1800 for mortgage borrowers this is a substantial part of a borrower's income for some borrowers low in the lower income part of the distribution we're talking about 80 of their monthly income so how should we unwind this uh there are different ways in which one or we may want to unwind this if it is structured as one time payment that could result in a significant household distress because you're talking about six thousand seven thousand dollars of accumulated payments for some borrowers as of the end of quarter one of twenty one or you may want to spread it over time so if you amortize it given the schedule that we see in the data what you would find is about 50 in terms of principal balance would be needed to be adjusted to take this into account having said that i mean this these are calculations that the government can do too but this is something that will require a coordinated effort because this is a problem that is not going away in the short run so thank you very much you
