okay so welcome back everybody to our policy panel on the uh future of global value chains um as you all know one of the distinctive features of globalization in recent decades has been the emergence of these Global value chains and the fragmentation of production across National borders and as trade economists we typically point to three sets of sources that have driven that emergence of gbcs and namely multilateral regional trade policy integration uh technological innovations such as a computer the satellite phone and the internet that have reduced the cost of International Communication and then of course thirdly uh geopolitical and institutional changes such as domestic reform in China uh the fall of the Iron Curtain and the emergence of India into Global markets the recent Resurgence of protection in the United States and elsewhere recent supply chain disruptions in the aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic and the Russia Ukraine war and of course raising geopolitical tensions between China and the United States as you all know have led to a renewed debate about the resiliency of Supply chains and the future of global value chains for example to what extent are we going to see a declobalization of the world economy in coming decades or will it more take the form of a stabilization of slowing down of a global integration will we start to see a diversification of sourcing strategies of increased onshoring reshoring or in the words of Janet Yellen friend Shoring to what extent are the decisions of firms efficient uh to what extent are the potential room for policy interventions uh what will be the impact of the industrial policies that a number of countries now appearing to be pursuing more with more attention and what will be the implications of the inflation reduction act here in the United States and the recent export controls that the United States has introduced relating to the semiconductors industry so we have an absolutely Stellar distinguished panel to address these and many other related issues including Renee Bowen the director of the center for Commerce and diplomacy the UCSD School of global policy and strategy Chad Bowen the Reginald Jones senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics and Ralph osser the Foundation professor of Economics at the University of Zurich and chief Economist of the World Trade Organization as you know as the MBR we're a non-partisan institution that doesn't make policy recommendations but there's sort of plenty of room for us to talk about the economics underlying these Trends and the potential effects of different policies that are adopted around the world each of our panelists is going to aim to talk for around 15 minutes before we then open things up for Q a and general discussion and we're going to proceed in alphabetical order by by last name starting with Renee before turning to Chad before turning to Ralph so I'm sure like me you're all really excited to hear what our panelists have to say on these issues and so handing the floor over now to you Renee thanks Steve for that really warm welcome and really excited to be here I'm going to caveat this with I'm a micro theorist so I'm probably the least qualified to be on this panel um but what I'm going to do is talk a lot about something I know a little about and talk a little about something I know a lot about uh so this is semiconductor Supply chains a political economy perspective what's great is once you've had one talk about Supply chains your supply chain expert so um here we go uh okay so it is a political economy perspective so I want to talk first a little bit about the economics um so we've all heard about Supply chains we've all heard about subiconductor Supply chains so I'm going to think about this as if I'm teaching mbas where you probably know loads more than I do but I'm going to give you just enough of a flavor to appreciate the political economy so the first thing is looking at the top five semiconductor producing countries and then we're going to unpack what we mean by semiconductor producing countries so here we see the United States as the largest semiconductor producing country by far 46 market share and you're probably scratching your heads and you're saying well what about tsmc in Taiwan isn't that what all the fuss is about here you're seeing that Taiwan only has eight percent of the market share China has seven percent of the market share so really what is all the fuss about so here's what all the fuss is about uh we have to break down semiconductor production into its little bits and there are lots and lots and lots of little bits it is a hugely complicated thing to produce and one thing that I'd like to impress upon this group is there's so much research to be done just purely based on how complicated it is to produce semiconductors so uh this is a teeny tiny graphic that doesn't actually capture everything but it does capture some some big points that are uh are important for the political economy so number one is design so design takes almost no infrastructure this is completely IP and there are lots of companies that all they do is produce IP Qualcomm is one example um so you see here from this diagram that design software goes into this intellectual property goes into this so when we're talking about the United States there's a huge semiconductor Manufacturing Company a lot of it is just in design when we talk about education for Semiconductor Manufacturing in the United States a lot of this is designed when we talk about engineers in the United States that are doing semiconductor research a lot of it is designed computer science which is not about electrical engineering which is something I'll come back to in a bit so the second part is fabrication right so actually producing these things in the United States as you well know we don't actually produce a whole lot of these things this is where Taiwan comes in and uh to some extent China and I'll get to that in just a second but here's where the materials come in the chemicals come in so we talk about these uh Rare Earth minerals this is where it all comes in and speaking of rare earth minerals we do a lot of rare earth minerals come from they come from Africa right so when we're talking about this Global semiconductor supply chain we're pulling in almost every single continent and we're pulling in tons of countries what about assembly and testing assembly and testing again this is a this is another part of the production process that can happen somewhere else it can happen in China it can happen in other developing countries and that's something that can be moved around and it's a little bit uh less uh uh low-tech okay so um now I want to talk about fabulous uh semiconductor companies what do I mean by fabulous semiconductor companies so let me just back up one second at some point in time in the 1980s and earlier all of this was done in-house by companies such as Intel and at some point uh this fellow came along his name is Mars Chang he's originally from China but then moved to Taiwan uh and in 1949 he was an undergrad at Harvard uh and that's when he moved to the United States uh from there he went on to MIT really good school I happened to know that for a fact um and that was in 1952 he did a master's degree he entered a PhD program and for all you PhD students who might be out there apparently he failed his qualifying exams twice so from there he had he went on to quite a a good career in um not in Academia um and eventually he ended up at Texas Instruments uh in 1958 and spent a very uh long time at Texas Instruments climbed the corporate ladder uh and eventually said he'd had enough wanted to return to Taiwan on returning to Taiwan the Taiwanese government topped him to be part of itri so itri is the Taiwanese uh might be called the Taiwanese NSF if you would so this is where they want to do all their research and develop their domestic technology Industries so this is 1987. now Mars Chang looks at what's going on in Taiwan and at the time Taiwan was producing small manufacturers but they were sort of uh just the widget guys all right so someone else was designing these manufacturers they were putting it together exporting it but they were doing a really good job and Morris Chang said well why don't we do this for Semiconductor manufacturing the Taiwanese wanted to produce semiconductors but there was no way that they could get into the semiconductor industry because of the high barriers uh to entry so indeed the Taiwanese government put in lots of funding into starting tsmc there was also private funding some of it from the United States to start tsmc and before we know it tsmc is growing Leaps and Bounds as a Foundry Company so this is not a semiconductor manufacturing company they simply carved out the most expensive part of the production process and decided to do just that and many of these integrated companies decided to follow suit and simply use The Foundry process from tsmc meanwhile doing all their design in-house so as we have here tsmc created the semiconductor dedicated IC Foundry business model it was an entirely different business model it came with a lot of support from the Taiwanese government and to this day gets quite quite some support from the Taiwanese government much of it in kind so uh what about today top five Foundry companies today so we can see number one tsmc 55 market share number two Samsung that's in South Korea 17 market share USMC is Taiwanese 16 Global foundries in the United States seven percent smic in China's four percent so if we're looking at foundries the United States has seven percent market share of foundries in 2021. that's minuscule so for the United States to actually become a major semi uh semiconductor producing uh country you see we've got a long way to go in terms of actual foundries so what about fabulous semiconductor companies so fabla simply means they've taken all of the manufacturing out of their production process all they're doing is producing VIP the technology and one of the biggest manufacturers will release the biggest manufacturer here is Qualcomm in the United States so what are the other large manufacturers broadcom also in the United States Nvidia in the United States mediatek is from Taiwan amd's in the United States so now you understand where that large market share from the United States comes from in semiconductor uh manufacturing this is all fabulous this has nothing to do with Manufacturing so what is it that the US government would like to do the U.S government would like to as far as I understand bring semiconductor manufacturing back into the United States but you see that we've gone a long way to go and number one is understanding this process Okay so we've already talked about how complicated the production process itself is the next question we have to ask is where is unit where's the United States actually missing uh uh parts of this production process so I should warn you that as a theorist I don't do data I do pictures so you're going to see lots of pictures pull from lots of places um and this one is pulled from supporting the future of us-based semiconductor manufacturing uh from SUNY and that's going to be important coming out coming up SUNY State University of New York and this was a 2022 report that they had put together so uh the thing they wanted to highlight in this report is that there's a lot to do to bridge the gap in the United States doing great on research and development and some parts of the United States doing really well on commercialization the end product but what we're missing in the middle number one is strong Workforce so all this time that tsmc and all these other uh countries are building up manufacturing capabilities for semiconductors we were reducing uh manufacturing capabilities but at the same time reducing the workforce capable of working in these uh semi semiconductor manufacturing facilities and uh the joke I like to tell is if you talk to anyone uh in semiconductor manufacturing the one thing they say that they're missing plumbers so uh so Workforce Development this has become a really important part of the semiconductor picture so everyone knows about the chips and science Act of 2022 uh maybe you don't know that the overall number is actually 278 billion a lot of people have focused on the 39 billion that was the first tranche that's being funded and that's being funded largely through the Commerce department so what you can see is that a lot of the rest of the 278 billion is really for stem and r d That's the big chunk in the middle a lot of it also goes into defense uh but for now we're going to drill down on this 39 million a good chunk of that also is for Workforce Development so this comes from the semiconductor industry Association of the United States and it breaks down a little bit how much is available from what pools of resources for Works Workforce Development so there's direct Workforce funding but that's about 200 million over five years there's indirect Workforce funding this is 13 billion uh uh in r d funding support stem education Workforce and skills training etc etc and you can see in that top right uh quadrant there's something called nstc so as part of the the chips act they authorize the creation of a national science Technology Council and this is intended to be a huge National Science and Technology Council that helps to inform uh the manufacturing capacity or capabilities of the semiconductor industry and then there are other things that are a little bit smaller pools um so a call goes out October 22 2022 and now we're getting a little bit to the political economy a call goes out from the Commerce department or a request for information about these semiconductor institutes these nstcs uh Etc and I've pulled here four of these proposals that were done in response bearing in mind October 2022 this call goes out now um let me uh just look at focus on some dates here February 2022 was one of the earlier proposals comes actually before October 2022 accelerating semiconductor research in in the United States so that was a a group called Asic an Asic uh uh consisted of a lot of Silicon Valley type organizations uh academics companies etc etc right uh the second one is called semi semi uh involves the Arizona crew um uh and I'm be I'm being very flip here apologies um and then there's the new California Coalition they put together something in October 2022 and then there's the SUNY Coalition and they put something together in September 2021. see how far ahead these guys are this proposal this request comes out in October 2022. as far as I know they've had over 300 responses but if you are responding uh or if you begin your response in October 2022 well you're already way behind the ball so um just to kind of wrap up again this is the political economy part of it so in December 2022 tsmc announced that in addition to Arizona's first Fab so tsmc already invested in one Fab uh they have started uh construction on a second Fab in Arizona why Arizona I wonder why um is this a political economy audience here yes um and that is scheduled to begin production in 2026. at the same time Applied Materials uh said it plans to spend about 4 billion on a research center in the heart of Silicon Valley remember I was talking about those nstcs so these are these are the uh the large r d facilities that uh the chips Act is supposed to fund so Applied Materials is hoping that they can get a piece of that pie by investing in Silicon Valley this four billion dollars so what do they intend to do they intend to host about 25 billion of research work over its first decade pulling together staff from research universities chip makers such as Intel tsmc and Samsung interesting so one of the things I wanted to leave you with is there has been a lot of misperception as well about the geopolitics of what's going on in the semiconductor industry assertions that in the United States uh there's actually a competition between the United States and say Taiwan or semiconductor product but as we can see tsmc the main Taiwanese company is actually coordinating quite a bit with U.S companies um now this makes a lot of sense if you've heard this term before the Silicon Shield the Silicon Shield effectively says because semiconductor production is so important to most countries the fact that the uh the fact that the Chinese government is sort of an ever-present threat for Taiwan uh the Silicon production in Taiwan makes them feel product protected should anyone ever attack Taiwan uh for then the semiconductor production I've heard it called the you know uh catastrophic event I think they're they're more you know dramatic terms but effectively almost all production in the world would come to a halt so this is a silken Shield that Taiwan is depending on and since Taiwan is depending on the Silicon Shield of course it needs to incorporate with its allies so the founder of tsmc says tsmc Asia's most valuable listed companies refer to in Taiwan as the sacred Mountain protecting the country because of its economic importance um now going back to globalization as Stephen pointed out uh tsmc's founder says globalization is taking a back seat to priorities such as National Security and technological leadership and that's the direction I think we're heading and without explicitly looking at National Security in our models in our research I think we're going to be missing a lot of the boat in terms of how we understand trade now the last thing I'll end with here uh is that there's a little bit more than talk on this Corporation so U.S Taiwan uh just uh announced an initiative on 21st century trade and that was signed June 1 2023 and what's the intention to strengthen and deepen the economic and trade relationship between the United States and Taiwan so I'll leave with that hopefully that's just a flavor of things that we can get the conversation started thanks oh thank you okay um so Renee is amazing and um I aspire to be a micro theorist um so you're stuck next with a podcast host so if it gets bad to worse I'm you know anyway so um I'm going to talk also about the future of global value chains uh but through the lens of industrial policy and in particular what I'm going to do here is I'm going to stick electric vehicles in a Caliendo in Peril model okay so if you thought the last presentation that we gave was strange uh just wait no I'm kidding there'll be no quantitative models here uh but this is about the inflation reduction act and Industrial policy so I may need to click on the phone there we go okay what are we trying to do here right so what's the underlying uh externality that we're trying to get at and obviously it's climate change right and so the big concern is that the United States um in terms of our Paris commitments you have to remember president Trump pull the United States out of the the Paris agreement um the Biden Administration comes in and is committed to tackling climate change again so where do our emissions come from well about 40 or so comes from transportation it's a big chunk of what we what we throw out into the into the atmosphere and of that nearly 60 is personal vehicles things that you or I drive around um so then another 25 is commercial trucks fans things like that and the concern was that for our the things that we can control people right we just weren't switching to electric vehicles quickly enough so by the end of 2021 it was only less than five percent of new vehicles entering the market each year coming coming onto the roads were electric and we're trailing China which was already 16 at that point in time Europe 18 uh and even Korea right so there's just a lot for us in the United States to do it's not so there's this guy out there named Elon Musk he doesn't get out all that much you might not have heard of him um they have a company called Tesla so you might think well there's this amazing Tesla uh brand out there and so maybe what the United States is doing is just exporting these amazing Teslas to the world and that would explain why we're not taking them up here right prices go up and you know that could explain it no right so this is export data and this is 12 month or yeah I think it's 12 month trailing sums I have put together here uh in value terms that's the top and in volume terms so number of vehicles on the bottom here and you can see the in value terms it's the Europeans right they produce a lot of fancy high-end expensive electric vehicles but in volume terms this is now China right but the United States is is really lagging in exports as well so that's not the story either so to kind of summarize where we are on electric vehicles heading in to you know say the Biden Administration we're not taking them up enough and part of that is you know we live in a giant country here in the United States Americans like to drive big vehicles they like to drive them long distances and so there's this range anxiety concern that I'm going to be stuck somewhere and not be able to recharge my electric vehicle uh quickly enough to be able to to get me there and some of that's technological some of that's we need to build the infrastructure as well these charging stations to support it but that's one underlying concern second is there's going to be a massive transition in the industry right we know that uh that the the internal combustion engine vehicle industry traditionally in the United States is a massive employer there's just lots of jobs final assembly engines Transmissions estimates are made there may be 30 fewer parts right so a lot fewer jobs those jobs are in politically sensitive areas of the country and and Gordon has done work on on some of this to kind of show what the implications of the green transition is going to be for jobs and so you know we're still dealing with politically the legacy of the china shop here in the United States we know there's going to be dislocation for workers transitioning out of the ice industry as well so think maybe another China shock sort of magnitude there and then finally when it comes to actually making these things the critical inputs that go into them so we're talking about the batteries especially you've got critical minerals and yes some of them are mined in Africa Cobalt um but they're virtually all processed at least if not mined also in China and so it's you know 80 90 percent of these uh whether it's the critical minerals lithium Cobalt nickel those kinds of things or the components the anodes the cathodes in the in the batteries are flowing through China at some point and China on the export restriction side has a as a tradition of liking to use Market power when it has it and using export restrictions for commercial purposes but we're also potentially heading into a new world with geopolitical conflicts where you might say well we don't want to be you know coming off of Russia Ukraine and what we've seen with the weaponization of energy supplies there maybe you're worried about National Security vulnerabilities so that's sort of where we where we were and then basically almost a year ago at this time uh we ended up with this surprise piece of legislation in the United States the surprise announcement between uh Senator Joe manchin of West Virginia right West Virginia coal producing state and and Chuck Schumer the Senate Majority Leader surprise there's this thing called the inflation reduction act which has nothing to do with inflation or reducing it by the way uh but it has a lot to do with climate right there's other stuff in there as well but there's a lot of stuff in there in China I'm going to focus only on electric vehicles and the thing to learn first is there's a special provision in there for consumer tax credits for electric vehicles called section 30d these are the ones that you or I would know normally get access to seventy five hundred dollars if we buy an electric vehicle you wouldn't get that if you buy a you know an ice vehicle right so there we're kind of targeting the externality trying to convince consumers to switch fine there's also a price cap in there uh so it can't be for super expensive models trying to convince you know the automaker and an income caps I can't be too rich to access these kinds of things there's a household or an individual income income limit there the idea broadly was to convince the automakers to to Really tackle climate they need to produce attractive models for the masses right enough of the high-end Teslas enough of the Porsche fancy things buy stuff that average Americans would would find attractive and buy to really build out get us from five percent to whatever 30 40 Etc okay so that on its face okay consumer tax credits but the United States turned this into an industrial policy by essentially saying in order for you to receive an American Consumer to receive the tax credit it only qualifies for vehicles assembled in North America now turns out this was actually better than the initial version of the sorry better I'm not allowed to say that it was um I had a wider geography than the initial version of the of the legislation which was the United States only this includes Canada Mexico sort of recognizing the North American supply chain for automobiles but it's very much a local content restriction and is sort of antithetical to the wto's rules and the subsidies agreement about prohibited subsidies and these kinds of things but the United States did it building onto that even if the vehicle is assembled in North America over the next couple of years the batteries have to come from a restricted set of places so they can either be recycled in in in in in in North America um Or the critical minerals uh they essentially have to come out of the over the next couple years they can't be coming from China anymore if you want to get access to this tax credit and they can either be from the United States or from a Free Trade Agreement partner small F small T small a we'll come back to that in a second and similarly for the components have to be from the United States all right so that's sort of they're designing this industrial policy to achieve those objectives that I've put up before local content just to kind of get at jobs the sourcing for the batteries to kind of move the supply chain out of China because they're worried about National Security okay uh and this is just to kind of summarize all the criteria that have to be met right so as we're studying you've seen a number of papers on Industrial policy uh over the last couple of years it's really the the the details really really matter about this stuff and so here are the details okay August of 2022 not everybody's happened about this sorry no that was there was no check there so yeah I'm going to extend that chart or that table in a minute okay first reaction the South Korean government gets upset right there now and again this is a country that is arguably protected militarily from the United States so it's not obvious for to understand why they would get upset uh denouncing the the National Assembly um resolutions they see betrayal they threaten the fire economic advisors can you imagine the horror of such a thing now this is also the second part of the headline was there was also apparently a theme park default so maybe that was the that anyway you could see how serious this was so this is the end of August I'm not really I'm on vacation I'm not paying all that much attention I get back to my my office in Washington and trying to figure out what's going on well the Betrayal story is essentially President Biden and his his first state visit outside of Europe had been to South Korea kind of a big achievement for the South Koreans and one of the things that he had done when he was there was had a very public meeting with the CEO of Hyundai and at that very public meeting an event the Hyundai CEO announces that they're going to be doing extra more investments in the United States for electric vehicles right so imagine doing this announcement in in you know in in Detroit or something saying GM coming forward and saying uh we're about to do 10 billion dollars of investment in China yeah um but you know when the president United States is standing right there it's kind of a big thing the the uh so this is sort of all of a sudden this local content requirement meant that the vehicles that were being still assembled by South Korean firms in Korea would no longer have access to the U.S tax credit and they were promising they would build electric vehicle facilities in the United States but it takes like semiconductors takes three or four or five years for these things to come online it wasn't gonna be ready until 2025 they were hoping to have access to the old tax credits to kind of tie them over and that was sort of what they were expecting and so the inflation reduction act caught them by surprise and they thought that this was betrayal right so what happens uh South Korean trade Minister meets with very extremely very very very important academic to complain about the inflation reduction Act foreign so this is true that is the South Korean trade Minister now in real life he also happens to be a law professor at Seoul national university and a personal friend and we've been you know working on things together for for years um but he's now currently the trade Minister but he literally did get in touch with me and said Chad I'm coming to Washington I have I have to tell you about what's happening so he shows up and he tells me about essentially people are rioting on the streets of Seoul about the inflation production act right in the National assemblies told him he's got to come and fix this and I'm like I just got back from fake what is this inflation production act what are you talking about anyway so they're complaining and they're very serious I wanted the second picture is the next day when he the U.S trade representative after a meeting they're basically going to have now he said weekly meetings about this issue but I want to make the point where he's wearing the same tie in both pictures so that's that's the link between the two okay so but the US government doesn't really do much about it right it takes really the Europeans to start complaining which they do over the course of the next couple of months for Action to have happen so in the initial this uh December president French president macron shows up uh baguette in hand if you look at the the the photo closely uh this is this is the financial times it's not my opinion uh complaining and essentially in a joint statement during the state versus with President Biden President Biden says oops you know the law was not written very precisely uh some senator who who was writing about it didn't even know that we didn't have a free trade agreement with uh our economic allies in NATO and Europe and probably South Korea too so we'll do something about it so what did they do about it so to imp they have to implement this law in terms of writing the actual regulations to to make it work to put it into practice right and so that's the Biden administration's job they're in charge during this process and so because it's part of the tax law this is treasury right and so uh Brett Neiman's not here but I presume right Brent is now a treasury this is this is his job no I'm kidding but there's lots of people Trevor whose job it is but he's part of the administration at this point so one of the things that they do is they say well actually if you look at the details of this law all of those restrictions that color had pointed out and there's something on business there those are for that section 30 do you think there's just completely other track of uh the inflation production act called section 45w it's normally for commercial vehicles so tractor trailers delivery Vans things like that um we're going to consider a vehicle that you or I would get access to so like a car that could also qualify uh as as qualifying as a commercial vehicle if it released okay um hey it's creative now why is that interesting and important because if you look at the the X's none of those controversial criteria about has to be assembled in North America has to satisfy a price cap can't be too expensive only only you know no high income people can buy it the battery's got to be sourced out none of that stuff applies for that other track right so that's the first thing they do second thing they do is they say free trade agreement it's not defined anywhere in the law we'll Define it ourselves in that over the course of the next couple of months is what they've what they've been doing okay so that's so the question is okay what what is the impact on that so far so if the inflation reduction act had had really bite right really had bite we would expect it on August 16th when this local content requirement went into effect immediately and made South Korea so mad in Europe so mad that imports from those places would have dropped off them dropped off the map immediately right so does that happen when we actually look at the data and the answer is no right so Imports of electric vehicles into the United States from both from the EU and from Korea continue to grow and do you see well that's puzzling why well arguably the December to January period is because there were no models eligible from anybody right so Imports really weren't discriminated against when there were no models that were eligible part of that was there was a in the old consumer tax credits there was a there was a there was a cap of 250 000 units per make so Tesla had already used up their 250 000 and they didn't relax that cap until starting January 1st the upshot was there were very few models eligible this Imports were discriminated against but starting January 1st effectively there's an additional explanation which is leasing right so the question is did leasing change so here's the benefit of actually being uh a podcast host um I'd read in New York Times this Edmonds company a Kelly Blue Book you know if you know anything about cars there are these private companies out there that collect data on various things and Edmonds has had this leasing data so I got in touch with them and said I host a podcast do you have somebody there that can speak to your leasing data please and they put me in touch with the right person and I had her come on the podcast and talk about it and then I said oh and you know what else I'd like to do I like to make charts can you actually send me that data so she sent me the data and this is basically what it looks like and you know it's kind of the amazing story so this was you know end of December you know December of 2022 so right before the announcement goes into effect fewer than 10 percent of new electric vehicles entering the U.S market were being leased but by March it was already over a third right so the car companies kind of figured it out very very quickly um that this was that this is an option for them to kind of work around the constraints and then subsequently I've learned that this data is actually in Bloomberg um so I've actually got access to it uh and I can put it together now so this is there's a dip and diff there sort of uh it's electric vehicles from Europe uh relative to ice vehicles from Europe there's some weird things happening in the leasing Market because of the pandemic we can talk about if you want so you can actually see the the European uh electric vehicle kind of recovery happens before the announcement but you can understand for the Koreans why they were so worried right two percent of of you know Hyundai's electric vehicles were being leased prior to this announcement they were like this is not going to help us but they figured it out pretty quickly and now it's over you know 40 for them as well okay so that's that um but again you know this is there's no price cap there's no income cap uh you're not if the goal was to National Security concerns incentivize the companies to move their supply chains out of China this takes that away right so this sort of undermines some of the other goals that were in this industrial policy in the first place which is just to say maybe this isn't the end of the word on this and maybe Congress revisits it at some point and also the jobs in local assembly parties this weekend as well all right lastly on tariffs um normally we think tariffs are trivial who cares about tariffs well for electric vehicles uh in in terms of a differential discriminatory tariffs they kind of matter so remember I I showed you that China was a major exporter they're not a major exporter into the U.S market why is that well because the United States it does have only a two and a half percent mfn tariff but the Tariff facing cars coming in from China is now 27.5 and that's because of the trade War right that was one of the first things the Trump Administration put tariffs on we weren't importing EVS from China at that point in fact it was just the opposite we were exporting a lot of EVS to China at that point uh but there's a really big tariff barrier to prevent that from coming in whereas the Europeans a major complainer about the U.S policy here they have a 10 tariff on on EVS they have massive discrimination in terms of offering preferences to other key competitors from the US side trying to export to the European Market South Korea uh it already has zero in effect Japan is is being reduced through their FTA and we still face 10 so this is the the European Imports of electric vehicles we used to we the United States used to export a lot of Teslas to Europe um then what happened in the trade War the Trump Administration put tariffs on Parts China retaliated with tariffs on finished Vehicles Tesla said it's too and that wasn't just Tesla other car companies that's too expensive for us to export from the United States to China we're going to move production elsewhere Tesla accelerated the production of their gigafactory in Shanghai now essentially uh if you're importing Teslas into Europe you're buying them from not the us anymore but China right so that's interesting future of Supply chains um France presses the EU to threaten trade war against China small print but Paris is seen as pushing a probe that could result in Chinese electric vehicles facing tariffs right so anyway old school trade policy May ultimately come into play when it comes to Green Green Energy Products and electric vehicles and even in addition to Industrial policy so the future of global value chains which is the question that I was poll to answer I have no idea all right thank you very much for um inviting me on this panel it's great to be back here with uh with my old friends and gives me the opportunity to get something uh off my chest um so I I I'll uh I'll take the Liberty to speak a little bit more broadly about the future of globalization but I promise and I'll also say something about global value chains um but I have resisted the urge to call this presentation uh wake up my friends your house is on fire but this is really the main message that I want to convey so I make four simple points and the first point is that we're really at a crucial moment in the history of globalization uh so globalization is really in quite a substantial uh crisis and uh you know the way I think about the globalization crisis I think about it in three uh different uh layers so so the first layer is I asked myself well what has happened to The Narrative The Narrative about trade The Narrative about globalization and I really think this narrative has changed quite fundamentally so it used to be uh there was this Vision that was guiding you know policy making trade policy making around the world that was uh uh kind of emphasizing that what we really need for peace and prosperity is we need economic interdependence and this Vision has you know as we heard also in the previous presentations very very quickly in the last few years changed to kind of an alternative perspective which suggests that what we really need is economic independence and if it's economic interdependence then please only among friends so that's the first layer I think the narrative is really changed quite fundamentally the second layer is you know ask myself what has this change in the in the narrative about globalization what has it done to trade policy what has it done to tariffs and I think there are not just tariffs you know trade policy more generally and I think there we also see quite some significant changes that you know I think we're all aware of them you know the elephant in the room is of course the you know the trade tensions between the United States and uh and China these uh you know tariffs some of them at least have been in place for five years now we think of it as if this was kind of the the most normal thing in the world I still remember when I presented my paper on trade Wars and trade talks for the first time and it's not that long ago you know people would say oh you know this is a really interesting exercise in economic history but we're not going to have uh we're not going to have trade logs again and if we have trade boss tariffs they're never going to be that high and you know now it doesn't even make headlines anymore that we have very high tariffs in place but it's not just the tariffs you know we have the export restrictions that you know we heard about before we have um I think a Revival of industrial policy you know sometimes with protectionist Tendencies so uh you know there's a lot of kind of change already happening in uh in in trade policy and then the third layer of the globalization crisis is well what has this change in trade policy done to outcomes you know what has it done to trade false and you know for a long time you know at least we at the WTO um argued that you know I'll kind of saw on the data well not that much so we used to say you know there's all this talk about de-globalization you know but really you don't see it in the in the data but Chad you know had the had the foresight and kind of saw where things were going um and you know really you do start to see signs of uh of of it in the data and uh you know first you see signs of a global value chains are responding so you see um you know activity moving out of China into places like uh like Vietnam into places like Thailand and into places like South Korea um but you also see things like if you look at the share of value added in in cost production on total trade if you if let me say this uh rephrases so if you think about the share of intermediate Goods trade and and total trade it's been pretty uh constant and 50 for for many years but now if you look at it in the last few quarters it's been coming down so you really see kind of First Signs I think of a of gvc's responding and you also see first signs of geo-economic uh fragmentation so for example and and Chad has you know shown this to all of us you see you know changes in the composition of of Chinese Imports into the United States uh you know that kind of correspond to the tariffs that are in place kind of as you would expect you see changes in inputs and import shares you know into the U.S moving out of China and into other countries and so on and and you also see so so one thing that we've done recently is we've kind of divided the world into two um hypothetical blocks on East and uh West according to a U.N voting patterns so don't take this too seriously but just to get a sense and and what you're beginning to see is that uh you know intra block trade is going faster than entire block trades so you see some signs of geo-economic uh fragmentation and you know what this kind of all kind of combines to for me is that we're really at a at a at a crucial time in the in the history of globalization where really um uh on on our way I would say to change the course of globalization but we haven't quite done it yet so I think it's really um an important time to um to act now you know why is this all happening you know my interpretation is it's not that people don't understand that there's economic and some trade I think more fundamentally people think that trade is really part of the problem to the most pressing uh challenges of our time or certainly not part of the solution and you know what are the most pressing problems I would say well first is to maintain peace and security and with the security also means supply chain security so resilience it's to achieve a sustainable economy and it's also to reduce uh poverty and inequality and you know if you think about Supply chains again you know the whole experience of the pandemic but then also the war in Ukraine now people have kind of taken this as examples of how you know uh globalization exposes them to excessive risks because we had supply chain disruptions and the conclusion are the the conclusion that has been been drawn from this is what we need is we need you know French orang de-risking home showing and so on so that's the first point um the second point I want to make is that we're also at a crucial Moment In The History of the World Trade Organization and you know as I as I just mentioned we see this uh rise and protectionist tendencies and that's of course you know not good news for an organization uh that uh you know that that that that uh you know that whose existence is about internalizing uh trade policy externalities but I think there's an even more fundamental problem and I think this more fundamental problem has something to do with the credibility um of WTO um roles because you know as we know from you know nuno's work for example The credibility of wolves is of course absolutely key because if we have an increase in trade policy uncertainty if uh you know proms households don't believe anymore that the tariffs that have been agreed upon are also going to stay in place you know that alone without any change in tariffs's point of uh very important effects on uh on trade volumes and and it is my sense that governments are increasingly driven by other policy uh priorities uh particularly the ones I mentioned before to you know maintain peace and economic security to achieve a sustainable economy to reduce poverty and and inequality you can think about jobs for example as you know we we heard before and and sometimes I would say perhaps pursue these policies without much regard for you know the the the rewards of the of the wtl and and what this means is that the wall Space Trading System I think is at risk of the collateral damage of Shifting uh policy priorities um because at the end of the day you know if if uh if uh you know people get the impression uh that you know countries are not playing by the walls and of course this raises trade policy I'm uncertainty now the third point I want to make is that uh you know this kind of matters so so a lot of at stake um you know for two reasons and the first reason is that trade is actually part of the solution you know I was and and I think this audience I probably don't have to um you know uh do too much to to convince of this but uh um but but if you think about global value chains uh again you know I think it's it's pretty clear and I think we all know this that the trade in fact not only has been very resilient itself if you look at the at the past crisis but but has also been a huge source of resilience uh during the past crisis I mean you think about the pandemic you know there I think it's most obvious of course initially there's you know there's been some supply chain disruptions but then very quickly you know we all needed to work from home uh what did we you know why could we do this because we could you know order the consumer doables uh and and get them you know shipped to us we could get the personal protective equipment from from China when you know uh we were on lockdown but they weren't anymore we got vaccines that were um you know ultimately that were produced in global value chains uh you know causing you know multiple countries and so on um so and and so I think it's pretty clear that the contrary to kind of uh uh conventional wisdom um trade really was an important part of the solution and now saying you know we we don't want to trade anymore um I think would be um would be a big problem and and I can talk about this for hours but I don't think you know I need to convince you it's the same for you know uh you know achieving a sustainable economy it's the same for reducing poverty and inequality I don't think we'll be able to achieve these uh objectives without embracing International Trade so that's why trade is important but I also think the WTO is still very important and this is you know perhaps something I need to spend a little bit uh more time on convincing you off because there's kind of a sense out there that the who doesn't matter anymore that the WTO is kind of irrelevant you know it's not working and some making any progress and in some sense you know if we don't play by the rules you know who cares and you know I think this is something where I I have to say I've really learned a lot over the last uh six months being at the WTO um and and the first point is that you know the the WTO still continues to be uh the corner store the Cornerstone of global trade so one interesting statistic You know despite all the trade tensions despite all the extraordinary tariffs 75 of World Trade is still conducted under mfn tears of the WTO 75 you know so the vast majority of international trade is still conducted under WTO on walls and second so so this speaks for um you know this clause for us I think not reversing what is uh already in place at the WTO but then there's also the sense that there's no progress at the WTO and that's also just not true I mean first of all if you look at the multilateral negotiations you know we concluded a trade facilitation agreement just last year an agreement uh curbing uh subsidies to to fishing so Fisheries subsidies and yes you know it's maybe not the great achievement that we all hope for during the Doha round but I think these are very significant achievements in multilateral trading negotiations but then the other thing you know I used to you know you know when you go to kind of policy discussions you know people always say well what does the WTO need the WTO really needs more plural lateral negotiations so more negotiations that don't involve our members because getting 164 countries to agree is really difficult well now I come to the WTO and I see that's happening yeah it's not something I mean it's it's good that people call for it but it's it's already ongoing you know there are a plural lateral agreement was concluded on Services domestic regulation that's basically um trade facilitation for services just last week a large number of members agreed on a text on investment facilitation for development again you know something like trade facilitation but for investment there's a plural associations ongoing for e-commerce for example so there's lots of lots of stuff happening it's not that you know sometimes people say the WTO is nothing uh nothing but a building in Geneva um but I can tell you it's not true there's a lot of things going on and I think a lot of progress are being made and then also if you just look at the day-to-day work I mean this is maybe not the most exciting stuff but you know that's the TBT committee for example where countries um you know have to notify regulations that they put in place product standards that are put in place other countries can you know voice trade concerns can say you know this is problematic uh for us and in these committees I think a lot of potential conflicts get diffused so a lot of us is at stake because I think what uh you know we are about to um kind of um um tackle or what we are perhaps about to lose I think is really important which leads me to what I wanted to get off my chest um which is uh where are we and where are you as as academics because really what I what I want to kind of drive home is the point that there's really a kind of historic crisis unfolding in our field of study um and and and I would like us and and you uh also to feel kind of some urgency I think to think about that uh crisis and and kind of participate in preventing it perhaps or or or or or kind of um solving and perhaps to some extent and and I think there's a there's a great opportunity in a way because uh you know one thing that somewhat to my surprise I will confess I've learned at the WTO is that research really does matter so policy makers you know do read these studies they do read papers you know when we put out a report they they want to hear it they discuss it they take it seriously so I do think if uh you know we we put out kind of relevant studies I think you know that really has the potential to to to have an impact on uh policy discussions so that's the opportunity but I think there's also a bit of a risk for our profession here because if you know there's kind of a globalization crisis uh ongoing and and you know the the firefighters if you will uh don't don't you know pay attention uh you know I think that's uh that that's also not great it's a little bit like you know the macro economists not having seen the global financial crisis or not not understanding why inflation is so high or or something like this and uh you know this this sounds a little bit uh negative uh and and and and you know of course I'm trying to be a little bit provocative here I mean I know that you know many people do very important work and and in fact you know it's kind of wounded a little bit by putting some very relevant papers on the uh on the program uh uh today um already and you know throughout this conference uh so I don't want to say that you know there's no kind of uh you know work ongoing of course that speaks to this crisis but I cannot help but feel that the sense of urgency that I feel in in Geneva is quite different than the sense of urgency that I feel here you know it's not that uh and and I would just like to encourage you and also encourage us to um kind of pay attention to this uh crisis that is unfolding and perhaps uh do something about it thanks
