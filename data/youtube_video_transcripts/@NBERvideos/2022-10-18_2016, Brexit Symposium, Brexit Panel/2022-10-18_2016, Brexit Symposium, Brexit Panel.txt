thank you all for for coming I guess as long as we have uh crises in the world we'll have uh packed uh ballrooms uh people eager to talk about them um we we do have an excellent uh panel of four speakers so uh I want to start off by introducing them going proceeding from my right Richard Baldwin is Professor of international economics at The Graduate Institute in Geneva he's uh editor-in-chief of Vox EU dot org and as of what last week he is uh president of the cepr in London uh next to him Thomas Sampson is Professor in economics at the London School of Economics he is one of the co-authors of a prominent I think the most prominent series of studies uh in Britain of the likely effects of uh brexit on the economy via trade uh investment maybe something on uh immigration next to him is Helen Ray professor of Economics at the London business school she's a member of the commission that advises the French Minister of Finance and she is a winner of uh amazingly large number of prestigious academic prizes and last is uh uh Anil kashyap the Edward Eagle Brown professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business uh many many claims to fame among the member of the the Squam Lake group and the belong group as Jim indicated we're going to start off with an initial round of comments from each of the participants I've asked them to try to limit them at that to seven minutes and I've uh to cut down on overlap I've I've assigned them specific aspects of this many faceted uh topic then we'll have a a second round where they can comment on each other that part is uh all on the record when that is done we'll go to uh off the Record question and answer discussion the um I I I'll tell you what I get what I've assigned them one by one I've asked uh Richard Baldwin to speak first and to focus on uh what this says in the longer term perspective of uh European integration thank you Jeff brexit it's complicated as Jim said and and that's the first thing you got to say about it and and maybe the only thing you really got to say about it um if you have watched British politics in the last few weeks it's unpredictable European politics is equally unpredictable but let me look at that complexity a little bit I mean the reason it's complex is because to understand what happened and what will happen get you into a jumble of UK politics and EU politics all tangled up with misinformation and wishful thinking and we could spend all day talking about all the different things that who all that but I'm going to focus on the misthinking and the wishful thinking in my uh seven minutes now let me just start with the Miss thinking and I'm going to focus on trade and trade policy I I would invite you to think about there being really two types of trade 20th century trade and 21st century trade now 20th century trade is the type that you all know you learned about in University and most of you probably teach your students about it it means Goods Crossing Borders stuff is made in one country and it's sold in another country and that's what trade is now trade policy when trade is that is quite simple basically all you have to do is get the Border barriers down tariffs and quotas and you're good to go if your companies have access to their Market without border barriers you have free trade if they have access to yours you have overall free trade trade policy is very simple 21st century trade is significantly more complicated sometime in the late 1980s the ICT Revolution made it possible to organize really complex activities at greater distances and many companies especially in manufacturing took advantage of this by fragmenting the production process and putting them across borders so 21st century trade is not just Goods Crossing Borders it's factories Crossing Borders and that changed things significantly because the flows of goods Services information Capital training the flows that used to happen inside a firm inside one country inside a factory to keep things smoothly going that's now part of international Commerce this International production networks made International complex Commerce much more complex and much more entangled because all these flows are pushed together so don't think about trading Goods is different than trading Services investment intellectual property those are part and parcel of the whole thing now what it means what I I'm coming back to brexit is this is exactly what the single Market is about in Europe in fact you really shouldn't even think about the single Market as a trade agreement you should think about it as a set of rules that allows this International production Network to thrive and that's relevant because that's why the UK's relationship with the EU is so important not because of a few tariffs but because the UK is part of factory Europe and since they want to be a favorable have a favorable position they have to be in the single Market which assures that these flows of goods Services people information all that stuff flows seamlessly not just from Britain to them but from them to Britain in other words it underpins Factory Asia now fortunately Britain has a prime minister uh at least will in about four hours who is not one of the ones misthinking uh trade the the campaign was filled with people who just simply wanted to talk about tariffs and whatnot and uh but now we know since yesterday that they're going to have a prime minister who really understands that the UK has to be in the single Market now this brings me to The Wishful Thinking part now my view the only real way that the UK can assure uh and this isn't thinking alone people like uh Thomas and many other people have said this but the the only real option for the UK to have single Market access is to join the European economic area agreement or something very like it which is often called the Norway option so there are a set of little countries around the EU who did not want to join but did want to be inside the single market and that's what they created this thing for so the UK can get that Now The Wishful Thinking part is that she thinks she can cherry pick the single Market in particular she likes the single market for almost everything except the free mobility of Labor in the single Market the Four Freedoms which are part and parcel they are not separable free movement of goods Services capital and people and what she would like is the first three but not the last three but not the last one now in my mind that is not possible whatsoever and people like prime minister may think that the UK has sufficient bargaining that they can get a better deal than Norway but that is really looking in the wrong place the problem is this is not going to be a negotiation between the EU over here and the UK over here what it's first going to be a negotiation among 27 countries Each of which has a veto and when they're done they're going to talk to the UK so the problem is that there was three million more people Brits who voted to leave than to remain and the 27 EU leaders are not going to allow those 3 million voters to threaten a single Market that serves 500 million people and covers a fifth of world production so the UK will very soon find out that this is a take it or leave it package as they go forward now uh really that's two reasons there for why it's take or leave and first of all they want to maintain the cohesion of the single Market just a practical matter if somebody started on picking it like the Brits each of the 27 countries would like to take it except one little thing and the single Market would very soon become 28 single markets and therefore uh I was hoping you're going to like that one anyway I worked on that one a long time but the second thing is that a lot of the sitting national leaders are afraid of their own anti-eu Fringe and they think that if they create a halfway house this will incite The anti-eu Fringe to be uh Bolder than they were otherwise so for both reasons I think prime minister May will very soon find out that is to take it or leave a deal and at that point she will have to decide who she's going to disappoint in my 49 seconds I would like to just mention that the EU has the UK has two other trade policy headaches first of all the UK's WTO membership is entangled with that of the EU in ways we can talk about if if you're interested in it and there are Third Country trade deals with over a hundred countries that the EU that the UK will have to figure out how to redo those things but I'll leave that for uh discussion just stop right there perfect thank you our second speaker is Thomas Sampson who's going to talk about what brexit means for trade and foreign direct investment and foreign so I'm going to focus on the long-run consequently long-run consequences of brexit and particularly on thinking about what it means for the UK economy so broadly speaking there have been kind of three methodologies that people have adopted when trying to address this question of what brexit is going to mean for the UK so I'd like to say kind of a few words about each method and give you an overview of what people have found so the first approach that has been used is kind of backward looking and it asks what happened to the UK after it joined the European economic Community as it was then in 1973 right so between 1973 and the eve of the financial crisis in 2007 the UK's GDP per capita increased relative to kind of countries like France Germany or the the us so that was a period in which the UK economy performed reasonably well and the uh you know the more sophisticated version of that observation there's a paper by campus courageely and Moretti who use a synthetic counterfactual approach to look at what were the consequences of joining the EU for the UK they find that 10 years after accession the UK's GDP per capita was 8.6 higher than it otherwise would have been so they're finding that you know quite a big positive effect now obviously even if we accept that estimate at face value there's you know good reasons to think that the effects of joining the EU and of leaving might not be symmetric so the second approach people have take is a more forward-looking approach asking if we start from where the economy is now and then we look at the brexit shock what would that mean so this is a question that has mainly been addressed using uh quantitative cge trade models we've done a lot of work on this area at lse using a a version of the Eaton and Quantum trade model and when you come to you know model brexit within this framework what brexit means is a shock to trade costs so the key question is what exactly would brexit mean for trade costs and you know for the reasons Richard has already alluded to there's a lot of uncertainty there but so what people have done is to consider you know various different Alternatives representing the kind of different possible scenarios for the post-brexit relations between the UK and the EU so there's you know one one alternative is the Norway option the UK remains part of the European economic area and part of the single Market in that case there would be no tariff barriers between the UK and the EU but there would be some increase in non-tariff barriers the UK in that case will be leaving the EU Customs Union so it would be subject to things like anti-dumping duties and also to rules of origin on its trade with the rest of the EU so when we simulate that case we find a decline in the UK GDP per capita of 1.3 percent okay and in some ways that is the the best case scenario in terms of minimizing the Lost output following brexit a more costly scenario would be if the UK and the EU traded Under World Trade Organization rules then you're talking about also introducing mfn tariffs on UK EU trade as well as much bigger increase in non-tariff barriers coming from a loss of access to the single market for services trade but also regulatory Divergence over time between the UK and the EU so in that case our estimates suggest a 2.6 percent decline in GDP per capita in the UK so double the cost of the Norway option another policy that has been discussed quite a lot within the UK is what happens if following brexit the UK decides to unilaterally remove all its import tariffs on trade with the entire world so if you layer this on top of the WTO scenario it does mitigate the Lost output slightly but the effect is relatively small it drops to a 2.3 percent decline in GDP per capita and the reason why that effect is is so small is exactly what you might expect tariffs are already very low around three percent on on average so there isn't a lot to be gained or you know there just aren't big effects of changes in the tariffs and it really is all about the non-tariff barriers and the more complicated what Rachel has called 21st century aspects of international trade so that that's that's the second approach and that's kind of what's coming out of these quantitative trade models third approach that's been used is more of a kind of reduced form empirical approach and it has two steps First Step use the kind of gravity model specification of your choice to estimate how EU membership has affected the UK's or how EU membership affects trade so if you identify that off changes in in membership at the EU it's telling us that the UK's trade with other EU countries is about one quarter higher than it otherwise would have been and it doesn't suggest there's any significant evidence of trade diversion right so half roughly half the UK's Traders with the EU so if we increase half of that trade by a quarter total UK trade is going up by an eighth and if you now combine that number with your preferred estimate of the elasticity of tre of income to trade and we use James fire as work which suggests an elasticity between a half and three quarters that's going to tell us that UK GDP per capita is going to decline by between 6.3 and nine and a half percent in the long run following brexit right so this this third approach kind of however you do it comes up with much bigger costs than a coming out of the quantitative trade models now that could be due to errors in the estimation that's obviously a possibility but I think there are you know there's a couple of good reasons why we might expect this reduced form approach to produce a bigger number um it's picking up potentially any effects of trade on productivity and it's also probably picking up effects of of closer integration on investment which which are not in the the quantitative models so those are the kind of three approaches that have been taken um obviously there is no nice historical precedent we can study for brexit so each of these approaches has you know severe limitations and there's ample scope for criticizing them but if I can just stress kind of two bottom lines that is coming out of all the work that's been done in this area firstly you know they're every credible bit of work on the economic consequence of brexit is saying that it will decrease GDP per capita in the UK and secondly the size of that effect varies dramatically depending on our future relations with the EU and the you know what package of deals the UK and the EU now agree is really going to be crucial for how big an effect this turns out to be so just to finish off then I wanted to kind of highlight two things that are missing I think from the existing work and areas that haven't been taken into account one is the UK's trade policy as regards the rest of the world could the UK outside the EU be in a better position to get in a new deal with America or with China or with India I'm skeptical that the UK will be in a better position for that but it's one route that could offset some of the economic costs second issue um export platform investment is really important in the UK and the reason for that is because we have access to the eu's single Market that's not well integrated into these estimates I've been talking about but it's likely to be you know potentially very important uh particularly for financial services and I think Anil is going to talk about this a bit more more later but that's an area where we don't really understand very well how big the effects might be so I'll leave it there thank you third is Helen Ray I've asked her to talk about what brexit means for macroeconomics both in the UK and in Europe and in Europe so I'm going to start by talking about the effect on the UK economy and I am going to distinguish between the short run and and the long run short run so I think there are two main shocks first an uncertainty shock large one and the second one is a financial Market shock so let me start with the uncertainty shock so we study political risk but now we leave it in the UK after the 23rd of June it became so clear that the people who were leading the brexit campaign had actually no plan and we have once after the other we have we have dropped out Johnson dropped out go without lit sumiz out as of two days ago and now we have Theresa May as the new prime minister soon in coming and as was pointed out was Richard she has a position which so far is inconsistent with the EU position in terms of negotiation she wants single Market access but she also wants restrictions to the full movement of Labor uh which seems to be a tough bargain to to get so we don't know what the negotiation will give we don't know when they will start we don't know uh how long this will this will last so there is huge amount of uncertainty about future access to to single markets and this is very very important for the financial services that was pointed out so the financial passporting in particular is a key element for the competitiveness of of the UK financial services are very important in exports of the UK Britain has the highest ratio of services export to GDP in the G7 and financial services are a big part of that so that's a huge question mark there's also a huge amount of uncertainty about future labor flows we don't know where we are going to get there Theresa May has pretty strong views on this we also don't know about the Integrity even of the United Kingdom as a country right this is the United Kingdom it's being right now not very United and we actually could see a referendum in in Scotland so as a result of all these uncertainty what we are starting to see is investment being delayed hiring decisions being delayed we also have more racist incidents we also start to hear about migrants not so sure about whether their future is in England or not so rather than a massive decline right now in consumption or investment I think what we are seeing is more of a grinding process we keep going for a while but there's no new projects so that's uncertainty that's our uncertainty is playing out over time so what's the uncertainty shock then we also have the financial Market shock so Sterling fell to a 30-year low after the referendum mind you if you read The Daily Mail the day after the referendum you would not have known because the Daily Mail reported that yes Sterling fell a bit but when it rallied however it seems to me Sterling fell there was also quite a bit of equity Market volatility and where it's interesting to see the very big difference between the food c100 with a big large multinational companies which actually gained tobacco and Mining went up profits in dollars but that increased the Sterling depreciation increase the profits uh but on the other hand if you look at the more local ftse 250 where you have more smaller companies which are more British centered where the shock was much bigger among the most heat we have a commercial real estate funds the bank stocks went down by a lot and also household goods and home constructions went down a lot in the in the first two weeks after the referendum they declined by 30 percent now since construction investment accounts for about nine percent of UK GDP that's not a very uh that doesn't bode very well for the for the short run economic activity and also obviously consumption in construction investment is a leading indicator of of severe recessions consumer confidence has also Fallen interestingly it fell more in the regions which voted for remain than in the regions which bought it for leave but it it fell to uh in in the sharpest way uh in 20 years since consumption is something like 60 percent of UK domestic demand again and since it has been the biggest source of growth in the UK since 2012. I think it doesn't both way dwell for the for the short run in terms of economic activity and this is what is reflected in the adjustment of the forecast that have just been given by the commission but also the ECB and the IMF which have adjusted downwards uh the forecast of UK growth by one one to two point um between now and 2017. so that's for the short run now let's talk a tiny bit more about the medium to long Horizon well so will the resolution of uncertainty even lead to an investment boom as some people have argued well obviously to me it would depend how uncertainty is resolved if we resolve it towards the norvision deal and then yes probably we will see an investment pick up if we have long negotiation and stopping the flow of Labor then probably not thus the Sterling depreciation help well so we have an experiment there of the 2007-2009 episode we are Sterling depreciated by a lot in fact it depreciated by 30 percent against the dollar during that period and the UK trade deficit halved at that point now the UK current account deficit is by the way seven percent of GDP so it's not it's not a small number so the UK trade deficit halved between 2007 and 2011 due to the very sharp depreciation of a sterling mainly due to the fall in British tourism in Europe which went deeply down and also there was some substitution towards UK exports but there it was relatively limited so during that former episode a 10 reduction in UK export prices leaded led to about four percent rise in exports only and this was at a time where there was no issue about trade barriers right so we cannot be sure that this time around it's going to play exactly in the same way very briefly because I'm at the end of my time just want to to talk about the effects of of these macro developments on the EU economy very few points there also a downward revision to growth in the order of 0.2 to 0.5 percent of growth between now and 2017 for the rest of Europe mainly due to trade and financial linkages I mentioned tourism that's one of these linkages now what has been very interesting is that actually if you look at some of the sharpest fall in stock prices following brexit these have come from the bank stocks of the periphery of a euro and I think where there's several reasons for that so one is a you know volatile values and confidence shock in an environment with a high non-performing loans on the balance sheet of some of the banks of the periphery but also brexit has increased the likelihood of low interest rates for longer and this this is eating Bank profitability banking sectors are already not in a very good shape in in southern Europe and I would add that one of a very big question mark that he's hanging over our head is the political Dynamics in the rest of the of Europe coming from brexit so how is it going to play out interestingly perhaps because of a lack of leadership of a brexit here so far the people of the extreme right parties in other European countries who had asked for a referendum have actually lost ground in the polls so if you look at Mr get filters in the Netherlands he actually lost some ground same thing in in Austria Marine Le Pen is stable so we don't know how it's going to play out but for the moment there hasn't been you know noticed a noticeable surge in the countries we were asking for a referendum following the great example of brexit very good very good lastly a Neil kashyap is going to talk about what brexit means for the city of London as a financial center okay thanks um thanks um I think uh economists should probably be careful talking about uh brexit and its impact I agree with mostly with everything that's been said here but all the economists were United in in this uh beforehand and 52 percent of the people ignored these predictions um and we probably need to step back and ask why as experts we've got such little credibility um I think it's it's degraded our ability to contribute to discussions both the United States and in the EU going forward and it's something uh we ought to be reflecting upon um but my assignment today is to speculate so I'm going to do that um my Baseline prediction is going to be the financial services in UK will probably shrink in and Shrink substantially just to put some more numbers on the table there are about a million people in Great Britain that work in financial services that's about 3.7 percent of the workforce and that 3.7 percent of the workforce uh contributed in 2014 about 11.5 percent of the taxes um so regardless of what you think about bankers and financial services the tax consequences of financial service migration outside of the UK will be important and uh that that's something that hasn't been stressed as much as I think it it probably should be uh just you know think about them having to make up five percent of their their taxes in steady state and and work that through whatever model you want that that's not off the table so why do I think uh brexit will have adverse consequences well just to elaborate on what Elaine was just saying it right now if you're running a pan-european financial services firm out of London it's pretty attractive you get English language you get UK law you get UK Labor uh regulation and you don't have to face any discriminatory uh regulation so that means no country specific or EU level regulations that can be selectively applied to UK firms that's the whole point of what Richard was saying about the platform uh the London won that race when it was played on a Level Playing Field and and they've lobbied heavily to protect the city's interests to make sure that that has been maintained it's ironic that the highest EU commissioner at the time of the referendum was their representative who was in charge of financial services now he's resigned when Gordon Brown was holding the the discussions over the Euro one of his five tests was protecting the city so it's not an accident that the city has thrived there's been a lot of effort put in to uh to deliver that outcome I think it's unlikely to be able to maintain that position after brexit commences I'm operating under the assumption that it will commence uh and that that they won't try to go back for a second referendum or a vote in Parliament to thwart this I I can elaborate more but basically I think that may having been in the remain campaign has to cover the right flank and and basically follow through and she said as much three or four times so I think we should assume that this is going to happen regardless of whether that would be your your recommendation so once that happens I agree with what Richard said which is you cannot let the EU Vu can't afford to be cherry-picked and therefore you can't offer the UK a better deal than the one it has now which seems to be the the promise so they're going to have to choose between having the current protections for the city of London or caving in on the uh the movement of people part so Norway just to be clear in its deal if there were Global Norwegian Financial Services firms they could operate on the same footing that the UK firms have now once you step down from that uh you lose that ability so the Swiss which have a model that's another one they could try to implement the Swiss started with its decision not to join the EU they immediately passed seven bilateral treaties that regularized a lot of the arrangements between Switzerland and the EU but they did not get passporting rights for their financial services firms so there are limitations there and and what that means is that you you can't do everything with One-Stop shopping you may need bilateral permissions you may there may be Provisions that the EU can put up that that makes it uh discriminatory if you want to be based in in Switzerland uh for instance so I think even the Swiss outcome would would probably make it bad now the obvious question comes then uh why can't you just keep booking everything in your your subs that are operated outside of London somewhere in the EU and keep all the people in revenues inside the UK I'd say there's three reasons why I doubt that will happen first I think some of the San some of the countries will want to put sand in the gears just to to make this disadvantageous the French have said already on several occasions that they think uh if Britain is out of the UK is out that things ought to migrate into uh into an EU country so there'll be some of some of that the second is that the EU Regulators I think will be very very hesitant to let all this happen inside the UK where they would not have any formal Authority um the UK and the EU regulations post the financial crisis are not fully harmonized the UK was embarking on a a set of measures to move in the direction of of normalizing everything that would have kept their passporting rights and the Level Playing Field but that requires the UK to follow through with this so right now who knows if the EU is going to want to adopt everything to be fully compatible with the EU without knowing what the the deal was going to be like and on top of that I think it would be really really difficult to preserve any of this if the UK responds to the pressure it's under by kind of lowering the bar and racing to the bottom to if they try to make their business location more more appealing that's going to make the regular leaders inside the EU all the more hesitant to say this can just go on in London and and you know we're not going to have management close to people if you talk to senior Financial Services people they tell you in the end your regulator wants to know you and see you all the time and this idea that you're booking all this stuff in Luxembourg but actually living in London isn't sustainable in the medium term if you put up some sand in the gears on top of it I think it becomes all the less uh realistic and feasible becomes a hassle eventually they move finally I think the the Ace in the Hole is really the ability to walk in and and terminate an entire trading division or a whole group of people without having to make big Severance payments right now in France and Germany you can't do that that's one of the big advantages London has You Can Let Go 500 people and you don't have to make a huge side payment I expect some country in the EU will pass special ed legislation that makes it easier to fire bankers and mass that once that's done the stickiness of of London goes away and it's important to realize over the last 20 years the people that live in and work in the London Financial Services industry is transformed it used to be it was heavily English uh and or certainly People based in the UK that had grown up there now it's it's mbas from all over the world that have passports from everywhere who have no allegiance to London so the stickiness is is just not there um so for all those reasons I don't think they're going to be able to to pull this off without completely capitulating on the movement of people and I think that would be viewed as a betrayal um okay so I'm out of time I I can uh I could we could talk about some of these other things but I just want to reiterate I think to take it or leave it thing is really critical so I think you should be assuming that what will be easy to implement will be either Norway some version of Switzerland or some version of WTO Canada but a bespoke deal is going to be really hard and even if they go for one of those off-the-shelf things it still may take them years and years to complete and in the meantime I think the financial services will kind of bleed out slowly [Music] thank you I'm now going to invite each of the panelists to react to uh what each other has said not everybody has to react to everything but uh everything but uh whoever has something to say in any order Richard so um I basically agree with every what everybody said so I just extend a little bit extend a little bit uh on on what Anil ended with what will it happen or will it not and I think uh Theresa May has made it very clear that she's going to start the talks for brexit and and that there's the idea that we would have of parliament preventing uh article 50 from being triggered that's not going to happen a second referendum in the near term that's not going to happen so um I mean the way I think the only way it could happen is that she triggers article 50 at the end of the year it takes two years of negotiation and once they see what the deal looks like they're going to get eea for example or membership then they might hold another referendum to say do you want this or do you want that but that is January 1st 2019 and that's after two and a half years of uncertainty uncertainty for people who are living in Britain and don't know what their place will be whether their children should go to educate to education there or where they should leave and uncertainty in terms of building businesses and investment and two and a half years of that kind of uncertainty especially if you might think that there's going to be a referendum at the end of it so there's even more uncertainty that can lead to hysteresis both in terms of the labor force and in terms of where manufacturing is actually located and where Finance is actually located so if you remember all of Europe is losing World share of manufacturing so we're not talking about gaining shares it's losing it more slowly so once that stuff goes it's not at all clear that even if they did decide to stay that it would come back and then that's a uh just just uh to to to to Rift on what Helene said about the uncertainty in Europe so there are three referendums in October this year uh Each of which could cause some scary things to happen they're going to rerun the presidential election in Austria which almost well it it they're going to rerun the election in Austria and then there's going to be a constitutional referendum in Italy about changing the way they things but the way it's it's viewed now is the prime minister is linked to the success of that and if he drops down the next party up is an anti-eu party uh so that that could cause all sorts of problems because Italy has a 130 percent debt in somebody else's currency so even the thought that they could leave um could be very disruptive and lastly there's a referendum in Hungary about more or less disrespecting some rules of the commission which would lead to uh a problem with the EU so it's a worrying thing going forward but uh in terms of probability of it actually happening I think it's at least over half because when we get get there uh they will have gone so far down that path they'll probably leave but but that's you know where I put it so I mean I wanted to pick up on the question of whether brexit will actually happen um and can I think one useful way to think about that question is to look at what is the political Coalition that has actually just voted for brexit and it's a bit of an unusual Coalition in UK terms It's a combination of traditional conservative voters um typically people who are reasonably well off um I kind of would be sort of little little England smokesy conservative voters but it's a coalition of that group with more kind of Voters who would traditionally maybe have voted for labor and have suffered a lot in the changes that have hit the UK economy over the last 20 or 30 years right and this is the group that is potentially particularly upset about the effects of globalization and migration and kind of the point I want to make here is that this is not a coalition that has existed really in UK politics before and it is a coalition that right now is is putting pressure on Theresa May to initiate these negotiations and to try and find a solution for the UK to leave the EU but it might not turn out to be a stable Coalition particularly when we do see you know two years of uncertainty of of lower growth it's far from clear that this Coalition for brexit will still exist two or three years down the line so I'm you know I think that that casts a reasonable data work you know will we ever actually see brexit happen so I agree with um all the what has been said um I just want to emphasize also a point what that Anil made on the difficulty for the city to to remain what it is really because of in particular in all uh the business which is related to to the euro and the clearing of Euro transactions where it has already been made pretty clear by the continent that it would be very difficult to keep a financial center with a lot of transactions in Euros in a place where EU regulation doesn't have any reach so when the question is exactly how the business can be carved out and in how many pieces and we start to see you know discussions about what type of businesses will move and what type of illness will will stay but as I pointed out when I talked about this uncertainty shock I think uncertainty is indeed a grinding process which in the short run what you see is a little bit business as usual but not in no investment no new projects being undertaken and as time goes by and uncertainty drags on you see more and more of the effect coming through and the question is going to be as more and more nvfx are coming through what effects will that have on the Dynamics of this Coalition but my neighbor just talked about and that's I don't I really don't know how it's going to play out yeah just say one other thing which is um now that Europe's taken a step backwards for the first time in 50 years I think we should be worried that you won't be able to stop at just one of these I mean you're now going to have to sustain uh votes in many different locations I mean Richard pointed out the three that are coming but you've got French elections you've got German elections you could imagine if the recession is not extremely sharp and and deep that eventually the separatist parties and other places are going to get almost goaded into it well the Brits did it why aren't we pushing hard enough and pick your favorite Breakaway region or country and so I've never was confident that the EU um or the Euro which the public can't tell the difference uh if if you were to actually put this to a vote that you would actually have made it we haven't it hasn't had that many affirmative votes so the odds of just an accident just if you have enough of these votes someone else is going to vote to do it and then it really gets to be a mess especially if it's somebody that's inside inside the Euro so it's fraught with danger I I think if um you know it it could easily be the case that in two years there will be another referendum as to okay now we know what we're actually voting on um so we'll we'll reconsider but over those two years that there's a lot of downside uh risks and and a lot of the stuff May migrate in the in the the meantime and they do it that's kind of a level effect that I don't see reversing so uh that completes the on the record segment of the of the program uh when we go
