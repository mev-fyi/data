um so i want to now spend about uh we're gonna have a two-part um session on what we'll think of as traditional policy instruments uh sin taxes product bans things that directly change prices and the set of products available and what i want to do uh during this session is i'll give a couple motivating questions uh talk through a model of optimal sin taxes then we'll have lunch and we'll come back and do three applications that will map in a familiar way to the motivating questions uh so here's motivation here are the three motivating questions first should we regulate energy efficiency so in the us and many other countries we have a series of policies that encourage us to buy less of these gas guzzling hummers and more energy efficient light bulbs and home appliances and cars and this actually is how i got interested as dmitry said we got interested uh in behavioral public economics thinking about this set of problems i originally thought that this was that energy efficiency regulation was mostly about the environment so more energy efficiency less energy use less climate change and we soon realized that actually a lot of this really is about behavioral economics and let me just give you an example again from my from my standard quotes this is from the regulatory impact analysis returning the the final rule for the corporate average fuel economy standards in 2010 that have for a long time require automakers to sell to us more energy efficient higher fuel economy vehicles so the epa the environmental protection agency projects significant private gains to consumers which appear to outweigh by a large margin the cost of the program even without accounting for externalities in short the problem is that consumers appear not to purchase products that are in their own economic best interests so this is consumers are making mistakes and so we as the environmental protection agency are now going to take a consumer protection type role to induce uh automakers to sell higher fuel economy vehicles to consumers and they say there are strong theoretical reasons why this might be the case consumers might be myopic they might lack information the benefits of energy efficient vehicles might not be fully showing now on the other side of this argument is republican senator rand paul who says listen call it what it is you prevent people from making things that consumers want uh so that's going to be application number one after lunch application number two after lunch is should we tax sugary drinks and on one side of this argument are people like chris madsen the prominent public health professor at berkeley she said sugary sugary drink taxes are one of many ways to make really clear what we value as a country we want to end this epidemic of diabetes and obesity on the other side of this are two folks from the libertarian mercatus center who wrote public health advocates often view the growing prevalence of obesity as proof that many individuals pursue behaviors that are out of sync with their own best interests but policies are too easily justified on the assumption that government officials are better informed than the individuals they seek to go application three that we'll do after lunch is should we restrict payday lending and of course payday loans are short from high-interest loans that in practice people take out repeatedly paycheck after paycheck and on one side of this debate in announcing the um consumer financial protection bureau's final payday lending rule in 2016 was the director of the bureau richard cordray who said that the cfpb's new rule puts a stop to payday debt traps that have plagued communities across the country too often borrowers who need quick cash end up trapped in loans they can't afford on the other side of this debate is the libertarian cato institute and in particular theo brook knight who wrote that the cfpb rule will significantly reduce consumers access to credit at the exact moments they need it the most so what ties these together is an assertion that taxes subsidies bans or other traditional types of regulations are needed to protect consumers from their own decisions and so the research question uh which is going to matter a lot for the world that we're going to take on in this session today is what is the optimal policy if any so let's dive in to the model of optimal sin taxes and let me just say um i'm going to really inc we have time built in for questions and comments and disagreements so i encourage all of you to jump in and raise your hand uh and ask questions as things come up let's set up this model first so the key intuition i'm just going to take everything you did in econ 1 or environmental economics class about externality taxation and i'm just going to take a few minutes to apply that framework to internality taxation uh there are a number of related references as you go home and want to look at the notation written down i've written them here the setup is going to be we're going to have heterogeneous consumers of type theta and each consumer is going to choose an amount of a sin good to consume we'll call it a sin good as well as a consumption of the numerator and the utility will be quasi-linear in the numerator sin good demand is going to be denoted x so this is following dog's notation where x is a the choice that people make uh x sub theta for type theta as a function of price and each consumer in the welfare analysis is going to have a social marginal welfare weight g sub theta which is the social value of theta's marginal consumption of the numerator in units of public funds so in other words how valuable is it to the government to take one dollar and put it in the hands of type theta which they will then use to consume more of the numerator uh in the quasi-linear model and uh this is a normative decision right how much we care about different consumer types but generally we'll think about applying higher social marginal welfare weights to people who have lower income that's the setup i'm now gonna in a very cavalier where uh cavalier way summarize uh doug's lecture in one slide um and so there's gonna be a lot that i'm gonna miss but uh what i'm drawing on the figure at left here is the demand function specifically for type thetas it's not aggregate demand this type theta is demand and notice that i've drawn two different demand functions and we have demand in frame one and then demand in frame two so just as an example this could be uh if i'm choosing how much dessert to eat and i might be choosing frame one might be what i choose in advance and frame two might be what i choose in the moment or it could be how much energy to consume and frame one could be if i have uh some information about total energy costs and frame two could be without that information um and so then there's a question of if we see people making different choices in different frames how do we do welfare analysis of a ban on the good or maybe a tax in a tax increase or subsidy option one is to say i'm going to respect both frames i cannot delete either one from the welfare relevant domain because i'm not really sure that one or the other is affected by a characterization failure and so i can compute consumer surplus loss from a tax increase for example uh against frame one against frame two and those could be bounce the second thing is i could expand the scope of consumer's concern so i use the word frame here but maybe it's not a frame these are just choices in different settings and i have different preferences in different settings so i choose i might choose less dessert in advance because then i get to spend the rest of the week thinking about what a great person i am because i'm not going to eat to eat dessert when that when that happens the third thing that we could do is that we could designate one frame as welfare well it could be that we uh go through and what we'd like to do there is go through the process that the laid out to establish that uh one frame is affected by a characterization failure delete that from the welfare relevant domain and then we're left with the other frame as being welfare relevant the other thing that we can do is basically assume the long run criteria in a case in a case of where people are present focused and that is as nicely described that would be a controversial choice but that would be a way of getting to one frame uh as being more figured and so for these slides we're going to live in this third uh in this third world where it's this kind of simplified case the special case of what doug laid out where we have one frame that we're able to establish this welfare okay so from there and so notice that now i've established one of these as well for irrelevant it is the the demand curve that is shifted in that we're going to call welfare relevant so market demand is uh shifted out so we're thinking of people as over consuming this same good so intuitively it might be cigarettes or gas guzzlers or things like that dessert so we have market demand for type theta and the welfare relevant demand for type theta and now i want to introduce this notion of bias which is it money metric so it's a vertical distance between market demand and welfare relevant demand and it's gamma is the notation for that for type theta and here's where we get to of course think directly about the analogy to externalities this could be oil consumption right market demand is what we see in the market and then social welfare is would be this blue line and the difference between those two is the externality perhaps the social cost of carbon and so just as there is a whole industry of talented economists who are trying to estimate what is the social cost of carbon there is a whole industry of folks in behavioral public economics that are trying to estimate that bias in dollar units that's what this is about so just to give examples so i want to i want you to notice that so far and for the rest of the slides this bias term gamma is its reduced form in the sense that i have not given a structural or specific underlying model of bias and that's fine this is going to be for optimal tax analysis a sufficient statistic but just to give one example from oh donahue and raven in that paper uh people are consuming potato chips or some unhealthy food that has a future marginal health cost age they down weight that future cost by present focus parameter beta and then the so then the planner the government uses the long run criteria as doug laid out and so we think of the beta equals one as being the normatively respectable preferences and so in that world bias gamma is the marginal health cost age times the share of that that we're not accounting for in our decisions relative to norma relative to what the planner thinks of as being normative preferences so with that let's think about what are the effects of taxes so we're going to live just for these slides in a world with constant marginal cost and perhaps there's some existing tax t and so the initial equilibrium is where the tax-inclusive price hits the the type theta's demand curve so at this black dot and i want to consider then what are the effects of a marginal tax increase of amount dt and of course i'm drawing this on the slides with enough that you can see it but this is going to be in calculus terms of marginal tax increase it's going to generate a consumption decrease to this new equilibrium at the top left of amount the slope times the tax change so the key object that i want to focus on that's going to result here is this bias correction parallelogram or more generally it could be a trapezoid so what is this this is saying what is the increase in so in in welfare relevant uh in in well in what is the increase in utility that the planner considers welfare relevant that the consumer of type theta was not considering in her decisions the size of that is what i'm writing here in the formula at the top right it is the social marginal welfare weight that we apply to that type thing g times the height of that trapezoid gamma the bias times the behavior change the slope times the marginal tax change and so what's worth noting here is that as we then are going to in a moment aggregate across lots of different types data hold if we were to hold constant the total size of these blue trapezoids we're going to care more about these blue trapezoids if the consumers who have the larger trapezoids are the ones who have larger social marginal welfare bases so in other words this bias correction aggregated across consumers from the planner's perspective is going to loom larger if poorer people lower income consumers have more elastic demand so their trapezoids are wider or they have more bias their trapezoids are high now the and then think about what is the full welfare effects of a marginal tax increase on type theta and that's going to have the standard three components the first is the bias correction in blue that we just talked about and then the next two are these standard terms from any uh tax analysis the fiscal externality which is drawn in green which is holding constant that tax t the consumption reduction is going to generate a reduction in tax payments uh that will hit the government budget so that's the fiscal externality and then finally the mechanical effect in red which is holding constant some consumption level x sub theta the marginal tax change is going to generate an additional tax payment x times dt that goes to the government and is taken away from a consumer with welfare weight g sub theta so that's the full calculation here now we can using that we can talk about the optimal tax so again i'm just going to i'm going to rewrite that same equation we just graphically derived this is again the effect of a marginal tax increase on type theta dw theta dt and it has those three components we just walked through the optimal tax of course is going to be the first order condition after taking the expectation across types so i'm going to take the expectation take the first order condition and then rearrange and i'm going to get an optimal tax t star that has two components the blue bias correction is going to come down and generate a corrective motive in the optimal tax and the red mechanical effect that tax payment from consumers to the government is going to come down and create this red redistributive motive at the right and so we'll talk uh through each of these but again the corrective motive is just the expectation of the size of those blue trapezoids across people weighted by their social marginal welfare weights and then the redistributive motive is how much money am i taking away from low versus high income consumers uh to transfer to the government because i want to consider a couple of special cases just to be concrete here the first special case is if i have no redistributive concerns so everybody's social marginal welfare weight is one well in that case this simplifies to the uh the redistributed motive goes away we don't care about redistributing we care equally about each person so the optimal tax is going to equal this simplified term here in blue which i will call the average marginal bias see why i call it the average marginal bias it is the expectation of bias gamma weighted by each consumer types demand slope dx theta dt so what's the tax then consider an extreme case where the biased consumers are fully inelastic and maybe there are some unbiased consumers who are elastic to the tax what's the optimal tax in that case so again i'm gonna i'm asking about what's the optimal optimal tax in the special case where there's two types of consumers there's a biased type that is fully inelastic and there's an unbiased type that might be elastic so what's the optimal tax yeah zero etc so even though there's bias in the population the biased people aren't responsive to the tax so there's no correction that's happening when i say that tax great there's a further special case with homogeneous consumers which is just the tax equals that homogeneous bias level and so thinking back to econ one as you might have taught pigouvian externality taxation you want to set the carbon tax equal to the social cost of carbon we're just doing the same thing here okay so now i'm going to ask you all some more questions and my previous question was a little thank you for thank you for helping us out there i'm going to ask some more questions that are going to be a little harder and so get your hands and your brains ready when demand is more elastic does the corrective motive become relatively more or less important compared to the redistributed modem and of course there's two ways to do this one is to stare at the formula which is great and the other is to think intuitively about correction versus redistribution when the elasticity appears anybody have a thought yeah corrective because you can actually change whether or not horrifying it but if you if demand is more inelastic like if the net is inelastic you're not going to change whether or not the more buying is so then it's just if we think for example syntax is effective like or volkswagen then you want to restrict it great so consider the the extreme case building on what you said consider the extreme case where demand is fully inelastic again as we just described we get no correction out of that so it's only the redistributive mode that matters as we get more elasticity we get more blue trapezoids and the corrected mode it becomes more important second why might gamma and so the bias the welfare weight the demand slope covari positive value versus negatively and what would that imply for t so can anybody think of like a real world case maybe it's cigarettes or wine consumption or pick your favorite application how do these co-vary in that application and why we get this soundtrack coming through the speakers i'd love it want to fix ideas with cigarettes what about with cigarettes how do these how might these objects co-vary as for the social welfare rate like this part i'm not sure i don't know you can imagine either story i think that's like we must care about helping addicts or not yeah so for an addictive good you could imagine that the people who are addicted are going to they're going to need to consume and so they're going to be less elastic to prices and so that would generate this covariance between gamma and dx dt what about uh g and dx dt do we think that low income people in typical situations might be more or less responsive to prices no so typically you might think of low income people as being more price responsive that's going to be another way that we generate this kind of to appearance yeah now i just warm called on somebody um and where's charlie charlie's going to be my next warm call if needed um but i hope not to have to rely on charlotte when might consumption x co-vary positively or negatively with g so before we were just talking about the elasticity now i'm asking a different question when does consumption co-vary positively or negatively with g and what does that imply for the optional attacks cigarettes is a good place to fix ideas here too or wine just pick your favorite uh example it's just like normal yeah so what's your favorite example uh let's go with y i suppose so here you come just like more of it yeah great and so then walk us through what that does to the redistributed motive or how that impacts the optimal attacks yeah so consumption is negatively correlated with the welfare weight so lower welfare weight on the high income high consuming people for one and then that's going to mean that we're going to want to tax that thing higher as a way of taxing taxing the consumption that uh rich people are interested yeah great thank you save charlie um charlie is there like sweating his boots uh finally how would the formula change for externalities so i'm just really trying to push on this analogy let's say i just had to reapply this to externalities how would you relabel these terms yeah so i guess gene is no longer um yeah exactly so that's a key distinction to that's the the core of the initial distinction here so with internalities the if there is bias the person who is consuming is the one who's affected by the bias if they're externalities it's the consumer imposing a harm on somebody else then so given that how would you re-label these terms up here [Music] so somebody else other than the can if if type theta is the consuming type then you need some other type that's affected yeah and so where does that not where is that we'll call it theta prime where does theta prime go great well thanks for getting us started you can continue or someone else want to pick this pick this up so we need we need to sort of relabel these terms and we've got a innovation where we have theta prime which is the consumer type who is affected by the externality disco is awesome charlie we're going to you so i know that you don't relabel gamma so gamma will still begin with data because internally i think you would you would also not relabel dx dt so i think that will still just be the elasticity that there's a response and then i think for the corrective motive you would still have g theta so you still care about correcting the uh implied you still want the person who's responding to internalize their behavior but i think for redistribution that's where you care about the mechanical effects of people who are who's demanding this you don't know i'm not sure great thanks for getting that started i okay so i agree with you that we'll keep the theta is the same in the redistributed mode so the people who are consuming are the people who are paying the the carbon tax so the thetas are going to say the same in the restorative mode what about in this corrective motive so again i'm getting rid of internet there's no more internalities and i'm just talking about externalities so what is gamma got to be and what is the subscript on gamma i'm going to relabel gamma now as an externality so charlie you said you want the subscript on gamma to still be theta this is the this is the externality imposed by type theta great so the last thing we need to do is what is g theta gonna mean now or what is g gonna mean what is g interpreted as now if gamma is an externality imposed preferences on so that's going to be incorporated so the assertion is that maybe g is social preferences i'm going to repeat the question for the video i'm thinking of gamma as being the externality and the magnitude of gamma is taking into account society's preferences over the sort of magnitude of that externality and so like the social cost of carbon for example is going to take into account what i think are the social harms of consuming um and so that's going to be embedded in gamma which i'm again here redefining as an externality like the social cost of carbon so i really want to focus on this g term g is the social marginal welfare weight yeah yeah exactly so if gamma is being relabeled as an externality then g sub theta is the social marginal welfare weight on people who are affected by type theta's externalities so for example imagine we're taking a local air pollution problem i emit pollution in a low income area i'm type theta i emit pollution in a low income area that's going to hurt low income people the g attached to my externalities is going to be high there's a high social marginal welfare weight on the people i'm part of okay so i just wanted to does that make sense let me pause for uh any other questions on that yeah what would be your preferred term then for the first like corrective in some sense expresses our desire to like bring people closer to what we think they should be doing so in the case of an externality correctly it feels my sense of the just language that would be used as a corrective motive is also applied to externality so these are corrective taxes we could try to correct or internalize externalities and actually we're the ones in this room that are now adding that uh internalities to fall within that problem other questions their thoughts yeah we'll just as a label yeah that would be that would be uh and pagoo of course was in 1927 thinking about externalities that might be another nice label yeah so in a sense corrective motive allows us to be more ecumenical and include both externalities if your externality is impacting a bunch of different types of people is there any effort to process people or yeah so that's a nice point so remember with internalities i'm affecting myself and so it's easy to think of what g is it's the social marginal welfare weight placed on me in the externality example if i'm affecting lots of other people we need to and i didn't develop the machinery to do this but we need to think of g sub theta as the average social marginal welfare weight of the people that i'm imposing harms on yeah thanks for pointing that out yeah absolutely so the way that um that would work is i would basically add they're going to be additively separable so there would be another term i have this so going back to as we defined it so gamma is the internality there's going to be a separate term for externals and so that would fall within the brackets there would be like the the demand slope dx dt times the internality plus the externality that i have built and so there are many papers uh we'll talk through our soda tax paper that actually in the explicit derivation has externalities in it and you're totally right to point out that actually um many of the major applications of syntaxes there's both an internality i smoke too many cigarettes for myself i consume too much soda i use too much energy cost myself money but each of those three applications that's external it's environmental externalities health health system cost externalities that i impose on others anything else cool let me ask you um a couple of questions and i'm going to use these actually to connect to early work so working with this formula are there some assumptions or some context that you can imagine in the real world where you could guarantee a positive optimal tax and just to step back why am i asking this this formula there's no sign that we've given on this formula the optimal policy could be to subsidize e-cigarettes or tax e-cigarettes or subsidized gas guzzlers or tax gas measures or whatever and so what are the assumptions or like a particular setting that you could think of where the theory natural assumptions on these parameters could guarantee a positive option anybody have an idea raise your hand if you happen to know the donahue and raven 2006 the famous paper on potato chip taxes a couple of you folks so that's a paper where we have like one of the initial key points of that paper is that we have a it's that the optimal syntax is going to be positive i think that's a one of the examples i might have in mind so what happens in that paper so there is uh so you know i sort of hinted at it before this is a case where the i'm consuming potato chips and there's uh there's a health cost that that imposes on my future self and i down wait that health cost because i'm present biased and again the planner takes the long-run criteria so it's the example i get a few slides ago and so what are assumptions within that model is anybody future focused no so charlie i think the key there is just that there's no everybody's over-consuming potato chips then there's no co-variants [Music] gamma term and so that everybody's over-consuming g yeah exactly so you know donahue and raven there's no redistributive concerns so this right term in red just totally goes away and then they say you know we're thinking about present bias and we think that nobody's future focused in their paper and so in that world [Music] in that world there's the bias all pushes in the same direction and in fact even you could have any arbitrary covariance between gamma and dx d theta sorry dx dt as long as gamma is always positive so that's an example of how you could always get a positive optimal tax what about something that could guarantee a negative optimal tax and actually so far in our discussions we have already this has already come up what's a set of what's a natural setting in which you might think the optimal tax on a sin good or an addictive good might be actually negative might be a subsidy so we gave an example before we talked through briefly an example where the people who are biased are fully inelastic so the corrective motive goes away once the corrective motive has gone away how can you get the redistributive motive to be such that you'd like to subsidize adam's going to be my next warm call if nobody saves him adam's quickening his boots all right [Music] and why but why do i want to redistribute more to the to the type of people who are consuming addictive drugs more i mean if there's no motive and you're not going to be able to trip that behavior maybe people yeah so it could be that those people are just lower income and so i naturally want to distribute more to the higher consumers or it could be that there's actually really something about the process of consumption that causes me to be lower income so i we as a society often express concern over people who become addicted to goods and you know i wish we'd done more of this 20 years ago but increasingly we are expressing concern over people who are addicted and we'd like to figure out ways to help them and so it could be the consumption of addictive goods happens to be because i'm poor or it could be that the consumption causes me to be poor or to to us to have more concerns um and bernhard rangel 2004 is a much more specific model but you can sort of fit broadly the concepts of that into this sufficient statistic type framework and it's basically the the intuition that we just talked through okay so um i'm going to do applications after lunch but um what i want to do now is just give you a taste of what the applications will look like and they're going to be three applications it's the the three that i hinted at at the beginning and in each case there's going to be a recipe and the first part is that i'm going to hypothesize and then measure bias and then the second part is once i've tried to measure bias i will do welfare analysis with that and actually just because we i'm going to do the beginning of the first application uh for five minutes before lunch so the first application is going to be energy efficiency and so here's the here's the background here so this is a paper that i wrote with dimitri in 2015 it was our second paper together and it was great fun [Music] and i think the reason that i want to do that in these slides or sort of the contribution to the flow of our argument for the day is that it's an illustration of how to estimate that average marginal bias term that i highlighted a few slides ago and then once we've estimated that in a sort of model consistent way how do we calculate the optimal tax from that so the background here is a and so this we did this work 10 years ago and interestingly the light bulb market has changed quite a lot in the last uh 10 years but at the time you know we were in a world where the main two technologies in the light bulb market were the traditional energy inefficient incandescent bulb and the uh more energy efficient compact fluorescent wall over cfl um and the cfl saves four dollars and fifty cents per year in electricity at average usage patterns and average electricity prices compared to those traditional incandescents but strikingly in 2010 cfl's had only a 28 socket share which means there's some survey that the department of energy had done where they tried to establish that if you were to go around and look at people's light sockets and their homes only 28 of those light sockets and in residences had cfls in them and so policymakers said hey this seems like an opportunity to save uh people money so the consumer protection argument in addition to the environmental externality argument which is you know the more energy i use the more pollution is uh it generated as part of that so many utilities subsidized at the time cfls and they've mostly moved to subsidizing leds or light emitting diode light bulbs now so there's a subsidy component and then the 2007 energy independence and security act banned most incandescent bulbs and that was delayed by obama and parts of it were phased in at different times and then what remained of that was partially rolled back by the trump administration and so you can see that you know this this was a especially contentious um uh set of policies and it's just a microcosm of this broader energy efficiency debate and so why did we choose light bulbs as opposed to something that has is more uh where expenditures are larger like cars or air conditioners or refrigerators light bulbs are going to be really easy to experiment with it is a small purchase that we can move easily we can incentivize it and so that's why we're choosing light bulbs as opposed to carson um and so the economic questions in this space are going to be does bias reduce cfl demands and if so what's the optimal subsidy for cfls and should we ban incandescents so with that i'm going to pause and we'll pick this up right after lunch we have lunch i think it's going to be right outside and we'll see everybody back here at one o'clock and be prepared for me to to share your ideas and questions and for me to warm call on you because these applications are going to be there's tons of problems with them so i want those all the surface see you in a few back at it welcome back welcome back everybody so we are oh that's right that's how we do it so we're back on doing applications we started with energy efficiency and i set up this um uh the economic substance of this uh question on light bulbs so remember step one in our recipe for these optimal syntax papers is to hypothesize and then measure the bias so let's talk through that in the context of buying energy efficient light bulbs the hypothesized biases here and you could start to argue with us right here but this is this is where we started we our read of the discussion was that the most likely reasons why consumers might buy the energy inefficient incandescents instead of the energy efficient cfls were two one is maybe i'm just not thinking about this sorry maybe i just don't know the truth um as we were talking about at lunch i was actually surprised when i learned that cfls could save me quite a bit of money when aggregated over the several years that i probably have a cfr so maybe i just i don't know the second is well maybe i know if you ask me but i'm not paying attention to that fact when i actually go to buy light reports so the thing that is very salient in the store is that cfls cost more money than incandescents and of course that's especially true now with the led light bulbs they're just way more expensive up front than the older types of bulbs and so it's easy to pay attention to or focus on that upfront cost that you pay all at once and maybe natural that you wouldn't think as much about the energy cost so that was our hypothesis and so we figured well the right way to test that the right way to try to measure bias is to do information provision so if i take a group of people that's shopping for light bulbs and i take a treatment group and give them more information and thus mechanically draw attention to that energy cost information that would be a good task for these two hypothesized biases and um we're going to do this in a randomized way so we're sort of gearing guaranteeing ourselves the exogeneity of this variation in frames so the assumption that we're going to make then is that the welfare relevant domain is the choices made by the information treatment group in our randomized experiment the information the control group in our experiment is going to choose between light bulbs without seeing the information that's going to be market demand but the welfare relevant domain demand is going to be the choices made by the treatment group and so what assumptions do we need for that to be a reasonable [Music] assumption to make one is that we need our information treatment to fully eliminate bias so if we have a unclear energy cost information provision experiment nobody understands it then it would be hard to assume that that has eliminated informational or attentional biases second we also have to assume that the information we provide does not affect preferences so we could have designed an experiment that talks about how it's important to be green or environmentalist and thus you know buy energy efficient goods and that would be something that's like persuasive advertising that could change people's preferences that wouldn't be de-biasing that would just be persuasive advertising um and similarly because this is going to be an experimental setting we need to take care to minimize demand effects we don't want the participants in our experiment to think that we wanted them to answer in any particular way and then finally as with all of these applications um we're going to assume that there are no market failures other than the market failure that we measure and this is true outside of behavioral applications as well you're going to have some optimal policy uh welfare analysis and you're going to assume that your model is the right model of the world and so specifically in this application one into one version of that is that there's no other behavioral biases that affect choice so that's this that's the setup we're gonna have to do let me then walk you through this experiment that's gonna have to satisfy these properties and again the goal here is going to be to estimate the average marginal bias so this is going to be a case where we're going to forget about distributional concerns and you know there's more to do in this space on that but for this paper we just said let's focus just on the corrective motive and so we want to estimate this object which you may recall from a few slides ago is the special case when everybody has g theta equal to one now i have added in these p's here to make uh explicit that the demand responses for each type could vary by price there could be some types that are more responsive at higher prices and other types that are sort of more on the margin at lower prices and so what we really need to do in this experiment is for every different price level figure out the average marginal bias at that price level and our i think one of the things one of the contributions to this paper is thinking through how to how to do that so uh in the in well there's two experiments in the paper i'll talk through the one that's more closely connected to this setup um we can we collect about 1500 people on an online survey platform called tess which by the way is still available and easy to use and people can apply for it and it's a high quality not allegedly nationally representative sample it's an opt-out sample so it's it's higher quality in that sense uh and potentially more representative in that sense and so everybody in our experiment gets a 10 shopping budget and then will there make incentivize a series of incentivized choices between uh cfls and incandescents and so this is within subject design first people will make baseline choices between the cfl and the incandescent and what does that do that tells us uh at what point on the market demand curve they're marginal so there are some people that are going to say you know the price would have to be very different for me to shift from an incandescent to a cfl we're going to know that price where they switch between the two and that we're using not going to be able to place them where they are in the demand curve then we have a randomized information treatment and then finally we have end line choices again between cfls and incandescents and if we then assume the information treatment is fully de-biasing i know where everybody is on that demand curve i know that conditional average treatment effect of information at each point on the demand curve and that's the object that's going to be my my average marginal bias so let's talk through that just in a bit more detail so step one is baseline choices the choice that looks like this uh choice a is one cfl and choice b is is four incandescents these have about the same y one versus four these have about the same upfront price cfl per unit is more expensive than incandescent per unit and also cfl's last longer than incandescents and so maybe there's some sense in which the overall lifetime of the one pack cfl is roughly similar to the overall lifetime of having four incandescents so uh that's the choice set and then we have a standard multiple price list that everybody goes through and so for those of you who haven't seen this um choice a choice b and you make a decision in each row of this table and what varies between the row is the price of choice a versus choice b so for example in row one the very top choice a is free you can get that cfl for free and uh choice b the incandescence is ten dollars and so you can imagine that most people are gonna say well the cfl is free i'm gonna i'm gonna take that uh what happens as we go from top to bottom is that the incandescent gets less expensive and then eventually the cfl starts getting more expensive and there's gonna be a point on that multiple price list where each individual person is going to shift from choosing the cfl to then saying oh now the relative price has gotten has changed and i'm going to start choosing the incandescent and so where people cross over on that multiple price list is going to be their indifference point or their relative willingness to pay for the cfl compared to the incandescent and it's that relative willingness to pay that is then i'm going to sort of mechanically use that to place people where they are in the demand curve yeah is the variation in the price of the incandescents also necessary where could you keep the price fixed on the right-hand side yeah so generally that's right so there's different ways of designing this kind of multiple price list and the main thing that simplifies things for people is if the relative price changes monotonically so the choice on the right becomes gradually more appealing to the price than the thing on the left the way that we did this as you know we start by decreasing the price on the right and then after that increase the price on the left we didn't need to do it that way um the benefit of this is that we had we remember we gave people a 10 shopping budget and so the the highest price on the right is 10 bucks and then this starts to drop and then the highest price on the left if i had the multiple price lists will continue down and that will get up to ten dollars so this allows us to basically have a a wider range of relative willingness to pay for the two goods while keeping all the prices below ten dollars so that's why we designed it in that one any other questions on this setup yeah it's like an underlying assumption that um i want to see someone's response and i'm going to infer their willingness to pay and recover demands i keep thinking going back to the point of what if people don't have deep underlying preferences so they are constructing them as they go so in this case i maybe never spent too much time thinking about my willingness to pay for cfl versus light bulbs and i am using information from the context the fact that you're telling me that position number one is three versus spam uh and number two is to say to make a rough estimate of what might be a reasonable willingness to pay for for life or cfos is that a concern in this environment i think this is a real concern so again the question is you know what if i hadn't thought very hard about what my relative willingness to pay is and something about the construction of this choice environment gives people cues that could influence what they reveal to us here and that's very real so for example there uh there is work showing that when you sell the same good on the same kind of multiple price list but change the bounds of the mpl that mpl multiple price list that will change people's decisions and so like there's you're exactly right that there's a sense in which we might infer how much we should be willing to pay by what the bounds are that that we start with here so i think that's a real uh concern and i guess i would separate i think there's two versions of that concern one is just anything you do in an experimental setting like this is going to have experimental design issues that could distort people's preferences relative to their true preferences and then the second version is well what if i didn't have true preferences in the first place and i just hadn't thought about that and so you know doug has set up this framework uh very nicely earlier this morning and we're going to live in what doug called the behavioral reveal preference framework where we're gonna there's gonna be one framework in which we respect people's choices and we're gonna have to we're gonna take those as normative doug has a thought yeah uh yeah i just wanna to this is methodological about elicitations this isn't the only elicitation that you can use so the another common one is called the evm methods of the group and it it's like a second price auction it is asking you to state your point of indifference and then saying you know we'll pick price at random and you'll buy the flip set it's higher than the price that it's going to otherwise that um doesn't anchor people the way the boundaries would actually be here the disadvantage of that approach is that it requires contingent reasoning which people aren't very good at there's an alternative that kind of combines the two which i've become increasingly partial to that's called titration medium and the way titration medium works is you start by posing the bdm question uh to get the point of indifference but you know you basically tell them this is just a way to get started and once they give you their point of indifference you show them the price list right around that point of difference and it's sort of like okay so what you're saying is that this one if that was your choice you wouldn't do and this one if that was your turn you would just above just below uh the point of the difference and if people look at that and go well no i wouldn't do that then you go back and recycle again the advantage that has the advantage uh of the bdm mechanism of not anchoring people the way the boundaries flew uh but it hasn't managed the price list in that it walks people through the contingent reason and that's the only way i want to talk a couple other things so first let me know a statistic that i think is actually pretty direct evidence but you're suggesting and it's a common feature in every experiment which is even when you look at the control group where people just do this multiple price list twice without really getting any decision relevant situation the willingness to pay will fluctuate you know and that's just like a you know a five or ten year like a five minute distance between the first solicitation and the second one so my dad suggests it might suggest exactly this notion of a constructed preference we might be thinking about the kinds of even drift fusion models some kind of psychology that are making their way into economics where we're kind of going through an internal kind of retrieval process trying to figure out what the value of this good is um or you know we might take more of a random utility perspective on this and just say fine they're just shocked we're going to treat each elicitation as normally relevant under that perspective we're actually okay going with the welfare analysis the way we're um doing here um then there's kind of a second minor mythological point you know and i think something i have these discussions a lot um to the extent that things like range can affect um valuations i think that's a point about how the demand curves that you listen in such experiments we might not necessarily readily accept that they are externally relevant what might be more robust as kind of the within person variation that's caused by the treatment that we might imagine is actually less sensitive to these various kinds of range effects so that's typically how i think about things i kind of i like the kind of causal effect of something that i find i typically believe is a bit more externally relevant than whatever is the demand curve that you estimate in these kinds of settings great okay so step one was now we know under the under the assumptions that we've just discussed we know where everybody sits on that market demand curve the part two of the experiment is this randomized information provision so the treatment is providing people energy cost information that looks like this and in fact this is not just energy cost but total costs so this figure is showing on the y-axis the total dollar cost to get electricity out of a 60-watt light bulb for eight years at normal usage patterns and normal electricity prices and so in the red bars this is re-illustrating what i said a few slides ago that um that see that cfl's cost about a quarter uh what incandescence costs for electricity the blue bars are the total cost of the bulbs and there is a rated lifetime of cfls of eight years and so even if whereas the incandescence costs uh have a rated lifetime of about one year they just burn out all the time some of you may have noticed this in your own homes over the years um and so the blue shows that cfls save money in overall purchase prices as well so we show people this figure we have some text that walks people through the figure we actually have a voice that reads all this to people if you're an auditory person as opposed to a visual person that voice is me actually reading this um we it used to be a different voice but decided this voice sounds better how this came about is that right you know remember we were contacting that market that company that does these visuals this guy's voice is not as good as mine i just did it i just did it you know i'm a good reader so that's the treatment that's the treatment and remember that what this has to satisfy it has to satisfy it has to everybody has to be fully informed after seeing this and so we need to be providing clear information we have a comprehension check at the end and actually you couldn't advance uh unless you pass that comprehension check um and it can't be about environmentalism and there's nothing about the environment here it's just facts that should matter to your choice the control group we want to make that similar except informationless and so this is irrelevant information with a similar structure so we have a figure this is trends in u.s light bulb sales over time and that's not going to impact height our assumption is that this will not impact how you choose between incandescents and cmos so that's the randomized information provision and then we go back to an end line multiple price list so this is a within and between subject experiment we see how everybody changes their relative valuations after they've received the treatment or control great so that's the setup let me first show you something that's just model free just sort of descriptive when you construct the demand curve at baseline that's what we see in black and so the on the y-axis here is the relative relative price of the cfl x-axis this is the market share of the cfl so for example at a relative price of zero in other words if the one cfl and four incandescents cost the same amount and see if the cfl market share would be about 80 uh in our experiment and that's already a little fishy i think you know building on these comments because the cfl market share was considerably lower uh in the actual market the thing that as dimitri says you might believe a little bit more is the treatment versus control difference at inline so that is the solid blue is treatment and then the dash red is control and so this information provision has shifted out demand to the right and then the assumption we're going to make for welfare analysis is that this blue demand curve is the welfare relevant demand curve whereas the black and red which are basically sitting on top of each other those are going to be potentially affected um by characterization failure yeah charlie so another methodological question was your goal to control information so i guess there's like a potential concern that providing information itself somehow affects preferences but were you trying to get like would you have preferred to control redline lie exactly on the black baseline is there some concern that you provided information that move them in the other direction in some way yes we you're exactly right charlie that we would have liked the red control and line to sit directly on top of the baseline now it may not be an effect of the treatment that we gave people or sorry the the control information that we showed people it could be that there's something about eliciting this a second time and people have learned and sort of re-realized and so i think literally the assumption we're going to work the the what we're going to do is compare blue to red and that's how we're going to measure bias but for other experiments do you recommend including these control information permission review strategies for like choosing a good control such that the land the demand lines will land on top of each other or i don't really have i think it's experiment specific it's a good question how to do this i will say so here was the other thing that we could have done right so the control group got info that had a similar structure took the same amount of time we could have just skipped this we could have skipped the control graphics and just gone straight to the second end line you can imagine some reasons why we wouldn't do that it's kind of weird to realistic preferences immediately a second time and there may be something about just the process of taking time to think about quantification or graphs that could affect your preferences and so we really wanted to isolate the energy cost information from these other potential factors thanks thanks for these great questions okay so now uh so this is just sort of i would call this a descriptive result now i want to connect this more to the optimal syntax model and the average marginal bias calculation in particular so this figure is the conditional average treatment effect of the infra of the energy cost information on willingness to pay for the cfls uh at conditional on each baseline relative willingness to pay for the cfo and so for example those people who were who have relative willingness to pay of zero so they were at when relative prices they switch at a zero relative price um that conditional average willingness conditional average treatment effect is what just over two dollars and i actually don't make too much of the shape of this graph we had a hard time you know figuring out how you would interpret this and i think it would have been cooler from our experimental perspective if like this sort of had a consistent trend one way or the other that was economically interpretable um and so we don't stake too much on that the thing that i think is important is just conceptually remember we want to measure the average marginal bias at each point of demand curve and that's exactly what this object is okay so this is the theoretical object we want to know okay so now i have this and i'm going to do welfare analysis with this and that's the second part of this recipe we've measured bias under some strong assumptions that we've discussed so what's the welfare analysis what's the optimal tax or subsidy that we would set so here's the figure that illustrates how we think about this so the baseline demand curve is now in red on this um and we're going to evaluate again this is demand for the cfl and we're going to evaluate the impacts of a cfl subsidy so it's going to lower the relative price gradually and a ban on incandescence in our model is equivalent to an infinite subsidy so first so looking at the red um the if we were just working in a revealed preference framework and there was zero bias so assuming uh taking market demand or this baseline demand curve in red is welfare relevant then we would have the standard analysis where a subsidy for cfls is going to generate what we called at the time of harvard or distortion so basically i have a corrective tax but there's nothing there's no bias to correct and so the size of that heartburger distortion is just the difference between the market relative price and what we're actually subsidizing and so if i ban if i ban incandescence i'm going to generate this consumer surplus loss in red and this is because that's the people who would prefer incandescents over cfls even at relatively low prices for cfls so that would be the standard non-behavioral economics analysis on top in blue i'm now going to plot the internality reduction and that's basically these trapezoids that we that we plotted in the model earlier and where did the numbers come from what are the height of these bars it's just this previous slide so this is gamma this is the average marginal bias at each price and i'm just going to take these conditional average treatment effects and i'm going to plop them down on top of the right part of this demand curve and so the optimal subsidy is then going to be the subsidy that trades off the harburger distortion against the internality reduction gain it's the optimal subsidy in our model given our estimates of bias is the point where this red magnitude is about is the same as this blue magnet the optimal subsidy is about two dollars yeah for cfls in this model the overall welfare effects of banning incandescents in our model is the red harburger distortion the decision utility if you'll excuse the use of the term the decision utility loss that people have net of the sum of these internality reduction blue areas so that's the welfare analysis uh here and what's what i like there's a ton of problems with this paper but what i like about it is that it's sort of a clean illustration that goes directly from the object we want to estimate the average marginal bias to this figure that's doing the welfare analysis let me pause any questions or complaints or comments about this paper i think many of you read it because it was on the reading list anything we haven't gotten to or things you want to complain about at this time yeah um so maybe this is because doug is my advisor but when i was reading the paper i saw that he said called information not information or bias it's uh it's not really a bias right if they just lack information like your decision probably isn't the one they would make with full information but is it yeah so this this is a great question so the question is is imperfect information a bias and here's the way that i think about this it just goes back to these figures that we started with so there is mark type theater's market demand there is the welfare relevant demand that type theta would have and anything that causes a difference between those things we're going to just semantically call a bias so that could be inattention that could be a bias in beliefs about energy costs it could be other things that are information related i'm going to collapse all of that into calling it a bias i think there are many cases and there's many natural reasons why you you know might not call in perfect information or bias but formally this is formally this thing is what i mean by bias great question thank you yeah well this will be the same if you've had like randomness and choice or maybe like on average would be the same but if you have full information you have no randomness if you have information friction you're just you make more mistakes but on average that's interesting so what if there's some randomness in choice and so what would that mean the market demand so if there's randomness in choice maybe you mean that you know market demand in one setting it would be shifted out and market demand in another setting would be shifted in um i think formally the way that we would think about this is the market demand that we're going to use is in some sense the the average across all the choice settings that people have in the market so i think that's a simple answer there's a much more in-depth answer that maybe doug will add no i wanted to so finish that one because i wanted to come back go ahead go for it oh okay um i just want to come back to the question of uh calling this advice and actually i whip it with this guys uh for the following reason the information that they provide is in principle available you know and this is the critical distinction we're not really concerned with there's unknown information information becomes available what is that the value of that to you that's a standard you know conventional economics uh value information question this is a there's information available to that process what we're going to do is call your attention to it and see on the chain and therefore any of these differences are properly interpreted as biases because they come from not having processed information yeah so i remember looking for first information treatment there was a group of people who just still refused to buy cfls um if you could go back to do the experiment how would you have tried to identify like what mechanism was happening there so the question is how do we think about these people who even at uh very low relative prices even when the cfl is really cheap they still don't want to buy cfls i think the answer there is it doesn't matter my answer for this paper is it doesn't matter there's a lot of good reasons to not like cfls they flicker they take some time to turn on they got mercury in them the color of the light is different than in incandescence maybe you just don't like them and you don't think it's like an information sound like this thing like people dislike painful information in like from an authority or something right so that's a good question could our and i think that comes back to the set of assumptions we need to make about what the information is doing so the question just to repeat for the video is well what if people don't like hearing information from an authority figure that would mean that our information treatment is not de-biasing people it's not eliminating bias it is giving people additional information from an authority from authority figure and maybe there is some aversion to that and we are assuming that away uh in this paper it would be interesting to think more about you know what that could do in other settings i mean there's tons of settings in the real world where authority figure the government requires information display and you could easily imagine reactants to that people don't want to have to think about this yeah i guess your information treatment is not just providing information that you have publicly available i mean you can search up let's say the lifetime of these two different types of light bulbs or you know like the energy consumption rates but you are also providing them sort of a i guess i see this as sort of a decision aid right when you are computing that for them as well like do you see that as a client as well or is that sort of conceptually different than providing sort of i guess the base information if that makes sense i see yeah uh do we think of information aids that give the conversation yeah do we think of that as somehow conceptually different i mean absolutely it's different in a really interesting way um again for this setting all we need to know is what you do in the market without the information and then if we think we're giving useful clear information how much does that change your choices um then there's a lot of nuance you could add on top of that in other settings but here that's all i need yeah okay so let's move to the next um oh sorry let me just make a couple of comments um so again this is the right experiment that's within subject design is the right experiment to identify the average marginal bias but a big downside of course is this artifactual online setting one comment uh is that you know given the very large differences in costs of energy costs for energy efficient versus energy inefficient light bulbs it should be that if you look across different utility service areas with different prices there should be big differences in market shares of incandescence versus leds or cfls if people are paying attention to the energy costs of the light bulbs and if people are paying attention to the differences in energy costs across utilities so sarah armitage's job market paper gets into this a little bit but you know i think there's probably more work to be done looking at so koichiro ito's job market paper looks at the boundary between two utilities where the houses on either side of the boundary are going to be very similar but they have different prices and he asked a different question with that but you can imagine using that same type of price difference for energy and then asking to the people in the higher energy cost utility then have much much more leds in their homes so that's like an example question that you could a direction that one could go uh with this and sarah does some of that in her paper but i think there's more to do there's one other thing i want to touch on which is that um you might ask well if this bias is information related uh why don't we why doesn't the plan planner why doesn't the government just use information provision to address that and we'll get to this more in the the lectures on on non-traditional or non-standard policy instruments the hope with information provision is that it could be well targeted there's some people that are well informed you subsidize their decisions you're then going to distort their decisions away from their already well-informed levels and so this subsidy is like a blunt instrument that is moving everybody according to the average marginal bias but there's heterogeneity across people and what that bias is and so maybe information could be ver could be much better targeted easier to implement that sort of thing so why is it that one would think that like why not just fully rely on information provision to address the sort of biases we were looking at in this paper yeah i mean i think one idea is that like there are many possible areas in which we might want to use information provisions correct bias and so you gotta imagine their positioning returns i'm imagining my box which has a lot of university information yeah i really like the way you put it so there's all sorts of domains in which there's information that would benefit our choices and it's really hard to get us to pay attention to and internalize that information in all those domains and so if in fact that is ineffective then you might need to resort to some policy instrument other than information provision and indeed in this set in the energy cost setting there are energy use information labels on cars and appliances and there's still a concern in the public domain that those don't fully address these sort of distortions great so i'm going to go to application number two which is soda taxes so i'll talk about this paper which is joint with ben lockwood and dimitri it's called regressive syntaxes with an application to the optimal soda tax and the in the flow of the logic of today the contribution of this paper is going to be to start with a light bulb paper but then add distributional concerns and i won't talk about this as much but in the paper there's also a model that adds the optimal non-linear income tax to the commodity tax on soda in this case um so that's this uh here's the background on this sugar sweetened beverages which i will also call ssbs are thought to be an important cause of diabetes and obesity as we saw before but despite the fact that they are bad for us they uh we as americans get seven percent of our total calories from sugary drinks at least as of a few years ago so it's actually quite striking how many calories we get from this um and this number is going down over time um just like incandescent light bulbs there are less and less of these things being consumed but still we're getting a lot of a lot of calories from sugary drinks so um to address these health issues there are seven u.s cities and 39 countries or maybe around 40 by now that tax ssbs and so the economic questions uh are one is there some bias that's increasing ssb demand or maybe we just like sugary drinks and so the health costs are just the the price we pay to to get to drink coke uh if so if bias does increase ssb demand what's the optimal ssd tax so that's the economic setup here um just to motivate the distributional concerns this is a figure that demonstrates that low-income people drink more ssb so the y-axis is ssb consumption and calories for person day remember that the daily calorie intake for a typical american is 2 000 to maybe 2 800 calories depending on what we're doing so again this is a lot of calories that we're getting and this is data from the nhanes survey the x-axis is uh is splitting us out by income groups and so you know steeply downward sloping such that the highest income groups are consuming half uh you could you know once we're over 100k those folks are consuming half of what the lowest income groups are consumed so if we tax this a lot of the tax payments are going to be made by low-income folks okay so remember step one of the recipe is hypothesize and measure bias so let's do that the hypothesized biases when we sat down with ben lockwood and tried to think about what is the policy discussion what are the biases that policymakers are worried about we came up with two one is that people again imperfect information people just don't know how bad ssbs are for them and the second is there might be self-control problems i know that i should drink less and i would like myself to drink less in the future if i could choose in advance but in the moment that's not the choice that i make and of course you could respect short run preferences choices made in the moment or you can respect advanced preferences and so to worry that self-control problems are a bias you then need to be taking the long run criterion which again doug discussed this morning so our approach to bias measurement what we call the rational consumer benchmark so we're going to implement a bunch of surveys that i'll tell you about that measure proxies for bias so for example a nutrition knowledge scale we're then going to estimate the conditional association between bias like nutrition knowledge and consumption and then we're going to regression predict the consumption that each person would have if they were not biased in other words if they had perfect nutrition knowledge thought that they had no self-control problems so that's the approach you can immediately see that this is going to require a selection on observables type assumption so the assumption here is that the welfare relevant domain is predicted choices if consumers had what i'll call expert level nutrition knowledge and did not feel that they had any self-control problems and so the embedded sub-assumptions are that there's some level of nutrition knowledge on our survey that corresponds to having zero bias and like what level of nutrition knowledge that is is going to be controversial and then second as i was alluding to there's no unobserved preferences that are correlated with bias so for example it could be that people who have more nutrition knowledge just also have preferences maybe from growing up or their peers or whatever preferences for consuming fewer ssps and in that case we would get an artificial correlation between our measure of nutrition knowledge and ssb consumption so i'll tell you how we address that using additional controls um and then finally uh as i as we've covered a couple times now for example in the light bulb paper we need to assume that there are no other biases out there so we're gonna we're gonna have a model of uh we're gonna have some partial equilibrium or some model of these markets and we're gonna need to assume that we observe all the market failures so let me tell you a little bit more about our survey we ran in 2017 a survey of home scan households and just so just for background um there is many of you may have worked with or certainly read papers using the nielsen home scan grocery purchase data so that's about 60 000 people these days that are in their grocery purchase panel when you buy groceries you scan everything that comes into your house and so we have good data on the upc's that people basically on all groceries and indeed all packaged goods that people are consuming um nielsen offers the ability to add surveys of home scan households and it's actually quite cheap and doable or it was at least at the time we haven't talked to them in the last couple years and so we were able to get a grant to pay for a survey of 24 000 households and then attach the survey responses to people's grocery purchase data okay so the first survey question we asked was this was a perceived self-control problem so just a self-report do you feel like you drink soda pop or other ssb's more than you should and we scale this from the answers are from definitely to not at all and we'll we'll scale these numerically the second set of questions is around nutrition knowledge so we have a 28 question nutrition knowledge scale from the generalized nutrition knowledge questionnaire which comes from a public health paper by climate so one example of the type of question that was asked is what is the main type of fat present in each of these foods and the different fat options are polyunsaturated monounsaturated saturated cholesterol and not sure and then we ask people to report the fat present for the following foods olive oil where the correct answer is monounsaturated fat butter which mostly has saturated fat sunflower oil which mostly has polyunsaturated and eggs which mostly have cholesterol this is one of the harder questions by the way many of them i think i think i would have known butter and i would have known butter for sure and eggs the mono versus paulie is it has got me a little confused um so the average score it was 65 now i said we're going to make this selection on observables assumption and so one of the things that we do to try to make this uh less egregious is to collect survey measures of preferences just like how much do you like ssb so we have two versions of this one is the taste question which is leaving aside any health or nutrition considerations how much would you say you like the taste and generally enjoy drinking soft drinks and then we have a list of other tricks and so we're going to control for this and in theory this is supposed to be a way for people to tell us their literally their preferences or their tastes for consuming these things separating out the health issues and then second people of course might have otherwise unobserved preferences for their future health and so we have a health importance question in general how important is for you to stay healthy by maintaining a healthy weight avoiding diabetes and heart diseases etc and so these are going to be our controls in a regression where we regress ssb consumption on biases and controls and it's basically the conditional relationship that we're going to use um let me yeah please do please i think it's super compelling because many environments there are multiple biases and there is no way to experimentally follow them but i guess the underlying question is always like to what extent is the assumption possible i'm wondering is there any way any way to validate the assumption meaning in a different environment you have an active treatment that for example correct misinformation and you have uh you you ask will the condition of zero recover the treatment effect is that you know super great question so could we have done other experimental approaches that would have more compellingly identified the biases that we're looking for and so for for knowledge or information you're right we could have done something exactly like many people have done including what we did in light bulbs paper which is provide inform nutrition information to people and then see how that changes their choices and then to measure self-control problems there's some of you may know this nice paper by sadof samick and springer which allows people to choose groceries in advance and then change those choices right when the groceries are delivered and that's a way of measuring time and consistency and then the question is how much would those line up to what we get out of the surveys um the uh we actually uh have not done that information provision experiment and sadasamex springer came out i think a little bit later and so we didn't compare their magnitudes um and it would actually be tricky to be interesting to think about how to do that exactly because they're going to estimate a beta present focus parameter and we'd have to take this question and turn it into a beta which i think we could do we need to make an assumption about what that future health cost was um so we did not do that and that's a good question and i think like the underlying thing to draw out there is just that you know this approach to bias measurement is going to generate interesting descriptive survey results that that i think are suggestive and interesting and as you say they will allow us to have one survey in a nationally represented population that will allow us to say something but the selection observable assumption is is is quite problematic just one comment on this question i would kind of the way i would put it is there's no one strategy that is obviously the correct strategy and i'm not sure there's a natural renting um over believability strategies either so for example with information provision which i was just talking about 15 minutes ago we uncovered all sorts of issues you know with the kind of advanced choice versus kind of a media choice there's all sorts of issues because of how information changes between the time of choosing and that actually makes these approaches not that well identified either so i would say you know kind of the healthy way of going about this is to kind of take cues from kind of large applied micro fields where we measure and elasticity over and over and over again possibly hopefully tweaking our approaches a little bit more and improving and then kind of where do we converge to you know we just kind of have to assess the evidence as a whole so i think kind of you know there's no approach that's perfect and i think we just need to keep doing this and treating this as kind of a measurement exercise and we just need to keep collecting the measures that's the kind of perspective i would encourage um for these questions great um so i'm going to try to wrap up in the next five minutes or so and so i just i want to give you the taste of what we see in the empirically in this paper and then i will conclude um let me first show you a couple of descriptive figures so this is nutrition knowledge on the y-axis and remember the average in our sample is somewhere over 60 somewhere just over 65 percent out of 100 and on the x-axis this is household income so higher income households have much more nutrition knowledge what does this mean just to just think back to our blue trapezoids we care when we're when we care about distributional issues we care if bias is larger for people who have higher social marginal welfare rates right and so what this is saying is to the extent that we think higher nutrition knowledge means lower bias this means that the bias that's out there is going to be concentrated in higher in lower income people who have higher social marginal welfare weight so taller blue trapezoids for people we care about more um now is this actually bias one way to start thinking about this is as i have advertised to regress our bias proxy which is the nutrition knowledge scale on consumption and so you can see that people who have higher nutritional knowledge along the x-axis have lower leaders purchased of ssbs in the home scan data against the y axis so more nutrition knowledge less ssb purchases and this is unconditional and then as i have alluded to we're actually going to have a regression where we control for preferences the survey measures of preferences and uh basically use this to infer the what we will call the causal effect of nutrition knowledge on consumption again with this very strong selection on observables assumption now what is normative here well it turns out that among 24 000 people we had i think it was 27 people who identified themselves as nutritionists or dietitians by profession in our survey so we figure nutritionists and dietitians that's a we'll call those people expert we'll say they have full nutrition knowledge and so the unbiased level of consumption then is going to be the consumption level that each household would have if they actually had the nutrition knowledge of nutritionists and dietitians so you can see that this figure i can do a regression prediction as to what each point in the nutrition knowledge scale what their consumption would be if they had this level of nutrition knowledge yeah i have a very silly question well then would you consider bias someone that wrote them all right like they're better than the average teacher so our assumption is that higher nutrition that our assumption is that if you're a nutritionist and dietitian you have full nutrition knowledge and anything less any nutrition knowledge score on our on our on our survey less than that is indicative is a proxy for bias does that answer your question someone that was even better than the experts oh someone who's better than the experts there were a few you're right um and we pegged those people all as experts we don't oh correct correct yeah so uh that's how we get the under the selection on observables assumption the causal effect of bias on consumption and then i can stack that up by income so i comparing so combining the last two figures that i showed you we know that bias is more prevalent among low-income people they have lower nutrition knowledge and so the share of consumption attributable to bias on the y-axis is then higher for lower-income people now how am i going to go from right now i have a quantity measure of bias so i can regression predict what uh how much less you would consume if you were unbiased so basically going back to our market demand and welfare relevant demand for type theta what i have so far is this vertical vertical distance under our selection on observables assumption the amount of consumption that just that's explained by bias gamma is money metric the bias we want to use for the optimal tax calculation and so all i'm going to do is then take the demand slope and just do basic geometry i got a triangle i got a horizontal distance i'll take a demand slope and turn that into the vertical distance the so to conclude this paper the optimal tax that that we calculate under these assumptions combines an externality a health system cost externality that we got from uh other papers written by public health experts plus this internality and then adjust for um other fee basically has the corrective motive and the distributional motive that we talked through uh earlier in the day and this is the welfare effect of the optimal tax by income group so if i impose that optimal tax which is about one and a half cents per ounce in our model on the x-axis we have the income bins on the y-axis we have dollars per capita and then each of these different colors is a component of that equivalent variation calculation so the red here is the consumer surplus loss that you would infer if there's no bias so we called that with the light bulbs paper that was also in red and we call that the harbor distortion this is just the size of that thing uh for each income group that's bigger for the lower income groups because they consume more okay so this would be your first this would be your first uh statement that well maybe this is regressive because we're taxing something that lower income people are consuming more of now the other bars are what might offset that so there's a uh externality correction and redistributed revenues that we're just going to allocate to every income group equally so we're going to say like there's going to be health care cost savings that's the externality and then there's tax revenues and we're just going to apply those to every group equally for this figure the thing that could differ across groups is the internality correction right and so remember we show that lower income people have less nutrition knowledge i.e in our model more bias and so when i tax so they have the larger blue trapezoids and so when i tax them i reduce their consumption and i larger internality correction trapezoids accrue to them so if you look at the left of the graph the light purple internality correction is larger at lower incomes and so when you add that up um under the set of assumptions that we started with the um the the tax is actually um is is regressive in this is regressive in the particular sense that higher income people gain more from this tax so they consume a lot less and that's not quite offset by the internality correction however there are some alternative assumptions you can make and it could have very well been possible that the slope of this black line which is the total is actually downward in which case we would say that the poor are benefiting more than the rich and so i think one key takeaway as i conclude here is that you know when we judge regressivity i'm on this bullet down here when we judge regressivity we need to consider not just who pays the tax not just the financial incidents but we need to consider how the internet the the the incidence of the internality correction benefits and so if low-income people are more biased that would make a syntax more progressive um some other economic considerations i will skip in the interest of time let me just quickly flag these open research questions so this same model i think could be applied to other domains smoking energy prices etc and there are lots of papers that do this sort of calculation but even our same model where we endogenize the optimal income tax i think there's more to do there second it's worth flagging many of you know about the proposed new york city ban on large soft drinks this i think is a really interesting policy in our settings so basically the idea would be stores cannot sell soft drinks that are more than i think it was 64 ounces is that a good idea well maybe that's well targeted because bias the people who are going to buy huge soft drinks are the more biased but maybe that's not true maybe it's actually regardless of what size soft drink you're buying you're equally biased and maybe if you ban 64 ounce soft drinks people just buy two 32 ounce software so i always thought that would be interesting interesting to study in this kind of framework and then i think there's a lot more to do on richard dynamic models with habit formation so gruber and kozagi uh you know 2001 goes in this direction but they make a lot of simplifying uh assumptions and i think there's more to do possibly for those of you who are good the dynamic part of these types of problems to think about how do you tax if behavior is not in steady state and multiple goods that are addictive and substitutes things like that so with that i'm going to skip the final application i just want to conclude the recipe for an optimal syntax paper find a policy question with where behavioral bias allegedly matters hypothesize and measure that bias and then do well for analysis and i think these these two papers have really highlighted why this is really hard to do and controversial and we need more research in this space but the policy questions are really important um they often affect low-income people and they're often done without rigorous behavioral welfare analysis and i think that people in this room and all of our colleagues can make more impact uh in this space so that's that uh and with that this uh session is over the next session is the final round of speed meetings after which we'll go into a break so these i think we should do outside it was pretty noisy in there and also it's beautiful outside we have a courtyard here it's still walled in so we still should talk i think there's an externality imposed by talking loudly so if we all talk quietly as a group that may help but we can be out in the courtyard and so the way that i'd advertised this was [Music] we have to have those lines basically hold on fold in on each other right we want to meet the people in our own line the folks we haven't had two minutes with yet so let's do um let's actually form a circle outside that'll make the transfer easier and we'll have a through c and l through r last names on the outside and we'll have d through k and s through z on the inside so let's go outside we'll form those two circles and we'll go from there i don't think that works yeah it'll work for the first 15 minutes and then it'll be
