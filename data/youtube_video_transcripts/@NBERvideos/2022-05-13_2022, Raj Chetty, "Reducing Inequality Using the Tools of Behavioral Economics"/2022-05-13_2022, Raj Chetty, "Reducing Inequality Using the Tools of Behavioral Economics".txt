thanks so much doug dimitri sorry to be a few minutes later i haven't put about confusion on the location but delighted to be here with all of you so i'm going to talk about inequality and behavioral economics and so let me just start out with some big picture facts about trends and inequality in the united states as i see them i think similar issues by other countries as well and so just as a big picture overview i'm going to start with a few descriptive facts that set the stage for for what i want to discuss starting with this nice chart here from the work of um um which shows how income growth has changed dramatically in the united states over the past 30 or 40 years so start by looking at the series in gray here which is plotting annualized annual income growth rates in 1980 by income percentile so basically you know 100 dots here take folks at the very bottom of the income distribution very top of the income distribution ask how much their income is growing in 1980 and what you see here in 1980 and this basically is the case we look before 1980 as well in the middle of the last century in the united states is you tend to see higher levels of income growth at the bottom of the distribution and throughout the middle class than you do at the very top so pretty consistently between 1950 and 1980 we saw income growth rates of something like two or three percent a year across the board what has happened since the in the past 30 years or so is that there's been a dramatic change in that pattern so here shown in the red is the pattern in 2014 where you can see that there is now essentially no income growth at the bottom relatively low income growth rates in the middle class but there's a tremendous amount of income growth at the very top right so very unequal distribution of economic growth that has emerged over time that persists into the current period during the pandemic and so forth and so what that's led to is this you know quite well known chart from the famous work of piketty and syez showing this u-shaped pattern in the share of income going to households at the top of the income distribution and so you can see you know this is now going back to the 1920s in the gilded age uh back in um uh in the 1920s and 1930s you see that the share of income going to the top 1 was you know above 20 and then that came down in the middle of the last century consistent what i was saying when we had this more broad-based inclusive growth but then that has changed since 1980 and basically come back to 1920 levels in uh the present era okay and so you know roughly speaking today the cutoff for being in the top one percent is something like earning about half a million dollars a year and those households at the very top of the distribution are capturing most of the income growth so this phenomenon of widening income inequality and unequal distribution of growth is potentially of some concern in its own right if we have a social welfare function that uh you know puts greater weight drops on lower income folks we would care about a pattern like like this but my sense is actually if you think about what the general public cares about and think about some of the work that stephanie stanchev has done on perceptions i know stephanie spoke earlier today about the great work she's doing on those issues the the public while some folks are concerned about the sort of phenomenons the the greater concern seems to be about equality of opportunity and the persistence of these kinds of disparities across generations rather than inequality itself per se now it turns out however that there's a tight connection between these patterns of inequality that i just showed you cross-sectionally and what is happening across generations in a way that i think really matters uh to the public and and for policy discussions so in particular stagnating wages in the middle class which are a well-documented phenomenon by ticketing and there are cats have led to reductions in absolute mobility across generations as well and so just to show you that as another type of motivating factor that i think is important in thinking about these issues this is from some work i've done with david grusky at stanford nathan hendren at harvard and others this is computing the following statistic what fraction of kids go on to earn more than their parents did by the year in which kids were born uh measuring both kids and parents incomes in their mid-30s and adjusting for inflation okay and what you see here is again a dramatic change over the past 50 years or so where for the kids born in uh the 1940s it was a virtual guarantee that you were going to achieve the american dream so to speak of doing better than your parents so 92 percent of kids born in 1940 went on to earn more than their parents that is as you can see here grammatically defined over time such that for kids born in the 1980s turning 30 around now when we're measuring their incomes it's become a 50 50 shock as to whether you're going to do better than your friends so why do i say this is closely connected to the charts that i started out with basically what's happening here is you know if all of the growth is going to the people at the very top of the distribution take the extreme case where say the richest person like jeff bezos or elon musk is getting all of the growth in the economy then the fraction of people who are going to be doing better than their parents is naturally going to be lower than if we were in a situation like we were you know back in the 60s and 70s where lots of people are having increases in their income uh relative to their uh parents generation and so that stagnation of wages in the middle class i think has really driven down levels of absolute income ability and the reason i think that's quite important is if you ask people and i think stephanie's work captures this or more broadly if you kind of look at the public discourse people care a lot about this type of thing so am i doing better than my parents you ask people you know how well are things going this is a very common point of reference if you ask parents about what they're concerned about in the future generation lots of people will express the concern that we're no longer in a country where i can expect my my kids will will do better than uh than i did uh now one further kind of descriptive fact that i think is important in thinking about these issues so in that last chart i was just focusing broadly on overall what fraction of kids end up doing better than their parents did i think this is particularly an issue of concern at the bottom of the income distribution partly because you know if you're already making 300 000 a year you know maybe your kids only end up making 250 000 but that doesn't seem like as big of a deal as if you're quite not well off and your kids are not able to rise up but also because the u.s is a country where kids from low-income families have particularly poor outcomes because there's a tremendous amount of persistence of income across generations and so to show you that fact here is a graph constructed from population tax data looking at essentially all kids in the united states born in the early 1980s relating their rank in the national income distribution to the rank of their parents so we're saying where from 100 do your parents rank in the national income distribution what is the average rank of the children as a function of their parent's income and you can see there's a quite strong upward sloping relationship with something like a 40 percentile gap between the kids born to the poorest families and kids born to the richest families and so you know in a nutshell basically i think a key question of public interest and the one that i'm going to focus on in this discussion today where i think the tools of behavior of economics can potentially be quite valuable is to ask how we can increase upward mobility out of poverty that is not the only issue that's of interest in thinking about inequality i think there are various other issues that matter as well but in my view from both from a scientific perspective and conversations with people both on the left and the right you know different sides of the political spectrum i think there's pretty universal concern about this issue at least of how we can increase upward mobility out of poverty that is a real challenge in the united states today and i want to talk about how we might go about doing that from a policy perspective and why i think behavioral economics considerations of the type you've been talking about in the past day and this morning can be very valuable in thinking about this issue so before i dive in on that let me just stop for a second see if folks have any questions on the general facts or what i'm trying to do yeah thank question on how uh absolute mobility is defined because i was wondering with the chart of the percent turning more than their parents couldn't you still um like couldn't you have um the kind of incomes stay the same over time and just have the share like if you have a bottom share that's moving up you're gonna have 90 percent stuff down yeah yeah so there can be a reshuffling to known one or there can be level effects because of changes in growth so the way i think you know one way you can decompose this as you do this in this paper just skipping that detail here is ask how much of this trend is reduction is driven by reduction in economic growth rates so in the us growth real gdp growth rates are about one percent lower in the past 40 years or so relative to what they were in the middle of the last century so when you have less growth that's mechanically going to lead to this sort of phenomenon that's part of what's going on but second the distribution of growth is also extremely important right like i was giving that example of one person getting all the growth and so what we show in the paper is two-thirds of this decline is driven by trends in inequality and one-third of it is driven by the slowdown of growth rates um and you know i think that speaks a bit to the kind of reshuffling issues that you're talking about so you know the reduction in growth is important but i actually think that inequality issues are even more important than explaining what's happening there and that's why i'm going to focus on that as as opposed to you know how do we increase productivity in general um all right so let me uh describe a uh simple framework for thinking about uh these uh these issues okay uh uh so just to kind of fix ideas and produce you know just a very simple notation to structure what i'm going to talk about uh let's think about a two generation model where parents decide how much to invest in their children's human capital which i'm going to call high the level of investment that parents make versus consume themselves in period zero call that xenon okay and you can think about this framework as a very simple version of a classic model of intergenerational income dynamics are done by background tones back in the 1980s okay so in the neoclassical world what we might think of currents is doing in this setting is maximizing uh their own utility in the current period u of c zero it's a function of their consumption the current period plus some discounted version of their kids utility which is going to be a function of their kids incomes which i'm going to call y1 which are in turn a function of the level of human capital investment made by their parents now that investment could be literally dollars spent on things like books and things like that it could more broadly be the neighborhood you choose to live in do you send your kids to a private school so forth and so on right parents of course face a budget constraint such that the amount they consume today and the amount they invest in kids has to be less than or equal to the amount of money they actually have which is i'm just going to use their income uh y0 and come in the current generation so the classic way to think about why we have intergenerational persistence of poverty is that low-income parents are liquidity constrained they have low income and capital markets we tend to think are imperfect for various reasons so i'm not able to borrow even if i want to invest a lot in my kids education or the best schools and so forth i may not be able to do that and so when i'm in a situation where y zero is low poverty can end up persisting across transitions right so it's just a very natural obvious explanation that you might think of so if you have that view of the world then the most natural solution that you might think of to try to to mitigate the amount of intergenerational persistence of poverty to create more upward mobility is to give low-income families cash transfers so basically relax this liquidity constraint and let them optimize now this is not just some theoretical notion of interest it's an extremely important debate occurring at the moment in the us in the context of discussions about the child tax credit for example should we extend the child tax credit that was expanded during the pandemic and there's a lot of debate about that uh at the moment so the first question i want to start out with is uh you know does that work does that make sense as a policy to address the problems just giving people cash you know do cash transfers in fact reduce the persistence of poverty across generations so back in the you know becker and tom's period people had these theoretical models that suggested that this might be a good way to address the problem in the past few years thanks to advances in data and peripheral design i think we're able to really understand empirically what the consequences of cash transfers are so i'm going to talk about a couple of studies that have shaped my views and thinking about these issues so one nice set of papers by accessory and co-authors looks at the effects of lotteries on using rich administrative data from sweden on a variety of outcomes and i'm going to focus in particular on paper here in the future 2016 where they study the impacts of lottery wins on kids outcomes so at some level if you're trying to understand the causal effect of cash transfers uh and you're in the near possible world where money is money and it doesn't matter where it comes from um lotteries are sort of the ideal experiment right so they have data on the number of lottery tickets people bought they can look at different types of lotteries and then you know just by random chance you win and i don't what happens to our kids very clean set up so essentially what they're able to ask is how much of the cross-sectional correlation between parents incomes and kids outcomes that i showed you in that initial figure is explained by the causal effect of income differently if i were to give you a bunch of money would that help your kids rise up so here's the answer to that so this first dot here shows you in their data what the cross-sectional correlation is between parental and gun and one of the outcomes they look at which is kids gpas in uh elementary school so if you look at a variety of different outcomes you know uh kids test scores high school graduation things like that they all give kind of similar results i'm going to focus on this gpa okay so what this is telling you is a one thousand dollar annual income increase in the cross section is correlated with about a 0.02 increase in gpa so that's the cross-sectional association so now what they can do is take their lottery estimates convert them to the same units and ask what is your estimate of the causal effect of giving a person a thousand dollars on gpas and what you can see is you know just across the board pulling everyone looking at low parents looking at young kids older kids there is absolutely zero effect of giving people cash on how well their kids are doing um and it's not just that you know there are statistically consecutive estimates i actually think they have a fair bit of precision given the scale of the data to rule out you know meaningful effects okay so this is one i think pretty compelling piece of evidence against the very simple view that just giving people cash is going to dramatically change itself so when you show people that that evidence you know and the common response as well lotteries you know that's kind of a special form of money when you win the lottery you're going to go on vacation you're going to buy a house you're not going to spend it on things that have a long-term day off okay fine i mean i would note that itself is a departure from the impossible model but let's let's take that view so let me now show you evidence from another study published relatively recently by brian jacob and co-authors that it has a very different form of income so this studies the impacts of housing voucher lotteries in chicago where a bunch of people applied for housing vouchers low income families as is very common in these kinds of situations there are limits on the budget the city had and so they gave out the lotteries for people who they give out the vouchers essentially through a randomized lottery for the people who apply so that again creates a nice experiment where some people basically got 12 000 of assistance in this case in the form of paying their rent essentially uh which is an enormous shock because the median household income in this example is about nineteen thousand dollars very low income folks are eligible uh for for these housing vouchers so again you know simple lottery type of design basically you can compare the impacts of uh compare outcomes into people who for the people who received the vouchers versus didn't essentially okay you know what they showed looks like transfer they look at a variety of different outcomes here test scores high school graduation and so forth we highlight one of them they all tell a similar story so high school graduation they're estimating knee treatment effects of 0.02 that is about 2 percentage point change with a standard error of 0.02 so they can't reject uh the null of zero impact relative to a mean of 58 so once again a pretty precisely estimated zero much smaller than the cross-sectional association between the 12 000 income change and high school graduation rates so what i think from that is that um you know it's not just about lotteries it's about other more conventional forms of income as well you know to summarize it looks to me from this and other strands of evidence like this that d i d y 0 appears to be small at least in in certain settings now i don't want to overstate this there are other colleagues like the nature spelling perfectly points and i think a very strong advocate for the child tax credit and has done good work showing that in some circumstances it can be quite impactful so i don't want to discount the possibility that cash can matter but i do think there's good evidence that the simple neoclassical view that in all settings just giving people money is going to dramatically change persistence and incomes across generations doesn't really seem to work yeah i mean it's a great hypothesis you know certainly one that i might have had i mean this is why i find like the last two the breakdown they do at the end here useful so they're looking at families and one when their kids were young versus their kids who are older you don't you know you don't really seek their impacts even when the kids were younger so um lottery foreign to cash transfer program that today is a selection intellectual use could well be and so that's why i felt it was important to also show you the evidence from the housing voucher uh analysis where you would think this election patterns would be very different from what they're there might be in lotteries right so i don't think it's something unique to the lottery sample i mean i i've seen lots of studies like this that look like the jacob uh at all study but what you might think is different populations different selection finders and you continue to find you know there are some studies where you find some effects but you don't find really robust patterns that look anything like the prosthetic association yeah and imagine this in the paper so sorry it's it's so that's why i'm focused on the intergenerational dynamics of poverty that's why i set that up as kind of the estimated interest that i want to talk about of course mechanically absolutely like if you're looking at the fraction of people who are above the poverty line and i give you twelve thousand dollars yes you're less likely to be above the poverty but i view that as that is not unimportant but it's a very different question than trying to understand the dynamics of poverty across generations and the reason i think that's important i mean i'm about to highlight it actually because if you think about creating sustained change if your approach is going to be to literally transfer money to people in every generation that's going to get pretty expensive the reason i think we care about intergenerational dynamics is if you can get people on a different footing where they are earning more money themselves then eventually you're going to get to a different steady state where you just have lower uh a smaller fraction of people so potentially a much higher rate of return in some sense right so that's why i think we care about that um okay great so that's yeah sorry just on the the last point is there we might not have data yet but would there ever be a model where it would take two generations so you could still have intergenerational effects but yeah i mean i think about the housing thing like maybe it's no matter when you give the parents the money you're not going to see sex on high school graduation of their kids but having stable housing has effects on investments to their kids so i'm going to show you some evidence that points in the direction to generation effects but not necessarily from cash okay i think and i think you're right that we don't have like the ability to directly do those two generation studies my intuition you'll see where i'm going with this my intuition is you probably won't see that because of how the money is being spent right um but it's you know it's a plausible box or something okay so uh now so one potential explanation for why we're not seeing very much impact is that your parents may under-invest in their kids from the planner's perspective so one simple way to think about this you know traditional explanation goes back to eddie lazier and others is that parents discount factors delta in the simple framework may be lower than the weight the planner or society wants to put on future generations we care a lot about you know as a society maybe about kids in the next generation but parents are really focused on their own consumption perhaps and that's why just rationally you give them a bunch of money they do things with it that don't lead to kids outcomes changing that don't change the intergenerational persistence of poverty okay so that's at least you know ex-ante theoretically a possibility you know a different view though is that parents do care about their kids but maybe aren't spending the money all that effectively to achieve the aim of improving their kids outcomes and so let me now talk about another pair of studies that have shaped my thinking on on this issue a bit so first i'm going to talk about a study by ben has seen that all in 2015 where they study a very nice tweak of a standard conditional cash transfer program which they call labeled cash transfers in morocco using a randomized trial okay so what this is is small cash transfers that are made to dads of school-age kids that are not conditional on school attendance critically but they are labeled as education and education support so traditionally what people do often developing country settings is say you get money if you send your kids to school but what they try here is you get money to help you send your kids to school but you know do whatever you want with it so again set up as an rct some people got the support some people didn't they are able to compare it to the effects of conditional cash transfers which some people received and so forth and so here's a simple summary of what they find they look at the fraction of kids small kids who are attending school um among those age six to 15 the mean in the control group is 0.73 the labeled cash transfer lct increases that by 7 percentage points and then they look at the difference between that treatment and other conditions like conditional cash transfers and so forth and you can see none of those things really have any differential impacts so what they're showing here is if i give you cash but i say it's for education you actually do spend it on education in a way that we think based on other work might really meaningfully change uh kids outcomes in the next generation okay so this suggests that it's not just that when you give people cash they have no interest whatsoever and spending it on their kids it seems to matter exactly how how you give this cash how you label it a further piece of evidence that i think goes in this thing in the developed country context comes from hastings and shapiro where they uh look at the impacts of snap eligibility eligibility for food stamps worth about 200 per month on spending patterns for households and i think this again demonstrates that money is not really treated as fungible by households as a student of any impossible model and as good as you see um you know pave the way for thinking about behavioral explanations so just to show you what what that looks like they're doing an event study of um families uh around the point that uh they get on snap they become eligible for food stamps and the key thing that you see here that's that's quite striking is that expenditures on snap eligible products so food in particular jumps up very sharply right when households become eligible for stuff now the key the key thing to understand here is that these households are not constrained many of them are already spending much more than the food stamp amount on foods on food to begin with so what you'd expect in the possible model when i give you additional food stamps is that you just start spending less out of cash you use your food stamps to buy food and you don't end up changing your total expenditure but you can see that in fact households start to spend a lot more on food they estimate that the marginal propensity to consume out of these food stamps of these food stamps is about 0.6 on food so sixty percent of that you know two hundred dollars is being spent on additional food in contrast spending on ineligible products which you would also expect to go up and then your possible model comes into cash that hardly changes at all so again you can see very clearly that people are not treating money as money there's some mental accounting going on there's you know some labeling effect that seems quite important okay so what do i think we've we've established from this set of studies empirically um for unrestricted transfers people don't seem to spend that much of it on improving outcomes with their kids but sometimes those impacts are larger depending upon what you know dick taylor might call of irrelevant factors seemingly involved in factors from the perspective of your classical model but you know things that actually do end up seeming to matter and so that of course naturally leads to potential behavioral explanations where you know we wonder whether parents are not maximizing this simple experience utility due to various behavioral biases and frictions so what might those be in the context of intergenerational income inequality i actually think this is exactly the setting where the types of lots of folks in the group have worked on from doug to uh david lipson just joined us and and others you know this is the type of problem where these issues really come to the forefront yeah i just wonder is there any way we're being safe with intergenerational persistence in absence of liquidity constraints and even in the absence of behavioral explanations if you have like complementarities between like human capital investment in your children and like parental and social backgrounds where you can imagine like you know if i have my parents have very high education i see so you're saying maybe the return different across the income distribution basically and that might motivate yeah i mean that's possible i'm going to show you some direct evidence that uh in fact the returns to investing in kids and low income families do seem to be quite high actually and their outcomes can change quite a bit when you make the right investments so i actually empirically don't think that that ends up um being true but theoretically you know right and i don't need to say like this is an exhaustive set of explanations that i'm showing you here but kind of paving the way towards the side of evidence that other people speak about yeah i'm all for april explanations but um thinking back to your motivational uh figures uh it doesn't seem like people are any more behavioral now than they were in the 1980s and yet we've had this that was your motivation this radical transformation you're not proposing that is responsible for that i mean yeah no that's i think that's totally fair dog you know i think there are behavioral so let me maybe put it this way that i think there are structural factors in the economy like technological change outsourcing and so forth that are contributing to the stagnation of wages in the middle class a question in my mind is why don't households sort of respond rationally to that and invest more in skills so i think about claudia golden larry katz's race between education and technology you might expect that when technological progress is continuing you will rationally kind of upskill yourself or upsell your kids so that they can compete with the machine and the way i want to think about the question is you know why is that not not happening if we just give people cash transfers will that be enough are there many revolutions at play that might explain why people are not making those investments but i agree that like the fundamentals i don't think are about necessarily about so does it have to be equivalent for explaining that phenomena i mean fair enough i'm going to put that on the list as potential things that might matter maybe you don't want to call that behavioral maybe you want to call that falling outside the traditional neoclassical paradigm you know part of it partly that's a semantic distinction but that's basically where i'm at let's think about whether that matters okay so the potential you know why do i think this is a situation where we should work hard to stop these issues i think it kind of combines all the features that we know from prior work or are situations where behavioral considerations might be quite important so the kind of decision we're talking about making investments for kids it's a problem where you've got the gate potential gains for kids realized pretty far down the road like 20 years down the road in terms of their earnings uh but you are making decisions up front and paying costs up front like choosing to live in a more expensive neighborhood or send your kids to a different school and so that's exactly the type of setting where things like present bias or status quo bias can be extremely important moreover it's a decision you make only once you're not making it repeatedly and experiencing what happens and so that again i think is a situation where behavioral factors may be really important second i think it's precisely in cases with poverty that we think people have limited bandwidth people are have lots of different constraints that are affecting what they're able to do makes them focus on immediate needs and so even if you do care about how your kids are doing you know far down the road you just may not have the luxury of being able to to focus on that and then third as doug just noted and i you know you may or may not want to focus on behavioral explanation there could just be a lack of information where higher income you know better educated resource families are very aware of how to navigate the system there's a nice paperback justine hastings and weinstein that shows that school choice programs are taking advantage of better by higher income families than lower income families that's consistent with this type of reason so i think there are good reasons to think that behavioral phenomena may be important in thinking about uh how to address these issues of intergenerational poverty and so you know what what i yeah just to take the first um which means they need commitment devices uh putting money in the savings account is not commitment devices you can always pull it out pulling and putting in your kid is a great device because there's no way to do a withdrawal figured out [Music] yeah i mean i guess it depends upon whether people are naive or statistical absolutely um and so at some level you know that's an empirical question um you know i i'm not gonna have direct evidence one way or the other the way where i'm going to say that people are naive or sophisticated but to me this motivates thinking about these issues you know in terms of choice architecture how are we setting things up and encouraging people to make uh investments in their kids that they don't apparently seem to be making i'll show you a bit more on that in a second okay so number three you focus on navigating the system would you put something like incorrect perceptions about the reference to capital investments and then kind of thinking about [Music] i think there's a debate about how much correcting those perceptions actually what how much of an effect that actually has major you know rob's paper shows pretty significant effects but there are a number of studies that replicate that in other settings and find smaller effects so let me come back to this my instinct is that the informational considerations themselves are not central although there may be a piece of what's going on i think there are other things going on as well um okay so you know what i wanted to say in this first part is basically that the data indication we need to go beyond providing assistance to reduce intergenerational persistence and equality i think that's the way people were thinking about it you know back in the 80s and 90s there's some capacity in that but i don't think it's going to fully solve the problem and so that motivates the focus on interventions that are focused on specific behaviors more directly support for education nutritional programs that impact kids outcomes you know doing more than just giving people money and my view is that insights from behavioral economics can be very valuable in designing those types of interventions not merely the fact that you might need them to begin with but how you actually design them once you recognize that people are not kind of optimizing as you would expect in the near possible manner and so i'm going to illustrate that in the rest of the time here and i just want to flag for david we ended up starting 15 minutes because of the location confusion so we'll feel good unlock it keep going [Music] so i'm going to uh illustrate uh in the remaining time here the work that's being done in the field by focusing on one very specific example that i think captures the broader issues which is to focus on one key decision that households make neighborhood choice where they're going to live and focus in particular on implications for the design of affordable housing policies and this is drawing up some work i'm not doing with various collaborators at the moment okay so to set this up i'm going to start with three facts on why neighborhoods seem really important for economic opportunity and then talk about a randomized trial where you'll see uh the importance of behavioral issues in governing these decisions okay so first fact kids prospects for upward income mobility vary substantially across neighborhoods so this is something that we and others have established quite systematically now using large scale data let me show you a map that illustrates this so i'll first describe how we construct this map and tell you what i think we've learned from it so what we're doing here is taking data from population tax records anonymized information covering everyone in the united states we take essentially the universe of kids born in the early 1980s in the us about 20 million children linked them to their parents and are able to map them back to where they grew up and for every neighborhood in america here i'm showing you an example from seattle because that's where i'm going to talk about an experimental study that we've done um you can see the divide seattle census tract by census tract about 4 000 people in each of those tracks in each of those tracks we compute a very simple measure of upward mobility we ask what is the average income at age 35 for kids who grew up in low income families families earning 27 000 a year which puts them at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution okay so we're gonna map kids back to the track in which they grow up track them using the longitudinal tax data over 35 years and uh see how they're doing as adults okay obviously they now be living in the same track themselves when we're measuring their income as adults the power of these data is that we can follow you no matter where you are so we color the map so that red colored places represent areas where you're less likely to rise out of poverty and you do colored places represent areas where you're more likely to have that problem if you start by just looking at the scale on the right side of this chart you can see that it matters enormously which neighborhood you're going up even in a city like seattle which has a vibrant tech sector so if you're in growing up in the center of the seattle or south seattle you are earning less than 30 000 a year on average as an adult if you're growing up up north of the city in a place like shoreline east of the lake average incomes are above 55 or 60 thousand dollars a year so just descriptively it's a fact from the data in seattle and cities across the u.s you can look at the data for yourself at opportunityoutlist.org for whatever you're interested in you will see a pattern that looks like this okay so uh there's a lot of variation across neighborhoods and kids second key fact that variation you know you might wonder is that just driven by selection different types of kids living in different places or is it actually about the causal effect that we've heard and i think there's now a pretty good body of evidence in economics and in social sciences generally that a large part of the variation in the map i just showed you the causal effects of place in particular the causal effect of where you grow up and that comes from a series of studies that look at people who move across neighborhoods using quasi-experimental or experimental methods and demonstrate that moving to better neighborhoods at earlier ages significantly improves kids there and so without going into too much detail here there are set of studies that have been done around the world at this point that basically have the flavor of looking at people who move to better areas think of like the blue green color places on the map that we're just showing you at an earlier age and show that you see an improvement in children's outcomes with sort of a dosage effect the earlier you move the better kids do so you see that in quasi-experimental sort of analyses where you can compare siblings within families you see that in randomized experiments like moving to opportunity experiment and so forth and so on i think there are you know there's a wide variety of studies now where this really seems to be a consensus fund so that's the second part the third fact which is what's going to motivate the set of behavioral uh decision-making issues that i want to focus on is that low-income families who receive housing vouchers that is who receive assistance from the government that is in principle intended to help them solve this problem and move to a higher opportunity neighborhood still predominantly lives in low opportunity vehicles so to show that to you let me go back to this to the map that i showed you before but now highlight in the bright green dots the most common census tracts where families receiving housing vouchers currently live in seattle back in 2015 to 2017. so just as a bit of institutional context we spend about 45 billion dollars per year in the united states on affordable housing programs that are intended partly to break the cycle of poverty and give people access to more stable housing to better neighborhoods what you can see is despite the fact that these families are getting about fifteen hundred dollars a month from the government and rental assistance they are not actually using that to move to a neighborhood where we know their kids would do better in the long run so this is one specific example of the type of thing that i was talking about more broadly earlier where it doesn't look like the money is actually being applied to something that's going to help their kids in in the long run and so when we noticed this pattern was actually housing authorities noticed this pattern when we put out this opportunity out this data we began to wonder you know why don't low-income families move to opportunity despite the fact that we're trying to give them the resources to do exactly that and so i think there are again two classes of explanations of the type that we've been talking about one is it's once again about preferences maybe not in a discounting context but perhaps just you know other amenities of neighborhoods that matter to people so you care about how well your kids do but you also care about maybe things like how far you are from your job or being close to your family there might be other good reasons you don't want to move to the other side of the lake in seattle a different set of possibilities is that there are behavioral frictions of various types that are preventing families from moving to high opportunity areas even though they really would want to do so and they would be happy to live in these higher opportunity places if they could now i think it's academically interesting to distinguish between these two explanations to understand what's going on i think it's also extremely important from a policy perspective because if in fact that's the latter thing then uh you know perhaps we can make changes in the way we design affordable housing policies to reduce segregation in our cities and perhaps increase upward economic mobility going forward and so to test between those explanations we ran an experiment in seattle we called creating moves to opportunity which was a randomized trial to essentially develop and test strategies to reduce some of these barriers and video protections that households might face in moving to high opportunities the way we conceptualize this is basically let's try to strip away whatever frictions families might face in making these moves and then see do they end up choosing to move to very different places if we make it easier to do so if they don't then we've learned that they really prefer not to move to some of these other neighborhoods if they do then maybe these frictions are actually quite important and so how did we do that in practice so what we did is designed first to bundle the intervention where we basically talked to families and thought through you know the various challenges they might face and ended up having three components first a customized search assistance component so the way to think about this basically is like a broker to help you find housing wherever you like to live so we hired a non-profit staff that that did this work and they spent on average six hours with each household talking to them about you know what's a neighborhood convenient for your job where transportation options are good that's your taste and let me connect you with a landlord there and so forth second because this is a two-sided market not just like going to the grocery store and buying ketchup you also have to have a landlord being willing to rent their unit to you we also had this non-profit group engaged directly with landlords and kind of make that connection between the town and the landlord you'll see in a second that proved to be quite important and then finally we provide a little bit of short-term financial assistance to deal with the types of liquidity constraints that families might face you need to pay an application a security deposit is a very low income household sometimes that can be an impediment now to be clear this is different from a behavioral intervention like a nudge or a default that you might think of as being super low cost essentially costless this actually costs them significant money about 2 500 per family which is certainly not a small sum but the way i look at it is in the grand scheme of things it's actually a pretty inexpensive intervention because you have to remember that on average we're spending 1500 a month on these housing ventures and the typical family is using these vouchers for something like seven or even 10 years because they tend to stay in these places so relative to that total amount of spending which is about a hundred thousand dollars a family the two thousand dollar incremental spending is actually quite modest on many services okay so we ran this as a randomized trial a thousand families came in to apply for a housing voucher in the seattle metro area in the standard way half of them got these additional services half of them just got the standard thing which was here's your housing voucher you have four months to find housing wherever you want and that's it just a clarification were these treatments um encouragements to move to particular neighborhoods or were these not high for any kind of so that's very important quickly they were absolutely not tied to moving to a specific neighborhood so we told people what the high opportunity areas are but you would get the financial assistance you know regardless of whether it was clear the whole point of an experiment was to say let's expand your option set and see what you choose to do rather than incentivize you to move to one place and that information about the hybrid area so we're basically trying to give you some information and i'm going to talk about how we unbundle this in a second to try to figure out what actually matters yeah i had a related question um did you have enough landlords who are willing to take sexually after seeing the high income so in practice yes and so let me answer that by actually just showing you the results of what actually happened um so just simple comparison it means right it's a randomized experiment so in the control group 15 of households move to high opportunity areas consistent with what i was showing you in the baseline most families when you don't provide the support do not in fact take advantage of it to move to a place where their kids are going to do better in the treatment group that number jumps up to 53 so more than half of them are now living in these high opportunity areas to see that very concretely let's go back to the map of seattle the blue shaded area shows you what we designated as the high opportunity places based on the opportunity of this data basically the top third of census tracts in terms of rates of upward mobility for kids the green pens show you where families in the treatment group chose to move the red pins show you where the family is in the control room and you can see very clearly that it's a completely different distribution critically the green pins are scattered throughout seattle so it's not that there was just like one landlord we found one building and everybody ends up looking there you worry about that potentially changing the workplace ends up happening in practice you can see people who are able to find housing throughout different neighborhoods in seattle um and so effectively what's happening here is on a small scale you're starting to basically desegregate and give lots of low-income kids access to better opportunities to put a number on it concretely tying this back to the earlier work that's been done and the causal effects of growing up in different neighborhoods we estimate that on average the kids in the green pen locations that basically got lucky and ended up moving to those neighborhoods are going to go on to earn about two hundred thousand dollars more over their lifetimes relative to the kids in the in the red paint areas okay so uh to go further in understanding what's going on here and think about you know what types of behavioral factors might be at play you know you might be wondering okay we've induced families to these higher opportunity areas yeah is there a sense in which this policy works on a small scale but if you get so that number that i cited is absolutely a partially investment right based on one kid moving to a different place so from the perspective of one thing here i think that calculation is possible you're totally right but if i were to move everyone from here to here you know surely the model is not that it's like the conditions in the soil or something that are you know it's about the social interactions and things like that and so this is why i was emphasizing that people move in a pretty scattered way i actually think that's fairly important because you know you've got a small number of people entering these new neighborhoods so you might plausibly think at least at a limited scale that you're going to preserve uh preserve the causal effects to some extent now i totally agree with you that if you scale this up dramatically and you've got dramatic shifts in the composition the population you you know who knows how persistent those but you also worry about what happens [Music] and they actually are doing worse i totally so all issues were actually thinking about in other contexts not going to talk about that afterwards okay so so families are moving to these better areas are they making sacrifices on other dimensions to get a sense of whether they sort of work making a mistake in some sense we care not just about whether the kids were doing better or but rather you know do they seem to actually be better off because we've provided this sort of support and so one thing you might wonder about is you know did they end up having to move further away from their relatives from their jobs do they end up having to move to a smaller apartment on any observable dimension you look at we don't really see any trade-offs that seem obvious people are not moving any further before there if anything living inside the larger apartments rather than smaller apartments in the drinking group perhaps as a result of all that if you do surveys exposed to how satisfied people are with their new neighborhoods you can see that people in the treatment group are much happier than people in the control group and they're quite sure they'll stay and in fact when we practice people over time and look interesting whether they do stay in these neighborhoods we see very high rates of persistence in the treatment group in the nucleus so why do i emphasize this you know i think evidently what you learned from what i just showed you is that many families do in fact seem to prefer the high opportunity neighborhoods but are unable to move there without additional assistance so this is what you know tying together the pieces i've been talking about it seems to me that it's not a preference story for why we see so much segregation in american cities a lot of it has to do with a small set of frictions that we can apparently overcome with the type of treatment that i was just talking about so last couple of minutes here let me say a little bit more about what the barriers actually are that families are facing and moving to these higher opportunity areas okay and this is going to speak to some of the questions about the importance of information and so forth so i'm going to take we took two approaches to trying to figure that out what are the underlying behavioral mechanisms the first is to unbundle the treatments that i talked about initially and the second is a qualitative approach working with a team of sociologists to actually talk to families and try to get a sense of what the challenges they face so first let me talk about the second phase of the experiment but we ran the study now with four arms in the second ear instead of two arms there's a control group as before there was a group that received the full set of services that i talked about as before but then there were two intermediate groups one that just received the cash assistance and the information about where the high opportunity places are and one that received would be called partial services not the person who's texting you and offering you to drive you to the neighborhood like super high touch really helping you out but rather more you know here's some generic support on tips on how to talk to landlords and so forth and what you can see is that you really get the big impacts when you do the whole thing if you just give people information just difficult just do some light touch support it doesn't really do what you know that much it does something that doesn't do a whole lot to really get that big impact you have to have the customized assistance and that is very much borne out by the qualitative evidence as well where we conducted the political study of 161 families our collaborator stephanie de luca from johns hopkins sociologist spent two hours with each of these families during the search process and first moved um compiled 8 000 pages of transcripts from from these interviews and to summarize all that in a very brief way i would say two major themes emerge one you can see very clearly the importance of scarcity of bandwidth basically so i was lucky to be able to go on uh some of these interviews with her and you know abstractly sitting in our offices at harvard it might seem kind of weird why the families need these opportunities on the table but when you're in their house and seeing you know you've got three kids two jobs trying to kind of just keep things together the idea of spending time trying to figure out how to move to a totally different neighborhood talk to the landlord there and so forth you can see why that doesn't happen in practice so that i think is one key issue and the second key issue which i think is extremely important in thinking about program design is that each family's needs differ a great deal like any one-size-fits-all thing really doesn't seem like it works different families face different instruments and so just to give you a flavor of that i just want to show you a couple of quotes from the types of conversations stephanie had so jackie for example says when she started working with this counselor it was this whole flood of relief it's the supportive nature of having lots of conversations with megan who's the caseworker who she worked with uh another uh uh person said uh i said i will come with uh when you find a place i will come with you and you will help people out application i'll talk to the landlord emphasizing the importance of having somebody who can kind of advocate on your behalf and help you make that connection with the landlord above and beyond just getting the voucher itself okay so let me conclude by talking first about what i think we learned specifically from this particular study about neighborhood choice and affordable housing and then zooming out of it and talking about what i see is the bigger picture of the here so first you know i think concrete lesson from this particular work is that the residential segregation of low income families in the u.s i think seems to be heavily driven by behavioral frictions rather than deep rooted preferences which i see is a really encouraging result in actually being able to do something about these issues in an increasingly separated and polarized society second uh you know part of i think what we're all interested in through our work in behavioral economics is having an impact on policy that will actually uh you know ultimately maybe change people's lives and i just want to illustrate for the students here how that can happen today even in the very politically polarized climate that we're in we do see in fact that affordable housing policies are being redesigned to reduce these sorts of behavioral frictions in light of the type of evidence that i've just shared with you so just give you a concrete example of that so there was a bill passed with bipartisan support in congress to authorize about 70 million dollars to replicate what we did in seattle in nine other cities across the country those demonstrations are now happening i think even more importantly there's now a bill working its way through congress again with bipartisan sponsors uh which is proposed to spend an additional five billion dollars per year on housing vouchers uh critically you know motivated in a very specific way by the type of evidence we've been talking about here so you can see you know emphasis on access to counseling and case management services engaging new landlords in the housing voucher program all of these points that i think very much come from looking at this and more of a behavioral uh dimension rather than just saying let's give people the cash for some people doctors and sort of be done i think this type of uh reasoning is catching on and can have you know of course quite a bit of scale impact on thousands of kids across the us finally i want to emphasize while i talked about this one very specific example my view is that these sorts of social determinants of choice beyond financial considerations are critical in many other livings and so just to give you a quick example of that here's another very different setting that i'm studying with larry katz and other colleagues so there's lots of work that's been done as another approach to tackling poverty intergenerationally in economics on job training programs to basically uh you know give people the skills needed to get uh jobs in the current economy there's a literature in the past that shows that traditional job training programs that basically give people a set of technical skills uh and then set them out to go find whatever jobs they can are not that successful there's been many many randomized trials done that don't show very good results more recently there's a new wave of these programs that people call sectoral job training programs that have more of this sort of social or behavioral dimension where we have mentors who are helping you out uh helping you find an internship with a company that wants to hire exactly that set of skills and in randomized trials here of a program called gear up you can see that people who are randomly assigned to the program end up earning about 30 more in the years to come after they get the service relative to people who don't and that's once again i think an example of how going beyond just simply providing resources seems extremely important so uh to to end and then zooming out from from these specific examples uh you know i hope some of the takeaways you'll take with you in your own work are one understanding the decision making process of low income households seem real seem really critical for understanding how to tackle poverty well beyond the current tone sort of framework second i think for complex decisions that here also be interested in the perspective of david and doug and onto the tree you know i think there's been a lot of progress made with light touch nudges and defaults in certain contexts for example retirement savings whether it can be incredibly impactful but my instinct for this sort of work is that there are other cases where we need to be willing to kind of roll up our students and go beyond those light touch interventions when you're doing something like figuring out a little myth it's not totally obvious how you solve that with the default i think deeper support that actually costs some money can nevertheless be incredibly impactful and have a very high rate of function and third as i've been kind of illustrating throughout this talk is a separate theme i think the tools of big data very large scale data that we now have access to can help us target these sorts of interventions and monitor their impacts so let me leave you with you know for the next generation of students here some thoughts on the many open and interesting questions that i think were made in this domain so first on the empirical dimension i've shown you some evidence here where i think a picture is starting to emerge where behavioral factors didn't matter where they might matter of us but i think there's a lot more to be learned there what are the situations where just giving people cash is adequate what are the situations where we need to think about uh other types of considerations if we want to address inequality help people rise up properly second going beyond uh the data i think thinking about models of behavioral biases uh that incorporate social factors so how do we think about how you're influenced by those around you above and beyond individual psychological biases uh that you might have seems extremely important i think from other work we're doing with social network data and so forth my instinct is these social factors seem to seem quite important and then you know coming to i think one of the questions doug raised on how to think about these issues in equilibrium a lot of that empirical analysis by its nature partners of the strength of our powerful methods at the moment tends to focus on partially equilibrium issues i think it's extremely important to understand the role of markets you know things like the shrouded attributes work how do we think about what firms are doing in this context to think about like for-profit colleges that emerge to try to fill a market need but i think actually probably made things worse uh rather rather than better what happens when you have some sophisticated agents and others who are less sophisticated what distributional impacts uh does that have i think there are tons of interesting questions there and i hope some of you will explore those so we have uh considerable flexibility in this happening on time so if you can folks have questions for lots of us now i'm still trying to understand what the mistake is of that possible side so you show that the decision on where to live is extremely consequential there's a higher return to making the decision right you also show that many of these households have low bandwidth they have very complicated lives and you also show that just providing information doesn't seem to be enough so i'm wondering do you think they are underestimating their return to spending one day looking for even one week or whatever they want back searching for their right neighborhood what is it that they seem to be not making the right decision even though they return to the news so far yeah it's a good question and i mean to me partly that question is about how you model the kinds of constraints that people are are facing so my sense from talking with folks is it's not a simple underestimation of returns it's kind of like how do you go about doing this when you are not well-versed in that environment right it's all it's sort of what is you have to have a certain way of speaking you know what's kind of in your consideration set is the set of possibilities what exposed i think from our perspective may seem obvious that you go talk to this landlord in this particular way and look at this sort of neighborhood actually in practice i think people feel very hesitant to do that so even if i were to say look i give you this amount of time and ask you to dedicate this time to figure this out yourself and i show you if it has a very high return my sense from talking with somebody's families is they genuinely you know would have a hard time figuring out how to do that and if you have somebody who does have that experience come and help you and advocate for you and say uh you know you you know we can figure this out together that kind of psychological support itself uh seems quite valuable i think it's a little bit different than what we typically capture in behavioral economics models but strikes me as being quite important in practice and i think just you know even if you respect yourself i suspect most of us in our lives can think of someone who's had a great influence on shaping our own trajectories and i think it's that type of thing that seems to matter we have an ideal sense of how largely indulgent response of parents upon moving from other neighborhoods i was thinking of stability you showed that many parents say that they do plan to stay in the new neighborhood whereas they might have been you know always about to try to move or not felt at home because of the bad circumstances i was wondering just upon you know feeling that you're you're settled like now you can stay at the good place how do you indulgently invest more or less i guess more yeah i mean i think what you're getting at is absolutely right that the neighborhoods may have a causal effect not just on kids but on parents in fact there's good evidence from earlier studies of the moving to opportunities experiment for example by larry katz and others showing that the mental health of parents and grooms greatly when they moved to uh some of these neighborhoods and i think it reflects exactly that you see a lot of people saying things like i'm much less worried about crying things are more stable and as a result i may be able to spend more time with my kids which then ends up helping the kids independent of the direct neighborhood effect as well so i think all of that is right how important is the advocacy mechanism um something i'm thinking about is like new york city co-ops oftentimes you have to be like introduced to like the golf board in order to like approve the application at all there's this whole idea but the way that you perform and have language can be very coded and that can make people very much get blocked out into other ways uh and so i'm curious about how much of the um the advocacy is split between having the like the representative there at all versus like learning all these ways of like fitting into a like maybe like a white neighborhood for example yeah yeah um i think it's it's a bit of both and you're right to bring up the role of race here so one of the things we were worried about is that uh the higher opportunity places at the moment tend to be predominantly white areas and so you might worry you know black and hispanic families are basically asking them to consider moving to predominantly white areas would they want to do that it turns out when you look in the data and you see effects that are almost as large frequent flights that are almost as large for black pensions so they are particularly many of these services but i think the advocacy component was very important there and in particular connecting them with other black and hispanic families who happen to live in these neighborhoods was also um very important so my sense is some of it is about you know speaking the right code things like that but actually having the person with you is incredibly uh valuable as well [Music] [Music] because the more you're like further away from the neighborhood like your potential neighbors the harder it might yeah it's i agree with your intuition um i in practice within the sample you're not going to have a ton of energy income because remember this is a pretty low income group of folks who are buying for a housing method so we did split the sample you know above versus below medium income within the sample and we don't find very heterogeneous effects but i don't really see that as speaking to your broader question because we don't have middle class families here to see if they would really uh respond yeah already if we explain it in the cities that are naturally larger [Music] did you find me like yeah so that's a crucial issue so let me say a couple things on that so first you know one thing i would encourage all of you like the qualitative evidence it's not typical in economics but i actually think just going out and talking to people in addition to the quantitative stuff we did that interplay back and forth was incredibly valuable and understanding what might be going on and you're absolutely right that everything i think really rests on how much the caseworkers care about this whole thing so the reason i think this worked so well is it's not a huge number of case workers it was like six or eight people and they were super committed to getting this to work right so they uh as i was saying you know we're texting people at 10 p.m on the weekends they were driving them around they really believed in the mission and one of the things they were able to achieve i think is not just you know coming back to the brokering question and the advocacy it turns out that not only was that helpful for the clients but what we found afterwards is that the landlord's perceptions themselves seem to have changed so we started to get landlords after the trial contacting the scale housing authority and asking you know can i get more of your tenants which is very unusual because i think they managed to convince landlords that you can do something that's really meaningful for the next generation simply by renting your apartment and people feel motivated by it by that kind of thing and so all of that i think is a reflection of how skilled these case workers were and how invested they were now the challenge i think that creates for policy morphology and this is i think an interesting issue think about for video economists is how do you deal with scaling in that kind of situation right so that's precisely the type of situation where if it was just about giving people cash like we can multiply the child tax credit by three or not and at some level it's a mechanical thing but taking this to other cities taking this nationwide you know at some point you start to get people to view it more as a job and are not invested in texting your attention and then you're going to start to see very different treatment effects and so thinking for instance if some events work on site selection bias and things like that i think it's going to be very important that methods continually track the impacts of these sorts of programs and really understand when do you get people invested in providing the sort of i was wondering whether some people didn't want to move because they they were not entirely sure for how long they would be yeah so that's you know i think it's interesting to understand the decisions of the forty you know five percent of people who chose not to move as well and there's actually some qualitative work that stephanie and her team are doing to try to understand that at the moment so one potential explanation is the types of things you're talking about on uncertainty another explanation that seems quite important is just a family ties to certain neighborhoods i'll give you an example so seattle has a big ethiopian community and we find that a number of the people who chose not to move to higher opportunities despite being given this assistance come from ethnic communities like that where they say look like i'm you know english is not my language sure like you see in the data my kids might do better here but i want to stay in a place that's familiar to me and to me what that underscores is the value of taking a choice-based approach where we try to expand people's choices as best we can but ultimately leave it to them recognizing that there might be heterogeneous treatment effects from these kinds of moves you might have thought of a different approach where you could say forget about all the stuff of providing people's support let's just mandate that you can only get the voucher if you move to obviously as a higher opportunity so give you a very strong financial incentive to do that and my sense from this is precisely for these sorts of reasons that might actually backfire relative to trying to improve the choice architecture and letting people do what seems best for them right so i think we should
