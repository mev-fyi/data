okay so jim just told you about the origins of the working paper series and i'm going to fill in some of the details and my atoncas is titled work in progress and there are actually three different meanings to that and the one that you might not think of is that this really is a work in progress and it's going to continue and one of the reasons is that i i thank alex who's sitting back there for providing uh the data uh that i'm using but as he knows um this is a little uh we're we're still working on it right and uh so some of what i'm gonna talk to you about uh we just have some new findings recent findings and things that we're going to have to work on to get even better uh information and since we're going to be celebrating in a couple of years the 100th anniversary of the nbr we have some time to work on this so uh so we owe a tremendous amount to the mbr working paper series and prior to the internet and as i look around the room there are some people in the room who don't know what that means prior to the internet the series filled a really huge gap in our ability to disseminate knowledge prior to publication that's that's really really important so economics has differed from many other disciplines for a long time and and in many ways continues to do so both the sciences on the one hand and the humanities on the other have been in many ways far behind in terms of disseminating knowledge as it's being produced an interesting issue about why that is the case okay so the mbr working paper series as as jim just said started uh some time before the nbr uh moved one of its offices or opened an office in in cambridge it always had an office in new york where it's where it began where its corporate headquarters are and it opened the office in in cambridge around 7778 and so this is the essentially the flow of working papers and and jim just said a bit about that uh the series given here begins uh with 1978 when the first seven nbr programs were established and of course everyone knows what d-a-e-i-t-i-l-s mf pr and the rest mean okay so um so these were the original seven programs we just heard that of these three of these seven three of them efg and ls and pe which originally was not called pe it was called taxation um uh have they they are the largest today and they have the the largest number of papers the number of working papers per year increased over time from about a hundred per year at the outset to about 200 in 1980 then to about 350 a year to the mid 1990s and now more than a thousand plus per year and a very interesting question to which we would have to do a lot more research on is why has the number of papers increased exactly what isn't and so for one thing the number of researchers has increased uh within each program and the number of programs has been expanded uh today there are um more than uh 1300 ras and and firfs uh and um and so that has increased and what i'm going to say at the towards the end is that the number of authors per paper has also um uh increased and the number the fraction of authors who are non-nbr researchers is is quite high on average today it's over 40 percent so we we need more research and understanding the production function behind the increase in in papers okay now the number of programs as i said expanded from the original seven in 1978 to 12 by 1991 and then increased by six more jim and i are still trying to date two of these programs h.e and ellie which began um as jim said prior to uh when marty brought the bureau to cambridge but today there are 20 programs and about a dozen what are called working groups okay so as i said the precise reasons for the increase in papers requires a lot more analysis this is a project any one of you can work on on the working paper production function so more researchers means more papers but there's more co-authorship and there are also more non-nbr authors in addition so we were just talking about the number of papers per year or per per period that people have put out but over time as glenn is going to discuss working papers papers themselves have become a lot longer so not surprisingly we have the cumulative number is ever expanding of course we're celebrating number twenty thousand where this line goes up to uh and if this equation can be used in a predictive manner and i don't bet a single dollar on it okay uh so uh this is my prediction right now uh number uh 50 000 is going to be issued in january of 2030 okay but lots of questions will the internet change the role of the mbr working paper series it doesn't look like it has we've had a long uh history so far and it doesn't look like it has so i'd like to make a few points about this series and its larger role in the discipline first of all is is programs per working paper so first of all the number of programs per working paper has increased so programs means that let's say i am in the development of the american economy program the dae but much of what i write is also labor studies some of it may be education so i'll include those programs uh on my working paper to indicate to people that that's it's essentially like using jl codes to indicate to people that they might be interested and when we put them on the on the website we will we will note that to individuals in the program so but what this means with this increase is that the number it means that economics is seen through the lens of the nbr working paper series has actually become more eclectic okay rather than being more specialized as we believe we are and maybe you know the rest of economics is we empiricists have become more varied and more eclectic now if you think that this is i'm sure you're thinking this is just a simple artifact of the fact that we have more programs if you think that's the case consider the following so what i've done here is i've picked one program one of the largest which is public economics pe and i've done this two different ways so i've held the number of programs constant so the red line or the pink line gives programs listed for papers that give public economics as one of the programs we don't know if it's quote the major program or a minor program it's just one of the programs the blue line holds the number of programs fixed at the 13 programs existing in 1993 and as you can see they're both increasing so it's not an artifact of the increase in the number of programs not surprising to anyone here is that the number of authors per working paper has also increased and it has increased as well for the three largest programs the programs that um that jim mentioned p-e-l-s and e-f-g and finally the fraction of authors who are nbr members and this is conditional on there being at least one nbr affiliate on the list and the reason is because the if there isn't one it's it's a conference paper so this takes out most of the conference papers and so the number the fraction of authors who are nbr members decreases with the number of authors and is about 60 percent on average in 2013 we can only do this right now for 2013 because we only have current membership in the bureau we don't have historic retrospective membership which is what we're going to put together at some point okay so um so the the point here is that the mbr working paper series is rather open to non-nbr researchers and in addition there are more authors than just nbr family members this gets back to the production function issue okay so in conclusion i received my first working papers when i was 14 years old of course i mean the legal document a minor had to obtain uh to get employment little did i know then just how important working papers would be in my life thanks
