so actually i i scott's a vintage there that paper would have been with him because i was actually not a member of the nbr until two years ago so my actual first mbr paper would have been more in the 18 thousands than that which is probably just as well because if i joined when scott had joined i would uh have made that top 10 list of most working papers where making duran ashmaglow kind of a minnow in that field and done my and done a wonderful job of bringing down all of glenn's citation although one of those papers would have actually been possibly the most read paper in economics that i wrote many years ago on um classic rejected articles so so there's some balance there but i must say i i having watched that field and participated in the study of the publishing process in economics i i got to hand it to glenn most of us whine about how long it takes for things to get published during that process glenn actually ran more aggressions to understand it so kudos to him on that but i think actually that brings a very critical question as he already raised about the role of the nbr working paper series for whatever we want to talk about it is now in a because the publication process has slowed so much uh for various reasons and in many respects is is uh is there's a case to be made that it's becoming increasingly irrelevant for the actual dissemination of economic knowledge at least amongst researchers in the united states and canada we should think very carefully about this existing initial role of the nbr working paper series obviously as jim pointed out that it was initially conceived to solve a lag problem itself uh but that doesn't necessarily mean uh that it should stay static even as that problem has actually in fact grown so um let's so basically these peer review lags are what motivate me here um and moreover there's an issue now the working papers are not themselves peer-reviewed and it's something we should actually think about and and be concerned about because uh you know i had one example that appeared in a uh discussion towards the doing of a paper yesterday these nbi working papers are of course being cited and used as evidence for things like critical us supreme court cases so it should concern us that we are only using as the selection process the club that is you have a achieved membership for the mber as opposed to things that would improve the papers and you know in my experience having had even several of these and i think everybody has we know there are situations in which we've put out nbr working papers and they have been improved by the publication process and other things as well so we shouldn't shy away from that um you know some are discussed at conferences we do have some processes i suspect there's another effect as well i think some people may well delay their nbr working paper putting it out there precisely because they know that's going to get the hit on their email and it's going to get the hit on the downloads so there's some delay so maybe people will submit it after first review or something like that but again if that's occurring that's damaging our desire to get the knowledge and the information out quickly as well and to balance those things um so does publication mean anything so so um the other theme i want to bring into that is now you know we've got 20 000 working papers there was some attempt here to understand you know where they're going and who's downloading and things like that but albeit extremely imperfectly uh you know a lot of being downloaded from outside uh the united states i must admit when i went back to australia after my phd 20 years ago the first thing i was told to do was subscribe to the nbr working paper series it was a significant expense they used to arrive by the way on paper and the little yellow ones individually they were all set individually no one sort of stacked it up and sent me one a week even you know one packet a week or arrive individually which made it quite an expensive deal fortunately the internet came along and solved my particular problem but you know we want to keep track of these things you know what happens when you submit a working paper you can actually revise them but you know some of these papers have been out there for a while do we want to keep the previous versions on do we want to identify where they've gone and other things like that so if you look here i i picked a an old you know a four-year-old paper just at random just to show you what the site looks like because you probably haven't sort of thought about it that much but if you actually look here so we've got the we've got the abstract and the number the publication date we've got a pdf download and we've got an email that's all fine um uh they've removed the uh how long it will take you to download at 28.8k modems used to be there that used to be very relevant that's good but um and they've got some some other record-keeping things including where it's been published but you'll notice there's no link to that published paper it's just the the publisher you would have to delve back into google to find it and then we have the very amazon like users who downloaded this paper also downloaded something as well which is which is clearly an excellent feature but in a sense and then i compared this to things like archive and other things that have been building up as repositories elsewhere and actually it's the state of the art i mean this is a this is as good as these things get but actually if you were to pacify any of our you know computer science uh friends or anyone designing something for the dissemination of information or you know yelp or amazon itself this is uh way behind the times okay you know you would have things like different versions of the working paper you'd have links to all these other things you'd have ability to share on social media for whatever that is worth but it matters you would have other things comments even if you were going to have comments and reviews and other things from nbr uh associates only you could have those things um you know we'd have to it's at least worth our ask worth asking the question of whether we should have that um you would have then links to this where was this paper cited would also be useful why isn't that being tied you can think of all of those things and i've listed a few of these options here but what i want to just hop on right at the beginning is the issue of opening it right towards the end sorry you only have a few more minutes ah okay there you go okay i'll survive okay very good um sorry nothing yes well it's my last slide that's okay um so is is the issue of open access um you may not realize it um even i believe the sinesta hotel here is within the nbr remit you can get free working papers anyone who stays at the semester can access any working paper for free the move ahead of that out of the protected zone which is most of the world um you uh you have to pay and it's five dollars for a download and ten dollars for a physical paper and that you have to do that it is well worth uh asking ourselves if that is a at all a good idea um that is certainly away from trends and not what you'd expect um now i'm sure jim can tell us about how much it is funding and let's face it if it's funding the infinite salary we have to pay rob shannon then screw the rest of the world [Laughter] so uh so we can include conference comments conference discussions why are why are those hidden maybe they can be brought out we can have links to data sets we can have different versions we can have links published works we have links to press and summaries this stuff is getting out there the one thing i have noticed and not everybody because i'm a blogger i pay attention to this when that working paper email goes out the summaries of those paper appear in the new york times in the washington post vox.com and a whole lot of other blogs immediately having done this myself i got called by 10 journalists the day recently the worker paper of mine came out that has an effect maybe we should be keeping track of that impact as well just for arguments sake just to to know that these things are being reported correctly and things like that citations and then the final thing that i want to leave you with is regarding peer review so nbr working papers exist outside the publication process that means they don't get peer review they don't get editing scott will laugh at that because clearly my own work would benefit from that um they don't get any of it you know things like typesetting other other other things that would enhance the working papers uh either in readability or other things like that they just basically come straight from the computer of the uh of the researcher straight out into press now there's nothing wrong with that it's it's it's not high in transaction costs but we should at least ask ourselves what we are losing and i can imagine you know for editing you could probably claim a fraction of a fee from people's research accounts elsewhere to fund that sort of thing with regard to peer review why is the first round of a review done at some random journal only to be done again is there a mechanism we could set up that the first round was done internal to the nber with those reports anonymously made available to any journal that you might submit it afterwards nobody would end up doing more reports no one would end up and we wouldn't wouldn't we would start to do something to address the slowdown in the publication process rather than just sit there and watch it happen thanks okay okay
