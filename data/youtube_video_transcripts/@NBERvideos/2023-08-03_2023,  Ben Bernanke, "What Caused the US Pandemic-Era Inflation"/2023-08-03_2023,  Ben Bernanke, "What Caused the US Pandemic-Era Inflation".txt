well thank you Jim and John I have to give a paper oh okay um this is work with Olivier Blanchard who may be monitoring us from Paris I'm not sure and it's about inflation and I'm the question uh what caused it may be um a little bit ambitious relative as well but we do find some stuff that I think will be useful at least in helping to understand the inflation so here's some uh overview of what I'm going to do as you know uh there was very large fiscal action in the U.S during the covet pandemic uh at least at the headline level total fiscal spending in the U.S during the pandemic was four and a half times relative to GDP the size of the post-gfc fiscal package arra this was enormous really big um and when the American Rescue plan was put out by President Biden shortly after his inauguration another 1.9 trillion uh there was a lot of debate among economists about whether or not this would be inflationary so they were as I say here two views at the time um the inflation optimists uh said well okay there may be some excess output Gap here there may be some tightening in the labor market but we know the Phillips curve is flat we know inflation expectations are well anchored so we wouldn't expect to see very much inflation that was a very common view and it held by the way on Constitution Avenue um the inflation pessimists which included my co-author Olivier and also of course Larry Summers and others said well wait a minute this is a huge fiscal impulse we're not confident that Phillips curve will remain stable under these conditions you're not confident expectations will remain constant uh so we could get uh we could get inflation now it turns out that both sides were sort of right and sort of wrong um in that the uh the the pessimists were right that inflation of course came in fact it was more than they expected uh but they were wrong and the optimists were right in that it the inflation did not come from an overheated labor market or an overheated economy okay uh it came instead from shocks to prices given wages so as you know obvious ones include oil price shocks food price shocks and the like and I'll be going into that um so essentially what we're going to show in a very simple model I'm a little embarrassed how simple this is um in a very simple model we're going to show that the most of the inflation and most of it up till now has been driven by product Market shocks and not labor market shocks however uh product Market shocks we will show are very transitory while labor market shocks are much more persistent and as a result over time the labor market shocks are becoming an increasing share of the remaining inflation which suggests that um getting this uh eliminating the inflation getting back down to Target is not going to be free okay so we're going to look at a very simple traditional model Tobin would like this model of wage price Dynamics it's an aggregative model we're not going to be worrying about used car prices or anything like that we're going to be looking at the economy as a whole and it's going to have four equations nominal wages prices and we rely a lot on expectations we're going to have an equation for short run inflation expectations and one for long run inflation expectations okay and we'll see that wages depend on the state of the labor market on inflation expectations which affect what wages people ask for and what we call a ketchup effect the idea that if you inflation was higher than you thought that you're going to try and push to catch up and you know get that back prices are going to depend on wages and other cost shocks and expectations will depend on history and current inflation now very simple model but we will see that uh it both in its pure form and when it's estimated it actually can uh capture some fairly complicated Dynamics and I want to emphasize that as I get to it so so here's the model again very simple this is the wage equation uh the the first line here says that nominal wages depend on expected prices plus something called the real aspiration wage I'll talk about that in a minute plus uh something depends on X is the tightness of the labor market so it could be unemployment rate it could be a variety of things okay so that's the wage equation we're going to assume that the aspiration wage which we want to think of as being the focal point for wage bargaining and it's a real terms um or maybe uh uh the long run equilibrium real wage in the labor market we're going to assume that it adjusts gradually uh uh where today's aspiration wage is Alpha times last periods aspiration wage plus one minus Alpha times last periods real wage plus stuff okay now again this is by far the toughest math in the whole paper okay now combining those two equations you get this one this is our wage equation um and uh there's two cases I'd like to mention here uh suppose that uh Alpha is zero Alpha remember is the um adjustment uh of aspiration wages if Alpha is equal to zero then this says that nominal wage growth think of these as log nominal wages nominal wage growth is equal to expected inflation this term goes away plus beta times the titans of Labor Market in other words uh Elementary first year uh Phillips curve okay if Alpha is greater than zero you get a little bit different uh result you get uh there's also a term here which we call the catch-up term which says that wages will also respond to previous uh mistakes about inflation if if you know you're bargaining for your wage for 2022 and in 2021 gas prices went up a lot and reduce your standard of living you know you're going to press to get some of that back and that's the catch-up term this also Alpha being greater than zero also has the property that uh that wages depend both on the level of tightness and also the difference of tightness to some extent okay so that's that's the wage equation uh that is the hard one easy One prices are going to depend on wages of course we're suppressing any constant terms plus some shocks or indifferences inflation depends on wage growth plus changes in the shocks okay now in our application the cost shocks are the obvious ones Energy prices food prices and we're going to include the term to capture supply chain issues sexual shortages and so on okay now the expectations are going to play an important role here uh let me start with the bottom equation for long run inflation expectations so Pi star here means long run it's not the central bank's Target it's a endogenous variable it means long run but people think inflation is going to be five to ten years from now and we're going to assume that it adjusts adaptively to last periods long run expectations plus it's influenced by last periods inflation actual inflation and then short run inflation expectations here depend with a parameter Delta on Long Run expectations so there's a tendency for sure when expectations to gravitate towards long run plus also it responds to current uh or last periods uh inflation okay so that's again simple adaptive uh expectations um a point I want to make it'll come back is that when you write down the whole model for equation model Pi star is not determined you can pick any level for pi star and what it means in practice is that if you have a period of high inflation that drives up Pi star then you can find a new equilibrium with pi star higher okay so there's no natural rate of inflation in this model and in particular the usual Central Bank concern about keeping inflation longer inflation expectations anchored matters in this model because uh if you don't you're going to have a permanent increase uh in the inflation rate okay now this is again a very simple model but it actually has kind of some interesting properties even in this simple theoretical form okay so here we're looking at how inflation responds to a uh a one-time oil price shock and these are this is just the impulse response function the dynamic response it turns out to depend on the parameters in an interesting way what I call here uh weak feedback is the blue line is what happens when um there's no catch-up effect or very low catch-up effect and inflation expectations are very well anchored if those two things hold then a shock to prices from an oil price shock for example it's not going to be very persistent at all and it's going to return quickly to uh to the Baseline in contrast strong feedback means that there's a powerful uh catch-up effect I I think in the 1970s and colas and wage contracts that you know that make up for losses in previous buying power and inflation expectations are not very well anchored that is the the parameters I showed you in the last slide are such that uh expectations respond fairly strongly to to current inflation in that case a one-time inflation shock is going to have quite a persistence uh is going to have quite a persistent effect and in fact it'll have a permanent effect because this is going to affect long run inflation expectations which will create a new equilibrium at a higher level of inflation likewise uh the model has interesting implications for what happens if there's a tightening of the labor market which is an increase in the X remember from the wage equation uh strong feedback is the case where inflation expectations are not well anchored and there's a catch-up term in that case you get a much stronger and more persistent response of inflation to a tight labor market whereas if in the other case where there's no catch-up effect in inflation expectations are well anchored you get a much smaller and uh equally persistent actually but uh but but less uh big effect okay so we're going to estimate this model and we want to think of it as uh an s-var a structural VAR um and what that does what we're going to do basically is very it's very close not strictly a structured viewer but it's very close what we're going to do essentially is we're going to use the model I just described as the contemporaneous relationship among these variables and then we're essentially going to have uh unrestricted lags of all of all the variables in the equation so that's going to allow for very free Dynamics okay so we're going to use quarterly data from 1990 we've we've played with it back to 1982 and using different data because some of this doesn't go back but anyway you get it doesn't change things very much we're going to use the employment cost index for wages the CPI for prices it doesn't matter if we use the pce we're using uh the Cleveland feds expectation series which goes back to the early 80s which is a constructed series which includes both consumer expectations and Market uh inflation expectations um when we so it's not truly a real-time measure when we use instead the survey professional forecaster real-time forecast we get again very similar result now an interesting question is what how do we measure labor market tightness uh that turns out to be that this is something that the Federal Reserve had a lot of trouble with in 2021 2022 and let me show you why this is what's called the beverage curve which I'm sure you're all familiar with uh on the y-axis is vacancies or job openings on the x-axis is uh unemployed people or rates these are in rates okay and normally the beverage curve is downward sloping the higher the unemployment rate the fewer vacancies employers need to post in order to hire workers um but a very interesting thing is that during the pandemic the the two lines at the bottom are pre-pandemic beverage curves the one the uh this one is the uh during the in within the pandemic is the beverage curve and this is the latest number so it is coming down a little bit but there was a big shift up here uh you know during the pandemic and it's very interesting to talk about why that's the case you know people had higher reservation wages they didn't get called back to their old firm there was a lot of reallocation but I'm not going to get into that very much here but simply point out again that uh there has been a very big shift uh more so than other countries interest interestingly enough uh so the question is what's the right measure of Labor Market tightness when you have this kind of shift and what I want to argue is that just picking the unemployment rate or U minus U star is not such a good idea so suppose you know you suppose your natural rate is six percent just sake of argument and think of drawing a vertical line at six percent well before the pandemic that line would have intercepted here okay and would have implied vacancies like that so that would have suggested um a very you know balanced labor market with vacancies and unemployment similar but given the movement of the beverage curve the same unemployment rate now reflects a much higher level of vacancies so it seems to us that a situation where for a given number of people looking for work there's a lot more job openings that's a tighter labor market even if the unemployment rate is held constant and so that was very quick but that is why basically we're going to use V over uh we're not religious about this there are other measures one could use like quit rates and so on we've tried some of them uh vu over U works pretty well for the United States but um uh and and it it works about as well also in the pre-pandemic era as the uh unemployment rate but that's what we're going to use as the measure of Labor Market tightness so again in the spirit of structural vars we're going to use a contemporaneous relations defined by the model um it's a it's actually a recursive model wages depend on on lag variables uh prices depend on lag wages prices depend on current wages inflation expectations depend on prices and so sequentially it's recursive um so in contemporaneous terms the the model is recursive uh but then in each equation we're going to allow sort of unrestricted Dynamics including four unrestricted lags of each independent variable and all endogenous and exogenous variables that appear in the equation so this is going to have a lot of free Dynamics when we estimate the effects okay now there's one more thing to talk about before looking at the results and I'm making really good progress here so there's gonna be plenty of time for questions I think um which is the problem of shortages so we all know that there was a lot of discussion of Supply chains and and other problems created by the pandemic and here is an example this is uh these data from Fred are about uh the automobile industry in the United States and you can see that uh after recovering after the lockdown was over production recovered to pre-pandemic levels but then it began to decline here at less than 9 million annual rate it was almost a quarter uh 25 less than than the normal levels of substantial reduction in production uh which we know was not uh it was not from uh decline in demand because you can see here what happened to Auto inventories so here we are in the third quarter of 2021 Auto inventories are at rock bottom because people were trying to buy cars and there were no cars available uh you all know the story The semiconductors Etc uh and what do you think that does to prices when there's a strong demand and no Supply well here are here's inflation quarterly inflation uh in new vehicle prices and you can see the big jump uh right around the same period and of course this this generalized uh and there were there were supply chain problems in in many Industries and even Industries where there was not unusual supply chain issues there were there was the question of normal capacity people came out of the pandemic with a lot of spending money from the from the fiscal policy and from savings over the pandemic and there just wasn't enough uh Supply uh to meet the demands in many sectors so how are we going to measure that well we tried various things there's various indices the New York fed has an index which we tried and a variety of other things the thing that worked for us was looking at Google Trends and Counting the number of times that people uh searched for the word shortage and that there it is uh there's uh blue line is Chip shortage the red line is car shortage and you can see how it lines up very nicely um we found by the way this works for other countries too not staking you know everything on this there are other measures one could use but this one seems to work pretty well if anything it works too well and as you see that the shortage variable is in fact very influential Ben can I ask yes can I bring you back actually two slides to the Dynamics I wanted to ask a slightly dplc question so the structural equations some of them had lag terms in them yes and then here you're saying you have unrestricted lags um does that mean that you have the lags that are in the structural equations and then you add other lags or is it only the diagonal terms in the VAR yeah let me show you let me show you the results so take a look at this equation here oops uh this over here uh well let me go back I jumped ahead I'm sorry okay this is the wage equation okay so wages depend on uh V over U they depend on the catch-up term uh and they depend on inflation when your expectations and we also have a productivity term a moving average productivity term which I'm not going to talk about very much here so those are the things that that wages uh depend on in the model but in the actual estimation here are the lags that we use we use uh four lags of the variable being you know which is the dependent variable what growth in wages we use four lags of V over U we use four lags of the catch-up term we use four legs of the one year expectation so what we're doing is allowing essentially these contemporaneous relations to occur dynamically over time so that's that's what we're doing um if a variable doesn't appear in an equation at all it doesn't appear as a lag either but if it appears in the equation we allow four lags and it adds a lot to the Dynamics so so here's the wage equation we found this might be a good time to mention that since we put out this paper we have uh within weeks we had uh a project going with uh seven other central banks all of whom are doing this for their own country and the nice thing about the Simplicity is the fact that we make all our programs available is that they can do it for their own country in like a week and so we we just had a call the other day where we compared our results to those of uke ECB Bank of Japan et cetera et cetera anyway one of the things that we find uh is that the wage equation is is the tricky one is the Hard One to fit uh this is simply the fitted value the the the the uh the red is the simply the out of sample fitted value of the equation so it's estimated up to before the pandemic and then this is what the fitted value during the pandemic the blue line is the actual the red line is the fitted it this kind of gets the general Trend right but it misses some short run movements uh and in particular the biggest Miss is right here which where the lockdown led to unemployment rates that were 14 or more and so the model says well that ought to really kill wages and that didn't really happen because they're presumably some constraints on you know nominal wages falling et cetera et cetera so this is not a perfect fit but it's probably good enough for what we want to do and the features here that I want to point out two things one is this is the relationship between nominal wage growth and V over U and uh the uh these are the piece statistics for this is this one is for the hypothesis that the sum of the lags is zero and that's rejected and this is for the hypothesis that each of the individual coefficients is equal to zero join this joint hypothesis that's also rejected won't go into details but basically what we do find here is a pretty strong and pretty stable Phillips curve that wages respond pretty predictably to uh vacancy to unemployment ratios here's the catch-up term remember if this is positive that means that people are trying to get back their lost buying power uh and we both here and in other countries we find it pretty much close to zero that there is just not much evidence that people are being able to get back their lost buying power in subsequent wage negotiations this is the price equation yes if you look at the 70s the cash up is a slightly lower frequency than that it takes a couple of years for wages to catch it so is it possible that you just don't have enough lags here to to capture the catch-up certainly worth trying um you know certainly we're trying I I I at some point it becomes difficult to tell whether it's catch up or other factors that are moving it okay this is the price equation uh and I just want to point out a couple of things one is that as you would expect the CPI responds very strongly and very statistically significantly to growth in the price of energy so energy price shocks obviously move inflation around a lot this by the way is going to capture not only the Direct effects but also secondary effects you know on Goods that rely on energy in one way or another this is the food uh indicator again powerful effects on inflation and shortages which is again the this Google Trends thing uh that some of the variables is not significant but jointly the hypothesis that each of them is zero is easily rejected so there are some lags at which shortages are very important and we'll see in that in the simulations that they make a big difference so this is the uh actual and simulated inflation for the pandemic period and here we it hit it pretty well we capture not only the general Trend but also these are quarterly numbers by the way so that's why it looks so Jagged this is not annual 12 month numbers okay so uh I'm not going to say much about this one argument one could make would be that fiscal policy did not create inflation by giving people money to spend but rather it contributed to a global boom in commodity prices and that in turn uh was a source of inflation as we see and so what we did here to try and test that was look at 19 raw Commodities that are in the crb index take the first principal component that's the blue and then compare it to the actual uh CPI energy and food indices and the results are kind of mixed I mean the energy uh prices do seem to go along pretty well with that first principle component um food does not it's been a big puzzle why food prices have continued to rise even though the raw materials that are used to make food have come down um so we don't have we don't draw strong conclusions here I mean the other possibility is that there are other things like General reopening um uh fiscal policy elsewhere and so on that we're contributing to this so uh if you think we have not explained uh the commodity price boom you are correct uh this is the these are the equations for inflation expectations and the most interesting variables are we show that generally they're quite well anchored but the most interesting variables this is for the long run inflation expectations this says one percentage point of extra inflation uh in a given quarter only raises long run inflation Expectations by 0.025 percentage points so long-run expectations seem to be very well anchored sure when expectations are more responsive a one percent increase in uh inflation uh during a quarter raises uh people's uh short run uh expectations actually when your expectations by 12 12 basis points so that is that is more responsive and the there are the fits of uh long run and short run uh inflation expectations notice the the um axes are different there's much more response obviously in the short run uh very rationally uh so that um that's that works pretty well um now so now we have an empirical model one question about this yes the fit uh so you showed us a number of results for the uh covid period which is obviously where most of the action is in inflation but if I understand correctly you estimated the the model back to 1990 was the was the fit of the model stable uh in relation to so so it's a good question and when we need to explore further it's stable if you ask the question statistically can you reject that the extra period is the same coefficients as 1990 through 2019 sometimes yes sometimes no wait but but the thing that seems striking to us is that whether we use the um when we use the pre-2020 coefficients we fit out of sample the variables pretty well and that seems that in terms of the economics that it's pretty close yeah I was thinking also about some anecdotes like the commodity price boom that occurred uh you know right preceding the the Great Recession in 2006 you know would be kind of interesting to know whether the model you know fits well the impact on inflation during that period yeah so one of my first questions to Olivier when we were talking about this was well we had oil price booms you know in previous periods and we didn't get inflation and the answer is right here conveniently enough um so remember uh in the theoretical model if you have so-called weak feedback which means not much catch up and very well anchored inflation expectations then uh in shocks the prices tend to be very short-lived okay and the only reason that oil prices for example were a big contributor to the recent inflation was because they kept rising and rising and Rising but one single shock would the effects would diminish quickly and so if you apply this model back to movements for example there was a big increase in oil prices I recall very well in 2008 um it was didn't last very long though and so the effects on CPI diminish quickly that's all consistent with these are the empirical impulse responses and they correspond very closely to the weak feedback case because what we found recall was that there was not much catch up or any and we also found pretty well anchored inflation expectations so we wouldn't expect this hypothetical impulse these are the impulse responses of the model to a shock to Energy prices food prices or the shortage and they they they're very they're very transitory so you need consistent uh ongoing oil price increases to have inflation from oil prices and so it does in fact fit period that you're thinking of pretty well and I I should add although I don't show it here that we've gone back to 1982 but to do that we had to use average hourly earnings instead of ECI and that has other issues that um okay so uh and then the same exercise we can look at the impulse response so the on the bottom there this is the empirical impulse response of the and note that I'm now using the full model I'm now doing uh uh General equilibrium if you will all the equations simultaneously are being solved and all the lags are being taken into account Etc uh so the model predicts that with a weak feedback which is what we found that the response uh of of inflation to labor market tightness will still be persistent but it won't be as strong and in the numbers by coincidence here are actually about exactly the same as they are as they are here so we get uh the theoretical implications show up you know very nicely and to summarize them uh shocks to prices in product markets um uh tend to be very transitory both in the theoretical model under week feedback and also in our empirical results whereas shocks the labor markets tend to persist how strong they are depends on the parameters but they continue to persist as long as the labor market remains tight okay now I'm coming to the punch line now when you take this model you can calculate impulse response functions so you can take a shock to the oil price and you can see how it works its way through the whole system including all the lags and how it affects inflation over the next however many periods okay and because everything is linear in this model if you take the impulse response functions of every uh variable in every period including the residuals to the equations they all add up to actual inflation okay now what we did was we ignored we decided to ignore the residuals so we throw those out and we simply ask what how can we can we explain the actual inflation by adding up the impulse response functions to the things up here uh the the V over U Energy prices food prices and shortages we don't deal with productivity what we do is we take I should add that we take the data up through 2019 as as given and we simulate it forward using the model and that gives us what we call the initial conditions so that's that's what would have happened essentially if there have been no new shocks after 2019 so this gives us a decomposition of of inflation uh and we're getting very close to the punch line uh so what we have here the brown bars are the initial conditions they show you what would have happened if given what was going on in 2019 if there had been no additional shocks and this sort of suggested inflation would have kind of stayed around two percent a little higher here because of tight labor markets this what else the blue this the solid blue line here is the effective Energy prices and you can see it's huge and it's bigger in Europe of course so the energy prices have been a big driver of of um of inflation and here of course more recently they've been a big driver of disinflation by the way the black line is the actual inflation rate quarterly and the dashed line is the sum of the bars so that comparison of the dashed line in the solid line tells you how well this model forecasts inflation excluding the residuals in the equation food doesn't do much that's the light blue shortages I seems to do quite a bit uh here we are in 2021 remember I showed an earlier picture where inflation in 2021 was responding pretty strongly to supply chain issues and that's what this shows but shortages are still having an effect apparently on inflation going forward and then finally and this is I think an important takeaway the red is the contribution of tight labor markets V over you to the inflation early on it was actually a negative contribution okay uh that was basically the the what the result of the um of the lockdowns and the pandemic etc etc then after that once things began to open up it began to have a positive contribution but she and it's a persistent one but you can see it's still a relatively modest share of the um of the total inflation so it's it's increasing and persistent but the story again is that inflation was not caused by overheating economies or overeating labor markets it was caused by these shocks uh to prices this is the same picture but this shows the decomposition of wages nominal wage growth and here you can see the red uh is much more important uh so tight labor markets have a much more bigger explanation for um uh for wage growth uh but other things including energy and shortages uh are are working as well again I want to emphasize that there's many indirect connections here so for example why would Energy prices affect wages well if Energy prices raise inflation which raises inflation expectations which makes wages higher which makes prices higher you know there's a general equilibrium kind of relationship there okay so uh that's those two pictures are really I think uh the main takeaways that uh again that inflation inflation uh initially was driven by shocks to prices given wages and not by overheated economy uh the overheating has become more of an issue recently uh and uh it will become as the other factors die away it will become the main source of above Trend inflation uh this is our projections the don't take these with a big grain of salt uh this shows this looks in terms of V over u under three scenarios the top scenario is it stays where it is or 1.8 second scenario is it's taken over two years down to 1.2 and the third scenarios have taken over two years down to 0.8 and you can see that uh you know if you get it down to 0.8 that uh that will get inflation back to Target and Below but if you don't if you leave it where it is inflation will be sticky yes what surprises me the most is the relatively small role for V over uh just because of the fact that there have been you know there's been other work like for example by um by Larry Ball and and colleagues at Brookings um or in the Brookings papers which has emphasized the role of that variable so I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about about the relationship to to the work that is emphasized to unemployment yeah the vacancy over unemployment ratio why is that not more important is basically what I'm asking I I thought there were other studies that had really well there's some technical differences with with ball uh one of them is simply they stop they stop their analysis like eight months before we do a second one is they assume they they impose a very long lag for Vu to affect wages which means it takes a long time for reducing Vu to um uh to affect wages and prices but the last thing that the real economics here which I want you to take away is that if you want to translate these V over U numbers into unemployment which is what we care about it depends a lot on what happens to the beverage curve if the beverage curve comes back to its pre-pandemic level then some level of unemployment not much higher than it was in 2019 will be enough to get inflation down whereas if it stays where it is you know you'll need another extra percentage point or so something like that so none of these things predict you know really really high levels of unemployment but the exact relationship does depend on on the beverage curve all right I'm going to close here with conclusions uh so simple very simple model uh but you got to take into account all the second and round indirect effects working through wage bargaining expectations and the like uh substantively uh shocks to prices not overheating economy or labor market tightness set off the inflation and those shocks are largely dissipating on their own which is good news and we're seeing that in the report yesterday we're already seeing some of that happening um though although overheating in the labor market played a small role initially uh it is set to become increasingly the primary driver of inflation over time if it stays where it is so to get uh inflation down further we're going to need some slowing in in the labor market now whether that means uh no increase in unemployment or a percentage Point increase in unemployment that that is very hard to tell because that's going to depend on the beverage curve if the beverage curve comes back to normal then the unemployment consequences might be quite small uh and I finally wanted to say that I mentioned this earlier that we are doing this now as a joint project with a number of other central banks who've also run this model for their their economies and um gotten pretty intuitive results on the whole okay I'm I'm done thank you for your patience
