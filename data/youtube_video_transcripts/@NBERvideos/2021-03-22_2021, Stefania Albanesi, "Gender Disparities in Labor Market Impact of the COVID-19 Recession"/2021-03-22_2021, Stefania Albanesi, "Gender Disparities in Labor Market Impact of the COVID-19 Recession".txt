okay so um this project is on the gendered impact of the kobe 19 recession on u.s labor market and it's a collaboration between myself and jiong kim at the korea development institute um so why would we think that recessions have a gendered impact well first of all in standard recessions we have a stylized fact that men are typically more exposed to business cycle risk meaning they lose more jobs and their unemployment rises more than women and the typical way we measure it is to look at the cyclical component of a labor market indicator for example the implemented population ratio and compare its standard deviation to the standard deviation of gdp and so what we see in the table here is the ratio of the standard deviations for men and women by also marital status and the presence of children and you can see that for all demographic groups men display greater amplitude of their fluctuations in employment compared to women and the gender gap is more pronounced for single and for those without children um there are a couple of explanations for this uh gender difference in exposure by gender to standard recession the first is that men are overly represented in occupations and industries that are highly cyclical particularly production construction and transportation sectors and occupations and women are over-represented in service occupation and industries and the second um explanation has to do with married workers particularly um and has to do with household insurance so married women who tend to be the secondary earners in most households have a tendency to be uh to leave the the the workforce at a lower rate in recession as a form of insurance against the greater risk of loss of employment of the primary earner at their husbands so typical recessions um tend to um you know disproportionately affect men uh now uh the covet recession uh is is an atypical recession as we know service occupations and sectors have been disproportionately hit because um they have high degree of contact with co-workers and customers and also we know that there has been a shock to uh the the time constraint particularly of parents because of school school closures and child care closures and so on um so we wanted to measure this um more precisely and starting with the role of occupation um so we devised a dichotomy across occupation based on um own it that is premised on the basis that uh you know low contact occupations where workers have little contact with other workers and customers are less likely to be affected by covet whereas high conduct occupations are and the other dimension that we looked at is the ability to perform work remotely and so here we looked at flexible versus inflexible occupation based on this characteristic so if we look at um two digit occupation we can group them into four categories based on whether they're flexible or inflexible or high contact versus low contact and the flexible low contact occupations are the ones that we expect to be least hit by kuvid they are in the bottom left quadrant of this matrix and they comprise all the professional and managerial occupations and also sales and administrative occupations by contrast the occupation categories that we think are most likely to be hit by covid are the inflexible high contact occupations and they're in the top right quadrant of the matrix and you can see they're mainly healthcare occupations personal service type occupations and food preparation occupation in the bottom quadrant the inflexible low contact occupations those are of interest because those comprise most occupations that are highly cyclical meaning very responsive to standard recessions and then in the top uh left quadrant we have the high contact flexible occupations which is sort of in the middle um and they comprise more uh most education and library occupations so um this is the occupational categorization that we use for most of the analysis and um what this graph shows you is the log variation relative to the same month in 2019 for every month in 2020 of the employment to population ratio for these four occupational categories in the aggregate population and as expected you can see that inflexible or contact occupations are the ones that experience the biggest drop in employment minus 38 in april and you can see that by november employment is still 15 percentage points below than what it was in the same month the year prior you can also see from this graph that inflexible low contact occupations um also exhibit a big drop in employment uh about 20 minus 28 percent in april um and though they have a somewhat stronger recovery uh than the inflexible eye contact so these occupations are not particularly sensitive to covet but they are highly cyclical occupations and may have been affected just by the uh the start of a recession associated with the covet crisis and then we can see that the flexible or contact occupations um um have a decline in employment which is the smallest about 10 percent in april and then sort of recover to about minus five percent relative to one year prior towards the end of the year and the flexible high contact occupations have a drop in employment of about 15 and also a pretty strong recovery now how are women and men uh distributed across these occupational categories so it turns out that the biggest occupational category of all is the flexible low contact uh category which comprises 53 percent of all employment that is actually good news because these are the occupations that we expect to be at least affected by covet this category is also gender neutral 49 the female share employment in this category is 49 on the other hand for the inflexible occupation that that's where we see a lot of um gender asymmetry so the inflexible high contact occupations which comprise about 15 percent of total employment have a female share of 73 percent and these are the most highly affected by the covert 19 recession on the other hand the inflexible low contact occupations which comprise 25 of all employment um have a female share of only 17 and they are male dominated finally the flexible high contact occupation which are a small category only seven percent of all employment have a very high female share also and we saw that you know those occupations were took a small hit from covet just based on the occupational distribution um there isn't an intimation of a large gender disparity in employment effects because um you know both categories of inflexible occupations were highly hit uh and for the categories that were um had the smallest in employment that's a relatively uh gender-neutral category but so to quantify more precisely um you know the effect of the kovi 19 shock on workers by gender and by occupation we basically estimate um a regression where we isolate the time effects as well as the impact of gender marital status the present of children under 12 and occupation and all their interactions after controlling for uh differences in the agent in education distribution for all these demographic groups that we consider and we look specifically at labor market stocks so employment unemployment and non-participation but we also consider gross job flows as a way to possibly disentangle demand effects uh you know people lay off uh service workers as opposed to labor supply effects so parents perhaps reduce uh their labor force participation to take care of children who are out of school so the the results that we get are the following so for example let's focus on employment so we focus on three stages of the pandemic the spring the summer and the fall so the spring is the height of the employment losses and then there's some recovery of employment in the summer and the fall and what i'm showing you here is the average aggregate effect of employment um in in those three phases of the pandemic relative to february uh 2020. so for example in spring employment in the aggregate was five percentage points lower um relative to february 2020. and what you see below is the contribution of women to this change in employment and you can see that it's much higher than 52 percent which is their share in the population if we control for occupation uh the result the residual decline in employment is smaller it's only minus 3.6 percent but you can see that the share accounted for by women is uh roughly a stable uh which suggests that you know above and beyond the occupation distribution women have lost more jobs uh than men uh at every stage of the pandemic uh unemployment gives us a very similar picture it's interesting instead look at non-participation where we see that here the share of the change in the participation which increased relative to um february 2020 at every stage of the pandemic quite substantially the share accounted for by women is really disproportionately high what actually happened particularly in the fall is that non-participation went down for men but it continued to increase for women uh resulting in the this you know more than a hundred percent share of the rise in non-participation in the aggregate accounted for by women so this gives us a big picture if we focus on gender gaps specifically in employment and participation this is what they look like by demographic group meaning by marital status and by the presence of children um on the left-hand uh hand side panel we see the female male gap in percentage points in the change of employment uh with 90 percent uh confidence error bands and you can see that every stage at the pandemic and for every demographic groups women lose substantially more jobs than men so the difference is two to three percentage points which for an average um decline in employment of five percentage point is a very very large uh gap on the right-hand side we have the same estimates but after having controlled for the occupation distribution and you can see that for all demographic groups um basically the gender gap drops by about a third which suggests that you know that's pretty much the contribution of differences uh in the occupational distribution to this uh uh change in employment and you can see that the biggest gaps between men and women are for married uh workers particularly in the in the spring uh and in the summer and then for single workers a single parent actually uh in the fall looking at the similar picture for non-participation what is interesting here is that occupational controls do not really account for a large um fraction of the gender gap and you can see the non-participation rates go up more for women compared to men but particularly the difference by gender is a strongest for single parents and in the spring um uh and the summer and for uh married parents uh in the summer and the fall so the picture that we have is that you know uh much of the greater contribution uh coming from women uh in the decline of employment uh and in the rise in non-participation during the pandemic relative to february 2020 is really being driven by married women uh when it comes to employment and um mothers are both single and married when it comes to non-participation uh so if we look at job gross job flows we have a very similar picture we focus specifically on the eu flow which is the employment tool to unimprove infra which is a measure of job destruction and the employment to non-participation flow which is a measure of the attachment to the labor market of workers who continue uh remaining employed and we have this uh controlling after controlling for occupation this interesting picture that at the height of the decline in employment which occurred in the spring of 2020 relative to february 2020 we see that again marrying women um are the ones that experience the bigger difference relative to marrying men in terms of the the rise in their employment to unemployment flows and on the other hand we see single mothers uh accounting for the largest gaps uh by gender um in the spring uh and the summer for uh the the the rise in the employment to non-participation flows so we have uh you know being a parent particularly being a single parent being associated to a decline in labor market attachment arising non-participation and en flows and on the other hand being a married woman being very strongly related to a loss in employment uh particularly at the start of the covet crisis uh in the spring um so um to um give you a sense of just how unusual this is it's uh one thing that we did is to run a similar analysis but for the great recession so we looked at um the change uh in um labor market stocks and and gross job flows by gender marital status and presence of children in exactly the same um with the exactly the same approach during the great recession relative to march uh 07 to november so the the six months just prior uh to the start of the recession and we divide the great recession into three phases the official mbr recession period uh which is what we call recession here and then the subsequent recovery which was very slow uh divided into two part so what you can see here other than the fact that focusing on employment the declining of employment was smaller but you can see that the share accounted for by women is much much smaller than their share in the population uh though once we control for occupation um you know the share accounted for by women is uh is about uh which suggests that during the great recession essentially men did lose more job than women and most of the gender gap was indeed accounted for by differences in the occupation of distribution and turning to non-participation controlling for occupation actually non-participation fell during the great recession as opposed to rise like it did during the covet crisis and women account for this portion of faction of this decline in non-participation uh particularly account uh controlling uh for occupation um and so if we look at the um employment um you know changes uh by demographic group a presence of children and marital status they look pretty much flipped relative to what they uh what we saw for 2020. and we can see that the role of occupation controls is much stronger here so once we take into we control for occupation we still have a residual gender gap in favor of women meaning women lost fewer jobs than men during the great recession but only for single workers and single workers are by far the most exposed to typical recessions now um so in conclusion we wanted to ask two questions so the first question is uh will all the jobs return and then the second question is are there going to be any long-term impact on women specifically so the question of will all the job returns we think is an important one because though the kobe 19 recession was very special and the decline in employment was very driven by mitigation measures such as mandated closures of specific type of business and also endogenous responses of consumers not wanting to expose themselves to the risk of infection so it's inherently temporary um but that doesn't mean that the labor market impacts of the kobe recession itself will be temporary and we have a sense that that may not be the case given what happened in response to the last three recessions in the united states so since the 1990 recession we've experienced so-called jobless recoveries and what we mean by that is simply that after the recession though gdp and components of aggregate demand recovered pretty much as they did in the past labor market performance was very sluggish in particular employment was very very slow to recover and actually in response to the great recession uh you know according to some estimates it didn't fully recover there's two main explanations for jobless recoveries one is that uh what has been happening since the 1990s uh structural phenomena such as the jupiterization and the disappearing uh middle skill uh routine jobs um you know have uh played a role in the recovery from recessions you know you know job polarization and recognization and elimination of routine job is a trend phenomenon most of the job losses are concentrated in recessions and when uh the economy recover those jobs are just not reinstated and instead firms meet increasing demand via automation or outsourcing um and so on and the second um you know uh explanation for the jobless recoveries is that in fact uh what really happened is a change in the behavior of women's employment over the business cycle so if we look at men uh their recoveries have always been rather sluggish you know even in the 70s and 80s when overall labor markets recovered pretty much the same rate as gdp and aggregate demand on the other hand um women as long as the participation was riding was trending up pretty dramatically until the early 90s exhibited really really strong employment growth in recoveries and since the pretty much 1992 female participation in the us has been either flat or slightly declining and so what has happened is that employment of women during recoveries pretty much looks like men's except for the fact women lose fewer jobs in recessions and so i've looked at this in previous research and sort of this contributes pretty substantially uh to jobless recoveries for the last three recessions so turning uh to the routineization hypothesis so those types of service occupations that were primarily affected by the covet crisis you know don't seem prima facie to be very susceptible to automation how do you replace uh you know a a personal service uh you know job with a machine but we wanted to get a quantitative sense of that so we use basically two indices one developed by otter and dorn in their 2013 paper and one that we developed independently again using own it and so what we did for the four occupational categories that we constructed we looked at the fraction of occupations within those categories that are highly susceptible to automation and so if you look at the inflexible high contact occupation we find that depending on the index 40 to 45 percent of those are highly susceptible to automation and um also another category of employment that was highly effective were the usual inflexible or contact occupation about 50 percent of those are highly susceptible to automation so this suggests that there may be a risk uh that uh you know employers and firms uh may behave like they did in uh recent recessions and uh may not reinstate some of the jobs that were lost instead using automation um and and other you know uh less labor-intensive uh you know ways uh to um meet uh the the rise in demand as we get out of this recession and then finally what do we expect for women so something that i think we can expect as a consequence of the decline in the rising non-participation particularly of mothers is an increase in gender wage gap so uh people that we have estimates of the effect of temporary non-participation spells um associated with you know uh the birth of children uh for uh married mothers and mothers in general uh for for the us uh and uh you know uh the human capital depreciation or skill obsolescence that takes place during those spells of non-participation can account for about 13 of the overall gender wage gap in the united states according to some estimates so conceivably we can expect gender wage gaps to widen as a result of this decline in non-participation particularly of mothers and that may actually reduce the incentive to re-enter the labor force for some women uh because obviously if prospective earnings are lower um that is a disincentive to re-enter the labor force that in and of itself may actually dampen the recovery of aggregate employment because it's going to generate you know something similar to what we've seen you know if you know participation is flat or declining and it's not growing we know that that reduces um the the rate at which aggregate employment recovers um after a recession and then finally there may be a reinforcement of traditional gender roles uh we've seen that um from for example from the census also pulse survey uh that mothers who have been remain who have remained employed have devoted more time to child care and schooling activities uh compared to fathers and so that you know may further exacerbate gender disparities in in the labor market and that's something that could persist beyond this recession
