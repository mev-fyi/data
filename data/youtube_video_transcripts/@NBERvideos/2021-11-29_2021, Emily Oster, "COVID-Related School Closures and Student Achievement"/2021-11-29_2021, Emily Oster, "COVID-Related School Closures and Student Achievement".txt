emily astra i'm at brown my co-authors claire halloran rebecca jack and james oaken and the paper is entitled pandemic schooling mode and student test scores evidence from u.s states so the the broad motivation for this project is the uh is the changes in schooling mode over the last school year in the us to give you some broad background in march of 2020 at the beginning of the covet pandemic effectively all of the schools globally and in the us closed for in-person instruction when we got then into the 2020-2021 school year there was a very uneven opening status for schools across the u.s there was more opening in some states than in others there was more opening in some districts than others there was an evolution of opening over time in general there there were more schools open in the spring than in the fall there were relatively fewer schools open in the in the winter and these decisions largely came down to choices made by individual school districts so states had some role in dictating what was possible but a lot of the decision making fell to school districts uh on their own there is a very broad question that i think we will be grappling with for for a long time uh which is what are the short-term and the long-term consequences of a lack of in-person schooling uh this paper is going to start to take one little piece of that and start to to explore it uh which is to look at to look at test scores so what we do in the paper is we do basically two things so first we're gonna gonna introduce um and use a new database uh on schooling mode across the us over the 2020 2021 school year uh this is going to be based on data we put together that's comprehensive across 36 states covering at this point about 30 million uh us k through 12 students this data set we built and now have made publicly available either at the district or school level uh over sort of different time periods that we that we have so i'm going to talk a little bit about that data and how how we put that together and then and then we'll use it we'll merge it in with some test scores from 12 states in the spring of 2021 and we look at the changes in test scores and pass rates on these state tests during the pandemic and how much variation there was in those test score changes by uh schooling mode focusing in particular on whether the school was in person or uh or not um just to sort of uh say before i tell you about the the schooling data just to sort of say uh what what we have had to use um or what has been available to use before this uh this database um in terms of understanding what modes schools and districts were in over the school year uh there was no systematic federal effort to track school district modes over the over the school year there was a lot of discussion about it but it did not end up falling to any particular agency and so it didn't happen most of what we relied on over the last year was data coming out of a company called burbio which tracked uh 1200 large school districts at the district level effectively scraping from from websites to see whether they were open by week or by or by month uh there was also a tracker called the aei return to learn tracker that had some similar data also pulls in some data from a place called mch so there were a few sources but generally not comprehensive not down to the not down to the the school level and focusing mostly on larger districts so there's like 13 000 school districts in the u.s um and for many of those we had relatively we've had relatively limited data so what we what we did um in in pursuit of this paper and hopefully uh hopefully others is is built something we've called the kobe 19 school data hub so we did this through contacts with state education agencies so we asked state education agencies for any information they have about their opening modes of their schools um we asked them for either you know what mode was the school or district in was it hybrid was it virtual was it in person uh if they knew we asked them how many kids did you have in each mode we pull this data in by week or bi-weekly or monthly whatever the state had available in some cases we've utilized information from something called the pandemic ebt program which has helped us fill out some of these uh some of these data sources and the end sort of goal was to create a public a public data resource where we could have all of this uh all of this information so show you a little bit what that looked like just so we get a sense of kind of what did school reopenings look like over the past year um and how much data we have where we're where we're missing it um so this is a map of of school reopenings by district uh over in in september um and so you can see um you know there's not there are many states that are that are empty um but you can already see the the blue is in person the red is virtual and the yellow is some kind of hybrid a lot of different variations in in hybrid um so this is what september looks like uh as we move into november um you can see the pattern that's you know fairly consistent which is there is sort of less reopening in the the sort of northeast and and uh and in the west uh more in the sort of center of the country um florida is very open texas here's what january looks like pretty similar to uh to november and then as we move into the into the spring um into say march uh and then ultimately into may uh we can see there's more there's sort of more opening places go from uh from red to yellow or yellow to to blue and we see a broader a broader picture of of opening over this uh over this period i should say if you looked at this in the fall of 2021 um everything would be blue um so we've seen you know some individual school closures over the 20 21 22 school year so far but um sort of pretty consistently places or at least available for for full in-person full-in-person learning um okay so that data sort of we built that data uh and then for this particular paper um we're gonna we're gonna pull down the data and we're gonna aggregate it to a district time period so um so in most cases to a district week or a district uh district month and then we're gonna use that to calculate the share of time that the district was either in person hybrid or virtual so in this sort of in-person means that the district was offering full-time five-day a week regular in-person learning doesn't mean everybody was there full-time in person so almost every district offered a virtual learning option in the last school year so they wouldn't necessarily have everybody in but the idea is what did you have available so a district could have available regular in person five day a week school uh virtual learning means you do not have access to school and hybrid is anything that is that is sort of in the middle in the middle here so any way in which the school was was hybrid we're going to use the 12 states for which we have test score data and i'll show you what those are in in a minute so just to give you a sense of the sort of variation we're going to focus in the paper on distinguishing between in person and the other two so we have a little bit of you know robustness where we separate out the other two but we're really going to be focused on you know in like in person as the kind of regular five day a week school versus some other option either hybrid or or distance um in the states for which we have also have test score data uh the state with the minimum in person share on average is virginia so so the sort of average in virginia um in person learning regular five day a week in person learning um is like nine nine percent of the of the school year um and for for florida it's about uh 97 so there's a big range uh across states uh in how much in-person learning they were offering um so uh so before i sort of get into to show you the results let me just briefly touch on on the literature and this is not gonna be this is not going to be comprehensive i feel like you work in the space of covid pretty much every week the nvr working papers have more things about covid so i am certain that uh that we have not been completely comprehensive here and so i apologize um you know i think one in when we sort of think about what literatures we're speaking to there is a a sort of pre-covered literature about just the impacts of missed school a lot of which focuses actually on the summer sort of issues of summer learning loss and how much are kids losing in the summer and which kids are losing in the summer uh there is then an an increasing literature on the impacts of schooling of covet on schools in general so looking at um at enrollments uh and sort of functioning of schools over time and then we have actually some some reasonable data from europe on what happened in test scores in the spring of 2020. so in the us we basically didn't test anybody in the spring of 2020 because nobody was at school but in europe many schools came back for a spring term or a summer term and there is some data on on test scores um the disruptions to schooling there are smaller but we do see some reductions in um in test scores which uh spoiler alert is also what we'll see in in these days uh all right so uh so we're gonna pull data on on test scores from these 12 states this is based on state level testing in the spring of 2021 we're gonna focus on math and english language arts for grades three through eight this is the sort of most consistent set of data some of these states also do testing of older kids or testing in science but this is kind of the two core uh the two core pieces and our primary outcome is going to be pass rates as kind of defined by the um by the the the state uh so so let me just sort of start by showing you a little bit about um about what determined or sort of what is correlated with schooling mode across uh or within within states so uh so this is table two from the paper in which we're regressing at the district level the share of of time that the district was in in person uh on um some demographics and the first two columns are are using both within and across state variation and the second two columns control for first state so uh so one of the because sort of a couple things to pull out from this so one is that you know in most of these specifications um the uh the relationship between the baseline pass rate and the share uh in in person uh is positive so for the most part actually places with a higher baseline pass rate appear to have a have a higher in-person share um so just better off districts or districts that were doing better before uh have a are more likely to to end up in person during the school year uh in general districts with a higher share of black students are less likely to be in in person and that effect is quite big uh the relationship between share free and rooted price lunch uh is positive so it looks like sort of conditional on race income seems to um to sort of positively predict share share in person and then notably the the covid case rates so if you sort of ask like how do you um what's the relationship between copied rates and opening actually that tends to be positive so it tended to be the places with the higher case rates were more likely to uh to open and and that relates to some other factors which we don't have in this regression uh notably the share um the republican vote share in the district is a has been shown elsewhere to be a fairly significant predictor of of reopening so that's who who opened uh and now we're going to look at kind of conditional and sort of like what happened to to pass rates i'm going to show you really three things so first uh the the changes in the pass rates just in general then the relationship between the changes in pass rates and schooling mode and then briefly discuss um sort of one kind of question about sort of what's driving what we see um so uh so here's a graph of the changes in pass rates in math um over these states you can see at the bottom the states we have virginia minnesota massachusetts nevada west virginia colorado ohio wisconsin connecticut rhode island wyoming and florida and we've ordered these by their average in-person share um in um the average in-person share uh that they had during them during the school year the the y-axis here is just the change from the previous year and the and the triangles and this is math these are math scores the triangle are the the pandemic year changes so this is 2021 minus 2019 which is the last year pre-pandemic for which we had scores and the circles at the top are year-on-year changes for previous years so just to get a sense of kind of how much general variation are we seeing in test scores uh in these in these places so what you can see is um you know virginia is a pretty significant outlier with an average reduction in test scores about 30 percentage points in pass rates um but in general these reductions and scores are kind of ranging in the sort of 15 10 15 11 kind of uh kind of range they are sort of slightly less uh the test scores do seem to sort of be slightly uh losing slightly less in these places with um where the there was more in-person learning although you know this is cross-state variation uh here is uh here are the the changes for english um and we've actually put these on the same uh on the same y-axis you can kind of compare them to what we see in in math uh there are reductions here too they are much smaller so the changes in ela pass pass rates are kind of low under 10 percent for all of these uh for all of these these states so uh here is uh here's what we see in terms of here's one way to visualize uh what we're seeing in terms of uh of the relationship between these changes and the in-person shares so to do to sort of make this visualization i'll show you a regression in a second to make the visualization we're just going to divide districts uh based on the sort of the places with the most in person so that's um at least two-thirds of your uh of your time in person the intermediate which is a third to two-thirds and least in person which is uh less than a less than a third in person uh and we're gonna just sort of show those across states and what we're trying to to take what we're what we're arguing we take away from this is that in general in basically all these states you're seeing that in this pandemic year the places that had the most in-person learning lost less or the places with less in-person learning lost more um and uh and that that isn't true in the pre-pandemic year so it isn't the case that we're seeing that kind of variation pre-pandemic but we are seeing it uh during during the pandemic we see a similar thing for ela although again everything is just much just much smaller we can look at this in a in a regression um and so so the sort of main kind of effect here uh is say column one or column four uh and this is looking at the the relationship between uh between this is a a sort of standard kind of district fixed effect regression uh in which we're looking at the relationship between the the percent in in person uh and the the past rates so the way we would read this is to say a coefficient of point one says that if you went from uh if you went from not at all in person to fully in person you would expect a 10 higher test score rate now remember 10 higher pass rate now that is a effectively a 10 reduction in the test score loss so the average test score loss and math here is 14 percentage points and so what this says is that that this sort of if if that's kind of the average that there's a 10 percentage point difference in the loss that we predict between being fully in person and fully not in person for ela that number is uh is smaller it's about three percentage points uh in the in the interaction columns you can look at this more in the in the paper uh we look at some interactions between uh between free and reduced price lunch or black and hispanic share and these effects and one of the things we see and it may be easiest to see in column in column six uh is that the particularly for ela the impact of in-person learning is larger for worse off districts so what this says is that for a district with a large share of free and reduced price lunch they actually benefited a lot even in ela not only in math but also in ela from having uh more in-person learning so that's an interaction that we're exploring that we're exploring more uh one sort of like thing to kind of highlight before i before i end is that one of the sort of issues with the data is that test participation rates are lower in 2021 and that comes up a lot when we sort of talk about like well what should we what should we learn from that in the states that we use the the sort of participation rates are typically um you know kind of you know typical year would be like 100 and in the years that in 2021 they're more like you know 80 to 90 percent um although not generally lower than that does this explain what we're what we're seeing um well effectively our baseline results assume that there's a random selection of test takers from the population if we actually look in the demographic data what we're seeing is actually larger reduction in test taking among less advantaged groups so we're seeing english language learners special ed students students who would sort of typically be actually performing worse on the tests are actually the students that are leading so if anything it looks like the test takers that remain uh are kind of positively selected that would suggest that what we're seeing could even be an underestimate of the size of these of these impacts in the paper we do some sensitivity analyses uh around this so so what do we take away uh from this so there are we see large test score losses over this school year we see test score losses that are larger in districts with less in-person instruction we don't think it's driven by these participation differences uh to us this really points to the importance potentially of recovery efforts of trying to ensure that we help students make this up and that we put effort in this year to recognize that yeah kids are resilient but there are some you know there are some things to be to be made up there are of course many limitations to the paper i'm sure that everyone can can think of them i think some that come to mind for us are you know the possibility that some of this is driven by differences in how incentivized the test performance was there's a possibility that other kinds of lockdowns which mim and larger and remote districts are in fact responsible for some of these these changes and of course it's important to note that test scores don't fully capture learning um they are only kind of one one metric of that um so thanks for listening and uh i look forward to hearing your comments on the paper
