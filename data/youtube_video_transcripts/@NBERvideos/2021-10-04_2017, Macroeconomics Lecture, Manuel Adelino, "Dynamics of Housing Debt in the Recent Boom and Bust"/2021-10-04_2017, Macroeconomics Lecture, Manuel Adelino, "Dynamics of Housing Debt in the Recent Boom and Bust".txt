this paper's on the dynamics of housing debt in the boom and bust and i think the motivation for the paper is fairly straightforward it was started at lunchtime um already and this is still thinking about or motivated by the lasting impact of the 2008 uh crisis we know that before the crisis there was this significant increase in the stock of mortgage debt um for all household many households in the u.s during the boom period and then when housing markets slowed down prices dropped and there's this large spike in defaults and i'm going to show you this is particularly true or the share that came from middle class and prime borrowers um rose a lot and now these losses in turn impair banks the shadow banking system this leads to great depression so it's a great recession and this so this is the motivation i think for thinking about these issues still 10 years later are pretty clear now the key question in this paper is what led to this increase in mortgage debt what is behind the large increase in credit expansion that that we saw in this period and i want to classify um you know explanations into two broad views of what went on and i want to call the first one the subprime view and according to that view um some form of financial innovation deregulation created incentives in the financial sector to provide unsustainable credit but particularly to low-income and subprime borrowers and so this this class of explanations if you'd like focus focus on distorted credit flows to low-income borrowers and then look at the consequences of subprime credit expansion in that to that category of borrowers that in turn led to increased house prices and ultimately to the to the peak and then the mortgage crisis and i think the work by me and sufi originally in 2009 and then follow on work are maybe the most prominent um you know authors in that in that space and i want to suggest another view that we're going to call the expectations view whereby inflated house prices and inflated house price expectations led banks to underestimate the potential for losses and so the driver over here are going to be asset values if you want collateral values and then banks lent against those increased collateral values under this view all borrowers increase their demand for housing and all of those borrowers in some sense exploit the increase in the supply of credit and over here there's an emphasis on an overall increase in in debt across the distribution if you want of income and credit scores now one natural question that would arise over there is what what triggers what triggers this increase in house prices and what triggers changes in expectations about house prices there's a number of explanations out there that's not something that we're going to pin down in this paper maybe some form of global savings glut lower interest rates that drive initial initial shocks expectations there's also some evidence out there that local shocks may have may have led to differential timing and when and when sort of the boom gets started okay fernando ferrer and joe jerk ward and have evidence um on that okay now it's difficult in general to to to test the two views to begin with these explanations are not really mutually exclusive and may in fact reinforce each other at some level and it could be that what happens is credit screening goes down as a result of the increases in asset values because now lenders feel protected by those by those by that collateral okay and then more access to credit then in turn feeds into higher prices and so the two are not really um mutually exclusive and i would argue that distinguishing between or identifying setting the facts straight about what happened during this time period is really important for uh for policy because it's gonna i think one view is gonna say you need to pay particular attention to low-income to credit to low-income households you need to fix incentives and monitoring in banks and i would say that maybe if you if you realize that the expansion was more widespread for all households in the united states then some form of macro prudential regulation is probably more in order and i think by setting the facts straight by and what this paper is really going to focus on is trying to establish a number of facts you'll see a long list of facts that hopefully then help him form models and then hopefully help distinguish models and we we we refer to a bunch of those um in the paper okay so starting here i want to i want to try to lay out a number of facts about how what happened to credit in the united states and i will focus a lot on what happened to credit across the income distribution what happened to the very low income to the middle class and to the top income earners um in the u.s okay and i think what our what our paper um shows is that house price expectations and increased collateral values seem to have played a really important role in the way that credit expanded um in the country so if you look at the flow of new purchase mortgages so new purchase mortgages that are originated each year and then the stock of credit so how much credit households have across income levels that goes up for all income groups over the boom it is not particularly concentrated in low income or low credit score borrowers so the first set of facts that i want to show you is that the cross-sectional dislocations in credit flows if you want how that credit was distributed in the population was very stable during the boom okay it was not particularly geared towards poor households i'm also going to show you that credit expansion is significantly larger in areas with large house price appreciation and that interestingly the combined loan to value ratios so the fraction of house values that were funded with debt so when people were purchasing homes how much of that house value is funded with debt that stayed essentially flat over the boom and that suggests it's very consistent with banks lending against these increased collateral values it's not that the capacity of of of housing as as an asset the capacity to bear debt sort of goes up the loan to value ratios are very stable uh during this time period okay the the as as i go on i want to show you that there's quicker buying and selling during the boom so there's many more transactions people moving a lot more during the boom and at the peak of the boom sort of peaks exactly with with house prices and then it goes down dramatically in the bust we're going to argue that these are attempts of households to buy into these increasing house prices and notice that when people move from one house to the next they pay down a debt they pay one mortgage that is potentially smaller and are getting into a mortgage that is larger and resets sort of to to a new level so that itself is a mechanism for increasing um credit in the economy okay i'm also going to show you evidence on homeownership rates that i think is going to be very clear on what is happening to the poorest household to the lowest income households homeownership rates increase for everybody except the very lowest income households in the united states and so it doesn't seem the evidence is completely inconsistent with credit expanding in a way that allowed poor households to gain access to home ownership now of course low-income households are already at a low level of home ownership relative to higher income higher earners and the boom didn't in no way help in no way helped these low-income earners to um to become homeowners okay i'll show you that the cost of owning relative to renting goes up and it goes up particularly in areas with large house price appreciations and then my final set of results will be that the share of defaults coming from middle income and middle credit score borrowers really balloons in the in the bust so while we call it a subprime crisis it became called the subprime crisis if you look at the portfolio of delinquent mortgages that was out there the fraction that came from middle-class borrowers expands dramatically um when when when house prices dropped okay so the data is it's it's it's it's a somewhat big data exercise in that we're combining a lot of census data um in particular the american community survey that's the largest household survey uh that is done by census with a couple hundred thousand uh households and from that we can measure housing costs for owners and renters and we're going to be able to measure home ownership um fairly precisely and for these home ownership facts i'm also in the paper we have sort of verification robustness of all of this with alternative census surveys like the american housing survey and the current population survey then i'm going to show you evidence from the home mortgage disclosure act so the humda data that's an administrative data set that has close to the universe of mortgages that are made in the u.s every year for loan to value ratios we will look at a data set that has all residential property transactions these come from deeds registries these are public and then corelogic formerly data quick collects all of these we're going to be able to look at the universe of um very close to the universe of ownership transfers of residential properties and we're going to look at the mortgages that are attached to those so we can measure combined loans to values very precisely for mortgage performance we use mukdash it's a smaller sample there's going to be one result at the end it has been checked in other data sets then we have income and house prices from the standard places so the first set of results um i want to show you is that you'll see that there's no large cross-sectional dislocations in how credit was flowing to u.s households during this time period the flow of purchase mortgages increases dramatically but it increases for everybody it does not increase just at the bottom of the income distribution in the u.s you'll see that the stock of mortgage debt so you look at people that have mortgages this is going to now include mortgages home equity lines cash out refinances that goes up people are refinancing getting these cash out refunds that is going up for everybody for the low income and high income um individuals okay and then you'll see that the cost of owning homes goes up particularly in high house price areas all right so this is a picture of the flow of new purchased mortgages in the country starting in 2001 all the way to 2015 i think the the boom in the bust is fairly clearly visible over here so one thing to note is yes the the amount the total amount of of purchase mortgages basically doubles between 2001 and its peak at two in 2005 and then six or you know as almost doubles but what you see is that the the dark blue in the bottom is the lowest income households in the this is the lowest income areas i'll move to households in a second these are lowest and lowest income areas in the us the lighter blue up top is the high income areas in the u.s and what you can see i think fairly clearly is even at the peak the vast majority of volume and numbers we could do numbers but that vast majority of volume of purchase mortgages is in the top second and third quintiles of the population it's not at the bottom okay and so while total credit really ramps up it ramps up everywhere it is not driven particularly by large increases at the bottom and then of course you see in the drop there's a large drop there's a large drop for everybody but that dark blue for example in the dark red lines uh the dark red areas really compress once that happens okay this is the same picture only now i'm looking you're looking at shares because here shares are hard to see i just wanted you to see it really goes up it really comes down and but you know you see all areas it happens for all shades and here you're seeing the same picture but now you're seeing it in shares okay and so you see that even at the peak again if you look at the top the second the third quinta clearly mortgages are going to the middle class and are going to high income areas and they're going also to low income areas but much less so even even at the peak of the boom so thinking of this as a as an explosion of credit to low income borrowers is not is not what you would see in in this in this picture okay this is now the debt to income how debt to income moves and you see debt to income ratios this is now for owners with positive debt i've moved to a different data set what you see here is owners with positive debt see their debt to incomes go up that is going up for red those are the the lowest income uh individuals dark blue at the bottom now is the top so top income earners have lower debt to income levels but the changes you see are happening for everybody okay this is i i want you this one is now moving to census data looking at the cost of ownership for people that move in each year so we look at people moving to a new home and this is their cost of owning a home and on the left you see the boom states you see how the cost of owning a home goes up but once again the story is it's going up by approximately six to eight percentage points of income it's going up for everybody in the boom states that change is fairly dramatic in the non-boom states much less so and so house prices are really the key driver here that help you helps you distinguish who has a large increase in debt to income or in this in this measure of cost of owning homes and who doesn't and of course in the non-boom states you see an increase because even their house prices went up but in the places where house prices go up by a lot the cost of owning homes goes up by a lot but it goes up by a lot for everyone okay you get a similar picture when you look at the differences between cost of owning and renting you again see this type of pattern where the cost of owning relative to renting then drops in the crisis um very dramatically okay i think this home ownership rates evidence is important for for for now thinking about net changes okay the the flow evidence that i showed you right at the beginning is going to be gross flows of mortgages the debt to income is going to tell you something about or cost of owning is going to tell you something about the burden of housing for households this is now the net changes if you want to think about it if so if if an owner moves from a house to another that's not going to change homeownership rates of course and people have pointed to this increase in home ownership rates as evidence that you're giving access to home ownership to people that didn't have it before what is striking about the picture of home ownership is that dark blue over here these are the lowest income uh households in in the census surveys and what you see is there's a long-term decline from 2001 then really accelerating in the crisis it is simply not the case that the housing boom is associated with low-income individuals getting access to home ownership they are at a low level that low level remains and in fact drops off even further including during the boom the second quintile they have they enter home ownership at the peak they're one percent higher and what is interesting is all of that increase in home ownership that people have pointed to is actually for the top 60 of the population not not for the people at the bottom and in fact that story is actually a longer term story because in fact the middle you can't see it the middle is 2000 to 2005 that's the picture i just showed you if you look at the 1990s the big increase in homeownership rate actually happens in the 1990s once again even in the 1990s the very poorest people did not enter home ownership even in between 1990 and 2000 in fact these this is between the two census it's really 1995 to 2000 it's the people in the middle that enter home ownership in large numbers and continue to do so during the housing boom it is certainly not concentrated in um in low-income individuals okay so going on to looking at the speed of churning so the speed with which people are moving and remember that the reason why speed of churning is important is that when people move homes and start moving a lot if you have many people moving from homes that they have owned for a while and now going to new homes that resets their debt in some sense people are going to get again an 80 or 90 ltv loan they're going to get new loans and are going to pay back loans that are smaller what you see for the speed at which homeowners are moving is that this this movement goes up and peaks in 2005 comes down dramatically so the crisis is really associated with a dramatic drop in the rate of movement that hasn't really picked up that much and at all levels people are moving more again not the story is completely consistent with all of the other pictures it's not particularly true for these for these low income people two more two more results that i want to show you one is the distribution of ltvs so now this is not about the debt burden of households it is only indirectly this is about how much of a home can i fund with debt or if you want to put it differently how much of a home did households fund with debt during this time period okay this is going to include first mortgages and second mortgages if people use second mortgages to fund those homes and you should think of this as the flow okay this is these are the the people that are moving this is this is silent about um refinances for example this is about people that are moving and purchasing new homes what you see is look at 2000 to 2006 those two vertical lines and what you're what you're looking at is the 10th the the the 25th median 75th percentile and 90 percent of ltvs and everything is moving completely in parallel with small increases in some place so for example the 75th percentile increases by a couple of percentage points the median is completely flat in this period the 25th percentile is completely flat it's telling you that banks what i was talking about before this is consistent with banks lending against asset values asset values were going up you can still fund 80 of your of your house with with a loan you can still fund 90 of the house of the house with with this loan it is not the case that you could suddenly fund a much larger fraction than you did than you did before okay this is also true in the boom states by the way this is not very different whether you look at um at all all states or or boom states all right let me skip the stability of employment to say something about default we in the crisis we then talk about a subprime crisis and that suggests that um the crisis particularly is is especially about subprime i've shown you in the boom what is happening to to debt it's important to say something then about delinquencies and i want to show it in terms of the portfolio of all delinquent mortgages that are out there so what you're looking at here is the set of delinquent mortgages by mortgage cohort so the way to read that is that in 2003 if you look at the portfolio of mortgages that are delinquent up to three years later 71 percent in terms of amounts you can do this in numbers once again in terms of amounts 71 are coming from borrowers that are subprime this is now borrowers that have a credit score below 660. in a sense that's what it means for you to be a subprime borrower as you default a lot unfortunately right in normal times again that cohort of 2003 in normal times middle credit score and high credit score people don't default that much so even though they have many more mortgages and much larger mortgages they don't default that much in good times as you move into the crisis what is happening is all of those middle credit score above prime and then above the median 720 so high credit score people that in normal times don't default you see very low default rates those default rates start increasing a lot and out of the portfolio of mortgages out there that are delinquent you see that this dramatic increase in the share that's coming from prime borrowers all right so calling this um again i go back to um a subprime crisis if anything what is happening is that the subprime borrowers are making up a much much smaller percentage of all delinquencies so um let me conclude uh basically out of time uh what i what what this paper is showing is that house the the evidence on credit expansion is much more consistent with the view that house prices play a major role in the expansion of credit and then a major role in the increase in delinquencies that happened the credit expansion and then the defaults are much larger in areas that have a large boom and bust cycle and these very stable ltvs that you see at origination are consistent with lenders just basically lending against those increased v's more or less mechanically like they always did they the same 90 median is is what you see in the data okay throughout and so this this uh this post-crisis policy response that we saw meant that credit and home ownership rates and credit in particular as we saw over lunch two low credit score borrowers dropped off a cliff and you know this may have presented prevented these borrowers from buying precisely when prices were low and the we hope these facts sort of change the way people think about what happened in the boom and then later in the bust
