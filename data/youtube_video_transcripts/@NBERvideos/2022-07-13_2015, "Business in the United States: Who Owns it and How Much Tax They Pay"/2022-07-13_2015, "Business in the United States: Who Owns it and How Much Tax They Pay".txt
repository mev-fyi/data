we're going to go ahead and get restarted with the second session our first paper i'm not even going to go through the entire list of authors there are eight of them and i've been told that five of them are actually going to share the presentation so that will be interesting um but they're going to talk about business taxation real interesting paper so i i don't even know who's starting but feel free to go ahead and kick it off thanks for the opportunity to present this project um it's called business in the united states who owns it and how much tax they pay and it's a work about partnerships and as you can tell it's by the title slide it's the product of a fruitful partnership between colleagues at the office of tax analysis uh uc berkeley and the university of chicago uh and five of us are going to cycle through so we're going to keep it fresh and exciting um i'm going to motivate the paper uh with this graph taken from a paper by uh rich przenzano and jason debacker so we plot the share of total net business income by tax filing entity type from 1980 to 2013. the graph shows that business activity in the united states used to be relatively simple with c corporations earning 80 percent of income and the remainder 20 in sole proprietorships or informal businesses it is no longer so simple c corporations now account for less than half of total net business income with pass-throughs which include s-corporations and partnerships rapidly growing in importance okay there's a second reason why this growth and pass-through activity is worth noting and that is that the rise of pass-throughs uh accounts for much of the rise in income inequality over the last 30 years so here we've taken data from piketty and science uh to plot two series the first is the actual top income share uh so it's the share of total household income earned by the top one percent of tax filers and the second is a counter factual share where we hold the share of partnership income at its fix at its 1980 level okay and as is well known uh the top one percent income share doubled from 1980 to 2013 from 10 to 20.1 percent what is less well known is that more than half of this increase came in the form of rising pass through income okay so there's a widespread belief that some form of business tax reform is needed but much disagreement about how it should look um the growth of activity outside the traditional c corporate form presents a challenge to proposals that neglect this activity similarly conversations about income inequality in the u.s which focus exclusively on wage and salary and other forms of capital income miss an important part of the story okay but incorporating this activity into the picture suffers from a relative lack of clean clear facts about the size and scope of the pass-through sector okay this is also especially true for partnerships which are the most flexible the most opaque and the most rapidly growing form of pass-through and that's going to be where our work fits so we're going to seek to unpack the black box of pass-through activity and taxation by using rich administrative data from the u.s in 2011 to identify business owners and to estimate how much tax they pay okay now the three main findings are summarized here so first uh we find the pass-through business income is especially concentrated uh even more so than c corporate income so overall about 69 percent of pass-through income that is earned by the top one per by uh individuals is earned by top the top one percent uh the second finding is the average federal income tax rate on pass through income is 19 partnerships uh earn the low pay the lowest rate among formal business types at 15.9 percent and the third finding uh which highlights the tax administration issues that the pass-through sector raises uh is that the partnership sector is quite opaque so in particular a large share of income is earned by partners which using administrative data we're unable to classify and so i have to use assumptions to assign rights which will be described more later in addition the possibility that uh can link to each themselves in circular or loop type structures means that for a lot of income we actually can't trace the income from the partner that is earning it to a unique a unique originating partnership or set of partnerships okay so to take a step back our aim is rather broad we're trying to describe the tax base uh who owns it and estimate the tax that these owners pay which are necessary inputs into any discussion about business tax reform here's the road map for the rest of the talk i'm going to hand off to rich prisenzano next who will describe the data in more detail and how we link businesses to their owners danny eagan will then present facts about ownership of pass-throughs and then uh john mcclelland will introduce our methodology for estimating average tax rates lastly owen zidar will present our average tax rate estimates and conclude let me hand off to rich okay so um kind of get started here with with um partnerships so first thing is kind of want to throw up the 1065. so this is the file that all uh sorry the return that all partnerships have to file and it looks like if you're familiar with the the c corp the 1120 form or any business form exactly sort of the same way you know we've got income got deductions um the big difference is that the net income is then split out to these different partners so we've got corporate individual two types of individual partners other partnerships exempt organizations and nominees and others this is going to prove to be the the difficulty with assigning ownership and getting a tax rate while it's true that partnerships the the income so if if a partnership is receiving a capital gain that income is going to retain its flavor and pass through to a partner so if partnership gets a capital gain then some partner is going to get a capital gain if the partnership gets ordinary business income some partner is going to get that ordinary business income the problem is is on this analysis of net income those two types of income are smushed together and so we don't actually get the information as to what type of income is going to what type of partner and that's going to require us to make to use this administrative data to link this analysis and net income to the actual partners that's going to happen on on the k1 which is an information return for each partner in a partnership there's a k1 that the the partnership has to file for that partner and it tells us exactly the amounts of income and what types of income that partner is getting now the highlighted fields here again this is administrative data so we don't actually get all of the the information on the k1 we just get the highlighted pieces um and you can see we miss um some dividends and we miss um other income those are sort of the two big pieces but we do get um the majority of the the income okay so now we've got this initial link between the partnership and the partners and what type of income the partners are getting the the difficulty becomes that we've got these different types of partners and those different types of partners file different returns and there are different systems across the irs so we have to be able to look at all these different irs pieces to to match up all the the ownership of the partners what we're going to use is something called the document locator number when the 1065 is filed with irs the the entire pile of filings is marked with that same number so if a partnership has 10 partners the 1065 and all then the 10k ones get marked with the same number we're then going to go and find every document that has the document locator number to make these these linkages we actually do a pretty good job in this linking so you can see we've got the 25 and a half million k1s that attach to the 3.6 million partnerships we're going to find almost 98 percent we're going to find at least one k1 for almost 98 of partnerships so yes there are partnerships where we don't find any k1s that said from that 98 we're going to get just over 98 of the income so again even though we're missing the k1s and some sorry we're missing some of the data on the k1s and we're missing some k1s we actually get a pretty high percentage of income from that information okay so now we've got these k1s linked to partnerships what do we do from here uh the big issue is that one of the partner types is in fact partnership so we get this kind of looping money back into the system so um a partnership can can sell widgets some of that income can go into partnership that then flows through the system which we're gonna we're gonna see on a k1 further down the road this isn't a problem we're thinking about the entire sector we're thinking about all partnerships it becomes a problem we start thinking about the industry breakouts and possibly audits and so we have to worry about where the income is flowing through and two and and how it gets out to the ultimate partner so the guys give me a hard time these are my favorite slides um i really enjoy drawing drawing these triangles so um so we've got a b and c partnership so triangle is a partnership the arrows are directions of flow so if we look at partnership a each partnership has to have at least one partner that's either an individual or a corporation so if we look at a it's ultimate partners or its owners are just a 1040 or 1120 filer so if we look at a we can actually solve for a's tax rate because it's just going to be the tax rate faced by the 1040 or 1120 uh partnership depending on the type of income so once we solve a then we can look at okay so now b is sending money to a 1040 and 1120 end to a so once we solve a we actually solve b too we'll be able to get a tax rate for b once we have a tax rate for b we actually now have a tax rate for c because it's sending money to a which we have a tax rate it's 10 40 or 11 20 partnership um sorry partner and then it we also have a tax rate for b so that becomes a system that's closed that we can we can see the ultimate owners we can assign tax rates for for a b and c here's where the fun starts so now we've got d e and f so now we can pick any one of those and if we if we look at f so we've got its 10 40 and 11 20 partners but it's sending money to e so e we're dependent to get a tax rate for f we're dependent on getting a tax rate for e problem is e is sending money to d so we're dependent upon d to get a tax rate for e and then d is sending money to f and so we're dependent upon the tax rate ref to get the d to that gets us e which would get us f right which we need d4 right so so you can see where this becomes very difficult um pretty quickly now what we're going to do is we're going to do a recursive massive method of of solving these things um i want to be careful too so some some partnerships you can think of as just sort of in a in a straight line we've got an individual at the bottom a partnership partnership and it goes straight up and so that sort of solves through the tiers um uh going up to the to where the money first enters the partnership sector we're gonna because of these circular patterns any step that we solve we actually might be able to solve multiple layers of those partnerships because of the way these things work and so our recursive method runs through um roughly 20 times to sort of solve these things it does not solve all of them we end up with a fair number of partnerships as eric sort of noted where we do we don't see this ultimate we can't essentially close the close the loop um and again this recursive algorithm is going to trace the income through the tiers until we get to sort of a non-transparent partnership where we can't uh put our finger on the dial to stop it and then just for as a um a point here we've got these are the types of partners right so we've got sort of the simple ones the the 1040s the individuals the s corpse 1120s we've got the alphabet there for the the 1120cs um and then these estates foreign whatnot the last two are kind of important so we've got the unidentified ein and the unidentified tin type so one is we actually see the k1 but we don't find a return that they're filing that that k1 is attached to the unidentified ein we're just we're left with we don't know what type of file are they all at all r at all excuse me so that's sort of the method finding the owners for the partnerships it's this complicated structure we're going to run this recursive algorithm for the other types of business it's actually much simpler so um the s corporations once you sort of understand what we're doing for partnerships in terms of this recursive method the s-corps is the same way it's just a really simple example because um shareholders and s-corps can only be individuals so we know they're all 1040s it solves some of our problem and we we make the linkage linkages the same way through k-1s sole props is really easy because the business income is actually attached to the 1040 and then we have the the c-corp we have this dividend um income um so that at that point i'm passing off to danny okay so now that we've got the um data structure and environment set we can now start answering the question that we set out to answer so business in the united states who owns it now we're dealing with four types of businesses here we're focusing on sole proprietorships s corporations c corporations and partnerships now partnerships are the most opaque and least well-known of this group sole proprietorships are all obviously owned by individuals s corporations are also by law owned by individuals c corporations we know a lot about their ownership since much c-corporation stock is publicly held and traded partnership ownership however is very flexible all kinds of entities and individuals can own it but all those part all those ownership stats are private and so we're going to start with stats on who owns partnerships so this graph takes the 25.3 million partnership k-1s that identify an owner of a partnership a partner and groups them by the categories that rich mentioned focus for now only on the red bars and you can see that the overwhelming majority of partnership owners are individuals there's a substantial portion owned by states and trusts about five percent and then a little less by different types of corporations so what did we learn from this graph well immediately you can see that almost 10 percent of the owners of partnerships are owners that we are not able to classify okay so those are in two groups that's the unidentified tin type we don't know whether it's an individual or business entity or the unidentified ein we know it's a business but we can't find the business return so this highlights what eric was talking about earlier the flexible nature of partnership taxation and ownership may lead to difficulties at least in understanding who's paying taxes and administering the tax system so this is the number of k-1s by partner how about income where does the income flow does it flow to individuals in the same degree or or to a lesser degree this graph takes all the income and allocates them by group so we're summing income across all the income fields that we see on the partnership k1s so the first fact to see is that over a quarter of the income earned by partnerships is allocated to other partnerships that's the partnership bar so this underscores that any analysis of partnership partnership taxation must follow the income across partnership tiers to ultimate owners why because partnerships face no entity level tax all partnership income must be allocated outside of the partnership sector by law by the end of the year at the end of the year so how do we come up with income measures outside of the partnership sector well we just exclude all the five percent of partnership k-1s partners that are partnerships and go from the red bars to the blue bars okay so the blue bars sum to 100 and partnerships are excluded from from this uh allocation of income and what you see is that instead of a majority of the income being allocated to individuals it's actually a minority of the income that's allocated individuals and instead of disproportionately large share of income it's allocated to the business entity owners of partners of partnerships so um this is the uh structure of who owns it now we noted earlier that less than um that about 10 of partners were unable unable to classify those partners earn disproportionately large shares of income so fully 20 of the income flows to partners whom we are unable to classify as either identifiable individuals or identifiable business entities so this is uh who owns the income now just you know what should we think about as the canonical types of partnerships well this graph plots partnership income excluding the k1s that reflect partnership partners and plots income shares by industry so what this graph shows is that canonical partnerships operating in say law firms tax advisory firms those in professional services do earn a substantial share of partnership income 11 however the vast majority of partnership income is earned in partnerships operating in the finance or holding companies industries so this includes real estate but also for example hedge funds this fact is going to come into play in just a couple slides and then later in what john and owen describe so we've now zoomed in to the partnership sector let's now zoom out and compare business participation and income across the different types of businesses so we do that for a particular type of owner tax filing households and we do that by beginning with plotting participation rates across our four business types for each percentile of the adjusted gross income distribution in 2011. so specifically to construct this graph we take the 145 million 1040s tax filing households that's what referred to households here in 2011 split them up into percentiles by justin gross income and then within each percentile plot the share of tax filing units of those households that have positive income of each of four types positive sole proprietorship income that's schedule c income in blue positive c corporation income which we define as positive dividend income that's an imperfect proxy but that's what we can work with here positive s corporation income that's positive summed income across the 11 20 s k ones and finally in orange positive partnership income that's positive income uh some in on a 1065 k1 some across the income fuels that we see so what does this graph tell us well first as kind of a benchmark it's notable that sole proprietorship participation is roughly constant across the income distribution so roughly you know it varies across the percentiles but between eight percent and fifteen percent of households in each percentile of the agi distribution participates in a sole proprietorship in contrast let's take c corporation income c corporation participation is highly skewed so whereas 80 percent of top 1 percent households participate in c corporation ownership they have positive dividend income less than a tenth of that is the participation rate in the bottom 50 percent of the income distribution finally partnership participation though although equally high in the top 1 percent is very small less than 1 50th in the bottom 50 of the income distribution highlighting that partnership participation is even more highly skewed than the canonical traditional corporation c corporations and we see that when we go to income it's even more skewed pass-throughs partnerships and s corporations uh over 60 percent up to 69 percent of the income is earned by top one percent households in contrast to 44 of c corporation income earned by top one percent households so finally you might think you know we care not just about ownership but taxation oh well if all the partnership income is being allocated to top one percent households well then that must be taxed at the top rate 35 percent that neglects several uh mitigating factors one of which is that the character of the income might be taxed at preferred rates i noted earlier that finance is disproportionately um generating income in the partnership sector uh finance income capital gains is taxed at preferred rates often and so you can see that when we break down that 69 number into industries we can see that uh of that 69 percent in the top one percent number if we divide it by industries here we're showing three uh example industries accommodation and food service sort of a mom and pop industry professional services that's maybe the canonical partnership type law firms etc and the finance and holding companies in green 37 percentage points of that 69 percent uh is earned in a finance partnership in contrast to about 16 percent in one of the more canonical type of partnership industries so this is just one suggestive element that partnership taxation is going to be below the top rates that you might think of even for these top one percent households for more systematic analysis we now turn to john and owen all right so um we're going to try to catch up some time here and we'll be focused here looking at average taxes given the questions of this paper and so what we're going to do is think about for all the potential income that's flowing through these various business forms what is the average tax rate and there's two basic approaches for most cases that is for the most frequent forms we see 1040s 1120s limit 20s we're going to use the administrative data in the irs database to actually look at the tax returns of these owners or partners and actually calculate their tax we're going to ask the hypothetical question if they hadn't received this income what would be their change in tax liability divide that change in tax liability by the flow of income to them and that gives us an average tax rate for that owner and we're going to do that separately for four different types of income we've aggregated off the information returns capital gains dividends ordinary business income and interest and when we calculate it we're going to for our partnership our partner in partnerships we're going to take all the partnerships that may be paying to that individual aggregate all their incomes so we don't have a stacking order issue as we consider a partnership by partnership we're taking the entire amount and saying for this owner for their gains they're getting from partnerships what is the average tax rate that they face and again that's using the administrative data so it's a modification of the calculators that ota uses for other purposes so for again for 1120 filers and for 1040 is that what we do but we can't do that for all the potential types of partners we have this alphabet soup of potential partners in some cases we just don't have the infrastructure to do that and so there's a set of other types of partners where we're simply going to assign a tax rate based on the characteristic of the return that that k-1 is going to so if it's going to a another type of pass-through a rick or read a remick we are essentially going to not be able to pierce that veil and so we're going to assume people receiving partnership income via these entities look a lot like as if they received it directly so we use a calculated average tax rate that we saw people were individuals receiving uh partnership income and then assign it for the flows flowing through these risks or reits and so forth in a similar fashion for the alphabet soup of 1120s rather have separate calculators for each we're going to assume that essentially the average tax rates for all these different various forms look a lot like a standard 1120 calculate the 1120 population and then assign that to the flows so these more esoteric forms and then there's two other classes are worth noting we have lots of payments out of partnerships going to foreign entities where we don't necessarily they potentially have filed a 1040 in which case we're going to use that but if not we don't see anything else there we're assuming what's happening here is the withholding taxes serving as the tax on those flows so from an outside side by soi we're going to use the observed average tax rate on these foreign withholding taxes and assign that tax rate to these amounts and then if it's going to a tax exempt we're going to assume a rate of zero um then we have this unidentified group we think they're corporate and i think owen may allude to that we're going to then essentially assign a rate for those partners those partner flows as well when we aggregate them up now that we have this vast database with tax rates and all the flows we simply can just multiply the tax rate times the flow and create weighted average to determine the tax rate for any partnership clearly when we aggregate up to the sector as a whole we exclude the partnership to partnership flows and so then we've been able to move from a tax rate on individual faces to a partnership sector tax rate which is again over the sum of all the payments we see from the partnership sector out we're interested in this paper to compare that tax rate to other alternative business forms so much more straightforward as rich alluded to if we think about s-corps and sole props it's the same exact sort of mechanics it's just we don't have the tiering we can just look directly between the flow from the business to the individual run it through a micro calculator and calculate the the average tax and for c corps we're actually going to use a c corp return we're going to look at the tax paid on the 1120 divided by taxable income that will be what we're like the first layer the business layer of tax on that and then we're going to recognize the fact via methodology outlined in perturb 2004 to estimate what the second layer of tax is that when that's taxed at um as dividends or capital gains what that additional tax burden would be on the on that income so that now gives us a set of tax rates that we've assigned to all these business flows and then owen's going to talk about sort of what that says all right great so i think we're running short on time so i'll be very brief so what do we find we find that the average tax rate on business income at the federal level in the united states is 24 and we believe that this is the most comprehensive estimate available because you have to follow money through partnerships and that's a quarter of business income and so this 24 number is important but it's really just a weighted average of four different numbers so this graph shows for c corps the rate um is 32 s corpse and partnerships are much lower at 25 and roughly 16 and then sole props are 13.6 and so these middle two bars uh represent the pass-through sector and on average that's 19 percent in the pass-through sector so it's much lower than the traditional type of of business so this really begs the question why is the partnership rate so low and there's three reasons why it's low the first is that a lot of the money is flowing to partners with low rates and so in the bottom you can see tax exempt entities and uh foreign persons they're making um a substantial amount of money it's 15 and then these unidentified groups as highlighted earlier make 20 of the income and so the first reason why the partnership rate is low is that a lot of money flows to people with low rates a second reason or sorry so you know part of that is i'll just kind of skip ahead the second reason why this rate is low is a lot of the money is in the form of preferred income so it's as you can see in red a lot of a lot of money goes to capital gains and dividend income which is taxed at preferred rates and so i think 45 of partnership income overall is in in this form and those have lower rates so then the third reason why um why partnership income is taxed at a low rate is that partnership ownership can be opaque and opaque partnerships pay fairly low rates and so what do i mean by this referring to the 20 of income that is earned by partners that we can't classify and then the second group is the group that rich was talking about of these non-transparent and circular partnerships and so when you kind of go through and figure out how much money is in that that nexus that is in these non non-transparent partnerships the facts are pretty striking so there's you know 20 000 of them and they issue 10 million k1s if you collectively add up all of the income earned by these non-transparent partnerships of the 670 billion dollars in the whole partnership sector 100 billion is earned by this group and if you say how much tax is paid on that 100 billion dollars it's only 8.8 percent okay so to wrap up what did we what did we do in this paper what we did is we documented the rise of pass-through income and so we showed that pass-through income is not only growing but it's especially concentrated it's hard to trace and it's taxed at low rates so one one stat for how concentrated it is 69 of pass-through income is earned by individuals in the top one percent and then the union of money going to partners who we can't classify and through non-transparent partnerships is 30 of income in the partnership sector overall or 200 billion dollars and then in terms of the tax rate on on pass-throughs it's 19 and so this has important revenue implications you know this is not a tax revenue estimate but if you just ask yourself if the structure of businesses looked like it did in 1980 in terms of the share that went to c corps and sole props we estimate that the average tax rate on business income instead of being 24 would have been 28 and that amounts to at least 100 billion dollars in tax revenue per year you
