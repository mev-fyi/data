i want to ask if there's because there were 13 people who were asked to speak primarily because they were the students co-teachers people he's known for a very long time but if there's someone here who would like to since we have 10 15 extra minutes who would like to speak please do so don't be shy i mean the this group is never shy certainly can totally used to do this thing i don't know if this is true or not you wouldn't let any grad student pay for anything and you would say that that's about program rule yeah that's a very very good point yeah exactly i mean bob would as i said he would always say something it's on my nickel of course ken would say it's on my twenty dollar bill it's arena yes i'm sort of a grand student because ken stock office was my physical supervisor mrs aldo was saying i suffered many years because that was not the only statement of bob's that ken would propose so every time i had a problem that i wanted to talk to ken about he would say well what what we used to tell me and then i would have to listen at great length to what bob had told ken so the first time i met bob was at the eha meetings and he was saying well what's ken like as a graduation advisor and i said well he's really good except that when i have problems he won't tell me what he thinks he always quotes what you have said and bob said well i really commiserate with your sufferings but being an economist is a bit like bootcamp which is that you have to suffer through this so that's later when you talk to your student you're going to bore them by telling them exactly what your thesis is exactly right my students are tapping forward because i'm constantly important i just want to make certain that whoever gets this sees exactly who's here and naomi why don't you just stand up over there so then and this isn't just taking i really think i was in the graduate school in history and i didn't know how this world worked at all but one of the first books i read when i got to graduate school i read chandler's strategy and structure and i read time on the cross and i knew what kind of economic historian i wanted to be at that at that moment and i i didn't know anything about how this world worked or how uh how that you could go to seminars and and remember these workshops and everything and and i was at brown which is not too far from from here as an assistant professor and somehow i ran into either bob garman or stan and they said oh you should just go up to the economic history workshop at harvard on fridays and i thought well you can do that i'm from a different world right i didn't know you could do that and bob was running it and he was the most welcoming generous person and i i don't think you know i really wouldn't be a part of this profession without without him he was just he was able to just bridge and make everyone feel um a part of this intellectual exercise i think why don't you come up here well but then it's not focused on anything i am here are you okay so my story is similar to naomi's my first job was in 1978 at williams college and the worry was you know we're going to be out there in the middle of nowhere and just get disconnected with a professional economic history profession and and this was a real uh worry of mine um but bob higgs assured you know first you know when i told higgs and north i've got this offer from williams and they said oh that's really good and i thought well you know liberal arts college i thought you guys thought i was pretty good no no it's a really different place it's really a place where you will publish and they'll make sure you publish or you will continue and besides you'll be really connected because vogel's at harvard and parker's down at yale and i arrive in williamstown and there are invitations for me from bob fogle and from bill parker to come to their seminars whenever i wanted and moreover you know he leaves bob wrote me this little note and he leaves his number and says just call maryland and marilyn will get you a parking permit and you could just drive right into the tower and it was just wonderful i you know i went and met all these great people and never felt like i was you know the kid from the country bumpkin kind of school he always was interested in what i was doing i met his students you know bob was there then ken was there and he he was just a welcoming presence as everyone said and very generous with his time and i i do feel that if it weren't for bob and bill parker i might have just done what most of my colleagues did do at williams was just do enough to get tenure and then let it go but not really stay connected and bob made me feel like i was as good as the people at the best schools and i've just never forgotten that that and his pocket protector no one mentioned it for his 80th birthday i made a list of 10 things that bob would tell us to do and one of them was always carry 10 mechanical pencils so i wasn't bob's direct student i learned a lot from him in all sorts of different ways i have to say one of my proudest moments is i wrote a book about coal miners back then a long time ago made arguments about how coal mining didn't necessarily exploit all these various workers and there was a book review in the monthly labor review by a guy who was a clear umwa acolyte who decided that he was going to castigate me for saying that you say i was just an acolyte of bob fogel and that was all i was and so i said little did he know that i was very proud that he described me as an acolyte of bob vogel so even though i wasn't one of bob's students i'm happy to say i'm an acolyte and i have been recognized in prince [Applause] certainly jared i'm very happy that jerry green has joined the group of economic history well i'm uh i'm jerry green and obviously as you know i'm not a member of the d.a but i have very fond memories of bob and i want to say a few words [Music] i have the honor of also being a student of stanley and stan was my first teacher in economics when i was a sophomore at rochester in 1964. and it was the course i think i got a b-plus but that's the consciousness anyway stan and i kept in touch because i really did like him and i stayed at rochester for graduate school and stan told me vogel is coming here every fall term you have to take economic history now i was in economic theory so not too many people in economic theory took bob's course but i did and i loved it absolutely loved it my term paper i had a similar experience to one of the speakers my term paper in that course called me and he said you could publish this what was your grade well i don't remember migration anyway i do want to say one or two other things about bob uh bob had a tremendous reverence for his teachers and as you can see from his recent book on time and that we all know that but i knew bob i went to stuyvesant high school i'm 20 years younger than us and uh 20 years behind him at stuyvesant and we had a teacher in common someone who was a lifelong teacher you know stuyvesant high school it's a new york city public school and kind of an elite school also for the teachers it's the pinnacle of someone's career to become a stylist and high school teacher so there was a teacher named jake lieberman the chemistry teacher who had been bob's teacher and was also my teacher we used to talk all the time about jake lieberman so not only did bob have reverence uh for simon but also for jake lieberman who was his high school chemistry teacher and i think that's uh to me that shows the kind of person he was that he he had a sense that we are in this business it's a collective business it's a network we're transmitting the wealth of our knowledge and our respect for the subject from generation to generation and that's how i like to remember any other comments um one thing to note is that the official university of chicago memorial service for bob will be october 4th october 4th yes if you happen to be in town that's actually to be followed we're having a commemoration of time on the cross 40 years later so there'll be papers on saturday to follow okay well if there aren't any other comments and i think that each one of us could stand here and say things that are both warm and hilarious in fact i was thinking about the fact that when i first met larry i was at one of these dinners remember before i took the fact that the executive committee used to have dinners okay we would meet and have dinner and and then after the dinner i was supposed to sort of meet larry for not the first time but sort of the first time and i had planned to come to the bureau and meet him at the back door and then i thought that he would say why don't you come upstairs you know to the bureau after the dinner bob said to me and he was being become very protective of me after my hitchhiking experience and he said protecting you from me yeah that he said it was like 8 30 or something and he said where are you going and i said i'm just going for a walk he said i'll walk with you i i said no i'm going to go meet someone he said where i said the bureau he said i'll go with you and i couldn't shake and i him to the back door and if that's at that point you could actually push something and it buzzed upstairs you could buy someone and i had a package to deliver to larry which i was a federal express package which uh alan krueger was mailing to larry but i took because i thought that would be my way of meeting him give him the package and so i bust and larry came down is right there and i had then larry opened up the door and i gave him the package and thought so it's quite obvious that i could go on and on with these funny sweet stories but i won't so the bus is downstairs you can turn that off there and
