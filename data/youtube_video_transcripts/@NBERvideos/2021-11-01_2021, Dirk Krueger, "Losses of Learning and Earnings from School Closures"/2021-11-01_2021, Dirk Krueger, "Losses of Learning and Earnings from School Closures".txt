so hello my name is dirk kruger and i'm so glad that you could join me today as i discuss my recent work the fiscal and welfare effects of policy responses to the covet 19 school closures this is uh joint work with a team of researchers that include nikola fuchsiandel andrey kuhlman etienne lalley alex ludwig and irino popova and let me motivate the paper by showing you a map of the of the united states uh so what you see on this in this map this place it displays at the county level the change in visits to school between spring 2019 and spring 2020 using data from cell phones that we have acquired the darker is the color the larger was it was a decline in school visits and what i wanted to get away from this picture is that pretty much for the entire country uh the reduction in school visits amounted to 75 to 100 suggesting that for most countries the colors in the colors in in red uh schools were effectively closed from march to may 2020 and this decline this this uh decline in the school visits resulted in a massive loss in instructional time at the level of the schools uh of course this crew closures where part of a larger policy response to the covet-19 crisis almost immediately when the economy was locked down a large academic literature sprung up to analyzing the consequences of the economic lockdowns in contrast a much smaller literature looked at the short and then also the long run effect of school closures partially and that's my conjecture because the main costs of the school closures accrue mainly in the long run so what this paper tries to achieve is it tries to estimate estimate the long run effects of school closure on the affected schools the children specifically the average future earnings their welfare but with a specific focus on the distribution of these effects eventually on the public finances because the children earn less income in the future that will affect tax revenue and at the end of the paper we then investigate a hypothetical policy thought experiment where we keep the schools open in the summer of 2022 and 23 for six weeks to see whether this policy intervention is a useful tool uh to ameliorate some of the school schooling losses that covet 19 rod brought to us how do we do this we go in three steps we first look at data from safe graph which is cell phone data on data from burbio which measures school closures to estimate the effect of loss in schooling time in the period between 20 20 and 21 since at least the cell phone data are at the individual school level we can do this separately by school type therefore we can do it by public versus private schools parliamentary and secondary schools and for schools in rich and poor counties then we take those measures of effective losses in schooling time and feed them into a life cycle model that life cycle model has endorsements child human capital accumulation so when a child is in school it humans human it accumulates human capital and the accumulation depends on schooling inputs as well as parental time and monetary investments when the child become an adolescent and at age 16 it leaves the parental household and makes higher education decisions and the human capital accumulated as a child affects that higher education choice and it affects future earnings the covet 19 shock is a reduction in schooling time for the affected children it will affect there for their education choice and future earnings and the model is used to quantify these future earnings losses and the associated uh welfare welfare losses including their distributions and we will also employ that structural model uh to do the policy experiments of keeping the schools open uh in 2021 2022 and 23 during during during the summer uh so let me show you uh the highlights of our findings starting with the data so what i've plotted here is a histogram of the changes in school visits zero means uh zero change relative to the base period with this which is 2019 the red histogram shows the change in school visits relative to 2019 in the period between march and may 2020 so this shows again what i showed you in the in the first slide there was a massive decline in school visits during the spring of 2020 then if you fast forward to the fall of 2020 the distribution shifts uh to the right that's the blue that's the blue line uh it shows that we are nowhere near normal in the fall of 2020 but the extent of school closures were not nearly as severe in the fall as in the spring and then going to the spring of 2021 situation is further normalized but again most of the school visit data locate uh to the left of the zero line suggesting there's still a depressed level of on or in person learning in the spring of 20 20 21 there's very substantial regional variation of what happened this is the picture that i showed you in the introduction for the spring of 2020 and now i show you the same map for the fall of 2020 lighter colors uh show that on the county level our schools were more open so comparing these two figures displays the fact that in the fall of 2020 more schools were open the second observation i want to highlight is that there's very substantial regional heterogeneity in the extent to which this happened at the coasts schools were still substantially closed whereas in the south and the middle of the country most schools had open uh for in-person learning in the fall of 20 2020 and this is the variation that i will later exploit in my structural model by grouping schools into different different characteristics combining our estimates of school visits with verb your data on effective school closures we can then estimate what fraction of the total two school years between the fall of 2019 and the spring of 2021 was a school open for uh effective learning and for all schools together we estimate a number of about sixty percent so sixty percent of the school time in those school two school year the schools were open for in-person instruction so forty percent was lost due to corbett under the assumption that any virtual learning format is ineffective in transmitting our human capital we also in the paper do this with an alternative assumption where our online formats are half as effective as in person instruction the second are observations that i want to highlight from this from this table there's very substantial heterogeneity in the school types if you compare elementary to secondary schools secondary schools were closed much longer than elementary schools the effect of schooling time in elementary schools was larger than in secondary schools if you compare public to private schools private schools were open more than public schools during the corbett period and if you group schools by county with respect to their income and compare the top 20 percent income counties to the bottom 24 25 income counties you have the perhaps surprising observation that schools in low-income counties tended to be open more during the covet periods than schools that were located in high-income counties and this goes back to the previous picture because their systematic variation of where high and low income counties are located in the united states in states where our schooling closes were relatively lacks these tend to be states with low income counties states where our school closures were relatively uh severe these are states where high income counties tend to be located and that drives this variation in school closures by by by income so this is our empirical findings and this table that i've shown you here this is the key input into our structural into our structural model because it measures the loss of schooling due to the covet uh school closures forty percent on average but with substantial heterogeneity by the type of schools that that we are we are talking about we then feed these measures of uh loss in schooling into an economic model in the economic model there's two generations a parental generation and a child generation this is a partial equilibrium model so we ignore our factor price adjustments when a child is in school they are part of a household where the parents make all the decisions and the key decisions is whether to send the kid to private or public school how much private resources and time to spend on the child and therefore if the covert shock hits how much of that to compensate by private time and resource investments and at the end when the child leaves the household how much interviews transfers to give the child for for college the child accumulates human capital while in school depending on parental and schooling inputs the kovic shortcuts that means a reduction in schooling inputs temporarily and then based on what the child learned in school the child when it becomes its own household makes a decision whether to complete high school and or whether to go to college and the effect of scovit 19 school closures is that the child arrives at the age of 16 when it decides whether to complete high school and the age of 18 when decides whether to go to college with less human capital lesser quick to succeed in college and therefore with less earnings potential when it enters the labor market after the child has completed the education decision now let me give you three slides with the key quantitative results from the structural model informed by the empirical observation on school closures first on aggregate averaging over all schools or over all children that are currently in school and are affected by the school closures due to covet we predict that there's a decline in the net present value of your future earnings by close to two percent and a reduction in the child's welfare measured by consumption equivalent variation meaning the permanent reduction in consumption a child would be willing to tolerate in a no-covet world to be equally well-off as living through a corvette world a reduction in total welfare by about one percent so we view these as sizable numbers the second thing that i want to highlight is very substantial heterogeneity by the type of uh socio-economic characteristics of the uh of the parent of the child if you talk about a child that goes to public schools the earnings and the welfare losses are slightly larger than average if your child goes to private school pre-corporate the earnings losses and the welfare losses are more moderate coming from the fact that i showed you in the data that private schools opened uh more during covert were less closed during covet the second dimension of heterogeneity i want to highlight is the h dimension so this measures the loss in the present discounted value of earnings and in welfare by the age of the child and there's two important effects here first other things equal the younger is the child the larger are the earnings and welfare losses that comes from the fact that human capital is accumulated based on past human capital so if a child at age six never learns how to read and write then at age 12 it will be less effective in analyzing shakespeare and therefore other things equal the welfare and the earnings losses are going to be more severe for younger children relative to older children but then i also shown you in the data that secondary schools were closed for longer than primary schools and that's why there's a structural break at the time when the child goes from primary to secondary school because secondary schools were closed for longer during covet relative to the no corporate situation in primary and in primary school the last source of heterogeneity that we highlight in the paper is uh the difference in the income of the parent if you think about a child at the bottom quartile of the income distribution of the parent versus the top suppose that these children would see the same extent of school closures then poor children are affected more strongly by the covet school closures than rich children this has this is coming from the fact that rich parents are more effective substituting schooling time with private resources however as i showed you in the data schools in poorer counties tend to be open more schools and richer counties tend to be closed more during covert time and this differential effect of school closures closes the gap in the welfare losses of school closures by about one-third so it is the case that poorer children suffer more from the school closures due to corvette but the fact that at least when it comes to county level income data uh schools and poorer areas tended to be open more that closes this gap by about one by about one-third comparing this gap to to this to this gap so there is a silver lining for the poor children in poor counties because the schools during covert years were open more than those in the in the rich in the rich in the rich counties finally let me talk for one minute about the thought experiment that we then do in the model thinking about a national expansion of schooling which amounts to six weeks of extra schooling in the summer of 22 and 23. you can calculate based on the model the net present value consequences from the schooling intervention we estimate that per child this costs about 1400 dollars and net of that cost the net present value consequences for a typical child is about a thousand dollars so the child is expected to earn about two and a half half thousand dollars more when it's uh entering the labor market because of this intervention fourteen hundred dollars is the cost of the intervention so the net present value uh for the average child's about a thousand dollars and the wealthier consequences for the average child are non-trivial at one fifth of one percent in a way in in a sense the fact that these are positive consequences is to be expected because the welfare consequences do not capture the full cost of the intervention from the perspective of the government this reform would pay for itself in a sense that it costs you about fourteen hundred dollars per child but these child children because of the intervention will be higher earners in the future therefore the government will collect higher tax revenue from these children and in that present value terms this is a reform that's uh that's cost neutral in fact slightly cost cost positive the last thing i want to highlight is suppose you can do this expansion only for selected group of the population because there are scarce resources in terms of teachers and perhaps building whom should you expand the schools to that very much depends on your objective if your goal is to maximize the positive welfare benefits of the children then you should gear these expanded schooling times in the summer to the poorest children if the objective of the government is instead to maximize the extras tax revenue that you generate from this experiment then you should gear it to children from the top income quartiles coming from the fact that it's those childrens that are on average accumulating more human capital their higher earner and with a progressive tax system which we model explicitly these will be the higher taxpayers so if your objective is to maximize the extra revenue from this intervention uh coming uh for the for the tax revenues for the government then you would give it towards the top quartile uh students so this again shows that this intervention is according to our estimates the good things but it has very significant distributional consequences depending on who will be the beneficiary of that schooling uh schooling expansions and that's all i have to say today so thank you a lot for watching and this is a paper that's available as an nbr working paper uh so if you're interested in the full account of our research you can find it on the nbr website as working paper 29 398. thank you
