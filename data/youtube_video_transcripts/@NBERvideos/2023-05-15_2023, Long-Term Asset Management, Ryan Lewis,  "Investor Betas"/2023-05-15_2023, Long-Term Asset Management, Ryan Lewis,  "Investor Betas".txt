thanks to the organizers for putting our paper on this is Joint work with Lorenzo back there and shree so I'll start the presentation um at a similar spot as I start my investments class um so I you know I'll start where where I start my investments class which is uh with this idea of Markowitz portfolios and you know I think we all agree that this is super intuitively appealing the idea that covariance risk emerges as what matters for asset allocation right so you know higher covariance you have to have higher returns to put an equal weight for that asset in your portfolio Okay I do a bunch of like in-class uh trading exercises like experimental stuff and it turns out that you know that holds up pretty well experimental in class okay and then we move on and we say well let's think about an equilibrium framework and what emerges out of that is the cap M model where the portfolio that people choose to hold is the market portfolio and again the covariance risk with the market is what matters for pricing assets this also works extremely well experimentally in class as long as you have the assumptions of the cat and then I have them take it to the data and we all have seen this picture before my students generated this particular one and I have them plot beta sorted portfolios against the actual returns everything cat then predicts everything should be on that orange line but you end up with a pretty flat line okay so we start to pontificate why why do you think cap M has failed What What In The Stream of deductions or assumptions have gone wrong that we see it happen experimentally in class but we don't see it happen in the data and of course there's always one student who proudly says I know why and I can show you exact evidence of why which is my own portfolio which recently has something like this but 95 percent of what they own is in some fad stock GameStop Bitcoin whatever and the last 10 you know one percent is whatever the treasury bond or you know investment that their parents or grandparents gave them at some point in time right so sometimes the pictures on this graph will flip entirely when the things crash you can also ask chat GPT why does cat doesn't fail this is 3.5 so I suspect maybe 4.0 has a better answer um but they're going to come up with the first thing it's going to come up with is something similar to what my students say which is this assumption that we're all doing exactly the same thing and holding the exact same portfolio doesn't isn't true in the data and it may be that sort of other uh you know other factors might matter and different portfolios might not matter I'll also point out that 3.5 did not answer this question very well because it says tap M assumes a single factor and I would argue that Kat then deduces a single Factor but that's neither here another okay what about professional managers do they look like my students well there is a lot more like my students than they look like a market holder on average right so uh 13f managers tend to hold median about 75 stocks and an average r squared with the market of 0.73 okay so professional managers don't hold the market either like we all are sort of familiar with this fact but the point of this paper is to understand what does that mean for portfolio level covariance risk right if they are paid based on sort of their performance and their performance is volatile these managers might care about the riskiness of their own portfolio right maybe don't you don't just represent the risk preferences of the people who invest in them which was definitely true I worked at a hedge fund uh my portfolio manager was short a bunch of like home builder ETFs and I was like we're a distressed debt fund what are you doing uh and he was like yeah if you know if the whole sector goes pear-shaped we lose the fund we all lose our jobs but if we you know have a hedge on there and slightly underperform our peers you know that's that's something that's manageable for us okay so to introduce the actual question we're asking you know there's a lot of Prior literature that that looks for single factors that drive returns or multi-factor models that drive returns and more recently we've been considering a lot more of the clientele of who owns assets and how that affects asset prices you know for example intermediaries well do these people play uh or or institutions play an outsized role in the determination of prices and we've also kind of considered how investors specific preferences through demand-based Frameworks uh affect prices and we're just going to try to take a bit of a combined approach say well let's assume some sort of Markowitz portfolio theory is operating in the background here what is that mean for asset prices in a world of segmentation so I'm going to just give a concrete example of how we're going to measure this idea of portfolio level risk across funds and assets and then we'll show some of the results so SRS investment fund this is actually a fund of a friend of mine from college it's a mostly Tech focused fund and this is just a printout of I think their most recent 13s okay so if we wanted to think about what is the investor beta portfolio level covariance risk of let's say meta what I would do is I would say calculate the beta or the covariance of metastock with respect to srs's investment return if you do this at a monthly level daily level it doesn't matter okay and I would do this for every single fund that owns meta right so I'd have a fund by stock beta for each of the funds that own meta and then I'm just going to aggregate across that so I can take the share weighted average across all these main measure of this paper Okay so the average you know share weighted beta of all the funds who own the stock with respect to that fund's returns I'll also take a quick pause here to show that my friend really likes rental cars they have 50 of their portfolio names that is done very well for them okay here's a preview of the results so if I take this investor beta measure and I sort into portfolios what I end up with is what we kind of would have wanted the CAF end to look like Okay so as we increase investor betas we get higher excess returns and the slope of this line is about six percent okay that's going to be the main point of this paper we'll do a bunch of robustness but if there's one takeaway it's this picture as I said this is going to uh be into a lot of literature that exists okay so um you know I talked about all of this Evolution and asset pricing when you could put a thousand papers up here and still not be you know complete um there's also sort of a different segment of the asset pricing literature that this uh relates to which is there are papers that show that asset managers are actually not so terrible at stock picking particularly if you look at their sort of largest allocations right so some of that stuff is going to be sort of closest in methodology to what we're doing today all right so I want to take a step back and and talk about sort of an extreme example of why this might matter um and then we can sort of talk about what we actually do in the paper so let's think about a perfectly segmented world where you have stock investors and bond investors and there's no cross-pollination between these two markets see what happens in this world well let's assume all of the assumptions Captain Holden everyone knows everything we're all we're all good but they are totally segmented in what they can invest so Cap N is going to hold we measure bond market returns with respect to the bond market and kathm is going to hold if we measure stock market returns with respect to the stock market but the second we include sort of a broad market index this is going to fail this is kind of the opposite of what we do and that's up pricing right because we just assume the stock market for everything but broadly in this in this perfect segmentation world that's what would happen right and the extent to which it fails is determined by the correlation structure of returns between the two markets okay so we're just going to write down a model that doesn't have perfect segmentation it relaxes this this assumption a little bit but it has segmentation holding that is systematic amongst investors and there isn't some super deep popular deep pocketed arbitrager who can come in and sort of even everything out okay so what's going to come out well it's gonna it's going to be very similar to sort of a standard cap M result but what we're going to say is that um the Returns on an asset is going to be related to the level of risk aversion of the investors times some measure of the covariance but the covariance is not with respect to the market it's respect with respect to the portfolio of people who hold it we can express this in beta form and some across all the investors and we get exactly what our investor beta measures okay if you put a stark example down where we really concoct a covariance structure to really illustrate our point but you could have four assets where for example one and four are highly correlated and two and three are highly correlated but the investors in one handhold three which would be the ideal uh sorry can't hold uh uh can't hold four which would be the ideal Hedge for them right and so what you end up with is if I just remember everything was reset to the market betas I get this kind of picture that doesn't look like anything but once I take into account the holding constraints of the investors it looks like beta's lineup with expected returns okay so we're just gonna take all of this and apply it to the data and the exact same analog so I'm going to run regressions at the fun level for every stock of the returns of that stock against the returns of the funds for every fund that holds that stock so that's going to give me a beta J for all the funds J to hold the stock I and then I'm going to go ahead and aggregate those using the share weights as we did in the example before and that gives me my investor beta estimate or each stock I now I should point out that uh in our Baseline model we're also going to take out in this first stage the market return now this isn't strictly necessary uh it turns out to to matter in the equity markets because we know that sort of the market has a flat SML and perhaps not surprisingly returns of funds are correlated with the market so by eliminating the market returns on the first stage you end up getting sort of a more precise estimate of these beta okay when we take it as an appearance inequities we're going to use standard data uh 13f for Holdings Chris for prices and returns in the bond market we've actually seen this you know already presented there's this Emax Holdings database so we're going to use that for the Holdings and then Trace fisd in words for all the other data and we're going to do some of the standard stuff we're going to do test portfolios uh sorted directly on this investor beta multiple sorts we could start with Obama French 25s we can do it at the stock or the bone level um and we're basically going to be you know looking at these second stage regressions and seeing whether or not investor beta matters okay so this is that first picture I showed you just to reiterate out of 10 portfolios of investor beta sorted on that plotted against returns these are equal weighted but you can do evaluated as well you get the same same looking picture maybe a slightly lower slope okay do the exact same thing for Bond markets you get also a very nice fit with this very positive slope investor betas seem to matter uh for for returns so I mean when I first looked at the picture I thought well maybe there's something mechanical going on here um so we do a lot in the paper to try and convince you that this isn't some mechanical relationship you know I I start to outperform on stops that increases the weight it increases the beta and you get some sort of feedback loop here so uh we can first thing we do is just exclude the stuff we're measuring when we're measuring the portfolio returns for these betas and doesn't change anything we can exclude the windows over which we're measuring returns from uh in the beta measurements from the sample period again that doesn't include anything and we can go sort of daily and like exclude again the the the measurement period from the the return period and again we're going to observe something extremely similar okay and here's what we observe and our Baseline model uh it's a return premium for unit of investor beta of about six percent we can see that sort of it still holds up as we do some of these other models uh the the return premium per unit of beta declines but that's mostly just because the beta span increases when we look at some of these other Frameworks um that's sort of five minus one portfolio looks pretty similar and then of course if you look at Daily we actually get a slightly uh higher coefficient there and again in the bond market we find something similar we find a unit beta has a return frame about 1.3 percent actually here controlling for the market because bond market betas are do actually do a pretty good job of pricing bond market returns we actually get a sharper estimate in that setting okay I want to sort of uh propose the interpretation so using this framework for using the the observe uh slope of this line we can back out a gamma estimate for equities of six and uh for bonds of four and then we can look at the the variance ratio between the variants actually experienced by funds and the market varies right so on average undiversified funds have higher variance than the market itself and we can kind of do the following an exercise where we're going to assess how much of the market risk premium could be attributed to this lack of diversification of the funds okay it's just I mean this is the very back of the envelope very crude calculation take the difference in the variances multiplied by the gamma annualize it algebraically you get a 2.5 percent of the market risk premium could be attributed to these uh this lack of diversification okay so we do again a lot more in the paper we form Placebo portfolios to try and sort of again confirm that this is not some mechanical thing so we're going to find for every fund that owns a stock another fund that looks a lot like it doesn't own that stock run the same analysis there and we find basically nothing we can run this with lots of other Factor modelers either in the second stage or in the first stage when we're estimating these betas and again we don't find that it really moves things around much um and then the last thing we do in the paper is we want to kind of come up with a setting where we can really drill down and isolate that it is the risk exposure of the funds that own the stock not some underlying fundamental about the stock that is driving our effect and that's where the bond market actually comes in really nicely because we can control for the same firm and look across the bonds that that firm owns what are the whether or not those bonds respond differently to their investor bait or whether or not they have different investor rates okay so we can include a firm by time fixed effect at the bond level analysis and what we find is that doing that actually doesn't change our results at all so the same firm can have multiple bonds they're owned by different people and investor beta drives returns in that set the only time that it goes away is once we include firm by Time by maturity bucket fixed effects and there I think you know what's happening here is the Arbitrage opportunity is so clean and I can buy one Bond one 10-year bond of a firm short the other one that that's enforcing prices are the same and there we don't see investor beta's driving okay so just to conclude uh point we're trying to make is that the covariance risk at the portfolio level seems to Aggregate and matter for asset prices in a way that sort of Markowitz portfolio Theory would predict it's just that the portfolio in question doesn't is in the market right it's the portfolios that people actually choose to have and we think sort of this sheds light on the potentially how much risk premium is is there because of lack of diversification and we think it could be incorporated into some of these demand Frameworks so thanks
