okay thank you very much I'm really excited to kick off this next section and I'm grateful for to the organizers for giving me a slot um so uh I want uh so I want to talk about uh uh Market design for Education mostly in the context of K-12 in the United States uh in big School uh big city school districts and I think it's helpful to start really from the beginning the market design approach for education I think started with research and policy efforts in in Boston and New York City so here on the left I have a clipping from the Boston Globe uh uh talking about the paper that typhoon and Attila wrote about uh school choice uh mechanism design approach and coding typhoon here once all this is known I don't see how they can keep the Boston mechanism and here on the right is a clipping uh from um The New York Times about how Game Theory economic ideas helped improve uh New York City's high school application process um so a lot of the work in Market design and education has focused on assignment algorithms so the Boston Globe article continues to talk about the Boston mechanism and its issues with uh um giving advice to participants uh and Alternatives like the Deferred acceptance algorithm which is now the most popular system uh used in many big city school districts this has the advantage according to this article that truthful lists are the best strategy it's a strategy proof algorithm uh and it eliminates Justified Envy the other algorithm that many folk folks have focused on is top trading Cycles so this is a variant of that idea uh and uh here's a clipping from New Orleans uh the recovery School District used this mechanism uh and so this is really exciting for Education Market designers that these algorithms were used in the field and if we think about the Milestones that have taken place since uh the Boston and New York City efforts uh there's a couple that I think are quite important so one is uh what happened in 2007 and 2009 uh so in 2007 uh uh through an active Parliament uh in England uh the country banned what they called first preference first arrangements for school assignment Countrywide uh and so this is quite uh startling because as far as I could tell this had no hand of an economist uh involved so I think this is important because it provides some external validation for some of the arguments that economists made in the discussion in Boston because the Boston mechanism uh is in fact an example of a first preference first Arrangement and even more startling in 2009 after asking 15 000 applicants to apply to schools uh the city of Chicago ran a version of the Boston mechanism and said man we really messed up let's do this again okay does that that's kind of pretty strong condemnation and I think real life support if only I could have orchestrated that experiment they did this on their own volition um the second major kind of Milestone I would say uh in a subsequent reform efforts was a bringing together of sectors uh for assignment so for the longest time and uh continuing to this day there is a fair amount of animosity between traditional public schools and charter schools for those of you who don't know a charter school is a publicly funded school that operates with a lot more autonomy uh than a traditionally public traditionally funded Public School uh in particular most Charter Schools operate outside of collective bargaining agreements um and at the beginning of the 2010s there was a coming together uh um where the charter sector and the traditional Public School sector said well why don't we simplify the admissions process for everyone have a common application system you apply on the same form you submit a rank or Federalist Denver and New Orleans where the pioneering districts in this effort that folks call unified enrollment right here in Washington DC uh we're almost on the 10th year of my schools DC where charter schools and traditional public schools are assigned on the same exact system um and so that was quite exciting and uh there's been many other reforms in other U.S cities and around the world um and if we were to take stock so part of the goal of this conference is to take stock and look to the Future uh I think some of the successes of the market design approach in uh K-12 are the following first I think uh there has been progress in reducing strategizing and gaming uh and getting into school so now many districts give uh families clear advice on how to navigate the system we've seen a reduction in inefficient and unfair assignments uh a lowering of application barriers often due to technology um there's increased collaboration across sectors so uh Charters and traditional Public Schools as well as other school sectors information has improved for applicants and administrators you have all of this information collected centrally audits have been facilitated so in fact uh the superintendent in Washington DC was fired uh thanks to the information collected by my schools DC where one of his staffers got into a school when they should not have a so I think that's good for transparency uh so that happened about seven years ago and uh these systems have allowed for troubleshooting and further improvements um so uh that continues to be an ongoing research agenda of many people including several in this room so some of the active policy and research directions uh include what I'll call policies focused on school demand uh So within that class there are efforts to try to improve the type of information applicants have when they apply to school so this is related to the earlier sessions on decision AIDS and recommendation engines many people in the reform Community call this Netflix for Education right so Netflix gives you a recommendation what movie to watch next why can't we use technology and machine learning to do the same for schools so um Adam Kapoor here uh Chris Nielsen who I think is also here have written about this and shown exactly how uh folks might respond to this kind of Choice support other sets of reforms involve changing where students can apply so an example of that is pangxi's work in Boston defining a zone free assignment plan the home-based plan and studying the consequences of such changes in kind of the choice basket the second set of uh active research areas involve changing how the market clears so this involves tweaks to admissions criteria like the elimination of certain priorities like the demise of walk zones in Boston or many efforts that are ongoing right now across the United States on diversifying admissions to schools so here I'm thinking of studies of the way Chicago has developed a race neutral form of affirmative action something that might become a top of the agenda for higher ed in the United States in a couple of weeks or worked at oguzan who's here is done trying to contrast prior already based boosts with quota and Reserve systems and then finally algorithm changes so many people here in the room have studied the consequences of different ways of clearing the market and this is all uh kind of very active and very exciting and uh as I Pat myself on the back I'm kind of uh um maybe a bit cautious with patting myself on the back in light of uh the public perception of some of these systems okay so here is a clipping from The New York Times uh which is top entitled The Broken Promises of choice in New York City Schools the high school admissions process was supposed to give every student a real chance to attend a good school but 14 years in it has not delivered okay and so that's the question I want to use my time to talk about today and I want to set up a a little bit of a debate between kind of two schools of thought and Market design which is uh especially in education uh approaches to think about Market design reforms that have focused on uh the question of who gets what okay so that's you know inspired by Al's book uh so I'll call that the bucket of market clearing policies and I want to contrast that with uh policies that focus on the what okay what is it that we're allocating okay and this is um maybe related a bit to what Derek said about entry barriers uh uh the computer science literature sometimes calls uh uh this resource augmentation so evaluating the performance of an algorithm in terms of uh what would happen if we have more resources and the argument that I want to advance in this talk is that uh even though I have spent and many of us have spent a lot of time focused on kind of market clearing policies uh I think to improve educational outcomes there are far greater returns to focusing on policies that are uh um focused on resource augmentation okay so what do I mean by resource augmentation in this context so one example would be the creation of new schools so an example would be high expectations Charter Schools or efforts to have school takeovers like uh what happened in large part in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina or other Innovative School models like the small schools reform in New York City or the pilot schools in Boston another type of policy that I would classify as resource augmentation involves policies about uh uh barriers to entry uh of charter schools so in many states in the United States uh we have a cap on the number of students who can attend a charter school that's the case for instance in Boston no more than 35 percent of students can attend a charter school uh and then finally another thing that's high on the agenda with post-pandemic enrollment loss in Public Schools is closing schools okay um so here's how I'm going to proceed okay so those of you who study auctions are probably familiar with this uh article by Jeremy buelo and Paul klemper that contrast the effects of setting a reserve price optimally in an auction let's call that market clearing okay with adding one more bidder to an option so let's see if we can do an empirical version of that in New York City okay and so my plan and this is based on work with um Attila Abdul kataroglu and Chris Walters I'm going to use data from New York City to compute achievement consequences of best case scenario market clearing policies okay so suppose we succeeded with the recommendation engine suppose we got everyone to apply to schools where they're going to learn the most what would we get out of that okay and let's contrast that with resource augmentation policies that achieve the equivalent student learning outcomes okay how many schools would I need to close and uh uh to get to the same exact outcome as these best case market clearing policies okay okay so this is the kind of horse race the simulation I want to run and uh what I'm going to argue is that improvements via resource allocation hold greater promise and they actually appear more feasible uh both in principle and in practice based on history in New York City okay all right so the setting here is New York City okay so this is kind of the case study from New York City uh uh we like this setting because it's the largest District in the U.S we have credible estimates of school Effectiveness I'll be talking about math uh High School graduation and college outcomes and in New York there has been a version of this debate in the last two decades Okay so in the early 2000s uh there was this big change to the assignment system uh with the adoption of deferred Acceptance in the Bloomberg era uh now Bloomberg uh had a pretty aggressive School closure policy this is what this is why almost you didn't get another term uh they created many new schools okay so Bloomberg was a a politician who was focused on the what you could say in this um time period uh the mayor that came after Bill de Blasio uh decided to devote a lot of attention to de-screening okay so changing the admissions priorities used at particular high schools and his signature effort is what's called diversity and admissions okay so let's take schools let's try to uh um engineer certain demographic profiles attending certain schools okay so you could say de Blasio is focused on on who gets what okay um okay so just to uh set the stage just a little bit more I'm going to be talking about um measures of school Effectiveness and uh I'm going to be decomposing uh potential outcomes for a student let's say student I at school J in terms of three components so the first is what we'll call their General ability okay so we'll model that using uh their covariates the second is a vertical Dimension okay so that's only indexed by J here so I'll call that the average treatment effect of the school and then finally m i j is a you could say a horizontal Dimension that's the match effect that's what matching theorists should care about match effects right uh so what we do in this paper is uh we want to measure why IJ for each student and school combination and I won't tell you the the full details on this but um today what I'm going to show you is based on a selection on observables assumption um where we have lag lag score controls okay um and uh we're using empirical Bay shrinkage we feel pretty confident about this strategy we validated this in other papers now estimating uh the dimensionality of match effects is going to be Central for our exercise here so the way we proceed here is uh we use principal components analysis to arrive at three dimensions essentially um Baseline match math minority status and female so what we're saying is attending a school if I am a minority or if I'm a female or a low Baseline math scores could be different for me than for someone who has different characteristics okay that's the match effect here okay so now let's look at the promise okay so let's imagine that we could have students ranked and attend schools based on Effectiveness what would be the outcome okay so that's demand side policies okay that's the recommendation uh engine agenda the second question I want to start with is what if on the school side instead of fighting about how many kids should get into stylist in high school in New York City what would happen if schools admitted students based on who would learn the most at the school okay let's start off there now um uh the reason why you might be excited about recommendation engines in this context is the following figure so what I have here is kids in New York City uh on the y-axis I have a gains in math okay everything I'm doing here is a standard deviation unit okay so just to Benchmark this in New York City the black white achievement Gap is about 0.8 standard deviation okay so relative to the actual ranking of a kid their first choice that's in blue here uh their first choice if they got to attend that school their math effects would be predicted to increase by 0.1 standard deviations okay now what if I whispered in their ear and I use my Netflix recommendation engine and said why don't you apply to the school where you're going to learn the most okay well the average achievement gain for that kid if they got into that First Choice school is 0.7 standard deviation okay that's gigantic right that's what's uh potentially quite exciting about this and you see that Gap is pretty similar second choice third choice uh so on and so forth okay now I'm not clearing the market here okay I'm just saying what would happen if you could apply to the school that gives you the highest value add-in you got in what about this the school side okay so what would happen if schools admitted students by learning gains so here I'm going to every single school I'm saying according to my estimate of Effectiveness which students would learn the most at this school okay and then I'm taking the average across schools okay uh so when I do that uh because I'm taking this average across schools okay and where I'm headed is school quality is mostly vertical okay uh not horizontal uh the effects are not as large okay .0954 for math uh at about .04 for high school graduation in college okay now let's take this one step further and let's clear the market okay so uh I'm gonna look at four different uh counter factual allocations okay so the first is what I'll call a line demand this is where students rank schools in order of Effectiveness and I leave this supply side unchanged okay the second is align supplies so Schools rank students in order of Effectiveness and the student side changed okay the third is let's do both of those okay still working in the ordinal domain and then the fourth is let's say I'm the central planner and I compute the allocation that maximizes overall treatment effects of kids in New York City okay this is a benchmark uh and uh what happens okay so uh the title of this slide is the equilibrium strikes back okay uh what happens is there's just not enough capacity at the schools that are very effective so align demand results in a overall math effective point zero three seven standard deviations okay if I'm able to implement this treatment effect maximizing what we call Tema allocation it's .082 standard deviations uh that's a very big if as many of you know it's challenging to uh um Implement such an outcome and the underlying fact driving this is that variation in school quality is more vertical than horizontal so if we think about reallocative policies or market clearing policies more generally there's limited scope for aggregate uh improvements okay now uh this is really an idealized first uh Benchmark right because students are not sorted based on Match effects in the status quo so leveraging match effects requires massive changes in assignment so this treatment affects maximization outcome would eliminate Choice entirely implementing market clearing policies to achieve these effects seems quite difficult I'd say based on the evidence that we have so far so uh we would require large-scale behavioral changes to get a line demand and if everyone rang schools based on demand because applicants don't appear to rank schools by Effectiveness and if we think about the debate on who should get into the school that's happening across the country uh those changes to admissions policies rarely seem to be based on Effectiveness in practice okay now you can also look at what happens to the racial makeup of schools how much kids have to travel uh uh and uh what choices we would be assigning people to under these uh counterfactuals and the changes are dramatic okay so I just want to say this really is this idealized first best and still we're not getting very far in in the aggregate so now let's compare this to Resource augmentation okay so here's I'm gonna model this okay let's close the lowest performing schools in New York City based on their average treatment fact okay once I close the school I got to do something with the kids who used to be going to those schools right so I'm going to consider two versions okay one I'll call effective replacement so what does this do this says if I close uh um X schools I will reallocate the seats proportionally to the top X schools uh according to average treatment effects okay you could say this is smart closures okay a typical replacement is I'm simply going to reallocate seats to all schools proportionately okay this is naive uh uh reallocation of the seats at the closed school so um what do I do after I close these schools I basically we run uh the Deferred acceptance algorithm using these new capacities okay and what I'm going to try to do is find this kind of equivalent variation exercise okay then let's find the number of school closures needed to arrive at the same change in educational outcomes as a line Demand on the one hand or the treatment effect maximizing allocation on the other and those other two cases I consider are in between okay so this is kind of the the uh the two polls that are sufficient and um here's the bottom line here okay so the equivalent closures just focus on column one to get to that same match effect uh as math effects sorry as a line demand in New York City I would need to close 15 high schools okay if I did a smart replacement effective replacement that's five percent of schools in New York City if I do a typical replacement a naive replacement we've also looked at a neighborhood-based replacement policy where I just create seats at schools in the neighborhood that are nearby it's very similar to typical uh I I'd have to close about 10 percent of schools okay 29 schools it's pretty similar across these other outcomes High School graduation the number of schools I need to close is even smaller uh for college it's it's quite comparable now that's a line demand remember align demand is this hypothetical right where people are ranking schools by effect and this I've never seen anything close to uh something like that being implemented in the field Tema treatment effect maximization requires us more closures okay but that really is an idealized uh first best Okay um now uh compared to the equivalent market clearing policies if I look at how much disruption is caused by these closures system-wide uh closures have more modest effects on the overall racial and income segregation of uh the city uh students um they have uh relatively modest effects on distance and travel you might be saying but we close schools because we're really concerned about equity for certain subgroups of students okay and this entire argument would work too if I said let's just Target improving outcomes for low Baseline math kids or for minority kids I would still do better by closing in fact I do even better by closing schools because those kids are disproportionately at the schools that we would recommend closing okay so it's better just to close those schools uh now I said that this is more feasible and I'm going to make that argument based on history okay in New York city so it's more feasible in terms of the disruption in my simulation Point number one point number two uh it turns out from 2007 to 2017 uh New York City closed 15 of high schools okay so uh the numbers I showed you in the last table you know within the right ballpark now what were the schools that they closed okay uh so there were schools that have low average treatment effects um and uh according to our closure policy the schools that we'd close tend to have lower achievement levels they would have large shares of Black and Hispanic students and be located in lower income neighborhoods and that overlaps pretty considerably with the schools that Bloomberg actually closed okay so uh making this point to say that this might be feasible okay in fact uh if I just plot the high school graduation levels of high schools in New York City on the y-axis and I sort schools okay uh uh in order of lowest graduation level on the left and highest on the right if you can see this uh any point that is red here is a school that was closed okay so what did New York City effectively do they just closed schools that have low graduation levels okay so when things are really egregiously bad the graduation level is 25 the school got closed you know uh 10 years after our time period uh now there's some exceptions there uh where schools had um graduation levels about 65 or so uh those tend to have to do with facilities issues actually um now uh how did New York City uh close these schools and why graduation level is a school that that has a high graduation level need not be ineffective you know it says nothing about their value added where the kids came in right but here's kind of uh something that surprised me so uh what if I do that same exact sort based on average treatment effects okay so here on the y-axis I have the average treatment effect of the high schools on the uh x-axis I've sorted the schools by the schools that are least effective on high school graduation to the most effective and what you see here is that closing schools based on levels does pretty well uh it's comparable to closing schools based on Effectiveness on the left tail of the distribution okay so what I'm saying in simple English is when a school is really poor performing it's probably got a low value added okay that's another argument I'd like to advance that this is possibly feasible because it's easy to make the case that these schools should be closed okay 20 of kids are graduating so the question now is who decides if if I'm advocating for large-scale school closures uh do we trust the central planner to do this or are there Market signals inside the assignment process that reveal this information and what we've just learned is a actual school closures appear to be strongly related to high school graduation levels um and so high schools with low graduation rates tend to have low graduation average treatment effects so a central plan or a regulator using a really crude rule of thumb like New York City appears to have done would have identified many of the schools that we would optimally close given all of our calculations okay uh now what about the demand side signals okay let's look at where people applied okay that's what I'm going to call the Market signal uh those are not as uh sharp as um uh this simple closure policy that New York City had and we've already seen that demand is only Loosely related to Effectiveness that was my very first figure right and in fact many of the schools that were closed uh were still in demand okay and in fact that's why Bloomberg got all this grief for trying to close schools down right because parents wanted those schools and that's what I would like to conclude with okay so we need to understand why okay so most of the education Market design Community myself included have concentrated on market clearing policies but I hope to have convinced you at least in New York City that their overall effects on learning are small even in best case scenarios okay on the other hand closing ineffective schools and expanding effective ones appears to be a better policy for learning games so in terms of new directions I think uh the market design Community should think about how should we soften the impact of closing schools how do we make that more palatable or if someone once told me how do we uh what keeps these zombie schools thriving right is this uh about the collective bargaining agreement is this about hard hit communities getting hit yet again because their school has been closed down in in the South Bronx uh and so that raises questions that I think we need to understand what is it that's driving demand for low performing or low value added schools okay uh and this may be where information campaigns or Choice architecture decision AIDS could play a role here if we were able to communicate to the communities that were taking their schools away because we're trying to help them maybe that will soften the blow now another idea on this that uh is quite interesting to me is what New Orleans did okay so New Orleans is a poster child for active management at school they close schools down uh um uh especially in the late 2000s as part of their assignment algorithm if I'm in a school that's closed I would get closing School priority okay so that's even better than sibling priority when I apply to school I basically get a lottery ticket to go to any school I want okay so they've explicitly given compensation to the kids who've had their schools closed okay so I think that's an interesting idea something that uh we should try to study more um and let me just wrap up with this kind of stylized fact that many people in K-12 education are grappling with you know after covid there has been a massive decline in public school enrollment okay so imagine you took the entire New York City public school district with 1.1 million kids and erase them from The Ledger right two percent of kids uh no longer go to public schools okay so districts are going to have to close schools so this is a great opportunity for us in Market design to have some role in that conversation at least it should be based on some uh um uh measures of Effectiveness and I think that's a an exciting direction for us so let me stop here hand it over to Derek
