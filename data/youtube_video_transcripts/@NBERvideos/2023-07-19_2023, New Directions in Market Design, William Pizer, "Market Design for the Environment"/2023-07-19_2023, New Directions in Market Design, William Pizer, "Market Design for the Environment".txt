Rachel I'm very excited to be here I'm at resources for the future and you know our mission is basically to try to solve climate change through economic research and we don't have enough economists so if anything I say during my talk uh my 20 minutes here or 19 and 45 seconds uh interests you please come talk to me afterwards um one thing uh I wanted to emphasize is that you know the problem of climate change uh has really changed in the last 25 years what I want to talk about let's see if this works uh the little oh there it is okay cool um to do something bad just click it there Perfect all right great the thing that's really changed over the last 25 years has been a movement as uh Estelle noted and actually Rachel's well towards just thinking about mitigating emissions to really talking about net zero emissions and I think this has a large consequence for what the role of carbon markets are I'll talk about a couple of ideas you know one is that in the long run we need to be balancing what remaining emissions there are with whatever carbon removal Technologies exist to get the right uh right balance is that good okay um a second thing is also thinking about the role of Marcus during the transition where uh as Rachel was mentioning a lot of this is really about uh technology development and the mitigation is almost a little bit secondary and I think there is a a plethora of opportunity um do I need to like click on the screen mate yeah all right see there we go so just to highlight you know in 1997 uh roughly 200 countries got together and signed the Kyoto Protocol uh most of them didn't a lot of them did not ratify it like the United States um but the idea was to try to get emissions below 1990 levels uh by around the year 2010. um and there's a big focus on global the idea of global emissions trading to try to reduce the costs collectively of achieving that those targets those are also targets only for the richest countries in the world by 2023 you have more than 100 countries including all the major emitters like China committing to uh domestically to reduce their emissions to Net Zero uh by mid-century uh meanwhile there's been uh arguably less emphasis on global trading although that's that's still there we can come back to that and to just give you an idea of the kinds of policies uh that are now on the table as opposed to emissions trading from 20 years ago uh in March the European Union announced that they will no longer sell internal combustion engines by the year 2035 uh just today the EPA released regulations or proposed regulations that would basically require all fossil power plants in the United States to capture and store their emissions by the year 2040. so you can kind of see that the direction of things is no longer about little mitigation efforts this is about major efforts to get to Net Zero um so what does Net Zero mean just to make sure we understand what we're talking about basically at some point by mid-century any remaining emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are going to need to be comp uh compensated by an equal amount of removals from the atmosphere uh and currently there are several different Technologies uh and Rachel actually covered these rather nicely um first of all they're what we call nature-based Solutions uh A4 station um and other ways that you capture and store the CO2 from the atmosphere using natural processes and basically leaving them in plants and nature and larger volumes of course uh when they burn that does release the CO2 so there is some concern about that um another idea that has been pretty popular is the idea of bioenergy with capture and storage they are the ideas you you know you grow the biomass or you kind of capture it from the atmosphere using natural Technologies uh but then you actually intentionally burn it and store that CO2 underground mechanically and and various type of reservoirs and then the third one which was uh what Rachel was kind of talking about the end there um or in the middle there is these direct out capture Technologies which are very experimental um but the idea is that you would literally uh pull CO2 out of the atmosphere through some sort of mechanical or chemical Manner and then take that captured CO2 and sequester or store it either underground or in some sort of product or something um but as as Rachel was saying it's quite expensive so one key role for market-based policies going forward that no one has really totally figured out um is that somehow you want to balance the remaining emitters in society with these carbon removal Technologies through some presumably some sort of market and the reason you're going to want to do that is first of all it's going to be very expensive to do the carbon removal um I don't know I was thinking around 400 a ton is probably what people are are thinking about right now maybe billions or a billion tons of remaining emissions that are going to have to be captured this way if you had to do this through public procurement it would be quite expensive so it seems sort of natural that you would require these emitters to actually pay for that removal so this definitely seems like you know a natural place for markets uh down the road but if you think about the transition over the next um you know in the next couple of decades and for some reason yeah the timer doesn't show very well thank you um we still you know it's not totally obvious we need markets um we can do bans on internal combustion engine sales or we can require power plants to reduce their emissions and there is some inefficiency in doing that um but it's certainly not as big as it was before because now it doesn't matter at some point it's just zero emissions uh so it's really just the transition that you care about but you could still imagine that there's a desire for flexibility during the transition uh both to lower costs and uh to drive technological change but I think a couple of things you know argue for us to think about more creative ways than simply the the kind of traditional cap and trade uh and taxes that Estelle was talking about um partly because what that's going to do in this period of transition uh is immediately put those very high carbon prices maybe 400 a ton hopefully not that high but some high carbon price uh immediately into product prices because of the informal emissions that they contain um and you might be concerned about this because of equity you might be concerned about this because a trade um and you might be concerned about this because as uh Rachel was mentioning the bigger point is is technological development and maybe you don't want to drive all of this uh through carbon markets so I think one of the ways that we can think about uh you know markets still being used uh to drive technological change um is through flexible performance standards so uh the idea of a flexible performance standard um is that you are you know in some sense taxing or other or caffeine emissions uh from products or output but at the same time you're basically giving away all that Revenue uh in the form of a rebate on the output or the product um so the consequence is you don't raise the product prices by the cost of the infra-marginal emissions you only raise them by the mitigation costs of the margin uh and so it's it doesn't have as many Equity consequences it doesn't have as many trade consequences um but it still drives uh kind of efficient allocation of resources along those margins and drives technological change there's a lot of examples of this that uh you know we could talk about starting with the lead phase down in the 1980s but all the way up through the Chinese emissions trading scheme with which if you kind of read in the details uh is basically a performance standard for the power sector um another thing to real realize however is that flexible performance standards raise a whole other set of challenges Beyond some of the design ones that a cell was mentioning um so first of all you're at you have to think immediately about the scope of emissions associated with products um are you just regulating the direct uh emissions of the manufacturer that's producing the product or are you thinking about the Upstream electricity emissions are you thinking about indirect emissions from other products that enter into the final product that's being manufactured you know with cap and trade and and carbon taxes you didn't need to worry about that because those were passed through in all the intermediate product prices but that's no longer happening so you actually have to think about that a bit more and you have to worry about whether or not you're inefficiently encouraging uh you know substitution into products uh out of direct emissions where you're really not reducing emissions or solving the problem um another problem to get into is thinking about how you define uh the metric for the product uh based allocation or the the rebate or the standard um you know as economists and looking at most of our data most of the data is value uh but probably there it might make more sense to think about weight um and then the question becomes are you how do you differentiate across different types of products um just a you know a couple of classic examples um you can make Iron and Steel using blast furnaces or electric Arc furnaces very different Technologies you might say well let's just whichever one is the most carbon efficient let's do that but that has re you know huge redistributional consequences and may not be available everywhere another example is in the power sector you know do you have differentiated standards for coal and gas plants or a single standard that is just going to push you you know whole Hawk into natural gas and again there could be distributional consequences or you could be actually trying to encourage technological change within the cold uh Firepower plants to get to Net Zero so these are going to be tricky issues that are going to have to be resolved another issue that comes up uh when you start about you start talking about very high levels of mitigation Net Zero particularly in the industrial sector is what to do about trade now if you use the tradable performance standards you have less of a problem because you're not raising the product prices as much but you're still going to have higher product prices in the in the jurisdictions that are moving more aggressively and so this raises the risk that there all the pollution is just going to migrate to pollution Havens so in response uh countries and jurisdictions like the European Union are implementing border measures where they will tax emissions coming into the Union based on their carbon content at least their unpriced carbon content um they don't actually propose to rebate exports but that's another thing that comes up um but again you run into a lot of these same measurement issues but now the measurement issues are actually in your trading partners no longer at home which makes it more complicated another interesting question that arises is uh whether or not you base your trading part the imported products Department content on the facility whether it's manufactured on the entire firm's uh product line or the entire sector um on the one hand you'd like to incentivize people to reduce emissions so maybe you target the facility but then you might be concerned that well you'll simply get the imports from the cleanest facilities and the dirtiest uh production will go somewhere else so that's a there's not a perfect answer but you have to figure out how you're going to balance those things finally I just flagged that this you know raises potential uh trade issues in the WTO um these have been carefully navigated I think uh by the European Union but the United States has kind of thrown itself into this debate uh perhaps without as much concern um and another issue that arises a lot when you talk to uh other stakeholders is how you do this in a way that's fair to develop helping countries who may not want to move quite as quickly as the richest countries um finally I wanted to talk uh just briefly about uh other Market policies because um we got into this a little bit in the um with the other uh talks um but I wanted to mention some more things or maybe even raise some issues so um uh I guess Estelle was talking a bit about voluntary markets and I just find this totally fascinating I I did work work on this 20 years ago where I said uh voluntary markets maybe you get like a 10 reduction uh so don't spend a lot of time on it it's kind of summarizing a book but um meanwhile now there's like billions of dollars in the voluntary markets um people have projected it could be a 50 billion dollar market I'm a little skeptical of that but you know it could be a huge Market in the future uh businesses seem to be moving beyond what governments are requiring um and the question it really raises for me is how do you leverage this to get as much mitigation as possible um and that doesn't mean making the rules as strict as possible because that may chase away some of the money these companies have these obligations that they're turning into payments and they want to be able to claim their their meeting their obligations so if you make it really hard they're just not going to do it and so somehow there has to be some balancing of thought about how you extract as much money as you can from these do-good or corporations and channel it into the best possible Investments and I think that is a hugely uh interesting and really economists have not waded into this it's been dominated by the companies who want to get the cheapest compliance and the environmental organizations who want to get the strictest rules there has not been a lot of economics in this Rachel talked a bit about procurement so I don't want to get into this uh you know too much uh except to say it's fascinating uh this idea actually just heard about this last week so maybe you're totally familiar with this but like with the green cement or actually this green steel was the example you may have companies that have an obligation you know to decarbonize their supply chain uh but they actually don't have access to the steel that is green very easily so there's this whole system by which they can pay for green steel over here divorce the environmental attribute from the steel just get the environmental attributes someone who doesn't care about green steel buys the steel and they apply that environmental attribute to this deal they're buying that's actually not clean so it's a it's a complicated Market mechanism and I don't necessarily think it's happening as efficiently as it could but it's a way to kind of again capture that corporate ambition and channel it as uh constructively as possible uh and then I'll just maybe I'll just end a few minutes early because um you know lunch is on the way and uh some of us may still need a bathroom break um I think there's a lot of other financing tools uh that could be on the table here the government is trying to figure out how to spend something like 50 billion dollars that's been allocated in the uh and uh inflation reduction Act and the infrastructure act uh to encourage Technologies uh that need to somehow interact with the markets that are going to buy these Technologies and figuring out how to design these incentives in ways that actually deliver the Technologies to markets uh as efficiently as possible just seems like a huge opportunity so I will stop there thank you
