to thank the panel and Jeff hemeter for a great job okay it's uh 2 45 so we're on panel three which is on improving communication and Outreach the uh moderator this time is Denise Hoffman Denise Hoffman is a principal investor researcher at Mathematica she has a PHD in economics from University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Denise Hoffman's research focuses on employment program participation and health insurance of adults with disabilities so let me turn over the audio to Denise Hoffman okay great thank you and welcome everyone to the last panel on the first day of the rdrc conference on improving communication and Outreach I'm pleased to introduce three presentations the first is from Dennis Hoffman that is not a typo just seeing if everyone's paying attention uh at Arizona Arizona State University he is a PhD she in economics from Michigan's state university and Dr Hoffman closely studies the regional economy in Arizona his research interests include the role of University as an educational investments in Regional development and prosperity as well as the impact of fiscal initiatives on Regional development next we'll hear from Dayo oyela at Bowie State University he has a PHD in it management from the University of Maryland Global Campus Dr oyela uses analytical Technical and strategic approaches to inspire his students to develop result driven skills that will allow them to explore how they can contribute to society and finally we'll hear from Dr Francisco Perez arse at the University of Southern California he has a degree in economic economics from Princeton University and Dr Perez arcee's research interests Center on the relationship between behavioral economics and public policy in the settings of Labor aging education and development and a subset of his research focuses on how the effects of public policies are shaped by behavioral parameters so with that I will turn the stage over to Dr Hoffman right we're going to pull up the presentation here yeah thanks for the opportunity it's my understanding Denise that we have approximately 12 minutes for this presentation is that correct that's right right uh the um the the initial idea really came um from our understanding of uh Social Security is administration's needs and desires to examine customer service delivery satisfaction ratings um explore opportunities and and ways to uh gain Improvement in those ratings and we had access to because of uh prior relationships with the uh Arizona pension fund uh we um we had relationships with the management of the pension fund and uh we uh worked with them to develop a proposal to use their members frankly as a laboratory to query um this uh uh the the satisfaction performance of their members and compare and contrast against Social Security members uh and I need to page down this guy so the um the basic project description then is um it based upon a 600 000 member population that is actively surveyed by ass asrs annually in three separate surveys and they measure member attitudes and we were able to then uh use their survey questions that which effectively to chime in Dr Hoffman I think he meant to advance the slide I'm still seeing your first slide yeah we see the second slide I'm sorry I guess we'll have to do it pull it I have a copy of your slides that I'm happy to pull up to oh there you go you got it can we just checked did it move um about that did that move yes okay we're good now thank you so um the um we were able to kind of get over barriers around piloting uh questions and making sure questions were effective we essentially mimicked uh the questions posed by the asrs uh imposing similar questions in terms of uh customer service performance a satisfaction ratings and and usage of online materials um Etc we were able to mimic those for the Social Security Administration which really facilitated this uh tremendously and also the asrs was willing willingly administered this survey for us so uh we're focusing on SSA service objectives and current satisfaction ratings uh this is uh from materials uh Social Security say Vision 2025 statement we were able to examine uh goals and objectives posted on uh in the public domain and we also were able to talk with the SSA survey research team back in January so that we could understand what uh Social Security was currently doing with respect to surveying uh for customer service satisfaction so that helped us get going uh and making sure that our uh approach was aligning with uh with the objectives and kind of fit with the with the objectives of the SSA so um the uh the surveys uh were administered throughout the year the active member survey uh was uh followed by uh followed the employer survey which was from last fall active member say over the winter uh you can see responses here uh in terms of basic questions we've just given you a snippet of uh some of the early findings uh in terms of uh results the um you could see in terms of the bullets uh 58 understand uh SSA benefits and how they're funded 66 understand eligibility Ops options and these are from people that responded the SRS survey but also responded to our additional SSA questions and now we're just slightly over a thousand folks in this active member survey these are members that have not yet retired um and so this is a a group that that effectively aligns with social securities uh attempts to um um to look at prospective clients and so the active members and prospective clients for SSA would be similar you can see in the graphic off to the right the the bar comparisons over uh the types of satisfaction uh ratings that we're seeing comparing asrs with the SSA uh fortunately they're both um we're again we piggybacked these questions so we're fortunate to have uh exactly the same ordinal metrics uh and questions for the two agencies and you can see the uh disparities there we also just recently received a very rich uh set of responses from retired members for the asrs now these are not just people that recently applied uh that's what SSA as we understand surveys but these are folks that um uh are the entire retired uh member population 840 some people responded to both asrs and uh SSA questions and you can see the response ratio you can see uh 70 Social Security customer service satisfaction and you can see that in comparison with uh with the asrs and so um we also have at this point we also have some qualitative feedback in terms of the last slide that I that I have here we have some some basic feedback uh that has uh we all we gave some open-ended questions and uh were able to uh document these are just uh some Snippets of uh of um the feedback that we have because the surveys came in late we have extended uh no cost to ask for a no-cost extension of three months so our report is not yet finalized it will be finalized in the fall uh we've just completed uh actually this week in-depth set of interviews with asrs management um to try to understand differences that we're seeing and see if we could understand the secret sauce behind the success that the Arizona pension fund has had with respect to consumer service US service we're also about embark on some multivariate analysis designed to see if we can explain what does explain the variance in SSA customer service responses you know what what variables are uh more likely to be highly correlated with ex exceptional performance or a disappointing performance in terms of feedback on consumer service so that is uh Denise pretty much it and we'd be happy uh at the end or however you're positioned to take questions okay great do you submit questions in the Q a feature and we will Circle back to those after the subsequent two presentations so with that I would like to turn it over to Dr oyelay thank you Denise uh let me share my screen no it's in everyone's in my screen yes that's good thank you everyone uh good afternoon so my topic or what I was trying to research on was to understand or utilizing online services to proactively uh support beneficiary you know in in the underserved communities and on the south communities yeah I'm focusingly more on blocks specifically um African-Americans when I started doing this research it was interesting to find out that blocks can be uh grouped or categorized into multiple variations on multiple groups so you have African Americans you have African descents you have a Caribbean descent and you also have um Hispanic origin descent too I also considered as Black song ah but the goal was just really focusing on blocks I wanted to figure out a little bit more about how the blocks um how how do they uh what's the word I'm going to use right now let me take this off so you can see how all the blocks like to be communicated we um you know how do they like to get Social Security Administration to communicate so come back here so the the why for me why why am I doing this right why did I decide I wanted to do this you know because it's kind of interesting and I realized that when I when I did the massage when I was in my previous site talk and I was kind of like you know trying to figure out okay what what kind of area can I focus on what kind of area can I really look into that would be very significant to help the policy orders right to something that could be useful for me like not for me but something that could be useful for policy orders SSA policy orders so I said okay I did a research to find out okay are there any um literature review how that you know on communication preferences about Social Security Administration retirement benefit on blacks and the result was zero so I was like okay I have something here that's a gap right so in my mind I'm like that could be a good research to talk about if we don't have anything on uh blogs how can SSA improve services to to this population so maybe we need to start looking into that area so this way as I say you can get some information the public you know they can get some information that they can take and say oh we have some data that saves this is how we need to interact with you know this population and that way we can improve the services today and enhance whatever existing Services then and also Focus on Service delivery so that was kind of the one for me in terms of understanding is there a Gap and yes there was a gap then I was also trying to figure out okay I mean you know I it's just not only be for me it wasn't just understanding that there's a gap right that's one piece but I also have to be uh I I needed another why to figure out okay what's going to really get me going what's going to get me excited to make sure that knowledge do I bridge this Gap but also serves as a motivator so I looked into Social Security I said well they saying that effective communication of our retirement beneficiaries is critical for you know for better services so I was like okay so we have in one hand here so just carry the same effective communication is good on this other hand we have there's no information on how that could be attained so there's a gap there so I was like all right I have something here so I decided you know what why don't I conduct a project that would explore how beneficials and on the south communities would like to receive the information the information about social security so one of the things so while I was doing this and I was talking to my advisor and it was you know it came back like well there's a uh there was a research that was done by uh I think it was Dr Lillian romanovic and Jenny Young something similar to what you're doing it'll be nice for you to kind of you know look at what they've done so far and see if you can Leverage chat and I said sure So I went in there and I looked the vid and one thing I noticed was yesterday there was some research but it was not focused specifically on blacks it was focused on um different ways and different genders and different groups so that was kind of like yeah this is really good very very good as a matter of fact not that it was so good that I was like I'm gonna use some of their questions to help me uh you know frame like mine so that would kind of see if there's any consistency there and so but the only thing I could say was there was not a you know it wasn't 100 focused on black it was just focused on um different reason changes so that was kind of the unique difference between these uh existing work and what I was trying to do so what was I what was I trying to do to make it a little bit even more interested I was like you know what why don't I make this more difficult for myself right let me do a quantitative and I'll say quantitative kind of a variation of a mixed method uh but not really you know so I decided I was gonna do um both qualitative and at the same time I was gonna do it quantitative and it was kind of interesting and the the motive for that was if I do it a qualitative interviews and focus group I could take the findings from that group and now use uh the finance from that group to develop my questions for the quantitative solvers so that way you know I can make sure that my not only my results will be very uh you know the company I'll have a reaching result in other words whatever they say in my focus group I'll see that if there's some consistent patterns or teams there then I when I go to the Soviet groups and this is an entirely different group of people so it wasn't the same set of people and the questions were not on um the questions before the focus group we had like seven questions and we just asked questions and we had people talking and you know people I had somebody calling so we're just looking for patterns and teams and behavior and everything then we're going to take that form it up into a survey and go over to the uh the the quantitative side and it was kind of interesting so we have it was interesting so that's really uh so for my qualitative the goal was to get um 120 participants in other words talk or have a focus group of 120 of participants and the participant groups or people close to retirement age 58 or 61 who are not received benefits and people uh 62 and older who are already receiving benefit get 120 of them uh multiple sessions and just talk to them about how they would like their information in a communication preference we achieved that there was there was no I mean it took a long time to achieve but we're able to get all that so we have all the data collected then when we got over to the quantitative we now ask them a series of um now we have some seven questions also but it was in depth so that was a solve instrument so we now had to even went in there to have some more questions about that so as you can see uh we right now currently uh they have about 300 301 percent that we've completed and there's a big event coming up soon the community event in the area uh in the in the area that we hopefully will get the rest of our sampling size and not coming up it's a massive event about 1500 people are coming in so we're gonna get out of it but so far um for the qualitative we have 100 uh completion rate then for the quantity we are about I think 60 so overall I believe we're around 69 completion rate so far so what's the significance of this um of This research it's really the ultimate thing is really about Service delivery right improving Service delivery making sure that SSA has a better understanding of this population size that side and being able to provide the service and getting them housed and say okay what exactly is it that you need us to do like I said Social Security is saying hey communication is good if you have effective communication we can do great things we can improve services on this side there's no data supports that says we have that information on how we want to be communicated so and that's where I step in some of the research findings so they they they chat on the left is for the focus group and the child on the right is for the um survey so far and as you can see we have the the size the population the group was we made sure we people answered um we we had we wanted them we make sure that we got the right people filling the right forms out or taking participating so it wasn't just random or anybody can do it we just wanted to be like if you didn't qualify you wouldn't be able to do it and this is just showing um if you look at this how would you like to receive information from socials from SSA regarding benefits and program information in general as you can see everybody which is kind of interesting you know we everybody wants majority I won't say everybody based on what the data we have right now Nigerian people will love the information mailed to them to their house they still want the print they want something that they can hold on to and at the same time something I can always go back to so which is kind of interesting with this population you know and a lot of them were not social media uh Savvy or electronically Savvy a lot of them um stated that oh it'd be nice if they can constantly mail this stuff to horse and if there's if we have an opportunity to reach out to somebody we can you know reach out to somebody or if somebody can come over uh do you prefer SSA communication style of mail and information to your home provides you so do your preferred SSA communication style of mailing you know information to your home provides you with enough information about retirement planning and they said yes the bottom line is if you send it to my house and I read it I said this is help me more so it's more I believe you know based on the focus group we had I think it was more about them having something they can hold on to and they can always go back and review if they have questions so some of the real current teams was play languages needed this population and I keep saying this population uh a lot of them was like sometimes it's so complicated what we get sometimes when we talk to people just from the focus group when we talk to when we call in and talk we really don't understand what they're saying we just believe it's okay and we trust them so it would be better if we could do play language they wanted uh Postal Services meal is preferred medium so far all the focus group was done and about 60 was done um the preferred medium has come is is uh postal The Wanted meal communication Outreach more face to face they want face to face that information is too wardy right then they they want uh knowledge transfer they want people that they can talk to so in other words this publishing wants someone that can really see and talk to they don't really want that online digital stuff then an education on what SS benefits are this population really wants more education how to reach you know if I can say that then one of the things that was kind of interesting was there was a lot of absence of men in the focus group I can tell you out of the 120 people we had on the focus group I don't think we had up to 30 men in the room and then maybe I mean the man comes in it was because they were forced to come in by the women so it was kind of strange you know um this is some of more real current times you know customer service does not make comprehension of benefit easy when they're calling it's difficult to get anybody to understand them or what they're trying to say then our information provided is trusted even though they may not be able to validate that they just believe since it's coming from SSA it's trusted and we had cases of people saying that some of the information was not accurate you know so and that's why the ones had Outreach wanted to come then scam education scam scam call education one of the things they they mentioned was why do you um some people said we don't we don't want to be we should stop this kind of uh Outreach education program at a very early age and not when they are in their 40s or 50s in conclusion uh one of the things like I said is there's a preference for track for the traditional communication method so this is something that the policy makers at SSA needs to know that when we try to communicate with this population right this black population they prefer this they are males to be they prefer their benefit information to the email and when they get any milk they would like it to be in plain language easy for them to understand they also want communication Outreach oh are you going to come more often would you do this more often can you come more often those are the questions that I have sent me I was like I'll take all this question about it as I say and let them know that this is what you would like so most of the centers I visited uh the senior centers and all the different places I've visited that was like we will need more of this we need more education more awareness you know and that was part of the thing then the early timing sessions whereby right don't let's start this earlier for this population is it possible for us to stop early or maybe while they're in some suggestions or maybe while they are in high school just to let them know and understand the difference and the benefits that they'll be getting when they retire Miss Denise okay great thank you really uh interesting to hear uh your research to fill what you described as quite quite a gap uh okay Dr Perez arse you are up all right all right uh so I'm gonna uh talk today about understanding the Social Security communication needs of Hispanics with limited English language proficiency uh this is Joint work with Lila rabinovich who's also here to help uh also answer questions in the discussion um there are approximately 20 million adults with limited English uh English Proficiency in the US around 13 of them were born here and the rest are immigrants and more than two-thirds of them are Spanish speakers so that is going to be the the group where we're gonna Focus uh today's talk one of the main things we're gonna do is look at the differences in knowledge between this group and other demographic groups and why do we care about the levels of knowledge so we know that knowledge matters for Social Security Behavior so we've seen from experimental and cross-experimental work that providing information and increasing people's knowledge on Social Security changes the decisions that people make in terms of when to retire when to claim our retirement benefits when to apply whether or not to apply to disability benefits so it is important uh to ensure that the entire population has good level of knowledge in order to in order for everybody to be able to make our good decisions so we're gonna do so we're doing a mixed method studies to examine uh both the knowledge and the Social Security communication needs and preferences of Spanish speakers with uh limited English proficiency so it's a mixed method it's uh both uh quantitative and qualitative my colleague lies the qualitative leading the qualitative part and I've let the quantitative part we ask how EP status affect social security knowledge and people's information preferences so let me turn to the quantitative analysis we explore these parties in Social Security knowledge between LEP Hispanics and other racial and ethnic groups particularly in terms of their levels of knowledge and also where they get the information their sources of the information for this we use the understanding America study which is a nationally representative uh panel of the U.S population it's been it's been going for almost eight years now we have close to 13 000 panel members and importantly it's recruited from a list of all postal addresses in the United States which really helps uh improve the representative of these data acts that compared to other online based studies and it includes the information on many things so we the the uis surveys older panelists on many different domains including in economics we asked a lot about income wealth of employment history Etc which are going to be very important for our control variables others in in the results that I'm going to show you later on surveys are conducted online but the uis does provide internet connected tablets and training to people who do not have internet access and this also helps with Representatives uh are may not come variables are going to come from three uh panel surveys within the uas that ask about uh one of them asks about what people knows about social security another one asked about how people access information about retirement and Social Security and a third one is specifically about people's knowledge on disability programs the uas surveys can be taken in English and Spanish uh and so we're gonna use the para data from uh the language that people use to respond their surveys as a proxy for LEP status so respondents who are who answer service exclusively in Spanish we're gonna uh we're gonna catalog that categorize them as being probably uh LEP status and we also have a survey that asks about a language spoken at home and again people who exclusively use another language can be proactive to be LEP status now of course these proxies are not exactly the variable that we want they're not exactly measuring uh English proficiency but they serve as proxies because most people with limited English proficiency are going to be more likely to answer surveys in Spanish and also going to be more likely to to to speak Spanish at home but because they are practices it is important to keep that in mind because it's going to drive our results uh basically our coefficients from our models towards zero so the way that that you should think about their results I'm going to show you is that they are the lower bounds of the differences in in between LEP Hispanics and the rest so that the actual differences are at least as large as the numbers that I'm gonna that I'm gonna show you so we basically construct knowledge indices about social security and also about disability and then estimate how what are the what are the differences that can be accrued uh attributed to the limited English proficiency what we find is that English proficient Hispanics and uh and black with black respondents tend to have lower knowledge scores than non-span quads that are about 1 or 1.2 uh points in a 1 to 12 scale but those who are uh uh those who are deemed to be limited English proficiency their Gap is twice as large so someone who is English an English proficient Hispanic can have a about 1.1 points lower than on Hispanic whites but someone who is limited English proficient will have twice as that twice as that there is a significant Gap but what's more interesting is that adding control variables for income well employment history Etc does very little to to change those coefficients so what this means is that it is this these guts cannot be entirely explained by differences in income or employment from this group so there's something about the limited English proficiency that's driving these differences in in knowledge uh what we found really interesting is that uh these differences in knowledge are not equally distributed across different types of questions so we when we look only at questions about uh benefits for instance we find that LEP Hispanics have a very large gap so they do very badly on those questions on the other hand questions about social security taxes and about how the how the funds come to the to the trust fund they actually do pretty well I mean at least compared to other demographic groups the Gap is much smaller on those type of questions and this is something that we uh explored in the qualitative analysis as well and what what we learned from there is that people many of the LEP Hispanics are immigrants relatively recent immigrants in many cases but they've had experience um in getting Social Security numbers they've had experiences in paying taxes in their employment Etc but on the other hand they don't know many people who are already retired and receiving benefits from Social Security so their social network is not giving them information about the benefit part of the system uh but they but they are quite knowledgeable about about the the resources foreign knowledge may be explained by their sources of information so what what we find is that LLP Hispanics are the majority of them report having absolutely no source of information about social security or retirement and this is partly attributed to the fact that their network is also not very knowledgeable about about these issues so for every group or every demographic group the largest the largest single source of information for all of these topics is family and friends so when you have a network that you don't have a network that can inform you about that that's going to result in not much the higher likelihood that you don't have anywhere where you think you can get information um let me just give give a brief overview now the qualitative analysis which helps understand those quantitative results so we conducted eight focus groups uh both in line and online of course they were conducted in Spanish um what we found is a very strong interest on on social security so they were asking a lot of questions among themselves and to the moderators about social security they want to learn about uh how you accrue benefits how long you have to to work or contribute to get benefit and so on but they had very little knowledge and they didn't have many people where they could ask we also asked them about how they learn information not only about social security but about other programs and what we learned is that they they tried to learn first and foremost from uh their social network family friends and acquaintances and second from social or Health Service this providers they um they do look online but they have there are two issues with the online information sources one is they don't find it reliable they know there's a lot of scams and so on um and second is that they find it confusing they can get lost when they go to the actual official sources Social Security they may find it uh confusing or too specific too detailed the information that they find and they they kind of cannot find a way back to information that at some point they found in person they find it intimidating they don't necessarily think that the language has been a barrier they find a majority finds that told us that they find they can't find people in the official sources in person who can't speak Spanish though this also depends partly on where they are so some some of our respondents are lived in different places in the US and they they speak about these differences across places where they can find and where they cannot find but even when they they do find it in Spanish some of them find it intimidating or they're afraid of going to to um the Social Security office um I think um I'm a little bit over over time but uh I'll just give a brief overview of what we think are the main implications of this of our researches um knowledge in general and knowledge in about in about benefits is particularly low for LEP Hispanics they have lower access of information particularly from their social networks and I think this poses both a challenge and a potential impact from uh from ssa's Outreach um the challenge is that that I mean there are very little very little access to information but on the other hand if if we can give some information to this to these social groups uh the potential for the for it to have impacts is expanded because it's going to really go through through the social networks um easier LED Hispanics have a greater transaction costs there is some um uh shame and prostration from information seeking in person and there they are willing to look online but they do find some some issues in terms of credibility from non-official sources and also challenges in navigating um the official the official sources um and with that um I'll wait for more discussion during during the questions okay great thank you and thank you to all three of our presenters
