hi i'm tom dee professor at stanford university and research associate at the national bureau of economic research thanks for joining me for a discussion of the revealed preferences for school reopenings evidence from public school disenrollment this is research done jointly with elizabeth huffinger cheryl phillips and eric segarra here at stanford the context for this research is the difficult set of choices parents and educators faced in the summer of 2020 after having struggled through the school year that had been disrupted in the previous march by the covet pandemic as they looked ahead to fall 2020 parents and educators had to decide how would they offer schooling would it be in a remote only setting a traditional in person format or some hybrid of the two and this is a choice that had to reckon with really serious and uncertain trade-offs across across health educational and economic outcomes in particular in-person instruction could imply health risks to the child the child's family as well as the broader community at a time when the availability and efficacy of vaccines was really uncertain they weren't yet available then but to go remote only also implied very clear risks of developmental harm to kids both in terms of their learning outcomes and social emotional outcomes and also potentially serious economic disruption to households so what happened well most public school students experienced remote only instruction nearly two-thirds while 24 were in person and the residual were in some kind of hybrid format the research question our team took up is what what are the comparative effects of these instructional modes on district enrollment now let me pause to suggest why this matters in part it's because it provides clear and objective evidence on the revealed preferences of parents who could vote with their feet in response to a district's choice would they decide to send their child to that school as a function of the instructional mode being offered by the school but also these enrollment changes really matter because they provide leading evidence of the educational disruption created by the pandemic and by our policy choices in response to that now to contextualize that let me talk a little bit about what we've been learning uh in terms of the impact of the pandemic on learner outcomes clearly these have been historically unprecedented learning disruptions and we see that in terms of key process measures reports of reduced learning time students being exposed to less academic content and less engagement with their teachers and their peers now in terms of documenting effects on learning we're researchers have been trying to do that but in a sense we're relying on a broken compass because the typical state tests the assessments we reduce to measure student performance have been cancelled and many of the more informal interim assessments districts would field have been suspended and the ones that have been given are done under different testing circumstances remotely instead of in person and often with lower test participation so there are a number of serious qualifications there but despite these qualifications there seems to be a consensus growing from the available data that suggests a troubling portrait with important implications for economic growth and inequality so let's talk a little bit about that the emerging evidence suggests student learning is several months behind what we would expect based on pre-pandemic patterns particularly in math and interestingly and importantly these patterns seem to have a kind of k-shaped trajectory that resembles the character of the economic recovery in particular with bigger losses in learning among economically disadvantaged students as well as black and hispanic students and a number of experts have argued that the selection biases are such that this low participation may lead us to actually understate uh the degree of learning losses but also want to be clear about is one other caveat most of the testing is in grades three through eight we still know relatively little about changes in learning among younger students in early elementary grades and among high school students i also want to underscore there's important but fragmentary evidence about how the pandemic has influenced social emotional well-being among american youth certainly parents and teachers are reporting higher levels of stress teacher surveys suggest they observe lower levels of engagement among their students and adolescents and teens themselves are reporting increased difficulty and concentrating and making decisions and just generally feeling happy and these pejorative outcomes seem to be more severe in remote settings and for students in those settings for longer periods of time now much of this evidence relies on subjective survey responses but there's also some more objective evidence in particular scattered reports of sharply increased chronic absenteeism particularly for students in virtual settings okay so this sets the stage for why we think public school enrollment is an important leading indicator it's objectively captured it's universally available for all public schools and it's available quickly in a sense it's like a canary and a coal mine for figuring out what's going on in american schools and we know there's clear evidence that public school enrollment fell dramatically in fall 2020. it's worth pausing to think about what in what sense does that reflect educational disruption well these enrollment declines are going to be in part reflect reactive switches of students to private and homeschooling options some truancy and dropping out of school critically some skipping or delaying kindergarten and that's important because we know those early formal educational experiences have substantial long-run outcomes and many kids are missing or delaying those critical developmental experiences and then finally to the extent these kids may never return in full numbers to public schools that's going to imply a longer term fiscal threat to those institutions so what are the major patterns in public school disenrollment well working with some colleagues data journalists at the new york times and elsewhere we recently put together a comprehensive set of data on a fall 2020 enrollment at the school and district level and in particular we did this because the typical federal reporting we rely on is done with such a lag we made the effort to go to all the states we could and collect and harmonize all the data we could and at the aggregate level we saw uh k-12 schooling uh fell by roughly 2.2 a loss of over a million students and this was in the new york times just a few weeks ago as you can see from the picture um digging deeper these declines were particularly sharp in kindergarten where we saw roughly a nine percent drop in enrollment and to a lesser extent in early grades where there was a three to four percent uh drop in enrollment and we see smaller you know uh less evidence of disenrollment at higher grades interestingly the kindergarten reductions were larger and poorer in urban communities and also in districts that offered remote schooling but the key confirmatory question we take up in our research is did the choice of remote only instruction really contribute to this disenrollment so how did we get after that question well we built a district by year panel data set going back to fall six years to fall 2015 through fall 2020 and examine the impact of the district choice of instructional mode uh in-person hybrid or remote only on fall 2020 enrollment to do this we relied on uh audit data collected by a company called burbio uh that surveys over a thousand school districts uh and and tracks their instructional mode over time in particular their sampling strategy oversamples the largest districts so this sample covers nearly half of all public school students in the u.s we match that to this district year profile of enrollment data from our federal and state sources and also matched it to district by year controls for other covid related outcomes that were likely to influence enrollment patterns the degree of coveted risk in the community and other policy restrictions that were in place around workplaces public events and public transportation the main finding is straightforward the decision to offer remote only instruction contributed significantly to public school disenrollment and we don't find clear evidence that hybrid instruction uh had an effect so let me show you this visually with a you know straightforward somewhat dynamic graph let's begin in fall 2015 and divide that sample of districts among those that chose remote only in fall 2020 those that chose hybrid and those that chose it in person and let's go forward and see how examine their comparative enrollment trends as we go to 2016 2017 2018 and then 2019 uh the eve of the pandemic the last year before the pandemic we see an interesting pattern has already emerged the districts that will eventually choose in person enrollment are seeing comparative enrollment growth that that's the top line in the graph well the dark bottom line the ones that are going to choose remote only one year later are seeing comparative enrollment declines and what's going on here is that the remote only are tend to be more urban and have a long-run historical trend towards reduced enrollment if our analysis didn't reckon with this we would overstate the impact of remote only instruction so we adopt several complementary methodological approaches to effectively control for this pre-existing trend so it's not a source of bias okay let's go to the focal fall 2020 enrollment outcome what do we see well first of all all three types of school districts saw substantial declines in enrollment but the declines in the districts that chose remote only were comparatively large in these conditional means by roughly 1.3 percentage points now so if we net out the fact that they probably would have lost enrollment relative enrollment by that half a percentage point this implies that the impact of remote on the instruction is close to one percentage point and in fact when we turn to our preferred estimates that's what we find uh in particular remote only instruction appeared to reduce district enrollment by roughly 1.1 percentage points now now to place this in some perspective our regression estimates suggest that in the in-person districts they saw all other things being equal a decline of roughly 2.6 this implies that the decision to go remote increased that disenrollment from 2.6 to 3.7 so that's a 42 increase in the degree of disenrollment and given the number of districts that made this decision and the overall loss of roughly 1.1 million students we estimate that the decision to go remote uh drove roughly 300 000 students from u.s public schools and there was heterogeneity in this effect the negative effects of remote only instruction were particularly large at the kindergarten level and to a lesser extent the elementary school level and that's not entirely surprising you know because for the youngest students there was elevated concern about whether they could learn and be comfortable in a remote only learning environment and and also simultaneously less concern about the health risks for the youngest kids of being in person interestingly we don't find consistent evidence that there were any effects of these instructional modes on enrollment at the middle or high school level so the broad finding here is that the choice of instructional mode appears to have contributed significantly to the varied educational effects of the pandemic associated with with disrupting schooling withdrawing from schooling going to new environments so i want to conclude with just a little bit of a broader discussion about where we go from here and what are some of the key unanswered questions right now we're in a situation where uh you know vaccination rates are lower than many would like as and there's inconsistent use of masking and that implies we continue to confront some of the difficult trade-offs we faced last summer currently in terms of uh you know other unanswered questions one of the big ones in my mind has to do with the prevalence of unschooled students in states where we know not just public school enrollment but we could track kids through private schooling and homeschooling and out-of-state mobility there's a big residual of unexplained enrollment loss that suggests maybe nearly as many as one in five students are truant or have dropped out or in unregulated homeschooling environments the federal government has over the last decade or so has made big investments in state longitudinal data systems for students um as well as there's a recent infusion of federal cash so there may be a nice opportunity to combine those and use these new data systems to really track some of our most educationally vulnerable students who may not have any formal experience with schooling right now second big question is we saw this big drop in kindergarten enrollment last year where are those kids showing up right now are they going to skip kindergarten to a large extent and show up as first graders if they do that's going to present a particular teaching and learning challenge because it'll be their first experience with a more formal schooling environment so teachers and educators are going to confront some very unique readiness to learn challenges alternatively if those students uh decide to go to kindergarten this year they would be what i've been calling covid red shirters this kindergarten cohort is going to be unusually large and we know larger class sizes at this age can be particularly harmful to child development so in the absence of responsive staff staffing kindergarten crowding is going to create challenges and that might follow these kids through their educational trajectories even into college there's some evidence that people who are in students who are unusually large cohorts find that the supply of seats in college is not fully elastic and it can be more difficult to matriculate at college because you're in an unusually large cohort so there's some real challenges if that ends up being the pattern as well and then finally i'll conclude with the broader question which is we're seeing serious disruption to the developmental trajectories of our nation's youth what can we do in response to that and so um i'm seeing thoughtful discussions of variety of options that aren't mutually exclusive tutoring social emotional supports expanded summer learning opportunities and then trying to leverage the education technology that might in particular meet the declines in math achievement we're seeing so these are all things i think we should be continuing to discuss and study as we come to understand the challenges we're facing thanks for joining me you
