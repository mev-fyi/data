good morning everyone uh it is wonderful to be back in this meeting with the market design in few answers I was one of the uh people sitting in the audience many years back when I was in Academia um so very happy to be here with you today and I have to put the standard disclaimer here that what I say today represents myself at the director trading Market at ICC but what I say does not necessarily reflect the views of the commission the Commissioners or other members of the staff um so today I want to talk about Market design in financial markets uh before doing that let me say a few words about the division of trading markets at the SEC generally at the ICC our mission are three parts right investor protection promotes fare orderly and efficient markets and finally to facilitate Capital formation the work and the division of trading markets could be thought of as having three distinct layers of Market activities in the market in ministries the first layer what we can describe as marketplaces that include National Security exchanges alternate trading systems Security based uh swab accident facilities and many others and they would cover a broad source of Securities including stocks options bonds security lending and repel and the Security based swabs now the second layer is what we can describe as broker dealers now broker dealer is important because we interact directly with customers and investors we have rules about net capital uh customer protection record keeping sales practice and registration among others and the final layer is really about the clearance and settlements so that layer of activity makes sure that the market has healthy and robust clearance settlement system we regulate the climate agencies which will include the Clearing Houses as well as Central Security depositories as well as as transfer agents now before going to some examples what we do let me first take take a moment to sort of discuss this um I would say you know over answering questions uh what is the role of regulators in all of this right why don't we just leave Market design entirely to the market I think there are three distinct reasons and I think each one of these is important first of all Regulators can coordinate actions much more efficiently than private marketers can do this is not a surprise for Economist in particular for areas that has the first mobile disadvantage it is particularly important that Regulators would come in and coordinate the action for example we would imagine very few investors would be willing to disclose their transactions to the broad Market if other investors are not doing the same therefore regulatory action is necessary um and also desirable now the second reason that regulatory action is useful is that there is a potential conflict of interest for Market design if like purely if if that comes purely from a private sector um for example the private interest to the deviation from the public interest at the privately business develop certain Market design they might be optimizing certain factors that is beyond the investors welfare so in that sense Regulators better present public interest now the last reason is that sometimes the official sector is actually the participant in the market that is particularly true for cabinet security Market you can think about the treasury Department as the issuer right I will try to Securities and the Federal Reserve is the use a sort of user of the government securities market for implementing monetary policy so for these markets it is necessary that way it consults with the Federal Reserve and and the traffic departments whenever we work on government securities Market as we do so today I'd like to discuss a stand for a financial Market design issues and structural issues that we are working on and I I won't say that this is by no means an exhaustive list there are many more but hopefully they will give you a flavor of what we do um the first example is competition in retail order execution uh the new products asro fees ISRO stands for self-regulatory organizations and false transparency of transactions and positions and finally Central clearing the first issue is about the competition of retail order execution currently the vast majority of retail orders are internal retail Market borders in stocks are actually intermediated and internalized by wholesalers now what is a wholesaler now the word wholesaler is colloquial term it is used to describe a broker dealer that purchases retail orders in bulk from retail Brokers right you think about retail broker the household names that you maybe somewhere you use so they would typically sell your order flow to these host Builders um for example if you have a retail investor sending a buyer order to buy a stock says Apple Amazon at the prevailing market price that will be immediately executable now this order is very likely to be rounded to one of the wholesalers by the retail broker now quite often the retail broker is going to feel the retail order out of its own inventory but sometimes the retail order is going to retail orders run it down further to other trading menus now why is the wholesaler willing to do this and pay for order flow the primary reason is that because on average retail orders do not lead to as much of the reflection as institutional orders do that means that after a retail order to buy the price doesn't go up as much and after retail to sell the price does not go down as much so for that reason these orders are viewed as very benign and very attractive so the fact that the large portion of retail orders are now intermediated and handled separately from the rest of the order flow to institutional orders is known as a form of segmentation now in December 2022 which actually only a few months ago the ICC has proposed a new rule it's actually Auto mechanism in order to among other things to enhance competition of retail order execution by asking retail Brokers all their other agents to expose retail order to broader Market competition with limited exceptions so that's the first example of retail order execution using options now the second example I want to talk about is really new products and in recent years we have seen new products coming up quite often some of these products are really targeted at retail investors for example we have more Shaw dated options we have increasing strike adoptions strike of options you know is a grid that will tell you at what price you could exercise the option which is the buyer to sell a particular security and we see a rising number of levered and inverse products being offered just to give one example that would be an instrument like the trade on Exchange that would give investors say two times the return of a stock index an example the inverse product will be an instrument that straight and exchange that will give you investors negative two times stock index return now in rational number the theory I think we can agree on that they kind of help complete the market because there will be more ways for people to take on a particular risk um as they want but also there are challenges um for example do we retail investors fully understand the products and secondly to retail investors receive sufficient protection when the market is then either with the trading hour is sort of upload liquidity or maybe the product itself doesn't have enough liquidity and thirdly how does increase match volume which is in particularly relevant for the increasing strikes of options how does that affect the trading infrastructure now the third example I want to use is is about ISRO fees now this one is a little little dense let me unpack a little bit um so by Statute by law uh in the United States exchanges finra which is the ISRO that regulate broker dealers and experiment houses they are all so called self-regulatory organizations now actually they do not mean what appears to me actually self-regular organization have a very kind of strict requirement by Statute uh in other words they have to file to the ICC any changes to their rules and fees right they have to basically write to us and say all right here's the change of the trading rule um will you approve or not um now the statutory standard for fees would include amount of understanding status fee is reasonable not unfairly is free ministry and does not impose until burden on competition now that applies to a broad source of fees including trading fee right how much uh fee you have to pay to the exchange of how much rebate you get if you provide liquidity data fees right because you have to buy data in order to trade effectively Beyond exchanges and the thirdly connectivity fees you can now trade at all if you do not have connectivity so hooking up with exchange actually incurs a cost so all of these fees would have to come to the SEC um and the basically regulator will have to decide uh what is the um whether they would meet the standard the statutory standard in the past staff in the division trading Market has published staff views about cost-based and competition-based justification of these fees um a cost-based classification usually starts with the estimate of the cost of providing the service now that is actually another trivia let's think about a computer could be used to generate the multiple lines of Revenue and how would you develop this computer operas now uh for the um for the generation of this particular service but you start with some estimate of the of the of the counts of the service and you add on on top of that a reasonable profit margin now again I'm using the the word reasonable now the competition-based argument uh is different it requires that the SLO demonstrate that the survey is being provided it faces sufficient competition and Market discipline which is a different standard now of course these two methods are not exhaustive um so an open and important question is what are the other ways that people could use to justify fees and so far the division has been using task based and competition based uh to basically attract whether a particular fee filing meets the statutory standard okay um that's the third example now the first issue I'd like to discuss is about a transparency of transactions and and the positions um now this one is also the oscillator dense because I do have quite a few um reduce he placed it here let's start with the posterior transparency we know that in the United States pulse rate transparency for equities Market has been around for decades right once you have a transaction people would see more or less in real time you accept this with a small latency will surprise the quantity and where it happens and so on now in fixed income Market transparency came a little later but 20 years ago I guess just over 20 years ago Federal introduced the trace which is reporting engine for fixing company Securities they started with corporate bonds Federal last year did their celebration of Chinese anniversary of Trace um so there's a lot of transparency today but Regulators including the SEC are continuing the effort to promote the further transparency into the market now the next Frontier I would say I'm listening on the first bullet point is about a Securities lending um in November 2021 the ICC had a proposed the rule that would require the public reporting of Securities loan transactions now what is a Securities loan if you're a short seller if you if you want to have a security for delivery you would go out to the market and say I want to borrow that particular security potential at the fee so that I could deliver it to um to fulfill our application now that is active market and so far there's very little transparency so that particular rule is meant to provide the transparency of that market in January 2023 um the office is about financial research which is housed under the treasury Department released the proposal to collect data on certain repo transactions now repurchase agreement is almost like a mirror image of a stock loan or Securities loan the point about the repo transaction is that you want to borrow cash and the posting security as collateral whereas for circulating transaction you want to Borrowed security and typically post cash as collateral so the economics are similar but they typically are down and the different legal contracts so that that's why on Wall Street they're kind of viewed as two distinct Market although the economics are similar so together these two proposals actually would make a lot of progress in enhancing transparency in the Securities financing Market including Securities loan and repo now in the last item transparency of exam Securities where the price is based on the spread let me see a few words about that today although many of the transactions in Securities Market is based on price sometimes the transaction is actually non-negotiate based on price it is negotiated based on the credit spread relative to a ongoing Benchmark Professional Security for example if you want to buy a hot you know investment grade or rebounds sometimes the negotiations down by what is the credit spread you are paying or you are receiving on top of the treasury yield yeah so in that situation today those transactions could happen in the morning but the treasury yield is not observed or not spotted until later in the afternoon so under the current Arrangement those transactions would not be reported until in the afternoon when all the terms of trade will determine once you know exactly what the yield is and what is the dollar amount so uh in November 2022 February released a request for comments and on their proposal now that proposal would essentially accelerate the transparency of this kind of transactions so that investor will be able to observe the ongoing spread if the transaction is negotiated based on spread uh immoralized Real Time with the usual Delay about 50 minutes right so that's the first bucket of pulse rate transparency uh now let me turn to position reporting now currently institutional investors I would say money managers with the sufficiently large balance sheet I think it's 100 million dollars we need to disclose there are quality Holdings um by finding form 13f now that that has a delay of 45 days they could file up to 45 days left before the ends um now thirdly I find it has been around for years but it does not include the shorter positions right so if you're short um it doesn't show up on 30f uh in February 2022 the ICC has to proposed the rule to require sufficient in large short positions to be reported to the SEC and then ICC will aggregate the data and it is close to the market the total aggregated amount of short position particular periodically now that is its social is actually aggregated and Anonymous um so it does not show the identity of the short standards for the proposal now in addition if the investor requires more than five percent of the class of equity security registers under section 12 of The Exchange act there are some uh you know technical term to it the investor needs to file the schedule 13d within 10 days right I'm talking about the the third bullet point which is beneficial ownership um now the SDS has also proposed a rule to shorten the delay from 10 days which is currently Equitable to five days so that is again uh you know the spirit of enhancing uh transparency and the public disclosure about the significantly large positions and finally Security based swaps which would include say credit default swaps or Total return slabs also important means for investors who gain exposure or shed exposure in a way that is similar to the underlying Securities and the ICC has proposed in December 2021 to acquire a public group reporting of a sufficiently large security-based swap positions right so that's another way to enhance our transparency in this market now the last example I want to discuss is about the central clearing um we understand what the Clearinghouse does basically it stands between two trade counterparties itself is to guarantee the performance of the two trade counterparties so if one side defaults the other side essentially made whole because the Korean housing is in the middle in this sense by essentially clearing a product or trade it reduces kind of high risk and reduces credit risk in the financial system today uh the Korean Health dtcc clears a high volume of security transactions and OCC options Clearing Corporation clears eccentricated option trades but a certain transactions in Securities Securities financing in other words cyclinic and repo and the derivatives such as how to return swaps and the greatest false swaps are not essentially cleared in September 2022 the ICC has proposed to expand the scope the scope of central clearing of Treasury security transactions and the treasury repo transactions in order to reduce counterparty risk and increase Market resilience in The Proposal renewable transactions will have a slightly broader scope than cash transactions hey guys I'm making up some time for all of you um so that's the sum of issue that we at ICC are working on um and we'll continue the efforts to update the market structure to protect investors to promote Fair audio Vision market and to facilitate Capital formation now this ongoing effort of course please feel free to get in touch and we certainly would welcome any thousand feedback from this great audience thank you very much
