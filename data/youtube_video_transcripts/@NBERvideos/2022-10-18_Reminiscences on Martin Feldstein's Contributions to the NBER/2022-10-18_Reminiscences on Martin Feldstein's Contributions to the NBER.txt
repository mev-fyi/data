did Marty have a new vision for the nber or did things just kind of happen as they as they evolved and the answer is unquestionably he did have a vision right because it turns out I've discovered that in the nber used to have an annual report uh that was published each year it was one of the things that Marty phased out in his new regime uh but in in the 1977 annual report okay Marty wrote a message to the board and to the constituency of the NBR okay which completely sums up what happened to the next 30 Years okay he said okay if I had to summarize in a single word what I regard as the bureau's potential contribution that word would be interaction the bureau can provide a framework in which to achieve research goals that individual Scholars could not achieve alone or through other existing organizations right and that is exactly what happened over the course of Marty's tenure as nber President right he delivered on exactly what he described that he was going to do so Marty hit the ground running okay probably more so than anybody expected uh when when he took the job when he arrived the nber was publishing two journals a year some of you may have some place on your shelves a copy of the Vintage annals of economic and social measurement uh the parent the the other one was called the uh the explorations in economic research Marty he closed them both okay the nber had offices in Washington New York New Haven Cambridge and Palo Alto I guess the way to describe it is Marty contributed to the dynamism of the American labor market by closing the Washington and the New Haven office and laying off most of the staff in New York and what he did was to refocus on the pure research component with an emphasis on building networks that would pull together researchers Under the nber Umbrella Marty even sold a data banking operation that was being headquartered here in Cambridge to Citibank and gave them the opportunity to collect a set of of macro time series at the nber at that point was was trying to to uh to assemble so Marty within the first two years okay actually launched what what we really was the framework for the nber that evolved uh in the next couple of decades and they're basically four things uh that he did okay the first was he he created research programs that were larger than a single researcher and that were going to be designed to tackle particular questions uh and bring together teams of academic researchers now these are small teams you know 15 or 20 people not the kind of teams that we see uh assembled here at the summer Institute today but small teams to tackle these questions there were eight initial programs including economic fluctuations and growth which Bob Hall was tapped to chair uh productivity which is egrilicus was asked to lead uh Bob Fogle that a group on economic history and development of the American economy and but these groups had a special Focus typically but they were going to meet several times a year and get researchers to interact often with a common problem solving Focus okay so the the programs in some sense became a key part of the Outreach that enabled the nber to start working and a key thing that Marty recognized and I think the empirical Legacy that he had worked on was critical here was that individual researchers working on a data set or question did not have that many people to talk to in their own departments about what they were doing but if you could bring them together right the expertise on how do you process the current population survey amongst labor economists from 15 departments was actually a lot more productive than one labor Economist in 15 departments talking to his or her colleagues right so the idea was we'll take advantage of the increasing returns of bringing these researchers together and that was critical to where Marty was going with the with the nature of the organization okay and it remains in the fundamental DNA going forward second Marty promoted the working paper series okay now many people think just as many people think that Henry Ford invented the motor car many people think that Marty feldstein invented the working paper series that is not true there were in fact in fact Robert Michael uh of the University of Chicago and other places was the was the person who launched the working paper Series in 1973 to promote the work of the of the sort of Health and Social program that the NBR had at the time there had been 173 working papers by the time that Marty started okay and those of you who want to go shopping on eBay right the old vintage versions the big yellow covered NBR working papers with the white cut out in the middle uh those are worth extra uh before they shrank to be only this size and before they then disappeared completely and went digital uh but those were the working paper series that were distributed and Marty recognized that the working papers were a way to communicate new research findings on a broad scale to University libraries and then to the researchers in these various programs so you didn't get all the working papers you got the working papers in your program and therefore you were basically getting the material that was most relevant for you Marty also aggressively pushed to get the working papers out so that journalists could find access to the research and others and this by the way was very controversial at the time because this was not peer-reviewed research and it was very much not in the spirit of the nber which in the older days had often taken four five six years to carry out a project the notion that work was now being distributed without the board of directors reviewing it first and in a way that provided comment and discussion was a fundamental change in the way the organization carried out activity but that turned out to be really important and of course you know today we think of the working papers and other you know in other similar institutions as key Inc in providing information on how the science is progressing but this was really the start of moving that forward in a very important way under Marty's watch there were 1 000 14 155 working papers distributed nearly 500 a year uh and today the NVR working paper series is running at about 1150 papers a year and is of course widely cited in in many contexts third thing Marty introduced the summer Institute okay it is it's an incredibly far step from the summer of 1978 when a group of about 50 researchers convened in Quincy house at Harvard in a small room with a large window-mounted air conditioner to keep them cool during the course of the hot days to discuss business Taxation and Finance and labor economics okay in the summer of 1979 when a similar group in international trade and in macro convened but the idea was that these researchers typically drawn from these small programs would come together and not spend two days as most people do for their jam-packed meetings these days but spend three weeks five weeks bring their families the nber would sometimes rent houses in Cambridge for people who were coming to the summer Institute it was a different time it was a different Spirit but the idea was to facilitate this interaction right the interaction word again because that was what people were going to do while they were at the summer Institute working on these particular projects okay and of course come from that the nber grew to begin to have you know more Span in terms of the number of activities more scope in terms of the number of researchers involved and ultimately less focus on specific questions and more of a kind of General Gathering of of what's going on today of course today it's actually substantially more difficult in most cases to get onto the program for the nver summer Institute than it is for the aea meetings and it's comparable to the difficulty of getting into some of the top journals in a number of the different fields so uh you know the NBR has evolved the summer Institute has evolved from there but it's really kind of a a an a key element of what happened finally Marty reoriented the nber's research program toward more active immediate questions okay so the the NBR had a bit of a tradition of studying things like the labor share now I know that today the labor share of of income is a really important topic and it's moved a lot but in the time when the NBR studied it it didn't move a lot for 50 years but it was still worth studying uh so you know you can just tell if you do the if you do the regression discontinuity of topic study before 77 and topic studied after 77 you can see the difference I mean Marty focused on questions like youth unemployment the inflation okay Bob Hall organized a conference on inflation and edited a book Taxation and Taxation and capital formation uh and and also kind of did broader Outreach thing there's a volume called the American economy in transition which brought together uh policy makers who would participated in policy making during the 1970s with researchers to basically exchange ideas on how to think about these various uh various elements at the same time that Marty was refocusing the research program and trying to reach out to to corporate and Foundation sponsors he also built a a very robust infrastructure for Grant administration at the nber and encouraged researchers who were now affiliated with these programs to bring their sponsored research to the nber sort of fundamentally creating the tension between university-sponsored research offices and the NBR which lasts this very day but but managing to to pull this off now these transitions all happened in the first two years after Marty started at the nber right if you just go back and look at what was happening in 1979 it was smaller but it was very much in the model of what we see today now this was not a smooth transition okay I think in retrospect one just imagines that Marty had this vision and everyone said whoa what a great vision let's just do it not true first all the people who got laid off were kind of annoyed but there were those who thought that this was just moving too fast and that the nber had lost its Moorings and in fact in 1979 the New York Times ran a story called bull in a data shop uh which was about the the new nber and whether or not this refashioning of the nber was in fact something which was really going to be very successful going forward or whether a venerable institution had in some sense gotten itself off on a on a siding that was that was really going to be a disaster of course the time has told that this was a brilliant inspiration and that all the things that Marty did have actually born an amazing fruit and and really not just transformed the little parts of Economics that were starting with those programs but have transformed the way much more of the field of Economics operates in the way we we all do things uh I think that you know it's easy for us from today's vantage point to see the contributions here uh but it's interesting to ask you know what what made this work right what what was the what was the Secret Sauce that enabled Marty to carry out this transformation and and push it forward and I think for those of us who know Marty and interacted with Marty uh there are a couple of things that that sort of stand out uh one was that Marty had great taste and research questions Marty really knew what was important and what wasn't and he did not Brooke working on little tiny topics he worked on big topics and he encouraged others to do that and that really is a key feature of the the research activity under Marty's Marty's time at the helm second uh Marty was a great judge of talent right he was very good at finding particularly younger researchers who might be brought into the nber and given leadership roles and letting them basically run forward uh with the projects and the programs uh that he would help to to launch and third hireless worker uh anyone who interacted with Marty you could never really tell when you got an email from Marty a tooth marked at 2 35 in the morning whether it was because Marty was traveling the world and was in China and 12 hours away I was just Marty working at 235 in the morning as he often did but the energy level that Marty brought to the transformation of the nber was enormous and that was something which stayed with him through the entire three decades of the time uh that he that he did this I am not going to try to offer you a quantitative estimate of how Marty's work at the nber changed the course of of economic science but I am pretty sure that the answer is a lot uh because the way in which he enabled the researchers to interact with each other bent the Ark of progress within our field and enabled the the fields of Applied economics to jump forward faster than I think they would have in the absence of the changes he made I was in on the ground floor Marty sought me out when he was in thinking about uh what what he was going to do if he became president he had not committed himself when he first met with me and he wondered if I would be interested in joining an effort to as we would say in Silicon Valley pivot the National Bureau which a lot of people I think to be candid felt was overdue the idea of having a program with a program director obviously was Central to his reason to be talking to me and he outlined what that what that would involve and and he said well what do you think are you willing to do that and I said oh yeah um and the secret of Marty in building this was the team that he built uh whose incident reaction was oh yeah it was a very appealing uh concept uh it was very different from anything that I'd done before talked about this plan uh and he outlined this idea that there'd be programs there'd be a program in labor i o uh public economics Health EP economics of course and interestingly and this I I thought was completely ingenious from the start two programs in macroeconomics um one that I was the candidate to run and the other that Ben Friedman ran up running called monetary policy well Monte policy of course is completely intrinsic in every way you can't have macro without monetary policy or vice versa but the overlap problem and this came up over and over and over in my uh experiences with Marty overlap no problem don't let anyone complain about overlap don't build any boundaries uh you know oh someone's giving the same paper in two different programs well that's all right or maybe not but but it's not because of an overlap problem there was evolution by subversion uh subversion by me specifically and the fact that Marty didn't just allow this to happen it wasn't neglect he liked the subversion he he he he really loved it so in particular the summer Institute originally in the in the program itself was a relatively small number of people many of the important ideas of macro I'm very happy to say were first listed and discussed within that group but then I wanted to grow the group and I did that in in a number of ways that that Marty eventually bought into but represented subversion um for example to expand the program Marty had initially thought that people would need to be paid to be involved in the National Bureau of course the sign of that relationship is completely changed now now we could auction the right to be a research associate for a substantial amount of money but fortunately we don't um so uh so and that amount of money was about ten thousand dollars in today's dollars it was really significant and it was an important part of of the budget that got the thing launched and of course that was probably important in launching it but very quickly I perceived that it was really unnecessary and we could use the same money to bring people together to pay transport and hotel costs which is the other big aspect of of the bureau's uh startup costs uh and uh and so I went there and said Marty I don't want my people to get ten thousand dollars anymore uh I want that money to be spent to expand the program done he said it was a very quick decision maker this was this was I'll get back to you that never ever occurred to him which was quite wonderful for someone who was now you can see that uh program directors were given a huge amount of discretion they were autonomous they were subject not to Prior review which you'd think but only by later review every program director met with Marty um once a year here at the summer Institute uh and uh and we've discussed what had been accomplished and what would be accomplished but basically uh as long as as long as it looked good whatever it was whatever as long as it looked good uh then you just move forward so it wasn't as if checking with headquarters was an important part of my job and that was why subversion was so easy but what I quickly discovered was that Marty's idea as an administrator was very straightforward was pick a very good group of people to help you and let them do their job so that led to the creation of the faculty research fellow which I'm happy to say was my idea uh which you could couldn't imagine the bureau today without frfs but there's still a lot of diversity a lot of autonomy of program directors which I think is just a superb thing and a lot of differences in the way things are done so it's really a fantastic contribution to build this organization Marty was unquestionably the most successful academic administrator that I've ever worked with and that's at the at this whatever I forget it's around 60 years now of involvement in academics um uh he really really really understood how to manage the how to manage academics effectively and and delivered a better and better package for the amount of money put into it by taking advantage of the extreme enthusiasm for no pay there was never any suggestion that you get paid for it the only Advantage was that you got to participate in this process the result of this was that um the the summer Institute in particular got better and better support from funders who were initially suspicious of the uh concentration in Cambridge which was part of the Marty's original model he was almost everybody in the original model came from Harvard not me I was at MIT untainted by Harvard but then I moved to Stanford which was just outrageous um but he learned to he he swallowed that he didn't say no you're fired you have to be from Cambridge he had just become a colleague of mine at at Hoover and his losses is a terrible thing as far as I'm concerned it's a young the time assistant professor or maybe I was already associate professor at the University of Chicago um I really wanted to be maori's colleague I was appointed to be part of the recruiting Committee of the University of Chicago we are now in the mid 70s and we needed somebody in Public Finance so it was called at the time and I put Marty's name forward there was a faculty meeting and I was shocked to see in a group of people if you know the University of Chicago at the time two individuals could never agree about what's the time so you're sitting in the room with allahaba girl Milton Friedman George Stiegler Harry Johnson Bob Fogel melt Miller who came from the business school in gene farmer and complete unanimity mouth is our guy later on I understood that there was another Pro another plan and as you described now how the NBR evolved and came to Cambridge let me tell you there was a plan to bring it to Chicago at the time and we wind him and dined him and people felt that there was it was going somewhere because his economics was much more quote Chicago type economics you believe in incentives and all of these kind of things and he never said no until he came back home and then was the chairman of the department called me said Jacob we blew it rather than bringing Maori we should have bought Kate so now he stayed in Harvard the NBR did not come to Chicago it was a good plan and I was devastated so Maori was very nice and he said I'll tell you what um we will have a program who will call it the visitors program and you will come to to Harvard and be sometime there as the first visitor of the new NBA program and I accepted and we became very very good friends multi was very very dedicated to his students the second week I was sitting in Mass Avenue he said to me you know what you did not get me but at least you can get my students let me introduce you to my very best student and he called in a young man called Larry Summers and well didn't work out either I remember the worlds that were mentioned in that faculty meeting and it's it's important because it tells you the type of people who were in the room and it was a compliment he is the most serious back of the envelope economist and it was viewed as an extraordinary compliment somebody who has great intuition knows what is the minimal number of data that you need to look at and see the forest through the through the mess and indeed this is what Marty has been but open economy macroeconomics this was something which multi really liked and he said I want to make it an international program with the passage of time those of you who know how the NBR expanded internationally with joint programs and whether it is India and with him many of us went to China with him many of us went to Russia things that could not have been thought earlier the summer Institute as was just described was ahead of its time today many of the universities as you designed them you see the value of multi-disciplinary organizations and this was really the concept questions that were never discussed in such an explicit programmatic way long-term trends in Public Finance Health economy expansion systems Social Security unemployment insurance minimum wage and all those kind of things well becoming bread and butter but not as a dogmatic ideology ideological thing but rather as a way in which one assesses how the incentive system works and this was really multi incentives incentives now who was Marty some of you think that multi was a very conservative not only Economist but also a conservative guy and it is right did you ever see him without a jacket did you ever see him with jeans or shorts or you didn't but yet he was in a way also adventurer he was Adventurer when we went together to the igawasu falls you remember Kate wow this was something we went from Argentina to Brazil and there was a storm the plane had to go back it was not allowed to to land and I said let's give it up he said no we have to go back we convinced that he convinced the pilot to take off and go and try again this dangerous Landing which I would have never done again in March it is always China development forum and the China development forum is a big form where Marty again carried the day with great Prestige anyone who wanted to understand the U.S economy or the world listened to it but for him what was important is the evening that we went to the Grand Hyatt Hotel to the restaurant called made in China the best speaking duck in the world he could never give it up in October always the international Council of JP Morgan which he which he really loved and then of course his Washington experience showed a very different dimension of Maori a dimension that shows that you can be soft-spoken but with extraordinary backs spine spine backbone when it comes to critical issues just those of you who remember the days and the silly debates about do budget deficit matter and maybe they do not and this kind of a discussion and multi-stud firm whether it was against not against vis-a-vis Don Reagan Jim Baker even the president Larry speaks the White House spokesman all of those who were really fighting him and he stood his own so much so that when he left the way in which he was described as the man whose reputation was proven to be impeccable and this was Senator Moynihan at his departure ladies and gentlemen let me tell you this Gathering is exactly exactly Jim what Marty would have liked to have what is the most fitting a gathering in the NBA in the context of the summer Institute of research people Harvard family friends this is the true mouthy the True Legacy and that Legacy is Immortal and through that also is our different Melody [Applause] Murray feldstein came to Oxford a year before I did and a year later went to nutfield college and then I followed him to not feel College uh and we were quite close during that period in Oxford and then continued that friendship for the rest of our lives and that had a great influence on me personally and on as it turned out the development of economics in Europe because Marty when he took over the nber that was a takeover of a rather sleepy Research Institute an in-house Research Institute a think tank as we would call it and he transformed it into a network of economists all over the U.S and some from abroad and that model turned out to be very appealing it was not just things like the summer Institute and the working paper series it was the web of network network of interconnections among Scholars that turned out to make a huge difference to the development of our profession I saw that sitting over in England where I stayed and it was an inspiration for the creation of the center for economic policy research which was also conceived of as a network a network of economists and in Europe This was perhaps even more important than in the United States because the separation the national separations meant that people really didn't work together very much uh the NBR model first starting with the summer Institute and the interconnections that developed there and then subsequently in all sorts of projects and working groups and conferences and so forth that was a tremendous stimulus to the development of best practice economics and it was in Europe too it turned out the cepr the center for economic policy research following that model with some changes of course to uh adapt to local conditions we constructed what we called subsequently a think net rather than the think tank and it was for for the United States it was a big change the National Bureau of economic research was an old well-established Think Tank Research Institute but it was rather sleepy and I think its board of directors probably didn't realize what Marty had in mind when they appointed him to run it and the subsequent change was dramatic and had very far-reaching effects so as we look at nber today that vision of bringing Scholars together in a wide variety of manners that Vision has proved tremendously important in the U.S but also in a somewhat modified form in Europe and I think that is a legacy that's very important I'm grateful to Marty on a personal level but I think the profession in Europe as much as in the United States has a lot to be grateful for from the innovations that he brought to our our activities I've had many friends many colleagues and many teachers none have had as large and influence through what they taught me and through their example as Marty feldstein I met Marty when I was 18. and even more disheveled than than today when I my father detected that I didn't have a plan for the summer and was interested in economics and asked Marty if he would give me a job for uh the summer which was very kind of Marty to do although I must say that I think my father may have slightly overestimated his kindness because my father didn't appreciate just how Diversified Marty's portfolio of research assistance was that summer what with there being 18 of them and so he was relatively hedged against what transpired which was my proving to be uh incompetent I remember sitting in his office and bringing some regression results and Marty's saying to me and this was the first thing he taught me before we look at the regression results why don't we just kind of look at the data and how it's aligned and he said Larry um How likely do you think it is that total spending on Social Security in Belgium is three times as light as large as total Social Security spending in the United States and I said well you know they have very generous social insurance in Belgium and he just looked at me but he persevered with letting me work for him or at least be in his presence and I learned a lot lesson one persist you know they say that Deeds matter More Than Words I remember sitting in a place that most of the people in this room never know existed 1737 Cambridge Street on the sixth floor I shared an office with Alan Auerbach and David Elwood and Dan fresh and the office had one of those old computer terminals with A continuous flow of paper and the paper stopped flowing didn't continue to feed through right and that meant that Marty's regressions on the four projects we were working on were in danger of making no progress between 1 30 and 5 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon we reported this to Marty I think we had mixed feelings it was a nice day out um and Marty came up and Marty's known for many things but nobody has referred to his great mechanical uh prowess and he looked at the thing and he found a rubber band and he clutched the rubber band around various parts of the computer terminal and all of a sudden the paper fed Marty smiled and said I guess you guys can continue on the projects and there was nothing that Marty Knew by virtue of being a full professor at Harvard rather than a graduate student that enabled him to figure out how to make that computer terminal work except he really cared about what he was doing and that caused him to not recognize obstacles as real second thing I learned from Marty I remember it because at the time it it made a real impression on me I learned that matters much more what you're for than what you're against a few years into the bureau we were having a conversation Marty and I were having a conversation about one thing or another and at that time the nber had a working paper series and a technical working paper series and there was some paper that somebody or other had written I don't suppose this was literally its title but it conveys the flavor maximum likelihood estimation on a Taurus and I asked Marty I said Marty how come this is a regular working paper not a technical working paper if there's ever a point in having a technical working paper I would have thought it was maximum likelihood estimation on a Taurus a Marty said you're obviously right but if I said it had to be on a Taurus the guy would be unhappy his friends would be unhappy the paper would get disseminated a little less and people would be mad and why I'd rather spend my energy starting things than stopping things encouraging things then discouraging things it's a good lesson I haven't always remembered it it's peace you guys weren't supposed to laugh that much you really weren't third lesson I learned sort of watching Marty but it was also things that he said was it's probably best to have a great and new question and a great and entirely compelling answer to that question but the opportunity to have that is certainly not going to present itself 16 times a year and Marty was going to write 16 papers a year so what I learned was if you had to compromise it was better to have a great question that people hadn't thought about before then to have a somewhat improved answer to a question that 20 people had already worked on trying to answer fourth thing I learned was new data newly constructed and created variables and competence beat old data being processed for the thousandth time with brilliance Marty understood the importance of informal interaction he understood it as a way of driving progress and he understood it as a way of drawing people in and that's why he has forged what is actually economics's most powerful research instrument not a supercomputer not an econometric technique but the network that is the institution that we are part of today it's a remarkable Legacy to the world and it's a remarkable Legacy for the people like me whose lives he transformed thank you Marty I got to know Marty and many different roles he was my undergraduate teacher indeed I took my very first class economics 10 from Marty on the first day he taught economics 10. I was also I also attended the last economics 10 lecturer given by Marty I think I may be the only one who bridged Bridge the two um I knew him as the leader of the NBR when I was a research assistant here as an undergraduate and also as a graduate student he was my colleague at Harvard for 13 years where we co-taught both undergraduate and graduate public economics he was my co-advisor on many dissertations and he was my highly esteemed boss once I became a program director at the nber Dy was an economist of breathtaking insight and extraordinary breath I cannot tell you how much I love teaching his papers today when I teach public economics it's just my favorite thing to do he had the ability to break through any issue and see its first order truths he usually would write the seminal paper on a topic and then he might actually let the topic go so that other people could write the downstream papers he was an incredibly dedicated teacher and anyone who co-taught with him would know how true that was he just always had time for students he always took students seriously and he really wanted students to understand he was a colleague and a mentor Beyond Compare he was a person of the greatest Integrity I would say he was the person of the greatest Integrity whom I knew cared very deeply about nurturing Each Coming generation of economists in his way of doing this was making the nber sort of incubator for young economists a place where undergraduates graduate students post-docs and especially Junior faculty could see the latest research present their work in progress often at an early stage interact informally with other economists and brainstorm over coffee or during the breaks in the conferences he very deliberately created a culture in which young people who were eager to do good work would feel welcome and would feel that they were taken seriously that Marty had an absolutely incredible ability to focus on any promising student giving us the same attention he would give a peer of his own seniority I mean if you ran into him in the kitchen and pitched an idea to him he would sit down with you and take it seriously even if you were just a student remarkably Marty always made us feel that we were part of the NBR and that we could ask for anything in the furtherance of economic research advice data statistical software space for computing anything he made the NBR home from home for generations of young economists many of whom came up with at least one of their most important paper ideas while sitting around the kitchen table and chatting by the by Marty was the genius behind the idea that providing breakfast specifically Donuts was the way to get sleepy graduate students out of bed and at their desks early in the morning there's now some protein on the menu most economists here were first exposed to the NBR at a conference where we as young people could get swept up in the latest research debates see top economists questioning one another sometimes fiercely and find ourselves participating in heady conversations with senior people who never seem to question why we were there or whether we were sufficiently serious and probably everyone here has had multiple aha moments at an nber conference some such moments are transformative several of my program members this week have told me that if it were not for the sense of community the ability to start collaborations and the feedback that they enjoyed at NBR conferences they would never have become economists it was under Marty that the NBR started the economics of education program and I was fortunate enough to work with him on starting it he loved economics so much that he wanted to create any program that he thought would expand the degree to which economic analysis could solve problems I'm sure that my experience was not unique to my program it started with his vision that he could see that education the field of Education really required serious and concentrated analysis and that education was ripe for research that would not occur so long as it was a mere subfield of some of the other fields of Economics especially labor economics and public economics I agreed with him on this uh strongly he worked with me to recruit Scholars he demonstrated to me how to engage funders he helped me to convene our first conferences and he himself took part in those conferences uh in part I think to ensure the participation of other top Scholars and then he launched us on our way the program is now thriving uh so much and is so large that it's really kind of hard to believe that it started with such a small germ and The Germ was important conversations that Marty and I had about how the analysis of Education could be changed by bringing in more economic theory by understanding that schools and universities are really organizations that we ought to understand more in the same way we understand firms that there ought to be more Public Finance in school finance and so on many I had many very exciting and important conversations with Marty but more importantly I believe that all of the programs Thrive and grew under Marty precisely because of the nbr's culture of nurturing younger Scholars I trace to Marty my strong belief that the most important role of each program is to ensure that younger Scholars have opportunities to present their research get feedback and perhaps most importantly interact with other Scholars many fairly senior Scholars including myself would say that they most look forward to giving a paper at the NBR it's better than giving a paper anyplace else why because it is the venue in which you're going to get the feedback that will allow you to make the most important changes to your research but Marty's Legacy I hope is that the same that I just said of myself can be said uh twice or three times as strongly and fervently by younger Scholars through his mentoring and the environment he created he has many offspring in this room his children in economics as it were and his grandchildren and his great nieces and his great nephews and the great greats this is indeed his NBR family I will miss him a great deal I emailed several professors in my first week as a freshman at Harvard uh in 1997 to inquire about research assistant positions and Marty was one of a handful of professors who replied with many of the other professors I only got to meet their graduate students but to my amazement I was sitting in Marty's nber office within a few days of sending that email talking about research uh the conversation seemed to go well and at the end I recall Marty asking me uh whether I'd be interested in helping him with some of his projects in public finance and I remember replying saying you know that sounds really interesting that sounds great but what exactly is Public Finance uh that was the first of many questions he kindly answered uh over the years and what struck me then was something I truly appreciated about Marty over time he could go from talking with the president of the United States to a first-year student at the college and educate them both while making them feel valued and respected I worked with Marty as a research assistant at the nber for about three months at which point I then vividly recall a meeting in which Marty said you have a lot of ideas of your own I think you should pursue them and we should continue our conversations rather than working on my specific projects I came out of that meeting thinking that either that might be a polite way to say that my ra work wasn't quite up to par or maybe it was a good sign of Marty's confidence in me I ended up sitting at the NBR talking with Marty regularly for the next couple of years a period that really cemented my interest in research in in economics I went on to graduate school at Harvard where Marty was my advisor and continued to work at the NBR while I didn't fully recognize it at the time the environment Marty created at the NVR for empirical economics had an incredible influence that extended well beyond direct conversations with Marty himself I sat on the fourth floor next to Matt genskow Jesse Shapiro and a number of others who would go on to become some of the leading economists of this generation at the time I was more interested in pursuing economic theory but gradually became more interested in empirical work in particular by talking with Jesse Shapiro and seeing his work with that Glazer develop uh over those years in this context I began to appreciate how Marty's influence extended well beyond his direct work to the institutions he built that would have lasting impact like most others in public economics when I was a grad student I read and sought to emulate Marty's papers one paper that I think captures Marty's style particularly well is his 1999 paper on the taxable income elasticity as a measure of the deadweight loss of the income tax system which everybody here in the public economics group will know very well that paper's approach now underpins much of the field of tax policy by proposing a very General yet eminently practical method to study how taxes affect the economy it's General in the sense that it's predicated on very few untestable assumptions unlike many economic methods it's practical because it can actually be implemented with the data that we have that is information directly from tax returns Marty's Insight in that paper later became known as the sufficient statistic approach to Optimal policy and is a method that's now widely used in many fields of Economics but beyond its scientific impact and the reason I'm mentioning it here is that I think it it captures a style of work that's had a deep influence on me and on many others trying to do rigorous work on important policy questions that's transparent and grounded in data as much as possible which I really think is the Hallmark of improving economic and social welfare through economic science which you know I see as the central mission of the nber as Marty laid it out and as we're all trying to carry it out today going Beyond graduate school as I became a professor at Berkeley and later returned to Harvard I continued to learn from Marty both at the NBR and elsewhere the NBR public economics Network really became my central Professional Network with numerous collaborators and Friends in fact my entire schedule and our research team's entire schedule became organized and is still completely organized around the NBR calendar with presentations at the summer Institute as the goal to which we're working at other points of the year so our students know this very well because I think they're all looking forward to some additional sleep at the end of this week after they've been pushing really hard for for presentations we gave this week here so today I continue to Aspire to follow Marty's example in organizing my own work from trying to do empirically grounded science that speaks to policy questions to creating institutions that provide public goods like the NBR to introducing more students to the beauty of economics and social science and introductory courses at Harvard and most importantly to try to do all of these things in a way that respects and includes everyone no matter their background no matter their status a few weeks ago I was in my office at Harvard and a freshman came into my office and said that he had read that I began in economics by working with Marty feldstein as a research assistant as a freshman myself he asked if I'd take him under my wing in the same way which I gladly agreed to do I often think back to that first email response I got from Marty in 1997 as the pivotal moment that shaped my career and my life I'm sad that I won't see Marty in the halls of La Tower and the nber but I'm comforted knowing that his spirit and influence will carry on in all of us for the generations to come thanks so much [Applause]
