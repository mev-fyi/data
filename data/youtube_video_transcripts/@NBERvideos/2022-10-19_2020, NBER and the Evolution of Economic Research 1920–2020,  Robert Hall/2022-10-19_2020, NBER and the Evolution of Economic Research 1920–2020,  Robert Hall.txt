okay well it's a great pleasure to be a part of this session um let me emphasize more than I ever have before that I'm going to be speaking uh this afternoon as an individual and not in my function as a chair of this committee because my first comment is that I've never been comfortable with the name of the committee I don't recall that I came up with it but I've taken a lot of ribbing that I don't deserve for the name and in my CV the committee is called the National Bureau business cycle chronology committee uh dating is you know it's become to have such a strong meaning and I guess I say that okay uh so um uh so let me let me start by saying that I I very strongly agree with the basic thrust of the romer's paper that uh we need to focus on uh measures of economic slack uh and rather than on output I think they uh we what we've come to understand uh is that movements of real GDP are pretty powerful from sources other than anything we'd call a business cycle there is essentially a productivity cycle in the in the U.S it's not it's not it's even more random than the business cycle we've had Decades of of high productivity growth in decades of low productivity growth and that has been confusing and since I don't think anyone believes that that should be considered part of the business cycle we need to we need to filter uh and I don't think that typical filtering methods uh just based on trying to filter out the lower frequencies are really up to that job uh and and I've I've argued this uh outside the committee um well by the way I did mention want to mention one thing codes of conduct have become a big deal on the National Bureau recently adopted one but the business cycle dating committee was by far the first organization within the National Bureau that had to have a code of conduct I won't go into why or who but it's been an interesting job being chairing the committee um uh okay so so then I want to turn let me sure I'm um so let me turn just briefly to uh the topic of um what's what you get uh if you use an indicator that is rooted in the concept of slack as opposed to looking at output itself the measure I'm going to use which I think I've argued in print on this point I think the best measure is uh based on unemployment to make it positively associated with a cycle though let's call it employment the employment rate is just one minus the unemployment rate okay so uh with that definition then you can you can sort of keep the the signs uh uh right and um so the first thing I'm going to show you is actually a picture from a paper that I've been working on recently uh that shows that the business cycle is is quite uniform in particular it's very uniform with respect to recoveries my view of the business cycle today is that there's a lot of different reasons why the the why unemployment Rises the output Falls and the recession begins uh most recently it was clearly related to the financial crisis but if you go back say to the 8182 recession it wasn't so much a financial crisis uh it was a very strong reversal of monetary policy so I think the the the things that explain recessions are are heterogeneous what is remarkable is how homogeneous the recoveries are so the blue bars show the uh annual rates of recovery of this indicator the one minus the unemployment rate so it's just the number of points of of employment you know that fall each year during recoveries um and it it moves within quite a narrow band you have to normalize it by the length of the recovery notice that the current recovery even if it ended in January of 2020 is by far the biggest recovery During the period that I regard as where we have reliable data the the unemployment rate really didn't exist until in its current form until 1948 when the current population survey was launched um uh so so this the magnitude of recoveries has gotten bigger and by far the record setting is the current one but in terms of of uh of uh annual rates of of growth of or shrinkage of unemployment um it's toward the top you know people talk about this recovery as if it was slow but that's because they're mesmerized by the low rate of productivity growth in terms of reducing slack this has actually been one of the more vigorous recoveries and in terms of Total Recovery it's by far the biggest as you can see from the red line so so this results in a very different view of the business cycle from from what you read from many economists and totally in the financial press okay good um uh so so let's have a new nber chronology I I'm not I'm not even in my independent self uh necessarily arguing that this is going to take over but it seems to me that we ought to be looking at this and if you just literally uh find the high points and low points of unemployment um and in every low point it's a business cycle Peak and every High Point is a as a business cycle trough then you get a a chronology which overlaps almost perfectly with the existing chronology as shown here except that you notice so in the in the third column of each panel is the discrepancy in the number of months between the two chronologies a positive number means that the the peak occurs earlier in a negative number that the trough occurs later and you can see that recessions are are rather more lengthy in the new chronology unemployment reaches its peak well before the National Bureau Peak sometimes extremely as recently and the trough and this is well known the trough comes after where it's the recovery that that the committee has come up with is almost invariably uh before uh unemployment actually starts downward um so but it's strongly confirms that the thing that the the bureau has done historically over this period when we've had very good data uh is something that should be called a recession because there's a complete overlap between the events it's only a question of the timing of the beginning and the end okay so much for the committee uh the the papers here were were somewhat slanted I thought toward the early history of the of the bureau the bureau meant nothing to me until uh Martin feldstein took over uh and uh so uh look this is mainly a blurb for something that Jim peterba uh organized um in the memorial to Marty um and a few follow either of these sets of instructions the first is infallible the second depends on your relationship with Google everyone gets a different result of any given you know every every result of the search is is customized so for some of you this may work and some it may not work but one of the other um and then uh Jim uh gave a very nice talk for 13 minutes so if you go 13 minutes into it then you get about 10 minutes of me um talking at some length about uh how I subverted Marty's uh creation of the new National Bureau in a way that it took on held held up so he didn't resist it so it was it was welcome subversion as far as he was concerned but uh the the the we've already came in at a time on the the board wanted to Pivot and they wanted a president who who would make something so more more important to macroeconomics uh business cycle analysis and and human capital in the other areas but but a bigger deal so they hired Marty to do that and they gave him pretty pretty uh uh pretty powerful tools to to do that um and so Marty just rebuilt the bureau from ground up he had this concept so first of all it was his his basic thought was that the bureau should be a coordinating event oh then wait a minute that wasn't five minutes okay all right well we can use the Hamilton algorithm but everything I was about to say I said before at the tribute so I'll just stop now and and you can tune this in as a national hero video yeah thank you
