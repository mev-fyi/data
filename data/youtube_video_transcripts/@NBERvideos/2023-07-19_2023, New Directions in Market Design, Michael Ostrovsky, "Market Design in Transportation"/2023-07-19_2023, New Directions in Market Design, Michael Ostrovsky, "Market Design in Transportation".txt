uh let me get started uh thank you uh thank you everyone uh I'm gonna open this session uh on the market design and uh transportation and then David and Yan are gonna give us their perspective so my View kind of high level View and Beyond transportation is a good place to look for interesting novel Market design questions is when there is either a major technological change or major changes in the regulation because that's when markets change and that's when you have a chance to introduce new designs uh and in the case of Transportation of course there are quite a few uh changes you can technological changes we can think about I think the most important one that's driving most of the changes that we're seeing is this one okay it's not directly related to transportation is the cell phone that's now everyone uh has in their pocket and there are several reasons why this one technological change is so important for transportation the first one real uh real-time location tracking right so you have a phone we can know it every moment in time you know where you are uh you know where your work 10 minutes ago so we can do lots of things with that obviously critically important for transportation uh the second one uh is that it can serve serve as a control center in your pocket right so when you're calling an Uber uh or you're ordering something from doordash uh you know you can have a fairly sophisticated UI that takes you know seconds you know compared that to trying to pull a restaurant and play the order or communicate complex preference but even more than that uh you can use your phone to you know unlock uh you know uh lime bike right so or or pay for it right on the spot so it's it's really it's a really powerful for a control center that's you know available to everyone at every time and the last thing and a flip side of that uh it can also serve as automated dispatch right so whoever has a phone we can now instead of having humans you know those of you who are old enough to remember how taxes work you know they would constantly have this transmitter thing on their dashboard and like all this conversations all the time who's going to the airport that's that's gonna right so you have the dispatch in your pocket well problem your dashboard and again uh very quickly um you can react as a driver to uh to all kinds of requests right and the human may not even be participating in the dispatching process that can be automated so dramatically reduces the cost of that uh and unsurprisingly you know with these um with these abilities Transportation markets are just changing super just incredibly dramatic uh and the first Domino to fall the most obvious one uh is Texas services so here is a chart that's not going to surprise anyone uh this is the price of The Medallion of their Medallion gives it a right to drive a taxi cab in New York City and it was kind of stable for a while it's what 200 000 these are not inflation adjusted by the way these are just absolute dollars uh so it's even more dramatic than than that if you inflation adjust then there was a run-up right up to about 2014 and then you know Uber and Lyft enter the market and the thing is just in a complete free fall I mean now they're basically worthless right so this is just kind of a really dramatic uh evidence and unsurprisingly uh there are now hundreds maybe even more research papers on Uber and Lyft studying all kinds of uh Mark you know among other things all kinds of Market design issues what's the optimal way of matching drivers to passengers how to locate those drivers you know many people in this room have written uh those papers so I'm actually not going to talk about this because I want to talk about new directions market and this one I feel yeah still very active but I'm not going to tell you much new by talking about this one uh but it's you know it's an indicator of things to come in other parts of the industry now before I get to specific examples I want to make a couple of more General comments so first of all in transportation what's interesting uh about Market designer so it happens on several levels right so if you think about kind of kidney exchange right so you can you just design the market that's your Market that's it right you're kind of your policy maker and you run the market and kind of you can control the you know that picture now in transportation Regulators are involved I think more in kind of meta-market design right so they set up all kinds of parameters all kinds of rules uh constraints right so if you can for now let's stick with Uber and Lyft you can have all kind of Labor discussions uh you can have you know cap a number of cars but those Services can have so you kind of set the parameters but then beyond that that's where kind of more traditional Market design comes in the kind that we're thinking about kind of matching markets you know setting figuring out who is going to drive home uh when so kind of firms serve and there's a second level of market doing so Market doesn't happen on two levels that's already interesting right I think if you think about Market design in this space there are papers to be written both about this kind of the first bullet point and the second bullet point that they're obviously complementary but even more than that in many of these markets and I'll show some examples uh you have multiple Market designers competing you have multiple firms uh Within These constraints who are all competing with each other so that's yet another set of uh issues to think about you know what happens when you have uh several marketplaces competing with this and you know quite often they they coexist it's not like they all sometimes they do all collapse in just one monopolist but quite quite often they managed to slice the market in a way that several ones coexist and that you know raises a whole bunch of other exciting questions and again not surprisingly in light of all of this there are now hundreds of fascinating papers on Uber and Lyft and that industry now what are the key challenges what makes Market design in this space interesting or complicated which is sort of the same thing uh you know why can't you just do you know Supply demand you know with salt uh you know when Mar was showing the picture of supply and demand intersecting for electricity why can't we do it here well there are several reasons one is there's extreme heterogeneity right because like every trip is special right so everyone was going from a different place to a different place so right off the bat you can you know you can't just do Supply demand uh but that's actually not enough because and you know thanks to the work you know from the 1960s and 70s by chaplain Subic and by Kelson Crawford and more later work ahead one Milburn we actually know that you know with preference or substitutable even with a lot of heterogeneity you can still have similar things and still get the market clearing and all kinds of nice results was similar uh comparative Statics and that's not gonna work here because you know the key assumption for those models to work is everything a substitutable all the preferences you know all these things are substitutes and here I'm gonna mention a few of those you know non-convex it is just like in the electricity market and various complementaries are also very important just to name one and you'll see them showing up in many other places and during my talk you know when an Uber driver drops you off in the middle of nowhere they they are not happy right why because they really want to be able to get someone uh than the next passenger as fast as possible so right on the right right off the bed are complementary uh between different rights okay and that's just a small example of it and the last thing that makes this all complicated and fascinating and interesting and gives lots of work to people in this room is Dynamics and uncertainty right it's not like you have you know once a year you clear an rmp where you have everyone on one side everyone on the other and you know and then you go home for a year you know this is happening continuously and things are changing uh both and from both sides of the market uh and so was that kind of bird's eye view uh I want to talk about just five uh specific examples uh of Transport you know of what I think are interesting Transportation works and I I do want to emphasize this is just a small subset when I sat down to just start thinking about what I want to talk about you know I excluded air travel I excluded rail I excluded you know ocean shipping I'm not going to talk about electric cars where there are tons of interesting issues related to where you put kind of charging stations and I'm not going to talk about uh turo which is kind of car sharing Airbnb for cars so even with yeah kind of narrow it down to those five which I think each of those is uh fascinating on on its own but just to give you any heads up there are others if you don't like these five but want to work on Transportation there are more fascinating topics uh to think about all right so let me go uh through them in this order uh just uh gonna give a bit of a preview the first three are not things I'm working on so I'm an outsider so you know this is for you know others to to work on uh the last two I am working on so I'm gonna say something you know more specifically about what I'm doing but again there's tons of work for everyone so let me start with those three and the first one I want to start with is tracking uh which is a huge huge industry right it it says dwarfs uh right right hailing industry right so they they carry this was the latest number I found was about 875 billion dollars in Revenue just in the United States right and worldwide obviously multiply it by a lot uh it's about seven to two percent of you of all U.S Freight uh by weight uh or by value is actually similar uh and some massive uh and it is really decentralized this is sort of as decentralized uh as a yes so there are about 3.5 million truck drivers so people could drive trucks and they're at 1.1 million carriers carriers are firms that provide services so a lot of this further just a single driver and you know IO economists here will be delighted that this is this is this industry is as fragmented as a gift like you worry about what happens when we go from four cell phone providers to three here you don't have to worry about this top 50 50 carriers carry only 10 of the overall volume right so this is just like I don't know in Industry that's as decentralized as this one which is going to create problems right as you'll see in a moment now at the first glance right I look at this and this seems like a perfect example perfect instance of the Chevrolet Crawford you know Hadfield Milgram two-sided matching markets with transfers and contracts right so we have on one side we have shippers uh super the term the lingo here shippers are those who need something shipped okay so they're not people who ship stuff those are carriers and then people put their clients uh and then on the other side you have carriers carriers are those who actually drive things uh and then there are you know loads and these are bilateral contracts between shippers and carers to deliver one uh one load to uh somewhere else all right all right make sure that I get those 15 seconds back thanks all right um Okay so um yeah so what are the challenges why is it not that straightforward and there are tons of challenges uh and by the way my suspicion for why you know there are so many grad students working on this uh I was working on Uber and Lyft but not on this is because you know everyone has experience with Uber and lose very few people go to grad school after being truck drivers uh but in terms of importance it's just as important uh I'm actually gonna going to mention there was a job marketers paper out that will make you this year on the tracking industry I'll mention that um uh but yeah there's way more room it was not Market design it was more sort of uh traditional I always all right so what are the challenges why is you know why is there tons of work why am I encouraging everyone here to take a look at this industry well so the immediate challenge is search cost but you have this hugely decentralized industry yeah and traditionally one part of the industry that I didn't mention were Brokers so the job of a broker well and still is there's still lots of Brokers was to kind of be on the phone 24 7 and get calls from driver who say okay I'm here you know in Atlanta you know I need to go home to Chicago for the weekend you know can you find me a load in the same way carriers and these Brokers would facilitate all this transactions it was a huge industry and it's obviously uh their labor intensive and you know very opaque uh and as a result of this uh a major problem uh in this industry is called debt heading which is just when you drive empty right and I'm not going to go by the way I'm not going to talk about all the potential issues with like there is environmental wonders uh uh kind of waste of fuel like I take those as self-evident so it's not just the stuff that I don't care about the environment it's just these problems are so obvious that they're not worth spending a lot of time talking about so clearly this is a huge issue and part of the gain here in terms of Designing a better Market is reducing this right and there's also an inefficiency in these truck drivers just sitting and waiting right that's that's on top of this this is going to actually actively driving empty uh now there's a lot of uncertainty here right there's a story both on the macro level when you make long-term forecasts if you want to make a long term if you look at the past three years you look at volumes of shipments you look at the prices I mean it's as volatile as it gets but also on a short level right there can be a snowstorms somewhere there can be uh you know some change in plans so that's uh uh that that's a big issue and even once you sign a contract like once you once you agreed on something that the game is not over because shipments often get canceled or rescheduled uh for both sides uh reasons all right so do both due to Keras and due to shippers um and preference are complex and change all the time eliciting full profile isn't practical and the last thing and this is this paper that I mentioned by uh Harrison when uh from out of MIT and there's also an earlier paper by Tom Hubbard from about 20 years ago uh traditionally in this industry and even though you can think of the zero transactional uh long-term relationship played a huge role okay so how do they but obviously you need spot markets as well so how to coordinate them how to make them coexist is highly non-trivial Okay so uh I'm going to skip this too I'll just show you some screenshots of what's happening right now well you know I kind of said I like the things that were things are changing really rapidly so these are just four out of many more to go on you know app store or Play Store apps for drivers right these are the apps this is Convoy Uber Freight uh these are kind of the high-tech Silicon Valley companies in the space and another two are JB Hunt and rxo which are these traditional uh broker shipping companies we're also entering this from the you know their user base and they're all trying to develop apps uh to match uh shippers and carers and even within one relationship within one sort of uh load this is actually a pretty complicated game if you pay attention to this has placed a bit some of them are posted prices some of them are run by a procurement auction and here's the last thing I'm going to move on to the next application uh if you're trying to create if you're a driver and you're trying to create you know to to get kind of network efficiencies where you say I want to link several trips well those trips can come from multiple different apps so you need to be on all of them if you really want to uh be able to do that so it's it it's still even though these apps are helpful there are still a major Hassle and so this is very much in transition and clearly there's tons of potential for interesting Market design questions and on all possible levels nope I'm so short on time there all right okay so the next one uh the next one that I want to talk about and this one I'm going to talk very briefly because David is going to have a whole uh lecture on this micro Mobility so these are pictures I took this morning outside of the hotel I was curious how many different ones I would get so there are a bunch of different ones there are scooters there are electric bicycles it's very exciting because compared to cars they use a lot less uh resources right it's just a super efficient with Transportation so it's a very positive development well except unless you're in France so from last month April 3rd uh voters in Paris overwhelmingly why you know so there were some some claims that you know there was non-selected people who showed up to vote but still eight to nine percent of uh parisians voted to bet just ban like not restricted ban e-scooters okay clearly something failed in how this was designed so there's clearly questions how should we design it so that people you know don't hate them and don't try to ban them all right third uh area that I think is potential is super interesting and the people in this room should be looking at uh that poses a bunch of noble Market design questions is consumer delivery services so I think doordash instacart uh those types of services uh so what makes it interesting in addition to the things that I mentioned well it's a three-sided market right so Market designers are very good at one-sided markets which is our auction on two-sided markets which is matching this is a three-sided market right they have customers you have restaurants or stores something delivered and you have the delivery person and you need to figure out how to jointly equilibrate those three markets right and I you know I think if you look at how these platforms do pricing right now it's a very rudimentor I think there's lots of room for improvement just to give you like just oppose a very basic question suppose you know we're right now it's peak time and delivering people are very expensive there is a shortage of delivery people you have to do search pricing for them well so that means it's a higher price how should you pass it through should you pass it through to the customer to the restaurant should you try to eat this cost but then what if your competitors don't lots of questions of that sort uh and on top of this um the role of the platform itself is also very complex it's not just kind of a neutral kind of bystander who's trying to match all of these so I'll just show you once uh one screenshot that I'm very happy about and I think there is a paper to be written at least one right here from the screenshot so let me tell you what it is uh this uh instacart I went on instacart and just searched for something fairly generic San Pellegrino okay I got about two thousand results they're all there is similar they all look like this so the first thing you notice it's kind of obvious you have these three stores who offer essentially identical Goods so that's that's one that's not surprising here's to an economist a more interesting observation instacart doesn't show prices right so what they what they're doing is they they're softening the competition among the uh those stores so clearly there is negative consumer circles they're artificial it would be trivial for them to display those prices uh but you know that of course other parts of their ecosystem so their artificial inflating consumer search costs you know I don't know uh how like what's the actual amount by how much is third if you actually click through it prices vary quite a bit so there's probably a non-trivial amount of consumer surplus uh that's being destroyed by doing something like that all right so but you know maybe they're justified in doing things like that because it's a it's also a very challenging Market uh and the main challenge there is that the delivery is very labor intensive right so if I if I want to you know a couple of cases of San Pellegrino ship to me well the cost of deliver is like way higher than the value of those goods so someone needs to pay for that and kind of the name of and to make it sort of economically viable the name of the game here is to try to bundle this Deliverance and again either deliver to multiple customers on one trip or deliver goods from multiple stores to One customer they start doing that you know when you buy some a restaurant or sometimes they say oh wouldn't you like to also get something from Safeway and this is very much active this is sort of happening and as we speak and sort of trying to figure out how to do and again some groups can wait right if I'm ordering paper towels you know they can deliver them to me anytime if I'm ordering something perishable a little different thing a restaurant I want my free class so and trying to elicit all of the preference is also impossible so there is this constant game of how to improve these markets very much in flight I have eight and a half minutes left so let me talk about the stuff that I'm working on I'm very excited about and uh those things are congestion pricing and carpooling so ingestion pricing I have good news and bad news so good news I'm gonna skip this area this is bad news but this is the you knew that so that's not news so good news is that New York City uh is very much on track to implementing congestion prices so just last week they cleared the major hurdle the federal Administration said you know no objections environmental review passed you know go ahead okay and how are they going to do this what's the plan let me give you a very brief overview of their plan so they're going to implement Cordon pricing so they're going to take this congestion Zone everything south of the 60th Street uh in Manhattan uh and you're gonna pay a certain amount of money to enter this congestion though right so those classic Cordon pricing right okay once uh just for entering and then they kind of just they're deciding on the level again the main debates right now are what should be the level of congestion fee and who should be exemptive you know obviously every single constituency you know teachers and firefighters and medical workers they all argue that they are very important they should be Exempted not surprising that you know you will see that that's what you mean so that's uh good news and the basic intuition there that the policy makers have is you know cars bad want fewer cars less set a high top right not crazy but as I'll argue in a moment kind of then the modern world is not sufficient so here's the bad news so London did this a few years ago okay and it basically didn't work right so it works and sort of generate a bunch of money uh but it's you know this is from BBC from 2020 just a few months ago remains one of the most Injustice theaters in the world okay so so what's going on uh and you know our view and I'm working with Frank who's somewhere here on the paper on this uh this is and then we're also working with Michael Schwartz I'll mention that later uh our view the the price uh when Singapore introduced it because that was kind of technological the only thing you could do essentially but in 2023 this is just not the right framework because different cars different vehicle cause dramatically different amounts of congestion per instance of processing a quarter okay also matters uh when you travel and pricing should reflect that right so I think the problem with London is a lot of these cars they draw us into the congestion pricing Zone and keep driving creating congestion so well so you say okay now we know what we know what to do yeah one doesn't work let's do intermediate Minecraft taxation to figure out the optimal allocation of who should be where every moment of time and you just charge people the externality for every cubic inch of space for every second and you get to the first test okay that's very clever and obviously you're going in the right direction but you know good luck doing that right so this is the map of New York City with with congestion as of the time I took a screenshot so like should we have different prices like every single intersection uh every single you know uh Corner uh and also sugar communicate all of these prices to you know people who just want to go to work from New Jersey like do they wake up every morning and like look at every single thing on their on their path so maybe maybe Yes actually I'm not sure maybe uh but with Frank we're working on what we call paper some and our observation idea is the following uh so commuters uh they also go to work generate fairly similar amounts of congestion per entering and exiting recording zone right to cross at 7pa or 7 A.M you go your Park you know obviously some of you have to go through the home and having others uh park close to where you cross but sort of comparable and now you have three vehicles we have FedEx UPS rash direct Uber all of those which generates an insane amount of congestion per unit of crossing that's just their job to like keep driving around uh and so the proposal is for commuters yeah it's okay to Department pricing for commuters you should you know you charge them for entering also you should charge for exiting because then if you don't then you're not regulating evening traffic correctly but basically we can sort of abstract away from where exactly in Manhattan they're traveling uh and sale will live with this approximation because it simplifies their lives dramatically uh and then for the police which is about half of New York traffic if you just stand on a random corner but half of the traffic are these weaves uh you're gonna charge more granular fees that are you know obvious than not to the extreme that uh uh I showed on on the map but somewhere uh in that direction right and uh you know and then economists at Uber and Lyft will figure out how to ingest those prices and then optimize based on them right that's so that's the idea all right so the last thing I want to talk about in the last three minutes is carpooling uh and they're either carpooling other technology itself is very old to people in the car where there is a huge change uh potential change is making it much easier to find Convenient carpooling Partners right empirically very few people carpool even though when you're stuck in traffic you can sit there and think wouldn't it be wonderful you know they're all these cars was three or four or five empty seats if all the people carp a little different Improvement everyone will be better off you know but we don't do it and one of the reasons but probably not not the only one uh is that it's just really inconvenient to find those carpooling partners and there's a lot of effort lots of apps uh trying to move in this direction so the first one here is waste carpool if you're interested to talk to Michael Schwartz who will tell you a lot more about the uh the story of that and but there are others uh who try to do that uh and here is when I say carpooling I don't necessarily mean that there is literally no paid driver it's kind of any service that's like stops short of like real public transportation with 50 people in a bus can have a driver but you know they're carrying not one person but you know two or three or four or five right so kind of band pools would count basically the whole name of the game here is to increase the throughput of the road while maintaining the actual Road surface right putting more commuters uh in the car so this is lift uh which was offering shared rights uh they relaunched it after covet about a year ago and this is via uh that had this identity of band pools in New York City and DC okay well but more bad news and this is you know I had a different quote but I couldn't resist the temptation to put the quote that's less than 24 hours old so that happened literally yet at 2 pm from Bloomberg Lyft is official discontinued sharing rights uh and the same happened with via they also discontinued this and Waze is no longer doing that so clearly by itself you know carpooling is not quite working so why am I why am I still super optimistic about this and the reason for this uh is that congestion pricing and carpooling are highly complementary so carpooling doesn't work now congestion pricing could work right obviously if you set the price as 500 uh that will scare a lot of people away and you know we'll hear about the Singapore experience where it does work uh but people most directly affected are not better off so drivers who get hit by uh those congestion fees you know they used to spend waste time and traffic now they have to spend dollars but the actual amounts if you quantify them and you know there's a beautiful paper by Victor doing that are the same so they're not better off and in fact uh what I didn't show you yeah I'll take one more minute um what I did what I didn't show you is there is now huge opposition coming from New Jersey right so the governor of New Jersey the senators from New Jersey are trying to kill this congestion pricing plan from New York because they're like look this is just a tax on you know citizens of New Jersey like this is like you just want just a money grab okay so now what I want you to kind of visualize and this is what makes me hopeful is the following in the world where you have um actual flexible congestion pricing intelligent congestion pricing and convenient carpooling right you could have moderate talls at peak times where the goal is not to scare people away but to force them to carpool right uh and with that and that's another paper I'm working on which I'm advertising the loss of hopeful they will also be on my website um you can make people's lives better off even if the government just destroyed the revenue so unlike the in the single driver world uh and and the intuition is very simple basically you know but you're going to work much faster okay and last slide and and I'm done uh what makes me hopeful that this is not just you know a pipe dream that we actually have some data points that suggest that that might happen I'll show you too so the first data point actually comes from Singapore uh there is a really neat paper by two World Bank economists Poland and Watson from 1977 who looked at the what happened after the introduction of the very first Singapore uh congestion pricing scheme uh which was you know by that by by the standard that I'm revolutionary and now it looks pretty simple you know there is an entire interval when you have to pay and so what they find is that the number of carpools increase just dramatically and guess what here to to uh to qualify as a carpool you had to have four people in the car right so it was a pretty high bar and sort of the number of carpools just skyrocketed now the second data point is going to be from California and of course it's surprising we don't have intelligent congestion pricing in California but there is something very similar that's going to serve as a proximate I think we can learn lessons from and that's park there is a really neat paper by Wilson and shoot uh from 1990 where they looked at what happened when an employer stopped subsidizing parking and so the cost of parking for employees went from zero to thirty dollars a month uh which in current dollars at about 75 a month so as you know it's not insane but it's also not negligible it's about a thousand dollars a year uh and they actually have several of those but I picked this one because you know it's Suburban La so there's just no public transportation zero percent of people use their public transportation here that's not feasible and so what you see almost all employees switched from driving solo to carpooling okay so this size of monetary incentives can clearly induce that behavior and that sort of serves as talls all right uh sorry I was running over time and thank you
