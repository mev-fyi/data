and it is november 19th i'm at the national bureau of economic research in new york city with anna jacobson schwartz and uh anna's going to tell us first about who she is and then a bit about a lot about i hope about uh her involvement with the national bureau of economic research yeah so as lord claudia has just stated my name is anna jacobson schwartz and i am a long time employee of the national bureau of economic research in new york so i have a very varied experience with this organization from the time that i first started working here until this very day when i sit here not so much as an employee but somebody following my own interests in research and supported by the national bureau in what i want to do and for me this is the most central part of my intellectual life so i'm very grateful to this organization right and um let's go let's start with with barnard and and that serendipitous event that uh that took you from walton high school to barnard rather than hunter college where my mother went to uh to college and i was thinking when you said and it changed my life that my mother was a stat econ she was a math major i think she was math staff but she did economics uh although um she denies that she remembers anything of this but i i don't i think she's wrong um so uh you went to barnard and um you you did uh economics and and what i was saying before they wanted to study economics from the time i was in high school yes there was a course in economics taught by a man at walton high school and even though this was in 1931 at the very depth of the what i later referred to as the great contraction it wasn't so much the experience of a depression that made me want to study economics it was the fact that the questions that we talked about in this class seemed to me so vital that i couldn't imagine wanting to pursue further study in a subject that would not have included economics so i went to barnard with the full intention of majoring in economics and although i took a variety of courses while i was there in liberal arts um my mind was essentially set even before you had to declare your major that this is what i was going to do i don't think that the economics faculty at bonnet looking back after all these years was especially distinguished but they certainly were serious people there were two women and the third person who taught statistics also a woman and the one man arthur d gayer who was a an englishman who had come gotten a job at barnard and it was his influence in particular that determined what i did after i graduated he was able to interest the columbia research science council in funding a study of british business cycles from 1790 on he had written on that subject as a graduate student at oxford and had gotten his degree the study he had done was unpublished and because wesley mitchell supported his interest in doing this study that the council funded was this the ssrc or this was uh at columbia at the time this was i think it was the columbia i think uh organization of that point and then it becomes something else yeah right so um on graduation i started graduate school at columbia and when gayer got the funding for this study he hired me first as a part-time person and then when i completed all the coursework for graduate work he hired me as a full-time person and that was roughly from fall of 1936 until the completion of the work on the british business cycles so you graduated barnard in 1934 34 and so and then you spent some time doing the course work and passing the yes obligatory when i went by the time i went to washington in the fall of no in the spring of 1936 i had completed the coursework right and when i returned to new york and started on the british business cycle study the thought was that i would be able to find a subject for a dissertation right from my work on the british business cycle study so for the next four years that's what i was busy doing let me go back to dc for a second who who found you the job with um the group working on uh the consumer price that the consumer expenditure i went to washington uh the urging of clara elliot who was the person who taught statistics at barnard and was herself working on the consumer purchases study i don't really know the dates when she was in washington but she came back to new york very frequently she had a big family and i'm sure that the job in washington was an important supplement to the income of the route family she was married to a man who taught at teaches college at columbia as i say there were four children and i know that problems of income for this family existed she was interested in me and i was frequently invited to their home but and i maintained that connection with her even after i returned to new york and was working on the british business cycle study but that's just incidentally but you don't recall that the time in washington was a very exciting time it was just uh it was a very exciting time for me i had never traveled anywhere okay and i was sent into the field to various southern cities to make sure that the local agents were filling out these forms in accordance with the instructions right that the people at the department of agriculture who had designed the um long long ago when i went to the national archives and uh um no one had taken any interest in these schedules and now they have but at the time they didn't this was almost 20 years ago and i had a friend i met someone who was working in the national archives and i i asked for so many boxes that he took me by the hand and he did something that you cannot do now and you really weren't supposed to do then was this college park no no this was in in dc on archives the big major archives and he said you can be in the stacks for as long as you want and it was a child in a candy store and and i i just went all over the place and i found this huge number of boxes which was the 1934-36 consumer purchase survey and the related one from 1935 to 37 the department of agriculture became involved in all of the original materials yeah that is exciting it was it was a great find yeah i'm sure that others could have found it if they were looking for it and and now a uh sample has been collected of them but let's get back to uh so so i'm uh and i've i've looked at um the many many volumes um that came out of it and then were stopped uh because of the war and so in fact all the reports as you as you know the reports were never finished because the war intervened anyhow so travel to various cities in the south and meeting people from this regional area who spoke differently from me and i was very young at that at that point so giving instructions to people from senior to me struck me as a little unusual but i suppose that's part of the experience of growing up so you lived in little hotels and that's what towns no i've never been a hotel all of us travel on trains and governed with government vouchers and i mean this was a very new kind of world for me so yeah it wasn't just working in the washington office proper but being selected to go out to do this field work and then to come back and report whom i had met whom i had talked to what were the problems there what advice i had given was it the right advice so uh i know that the time that i was there passed very quickly for me and i never had a feeling why am i here i should be back in new york but right as i say the decision to go back in new york was a personal one and so then you return and then i returned and as i said 36. i was shortly after that hired to work on the british business cycle studying and that's what i did right now gayer of course was was um a full professor at barnard he was not a foreigner i mean these were slim very slim times for faculty people's salaries were abysmally low and um he was regarded at that time at bonner as someone who was a comer he was going to amount to something i don't think that his career subsequently um confirmed that belief in him the way he was a dile talent he was bright enough there was nothing wrong with this a perfect person to teach at garner yeah and in fact he did very little on the british business cycle study i don't know how he came to meet walt rusto but it was the uh addition of walt rostow to the staff that made all the difference in the world and the way this study was conducted and there were other people who were hired subsequently so one of them was isaiah then known as finkelstein who later changed his name to frank and harry eisenpress these were they were graduate students at columbia at the time and walt had finished his phd at yale but had no had no job so um the fact that we were doing this study of british business cycles with wesley mitchell's interest meant that the study would be directed in the directions that the national bureau of business cycle research had adopted so um the big uh the big subjects well well let's collect all the data that we can possibly find time series on all the questions that you would want to be able to answer about the british economy and then let's uh analyze these series according to the national bureau right now this the sources um and gayer obviously knew of many sources uh on the other side of the atlantic yes was the columbia university library it's a wonderful collection it's a um a depository right they had all the british parliamentary papers and we were able to approach the bank of england for data that didn't appear in parliamentary papers but that we knew they would have and one of the very sad things i have to report as a result of the numerous moves that the national bureau made during the cosmic time when i was told we cannot move all your file cabinets and choose what you want to save and send and the rest will be moved yeah and somehow these precious bank of england data that were copied for our use disappeared and i mean decades later people would write to me saying don't you have a data nope they've disappeared just as all the files of um the national bureau study monetary trends in uk and the us were thrown out when we moved here we were told can't be can't be saved well nobody really has asked me show me the the dentistry show me the yeah the printouts right back in your tables so in that sense it's not a loss i feel it as a lawyer no it shouldn't look at what happened when uh christie's um romer wanted to go back over the numbers for example that stan lieberg did long long ago on unemployment yes and stan said well you can you can have them for a while and he came out as as you know my hands are spreading wide apart because that's what the data sheets would would look like and he handed them over to her and and she she did much with them to his consternation of course but um now so gayer um uh was the titular head of this study he was the titular head now at the same time you're you're a graduate student at columbia and and was he then considered your major advisor on your dissertation no no i mean the theory was that burns would be a major advisor because it would be in a business cycle context that's right even though it would be british and they may have had their own rules about the fact that yes faculty still is a separate factor and there was the british business cycle study was completed in early 1941. we had been promised publication money for five volumes and this is what we had produced in the course of the years that we had worked on it and at that point the columbia council informed us no there was not money for five volumes there was money for two volumes so you you you actually had a manuscript five minutes five separate manuscripts and these these were chronological they were thematic um one volume had a historical narrative of the british economy according to cyclical dates from 1790 to 1815 then there was a volume on price data commodity price data that we had collected monthly i mean so much of our data was monthly because of the emphasis in the national bureau tradition that the technique was applied to monthly data right another volume was just stock market data again we had had people in london collecting um the monthly stock market figures for whatever was listed on the london stock exchange during that period we had a volume of of data and a volume of the business cycle analyses of individual series grouped in to five categories you know production construction that kind of stuff so it was a a stunning blow to us that instead of money for five volumes we were confronted with either you will have to throw out some of the material you intended to publish if you can reduce the size and got get them into two volumes fine but it's got to be only two volumes and for the rest you will make the decision what to do with the other material what we finally did was to like really thick balance yes and to use um microfilm of the original data series right i mean this is a hard luck story on so many in so many ways university of michigan had this microfilm project and they microfilmed all our data somehow they lost the microfilm people who then would have i mean in the vodka and the printed volume you're advised if you want the original data right to michigan the michigan microfilm source they can't explain it disappeared from there i have the original type scripts of the data so i'm able to pass on um certainly the the original commodity price series the stock market series were not microfilmed and they're lost i mean people who want to do something on british well they've been collected against yeah right it's just sad to see right now so much well that's valuable has been discarded right so some of this some of the uh series such as i know the stock market uh data has been recollected yeah the big big series on stock market data and i also have the original type scripts of the um introductory material explaining what the individual time series covered what the problems with these data were and stuff like that so anyhow this was 1941 in the middle of the war where the war had just started for us and the urgency of publishing a right it didn't seem top of the agenda and it was not until [Music] 1953 right when rostow went to england as the homsworth professor of american history that he was able to negotiate with the oxford university press that there was money that they wouldn't be losing anything by publishing the two volumes that had been sitting around you know for eight years right but uh so the volumes were finally published and didn't get the kind of attention or the kind of interest maybe i don't know why in 1953 this wouldn't have been considered a major effort that should be looked into it got a very tepid review by rco matthews who criticized it for our use of the national bureau technique this was not the way to understand how cyclical developments occurred at any rate there was just this feeling of let down and now so the the well that's my experience with the british business but from my personal point of view the [Music] debacle was even worse although we indicated in the published volume who was responsible for what and each of the two volumes right burns refused to accept a contribution to uh volumes with many authors as my work right and at that time already i had begun working with friedman and burns said forget about the british business cycle study it had to be a published dissertation to be acceptable at that time really yeah so the fact that it was published it was going to be published i mean which was a hurdle for many people right that's an enormous hurdle yeah that's interesting so what what year did burns say um terribly sorry but uh this is not the kind of dissertation that we accept so what what year did he say that well this might have been 1954 or something like that after the after the volumes were out right the problem was not that the volumes had been published right before there had been a dissertation committee to vet what i had done at any rate but it is uh you know these are so i mean when people look at my vita and see i didn't get a degree to 1965 they said what happened well this is what happened i mean if this if things had worked the way we had expected in 1941 when the thing was finished and they had been willing to accept my part of the the then five volumes well i would have gotten a degree much earlier but of course bob lipsy's degree uh has sort of a a long period uh in between his years as a graduate student and when he got his his his phd yeah because he began as a graduate student in the late 40s he got his phd i think also in in 65. that's right something like that so you have your degrees together but that must have been a a great disappointment a real disappointment since other people had phd had dissertations that were jointly authored yeah right and i mean yeah considering the amount of work that had gone into the phenomenal metaphor anyhow well can you say anything about now about burns because we're gonna be moving to the to your time at not at the bureau but well i'm sorry at the bureau because in 53 you begin to be physically at the bureau that's right once we moved to the madison revenue office right but um but he knew me he knew you you you met him probably in that i had met in his 40s but because of this british business cycle study we would go down to the bureau's offices at 1819 broadway to talk with the people in the british and the business cycle unit to see that we were following the rules and the idea was we had to do exactly what they did in analyzing the series and that our preparation of charts was just like theirs so in a sense we were an auxiliary to what was going on at the national bureau in terms of u.s data that we were trying to apply to our british data so he certainly knew me as somebody who was around the bureau for this purpose right and knew that i was working at columbia on these issues do you remember the first time you met burns and where was it i don't really remember the first time i met him could it have been at columbia it must have been at columbia yes because he he was the um he had been made he was there a parent yeah to wesley mitchell right and i hadn't taken any courses either with him or with um mitchell but they knew me and it was because of my connection with this british study mitchell once had the three of us gaia rostow and i were invited to mitchell's home i can't imagine where this must have been in late the late 1930s to meet with schumpeter for a discussion of what we were doing and what the national bureau was doing and what shipped was doing on that business cycle study oh yes and to me it was a revelation i mean schumpeter seemed to me so much more we'll just put it over here does to bring champagne closer yeah yeah champagne seemed to me a much more profound person than mitchell but mitchell's the only contribution as i could remember to the conversation was to repeat the national bureau definition of what a business cycle was and there was a breath to the comments that champagne made that were absent that was absent from what um mitchell was saying can you remember away from this [Music] the gist of what jim peter said yeah that it was a much more enlightening view of how an economy worked than what mitchell as i was saying mitchell seemed to be offering some mechanical views yes about business cycles whereas i thought what john peter was saying had some economic depth and there would be questions that you would be able to address to this kind of approach that you couldn't address to the mitchell approach but this is in some sense the a clash between the data the more mechanical way of doing things and the theoretical way and rather than a clash it could have been sort of a union yeah but it wasn't but it wasn't so my sense was that we really hadn't settled anything in this um exchange i mean it was very exciting to be invited to mitchell's home and where was it horatio street in greenwich village but um in the sense that it had some impact on what we were doing i don't think so um we were sort of tied to the mitchell view of what understanding the british uh cyclical behavior was so what in crosstalk my feeling about i mean he's a very pleasant person to be with and is admirable in many ways my only feeling about him after all these years is that he was saying 30 years after the british business cycle study was a and the same things that he was saying 30 years earlier i don't have a feeling that he grew and that his understanding of the world had deepened and in some way been enlarged he was essentially the post-doc person that he was when i first met him and not any different um he can be a lot of fun i mean just nothing wrong with him as a human being but he was an economist right as a historian i i thought he was lacking um i really haven't kept in touch with him all these years did you get a sense though that um he would burst on the scene with with um big ideas and um well then you would there would be some need for a large cleanup squad to figure out well which of these ideas are actually right and which of these ideas should be thrown out but he was he always the ideal person throwing ideas out all over the place well he had a few central ideas that economic development depended on export growth and this was the one message that he more or less applied in all the books that he ever wrote subsequently and take off i mean the the thing that he became known for in the 1950s didn't prove to be a seminal kind of idea that others picked up and developed and so um problem is of course that i got to know milton friedman and that surely changed my view of economics and what the real problems were right so in a sense maybe i wouldn't have this kind of view of rostow if i hadn't been so influenced i don't think so i think that uh that walt's brand of economics is not as satisfied it it just didn't satisfy you it just didn't make sense it's that's they're they're sort of big interesting notions but there's there's um no meat there's no uh sense that you can really get your hand around it yeah and get your mind around it yeah as i say um he hasn't played a role in what i think is my development well and um neither uh mine i mine either and uh um now said a bit about um about burns and and mitchell so so this was uh um was this the first time you had met mitchell at his home i mean i had met him right at columbia and um the bureau but it was the first time i'd been in his home okay yeah but you you um you knew burns vaguely in colombia but at columbia you didn't know mitchell any better than i didn't know no no because i wasn't a student of either one of either one of them right i mean i took monetary economics with angel yes and if i had any link with anybody in the graduate faculty it was with him and it was because i was doing some work with him at the time that he had a very brief connection with the national bureau that it was assumed when i was hired that i would be working with my angel but there was i don't really know why whether he was dissatisfied with the connection with burns or whether they weren't satisfied with him and then there was he left there was frank mills as well right i'm sorry mills mills you took statistics yes i had some connection with uh with mills but uh again not for very long and he he he wasn't mills was at the bureau yes his first name is frank do i have that right okay oh frederick okay but he's known as frank yeah i first had it right and then i got it wrong okay yeah um so uh so you you come to the bureau in 53 and before that i come to the bureau much earlier right but physically but i'm not physically physically here working right now so um so what what year do you date um this uh coming to the bureau but not being physically here so that's about 19 it was as soon as the british study was over 1941 right and then the i was hired with the intention that i would work with angel right on the cyclical behavior of money angel was really working on that at that time right so when when you say you sort of came to the bureau that meant that you were on the on the page that's right that's right the difference right but you were working out of a uh an office or a carol or something for the columbia library okay and i would go over to faye weather which was the economics building and see angel or whoever in the economics department that i wanted to talk to but essentially doing what i started to do then i mean that was the beginning really of trying to put together a money stock series and angel had had um he had a a woman named caroline whitley whitney who had gotten her phd at columbia was working with him who had done some work in this area for him she didn't live very long after that i don't know what happened to her but um i don't think she was in the picture any longer when he started asking me to work with him but um so it was through him actually that i came to the national bureau and once once angel was out of the picture for them they approached milton to ask him he had left the bureau after he had finished the the draft of professional practice and he wandered around until he was able to get a job wisconsin which didn't last right and then when he was finally at chicago he was asked to become a research associate and that's when i i had met him briefly in new york when he was working on the statistical project for the war effort at columbia um it was hard to find a stroller in new york during the war and i had had two children and a stroller that i didn't want didn't need at that point and they came one evening and i handed them the stroller but i sure didn't know him you know to talk to him so essentially i got to know him once he became affiliated with the money money business cycle study for the national bureau and then of course my contact with him was largely largely through mail because he was in new york so rarely and then we would sort of plot out what would we be doing the next few months or something like that rather than have you know daily contact was unusual to use the telephone in those days had to be something very special to use a phone so it was largely by mail and when when we finally got around to beginning to write the manuscript again went back and forth through the mail so what year do we date milton comes to new york city in 43 42 i don't know that that's the right year it's got to be something around something sometime in the late 40s i would say because at the beginning as i say it was with angel with danger and it was only after for whatever reason i don't know angel mitchell and burns parted ways that they looked for somebody who would be the senior person on their study of the money right so it's some science but of course had no real interest in the behavior of money until he started the project here now that's that told me that right they looked at something that milton had written about inflation i think with ruth mack somebody else and money was not yeah important so anyhow um and that began this very uh i would say for me intense connection with him that's lasted for so many so many years so uh i have this feeling that my understanding of economics really began from the time i started working with him whatever i knew about economics before that was not very important i really understood economics in a new way when i began talking with him and began discussing what are we going to do on this this study and the fact that the initial effort was concentrated on the monetary history which was again not something that we would have thought in advance was the way we would proceed i mean the idea was we would collect all these data and analyze them according to the national bureau technique and that was going to be the major contribution of this work and of course that first paper that we did that was published in the review of economics and statistics statistics as part of the first monetary conference that the bureau sponsored did make use of the the bureau analyses of the money series and the kind what year was that the the first paper that was i think that was 1962 that it was published probably the conference was a year earlier or something like that and again the astonishment of people who were at that conference i mean we were considered weirdos from thinking that money was such an important money mattered yeah but when when you first met milton and he comes on board this project that you've been working on for a while with angel yeah um do you know what motivated him to become part of this project what at the time very close friends with burns at that time yes didn't last i mean yeah but at that point i'm sure he looked to burns as uh significant for his his future yes and um to be invited to be part of a bureau project was certainly something that he would value but um but of course i mean you're on the payroll you're on the payroll that's a good thing milton couldn't have been earning that much money as a assistant professor at chicago to be you know oblivious to the opportunity but truly but by then milton is is at chicago he he has all of these colleagues at chicago who have thought for a long time that money mattered an enormous amount so when he when burns said well we have this project on um and i don't know what burns said it was he wouldn't have said it's a monetary history of the united states mean birds would have said we need you to analyze the cyclical behavior of money so it will be another um another chip in this big yeah we're going to have this enormous collection of how different sectors of the economy behave and then we will be able to say something in a generalized way about business cycles yes um the holy grail view of the economy that's right and as i say i think there were financial reasons for milton to be eager to participate but when when milton came here he he didn't have another agenda in the back of his mind at all that no he didn't have any agenda about money we were going to know agenda about money he's all that his own friends in chicago didn't say to him okay now show us what's happened to velocity over time no one said no i i think that that was part of the discovery in our work and so i put this big effort into constructing the money data and he participated of course because there were technical decisions to make and it isn't that uh i was just doing it on my own and we had a staff of people who were going to the books to get the data and put them together for so that was the accomplishment of the first few years that we worked together and then deciding well we better find out why these changes in the money stock happened at the various dates that we have data for so you are a general you decided at some point well let's start in 1860 and moved it so so you you decided the beginning date was decided the beginning date was decided by where when we could find enough data so we started at 1867 after the civil war even though the data were pretty scrappy at the beginning and then became fuller and more reliable but we always thought of the [Music] time span of the star study as covering the years since the civil war right down to when we ended the the collection in 1960 but [Music] so two things were going on at the same time one was the cyclical analysis the bureau the traditional bureau approach but we did other things that besides the bureau's approach including deciding that what was important was growth rates not the levels at any particular date and that was not a traditional way of operating at the bureau and i think moore and burns never really believed that that was the right way to go i think they tolerated us in this what they considered not a credible way of measuring money behavior so so so burns and mitchell uh well mitchell was known i'm sure mitchell's no longer uh so so burns at the time was was not sort of understanding where money was going to fit into no the economy he didn't understand that m and p are related and we've got to understand that changes in m and no i mean this to them was foreign and well that's why burns got into trouble later on maybe yeah so um i would say in general there was not a warm reception by the staff at the bureau it was only when milton started bringing in his students from the workshop at chicago i mean people like kagan weiselman and so on that we sort of had a cohort here that really believed what we were doing i think the the other people in the of the bureau of staff well partly because they were all involved in their own specialized studies and didn't really pay much attention to what we were doing except what they learned of it in a sort of incidental way and then right it wasn't a common mainstream view so well one can see this in the sense that people at the bureau are dealing with these these real tangible things yes steel ingots and and bushels of wheat and and uh and here and here suddenly we we moved from this uh real economy into this this money into a nominal economy that didn't seem to them to be the stuff of business cycles right so little did they know i mean i don't i don't mean that there was you know over hostility there was just disbelief and well it never mattered to milton that now that they didn't accept these ideas and it's because he's such a persuasive person that i think the profession in time said yes there is some validity to this approach we're going to have to stop this soon and then then we'll take a little break yeah and um and get back to the story because uh we're now uh into the thick of the your relationship to the bureau and uh i haven't really answered the initial questions that you asked me but no no no but that's the point this is those were the questions that were the naive general ones that's how i began that this is your story and this is the exact story as i wanted it told because you started at the beginning and now we're in uh in the 1950s yes and and i'm going to stop this and then we're going to continue how's that okay i'm gonna turn this off we have three minutes to this thing so i'm gonna turn it off so we're uh continuing uh with anna jacobson schwartz and anna just start up where we left off thanks all right um so i think milton treated his graduate students as people who were as equal in trying to understand whatever issue they were dealing with in their dissertations it wasn't the relationship of somebody who was talking down to others and i think in that sense um he contributed something to each i've known a number of his um graduate students who earn phds under him that they each have a sense that their their work was something that they did with milton not under milton and that he took as much pleasure in their success as it obviously was in their interest to achieve it so there is something um very attractive about working with milton it's the sense that he's not trying to sell fragment and dietization right he's doing something in a cooperative way with the people who are essentially learning from him but at the same time able to share their views with him as if they were equals and i think this is a very rare quality in people who [Music] are continuously nurturing younger people but always in the position of the superior he's not like that so even at the start when he was at really at the start of his own career um we functioned in a way that i think gave me respect at the same time that i certainly had enormous respect for him because i felt i learned so much from him and every encounter it didn't matter what we were talking about he always illuminated a subject for me and as i've often said sometimes when you say i don't understand this and this is my question milton would reformulate his your question in a way that made you understand what it was that you didn't understand until he showed you what were the real problems in this particular area so um as i say i think i did have a unique relationship with him but not unique in the sense that he didn't treat his own graduate students in any way different from the way he treated me so um the other thing i i think that was special about my relationship with him was if i said to him i don't think you've expressed this well i don't think you've covered this i think you've evaded this he never got upset he never got angry with me he said let me see if i can do it better and when he criticized something that i had done and was in the same spirit he wasn't trying to belittle me he was trying to improve the product and i appreciated that and i wanted to do better if he showed me in what respects what i had turned into him was not as good as it might be so the working relationship i think in many respects was one that was enriching both for me and for him so so you the two of you you worked at the bureau he of course was at chicago almost all of the time and you corresponded mainly by mail he would occasionally come to new york yes maybe summer there was one half year the half year in which columbia awarded me the phd when he was the visiting wesley claire mitchell professor but that was much later of course that was much later 64. right and there's a lot of yeah and and all the intervening years were these uh years in which you wrote this um very important large volume of monetary history of the united states and so you begin this you you have much of the data that you that you and angel had been working on milton then and and you then sort of uh map out exactly what data you're going to be collecting yeah and uh at what point did the two of you sit down and say this is how it's developing these are the chronologically the breaking points that we want to separate it into these chapters yes and this is the narrative and the book has a grand narrative yes and so what's amazing is that it starts out as all good economic history and economics research must with uh a collection of important illuminating data but it winds up as a great narrative so how did that happen um as i say the fundamental series was the money stock series right and the way we interpreted it so that was the great data achievement at the start and then in addition of course we needed price data and income data and velocity data and these were um available mainly from the work of others except that we reviewed what others had accomplished and in some sense we modified what others had done because we found various problems not our fatal ones but ones that we thought could be improved and um these auxiliary series supplemented the money stock series and became the bedrock on which we built the narrative so the narrative up until we had access to the internal federal reserve documents for the 1920s and early 1930s were drawn mainly from standard economic histories which we didn't always interpret the way the standard histories did but nevertheless they were the sources that we used it was only when we turned to the federal reserve period in the 20s that we were able to present an internal aspect of federal reserve decision making that became the the focal point for the emphasis on how wrong policies had been during the great depression um now that alan meltzer has written a history of the federal reserve system in large part repeating what we had done except that the emphasis is strictly on the federal reserve whereas our view was broader than that over the whole period and he's had access to some internal material that was not available to us at the time but i'm not sure how that volume will be regarded in when it's finally published it is in the production department at princeton press if alan really succeeds in covering the period from 1951 on which is supposed to be the second volume of his work i think that may have a much greater impact than this first volume would i think even though i don't always agree with what uh he's written and he knows where i disagree seems to me to be retreading ground yeah it's already been pre-plowed but that's an incidental comment i think um the initial reception by the profession of both the cyclical behavior of the money stock in the review of economic statistics volume issue and the publication of a monetary history was just amazing to the profession in general which had not heard such views expressed and regarded them as revolutionary in a way that they were and didn't win general acceptance until much later so there was the the post-publication period in which the national bureau really wasn't involved we were involved as individual authors responding to the [Music] sort of critical uh assessment that people who were who consider themselves monetary economists um expressed do you remember of course there was internal dissent yes there is that dissenting a director a director according to the bureau of the laws have the right to write at the center i don't agree that's right and that was published along with the main volume right and a lot of people of course felt that the bureau sent off this volume with less than uh 100 well well isn't it the case that uh um income from independent professional practice also has a dissenting uh opinion in it and and that's in many ways uh we think back at the bureau as having enormously high standards that it had this review process that could lead to a dissenting well it wasn't only the review process it was the idea that anything that came out under the imprint of the national bureau had to be something that was solid that was not just um you know an occasional thought of the authors not backed up by solid data and something that the national bureau didn't want to be associated with it so um there was this sense that publication had to be a kind of ultimate goal the intermediate steps were the ones that counted and that was checking rechecking making sure that every sentence in any manuscript could be backed by support and that was the way every manuscript was treated that it was turned over to an internal committee after research assistance had been assigned to check every single step what we in many places called the fact checkers that's right you must have run them ragged yes but the it was the people who were our research assistants who did that kind of work but in the largest sense of the the main conclusions of a monetary history were not subjected to that internal kind of assessment i'm not sure the the one comment that um saul fried assault rabbit cat made was that we ought to substantiate what we said for the us by apparel study for the uk which in the end turned out to be not a very fruitful way for us to have spent our time but we did try to respond to this internal but internal criticism but i don't recall anybody else on the staff reading committee that challenged us in the way that the profession did right about right uh why are you so certain that right money plays this that's an important role when you were a graduate student uh you must have taken a course uh on um money monetary theory money and banking uh that was with angel and that was with angel and um but when you in many ways anticipated what we did except he didn't accept at face value what his own results showed i mean he showed that changes in money were associated with changes in nominal income but he didn't make anything of it right right so um did you did you feel that you mean that teaches me something right if you do research right you really have to be convinced yourself that what you're finding is worth attention and i think angel lacked that kind of conviction that something that his book shows wasn't something that he emphasized or tried to make something of and it eventually was you know just sloughed over not really paid attention to whereas we thought that was a very significant finding and that you could replicate it not only for the us but for other countries and that's in effect what some of friedman's students did absolutely right yeah did did you this is sort of beside the point in terms of the the issues having to do with the bureau but do you can you think of um sort of a moment when you sort of said to yourself you know i'm a monetarist and was there a moment when you said well i had been working on business cycles and i had been working on britain and and i know it wasn't then that you thought of yourself as an economic historian you were an economist who for good reason used historic like kuznets historical economist notion but truly at some point in working on a monetary history uh you must have thought if you're suddenly the word monetarist must have come across in in your mind you and milton must have thought and discussed the fact that that you you had a vision of the world a vision that wasn't sort of a vision it wasn't theory it was coming out from the data it was sort of backed up by a framework it was on a solid rock but suddenly you you had a um a very clear view of what had gone on in some critically important moments in american history is there any moment that you think of that that suddenly you said aha monetarism well i think when carl brunner started the shadow literally federal federal open market committee when we were clearly trying to convey a message about the importance of what the federal reserve was doing that i'm sure that and he was the one actually uh i mean carl bruno who coined the word monetarism yes the that became a tag for what the people associated with him i mean friedman was never associated with the federal mark the shadow of market committee but he was intensely interested but there were there were all these um chicago people before milton yes who um but never with this vision right so they were quantity theory people in a traditional sense but not emphasizing the demand for money the supply of money velocity money balances that kind of emphasis but certainly they believe that you know if you had an inflation you better check on what what's what you're doing with the quantity of money right but um it was not as i say the the view that you can explain a lot a lot by the behavior of money but you cannot explain why real things are changing the way they have so this distinction was certainly not part of the way the chicago quantity theory people operated and of course even that there was no link back to the real yes from the nominal in in the simple q theory model right and that's uh the um you know what what milton put his his stamp on which you put your own stamp on was that view and uh and that then um becomes refined uh and altered uh with bob lucas and um and you know they're they're they're the same sort of view of the world with as a different framework a forward-looking framework a uh a different a backward looking framework in some sense it has to do with um expectations right has to do with this the sense of of the knowledge of that kind of change in our framework is what emerged in monetary trends right and it's really such a disappointment to us that that book got a bad press from henry and erickson for one thing one regression in that volume ignoring all the other parts of the study that never sort of got any kind of attention and of course the irony is that what henry was correcting from his point of view was inadequate uh econometrics didn't in one sense change one idea about finding his finding was precisely ours except that by his standards it was based on the most up-to-date econometric technique whereas ours was backward not really right now you know but that's another uh i mean look if you do nobody who's ever published something knows you never know but the point is that uh you know it's only with truly great work that there's controversy the worst thing that can happen is to be ignored um that's right let me throw in a name out of someone who worked behind the scenes at the bureau but worked obviously very hard on on your book on a monetary history it's irving foreman um did you know him did i know irving foreman the person who did all the charts i worked with irving on the charts for the british business cycles he did those two he did those i didn't throw his name out because um in the history of the bureau he will i hope that he receives um at least a page because he deserves a lot more and he must have been an extraordinary draftsman that's right and also a passion for accuracy yeah he didn't want you to hand him any data to char that had not been checked and rechecked and i think that there was this kind of integrity about his work that makes him special he he really cared about how good the data were that he was was he a full-time bureau employee full-time he had his own office with all his drafting materials i mean he was a bit of an eccentric but anybody can be that way he was so clever i look at many of the uh figures in a monetary history and i believe in the um you know in the great compression um the great contraction i i'm laughing because i i in in a piece that i wrote on income inequality in the 40s when the income inequality compresses i i paraphrase the great contraction i call it the great uh compression which of course is also the uh coming from the language of the great depression so it's taking the great depression the great contraction together and so in in your chapter um on on the contraction um there are some figures that are multiples of many many figures you know there there are a couple of charts in which he's he's graphing um you know six different series with six um pointing to different parts of the axes first left and right and left and right and um they're they're just brilliant ways of displaying information and he had that knack yes so he certainly deserves a lot of credit and so you would never suggest to him well you know we have this chapter and if you did each one of these as a graph there would be you know 122 grams and so you never said to him it would be interesting to condense them in the following way he just thought about it yeah but he must have known the direction that the chapter was taking so he knew how to put them all together although i never really discussed what's the economics of what we were doing in terms of how can you best display what we want to show at each point that it supports the text that's accompanying it and he had a he had an incredible knack for reading your mind then because there's some wonderful uh exhibits of of series in that chapter and many of the chapters um i always whenever he was really um a workman of some i would say some excellence it's yeah right um so just tell me let let me just go back just for a very very short while because i want to go forward in time uh in into um the 50s and and the 60s of the bureau but you talked before about the national bureau approach to doing business cycle analysis can you say just a little bit more about that do i think can you just say a little bit more about what you mean i mean the the guiding principle of the bureau's business cycle project was that if we could learn something about how each sector of the economy operated at cyclical turning points we would be in a position then to formulate some kind of overall view of the american business cycle and until we had these building blocks as it were we were not would not be in a position to have this general view so the emphasis was always on um what do we know about production what do we know about construction what do we know about inventories and then somebody a master builder would be able to take all these separate pieces and put together the big picture of business cycles and the only common feature of all of these separate things was that bureau technique of how you how you measure business cycles so you've marked off peaks and troughs and you're divided over the intervals according to some fixed number of phases and you described each one in these terms and the um the emphasis in each of these separate pieces was always on what's going on within these sectors not relating to something else and not in addition uh being concerned uh with with growth as opposed to cycles well that was the big rift yes at the national bureau in the 1940s after the very negative reception that measuring business cycles received that it was measurement without theory and it was a blow i think that arthur burns never recovered from and somehow he i mean he was certainly the surviving author of measuring business cycles who had devoted his whole life up until that point to this one one approach to business cycles and um well it's ironic in a way that younger people so many years later have thought there was some virtue to what the national bureau's technique did and don't think that measurement without thero without theory has no justification but of course burns never lived to enjoy that kind of uh rehabilitation but but if you were um we were i mean we had plenty of theory that nobody believed right and then there was the other stuff but but there is this um this moment in i think it's 47 uh free kuznets writes a uh proposal uh to ford i guess yeah and um it's on not just on growth it's it's comparative yeah and um uh and of course uh you're uh you're uh working for the bureau at the time but you're you're up at columbia so you perhaps you know about this only from hearsay okay but not at the time word later i think at the time okay but um this was arthur burns protecting his turf yeah and i think the the sense that the bureau's mission was unique it was to study business cycles and here was a proposal to change the direction of the national bureau in a way that i think he regarded as a threat to his own dominance of the institution and although the title of the british business cycles study was growth and fluctuations we got growth into the title although i don't know how much growth we actually just discussed but um i i think that cousins didn't get a fair hearing and of course he was not dependent on the national bureau if they weren't going to support this program of research that he wanted to pursue he would find other sources and did did you have a sense then or later that simon and arthur had deeper personal and intellectual conflicts yes i think i mean there was every reason for kuznets to feel that he might be the successor to mitchell but since burns was the one who worked so closely with him during the 20s and 30s that may have been you know just not a reasonable expectation even though mitchell certainly had a very high regard for kuznets i think also the fact that milton's participation in the quiznet's study of income professional income that in the end sort of dismissed quiznot's contribution as superficial and milton's as more more significant also harmed kuznets position as a possible leader of the uh the bureau but certainly milton to this day is very respectful of of kuznets and says kuznets treated him very well i think i mean it must have been a difficult situation for cousin it's who was certainly more established in the field than milton was at the time that he really rewrote income from professional practice than the manuscript that was handed to him but nevertheless supported milton's version and didn't oppose it right so um where personalities and and professional judgment enters i think it's hard for an outsider to say yeah but you never had an um any knowledge of something deeper in the sense and and once again it's it's hard to to figure this out um i know that for example milton and arthur um uh became at least milton sort of lost respect for arthur in 71 yes uh with the wage and and um price controls and milton wrote a letter to arthur expressing his enormous disappointment to that very different type of of differences i think emerge with kuznets and burns i you maybe you don't know anything about this but i get the sense in from reading that that that kuznets um perhaps the only the best way of putting it is that he didn't have that much respect for burns's intellect um well at the beginning of course byrd seemed to be the dominant one and milton learning from burns but milton's i mean mitchell and burns had liberal in not in the 19th century since but in the the modern sense of liberal they were they were people who did not oppose a a welfare state who thought that uh you know government was certainly an important player that you should attempt to include in any kind of reforms whereas milton was a hardliner in the sense that the private sector was the one that needed support and government could not be relied on to produce favorable outcomes so this was milton's stance even before he came to the national bureau and he was certainly identified with that view and i think influenced burns to move to the same kind of thought that milton had but never was a believer in the sense that milton was and i think in a way milton deluted himself into believing that arthur burns shared his views on matters that arthur was quite indifferent to and maybe opposed but would never have a fight with milton to say i don't agree with you and right you're off the edge you know that kind of thing um we didn't say anything about about mitchell of course mitchell um you didn't see much of mitchell but mitchell becomes i'm i think ill around 46 or so is that right he dies in 48 yes i believe um this the office is in new york um he must have been um a most uh beloved individual he was a person of enormous humanity most gentlemanly person you could hope to meet i mean this the sense that he treated everybody with dignity and um kindness something that you would never associate with birds and it's hard to understand how somebody with burns's personality would have been appreciated by mitchell and would succeed him with such a different way of approaching people and issues but um there it is i only knew burns very late in his life when either that edge was somewhat um dulled um or i saw him in in a particularly good day yeah but uh but i i i've heard from many people that he was gruff discourteous everything mitchell was was not that's right there was a session at a western economics meeting western economic association meeting at which frank morris who had retired as president of the boston fed who talked about burns's relations with the members of the federal market committee when he frank morris was a member he said the members of the committee hated burns but oddly whenever there was some social gathering with the wives of the presidents they loved burns they admired him and the men looked at their wives with other couldn't understand this guy was not somebody that well he treated them all as you know what did they know about economics what did they know about how the federal reserve should operate he author was the one who had the intellect and the experience to determine questions of this kind and these you know and i mean he was open about it isn't as if he tried to conceal his contempt for these people who were his colleagues he showed it and they resented it and it didn't matter to burns so this tells you something about about him and that i mean he could certainly act you know in this grand way with women maybe that's what i was won over by yeah it hadn't occurred to me so and i don't feel that burns career after he left the bureau really enhanced his reputation i mean even apart from what he did as chairman of the foot i think the chairmanship of the council in which his big uh the the big position that he took opposition to keynesian monetary and consumption economics in a sense this was something that was an outgrowth of his closeness with milton at that time so that i don't think this was really something that emerged from burns i think it was something that he learned from milton and expressed then in his own way but nothing that he did after the leaving the bureau i think has made a mark he leaves the bureau then he comes back and then and then he has another diploma and then he has another debacle when he comes back with the ford foundation decided they didn't want to support the bureau the way it was organized at the time and what did you feel about that when you heard so so now we're and we're going to we're not going to leave the 50s we're just going to be on this tangent for a while but it's a very important tangent so so burns um comes back to the bureau uh after he's he's uh chairman of the the ca um moore uh is now director of research burns is is president yes so so we have now two people um in in this these higher up positions rather than just one and and it takes a a pretty long time i think it's in 67 or 66. so that's um a little more than 10 years it comes back 10 years later uh the ford foundation which had been giving amply to the bureau comes and says this is too colombia-oriented this is a closed society a closed group what were they really saying and how did you as a researcher here hear it and respond to it well uh the ford criticism was just you were selected by burns possibly more although i think more was more of a cipher than an equal in the decision-making process so if burns thought you could do something for the bureau in some research work he would invite you and that was it it was only people with whom he had contact it wasn't as if he was searching for the best economist located anywhere where to participate in whatever projects he thought were worth supporting or finding funds for and i think burns had returned to the bureau thinking i mean here he was with a national reputation and whatever he would seek to fund would be find a welcome response from whatever foundation or corporate president whom he approached and i think he was unprepared for the sharp rebuff that he had at the ford foundation i mean i don't think that it was the quality of research that was being conducted at the bureau that was responsible for the way the forward foundation responded i think it is it wasn't a sense that it's too parochial of an organization to be calling itself a national research thing and that was the beginning of the change in the direction of the national bureau so i think the succession of john meyer turned out to be a mistake but that was the beginning of the broadening of the research program at the bureau to a much wider group of economists and had been true before even though you know when somebody at chicago became a research associate and might have spent a year or some months here and then gone back to teaching far from new york um it was still a new york centered organization and the change really came with maya's accession and of course much uh expanded after martin took over right but uh you know in looking over the uh the people who were researchers at the bureau at um under uh burns some of whom may have started under mitchell but i know that they were finished their work onto burns they they look uh it looks as if they're from all over but um but in many cases the lineage does go back to colombia and stigler's case is that's one case in point and say justin right who moves on to michigan and so on that they have some physical link with having worked at the bureau right but then moved on and a sense the bureau provided employment to economists at a time when it was hard to get a university job and it was only after the war a man like abramovitz never had a teaching position until after the war and the bureau was a a haven for people like that even though he was a colombian man and therefore would have been typically associated with with the bureau but uh it was the absence of opportunities at universities until after the war that explains the fact that the bureau could satisfy its research personnel with the local people i mean and extraordinary local people at that um let's go back to a monetary history that's okay and uh we'll do this for a little while and then my tape will go and and if you want to uh we may have another half hour is that okay are you getting bored no well i have things to do but i was away from four years last week so i'll have to wait another day yeah to do well if we don't finish it now we can finish this another time but it would be good if we just did another uh half hour or so so we'll we have just we have ten about eight more minutes left on this tape and then we'll go but let's go back to a monetary history and then go forward a little bit um uh the um i i always enjoy reading a monetary history as i said it's that the narrative is is a great narrative and um uh the when when you and now you and milton were working separate from me from each other but when when you were working on the narrative would you would you write um 50 pages send it to milton he would he would cross things out absolutely scribble in send it back you get it typed somewhere or you type it yourself i don't know who was doing the typing of these things you had typos good because there was a lot of typing and um uh did you did you have it in your your your mind that uh you were actually writing brilliant english this was this was readable no i mean that never occurred we were trying to get this thing done and it was not written once it was rewritten and rewritten and the last sentence of of the great contraction you know that sentence very very well it has about uh three knots in it it's it's the most uh one of the the great sentences i think of of economic literature i read it out loud to my undergraduates and my graduate students every year and tell them sometimes you can have a triple negative for effect i just want to tell you that that i very very much like that sentence and many of the others in in that book um so uh so you and milton work and work and work and work and of course uh eventually we turn in the magazines eventually wow eventually 61 62 that's the rewritten that's the rewritten manuscript so the the first version of it is turned in when it goes through the staff reading committee and the director's reading committee and it was the man who was president of the new york fed who said why don't you use the harrison papers right at columbia right and it was the first we'd heard about and then i went up to columbia and selected the the pages of these records of the new york fed that we had copied and i brought him back to the bureau and we made copies of them here and sent them to milton and then we started working again on the chapters where these federal reserve documents could be introduced so um it certainly changed the tone of the manuscript and i think um added a lot of i would say human interest to what we were writing but eventually we completed it and then turned into what was the final version and that was it so um so they were the edition was was just just the harrison papers where there was revision was basically incorporating the harrison papers i mean we rewrote a lot anyhow because you always can see something could be expressed better after it's been out of your hands for a while and we did a lot of rewriting in that sense but not in the the formal sense of having new support for the view that we were trying to present based on the harrison papers right so um once again we're almost done with this tape and then we can take a little break and then we'll just do a little bit more um i think that so we're we're now around and up to the time that you you get your degree you're still at the bureau of course and you're still at the bureau and now and uh and so i think that when we pick this up uh you know you can just sort of um discuss a bit about um what then happens at the bureau from uh the 60s to the 70s and so we're going going to go through the tumultuous period of uh the end of arthur burns the beginning of john meyer uh and it was um a bit of a tumultuous period i i know john uh not from the bureau i know him from from when i taught at harvard 1976 and met him as the john meyer from conrad meyer yes and john meyer is an extraordinary individual there's the good and the bad and on the good side is that he has done so many different things it's as if john meyer was is five different people and maybe maybe that's the downfall of anyone is to attempt to be five different people um so let's let's take a little bit of a break okay oh this is um tape three of a november 19 2001 discussion with anna jacobson schwartz about life at the bureau then and now okay so um uh we're sort of somewhere in the 1960s and you can go back in time forward in time but i was thinking that you can comment on um the um you've said a bit about the way research was done i know that that's always difficult to comment on about the shops i know um bob has told me about the business cycle shop um did you see the business cycles when when you you would come here during the time when i was working on the british study right i was often in the business cycles shop where there was a crew busy working on individual time series and this was a period when there was the codification of the way to do national bureau style yeah business cycle analysis hadn't yet been firmed so that they would do things one way and show them to whoever was uh in charge of that series and there'd be some discussion well maybe we shouldn't do it just that way maybe we should modify the procedure and eventually it got settled this was the rule always observe it and each of the people in that unit would be busy every day of the week doing an analysis of the series and this was way before there was a computer and did has someone written down anywhere what this codification was yes i mean there is um a mimeograph version of how to do each step in the uh in the way of getting the final result do you know where the mimeograph you're you're saying that you've seen one at some point i may even have one so there is such a okay what you would call the rules of the game and this is the way it's played well if you happen to find it let me just pass it on to you right well we can xerox it so you can keep the original uh yeah i'm pretty sure i've got it anyhow there must be a copy here right well and now that i'm trying to put this archive together there are many many different things that i think that we'll want in it um so um are there any other statements about how research was done um in those days right well sort of in the 50s i think i've already indicated before the first emphasis was on accuracy right one person might have been assigned to collect the data for some specific series that person would have been sent back to check what had been copied another person might have been assigned to do the same job to come back with the results to be compared with what the first person right and as i say there was this intense concentration making sure that every number you copied was what had been shown in the document that was its source right then there was the the next step which was the analysis of the series which might have been done only by the people in the business cycles unit separate from the perfect the people who were doing the collection and then there was the the final stage when somebody had written a manuscript and somebody was assigned to check each statement in the manuscript which was typed and sent to a reading committee and to a director's committee and the research assistants like uh bob and like yourself were were drawn from uh columbia graduate students that's right right i don't think of anybody who wasn't i mean there were some who were not graduate students a lot of the people who worked on the money project were not graduate students the only one who was a graduate student in fact got his ph.d while he was here who is mark whaley who was psychologically not really um a normal person i would say but certainly a very intelligent guy in other other respects are the people who weren't graduate students what were they they were stupid people who were used to copy stuff i think to prepare tables for you to do all kinds of um were they people who had been undergraduates of columbia and bernard not necessarily might have been recommended by somebody who knew somebody right it was a job the bureau had wasn't edith kuznets um chris chris worked as a research assistant which isn't it originally but i think that long before you came to the bureau somewhat before wasn't edith kuznets harry jerome's research assistant and that's how she met simon yes and and i always say that that was the first moment that we know of maybe there was an earlier one that the national bureau was the the national bureau of economic romance which it has continued to be there have been many i mean i know other couples one of whom was a national bureau person but not the the other one but no we i can give you a list of them but not now um so um uh so research uh the research process is as is always very uh time-consuming very time-consuming right involved i would say lots of people lots of that's right it was it was um i like to think of it in in the mind's eye i think of it as as sort of a little factory that's called the shop and and i sort of think of it that way um a lot of the work that you did was um was solitary you would you would direct research assistance right yes um but it wasn't it wasn't a group okay yeah and you would that these uh research assistants would would go to colombia get information bring it back that's right right yeah and um and uh milton didn't have his own research assistance at chicago every everybody was here under your eye yes nothing was done in chicago by others right whatever statistical work we did was here he didn't he didn't initiate it in chicago or have somebody working on it there and the uh now by the 50s um there was a mainframe someone had a uh um that was used by us right by the time we did the monetary trends of course and then there was right so so there were monroe calculators what do you remember monroe calculated that's right and um and there were these research assistants would just crack attack yeah that's right yeah um my own graduate students find it hard to believe that i remember when um when we didn't have um an easy portable way of computing natural logs that's right you know that well when i was a graduate you look at the long table but but i mean i i could i could you know write a program and go to the computing center but you you know you don't want to go to the computing center to compute a natural natural log and i remember that bob fogle who was my advisor at the time uh rented for me because i was working on a project for him and a project for myself and so he rented a calculator that was gigantic and must have had a bit of a memory and it computed logs and it had you know exponential and and that was uh my way out of the log table and i would also just use my my high school slide rule which i was certain i could read to you know five significant digits he was he was one of those yeah um okay so so into the 60s um you're working here monetary history is out where we're still thinking we're going to pre-produce this volume on this cyclical behavior of money right instead we publish this volume on monetary statistics of the united states that came out in 1972 and we're still thinking that we're going to do the cyclical history of money instead of which we go ahead and do monetary trends yeah and we never do the cyclical history of money the only thing in that direction is the 1962 thing that we did but by then isn't this technical history is an anachronism it's a technique and that's probably i mean i've never discussed this milton that with me right how come we never never did it but i think it's because the national bureau technique had sort of been abandoned so but you sort of abandoned it yourself in many ways yes yes because we didn't do anything further with it right and by the time we're doing trends of course we're doing it with the help of computers right originally with cards right those wonderful cards right we've been through the technological revolution in research starting with hand calculation you know electric computers and then i think bob was the one who told me i can't remember that that you know these these um tables would be checked um and of course i still check my tables the same way that you you go across and you go down and you make certain that the marginals add up um but these were not tiny tables these were gigantic tables that would fit on this table and more um so what happens when john meyer comes a lot of in computer work is done at yale so john is it yale at the time i guess meyer isn't is it yeah and there admirer is at yale and i've forgotten who's the name what's the name of the guy who was the computer it was a gutierrez from yale who would come to the bureau and would bring back to yale these decks of cards left me prepared yeah to be inserted i would probably remember yeah and then he'd have to come back with the output that's right yeah i know that must have been terrible when you would come back with the output and it would say job aborted or something program error that's right yeah and you'd have to send him back again didn't matter you'd have to do it again that was an interlude really because john meyer didn't last all that long but he he lasted from maybe i've got this wrong but from 68 right yeah to something to 70 76 77 that's a long time that's uh you know eight years um nine years it's pretty long we used to have annual conferences that he organized once at montauk um i mean nothing like this had happened in the previous administration that there would be this big blowout where we would have some fancy resort and have a conference that was new for the national bureau well in some sense in his defense that meant that he could take the boat from connecticut the ferry down to orient point and go to montauk maybe he was uh equalizing transport for everyone of course people in new york would have had to go all the way out to montauk that's right but and all i remember actually about his time here is how easily it was for him to get angry just a very short fuse and he'd blow up but he was the bureau wouldn't make sense wasn't much changed that he was here because the organization was pretty much the way it had been we had the publications department the um the way research was conducted was not very much different now what what do you think the board chose meyer i guess this is the one part of the bureau that um that i'm a little rusty about where did meyer appear from i don't know who who who was the person on the board just right you thought he would be the the right person to succeed more to succeed he was succeeding more burns in 67 68 he was still succeeding burns was not yet um fed chairman right no burns went to washington in 69 when he was not he was or maybe it was 68 when was the election probably november 16 68 right and then he was part of the nixon right didn't i think he wasn't appointed to the fed probably until late 69 right yeah something like that but but my recollection of the timing is that um things weren't going well at the bureau um meyer um was uh going to be appointed or was appointed and burns um very luckily for him nixon wins and he goes out in style um so it would appear to anyone looking at the history without scratching beneath the surface that burns left and then meyer came in without knowing that meyer was going to come in even but um but more so myers coming in as president moore remains as director of research is that right yeah yeah and so in that sense things aren't going to change a hundred percent because more still is still physically here in new york as as the continuity the continuity in um in uh an intellectual sense as well uh burns uh moore is a pretty he's technique he's sort of technical he's not an an idea person um mitchell of course was a was a big picture idea person uh burns maybe neither neither yeah he was uh and and then um uh so you don't remember any discussion about where did this guy john meyer come from people here must have been i don't remember if i ever knew but it's not something i can think of now right right but maybe it didn't matter so much because after all moore was still here so uh it may not have been something that that one thought much about but then once he was here um what did you know about what he what he did he was he did uh he was an urban transport person he was like you know he broadened the range of research projects right he brought in a housing program which hadn't existed there was also a study of steel industry i think how come american uh entrepreneurs weren't as innovative in steel as counterparts in other countries and that was a new thing right although steel wasn't new but that that farm was in whether alf conrad was on that no i don't program i don't know i don't know i don't know al conrad dies um somewhere around then i believe yeah he wasn't here very long before that yes he committed suicide but i think he was on that program about innovation in the steel industry um what other new research projects what about people who did you um uh who did you talk to and who who who were your friends yeah university appointments right and um ruggles i think came in at that point and and he would have been at yale yes but uh maybe he would show up at new york every now and then that's right and and your own personal intellectual contacts social contacts here at the bureau uh were about the same that's right and and who who were they mainly over the years and here we're situating this somewhere from the late 50s into this into the uh the whole of the 60s well um i mean someone i've known all through the years right it's bob of course bob's the great country that we were really social i mean i didn't have dates my husband and i didn't have dates with bob and sally but right we certainly knew one another and um my social activities tended to be [Music] confined to my family to um opera right concerts but what about the the intellectual life of the bureau to whom would you go if you had uh if you wanted to talk through an issue no i mean that was what was i thought somehow the there were segregated projects so you associated with people on your project and you wouldn't say to somebody working in another area i have a problem in my area how do you think i should approach it for one thing if i had a problem i would talk to milton about it there wasn't anybody at the bureau who i would feel would give me better advice than him so in that sense i think projects didn't intermingle they pretty much stayed separate from each other and certainly i never felt that there was a group at the national bureau who was as interested in money as i was and well i didn't have to look to people at the bureau to discuss these things i mainly could talk to people like phil casey phil kagan of course right so right whether my experience is unique in that regard i still think that that's the way it went that people in your area were the ones you were intimate with you knew all the other people working on other projects but you'd never really expect them to devote themselves to what you might think right the problem at the moment well i think in some ways than the new national bureau for all of its um and we can save a couple of words about this and then um we can wind up for for all of the potential uh practical problems that the bureau has today in terms and and you sort of intimated this before that that research you know i i have an idea let me write you know a 50 page paper on it and uh and we'll follow through later maybe for all of those potential problems the the wonderful thing about the bureau is the vibrant intellectual atmosphere that that that if any one of us has um a problem be it empirical be it um historical theory whatever a program you know computer program someone in the bureau who would be able to help who who would you know really want to help yeah and and i think of that as um as a real plus of the bureau um but for me the chief benefit of working at the bureau is that you can follow your independence that's right and if you want to write something up or look into something as a possible way to develop something right you you have the absolute opportunity right so so let's let's ramp up at this at this moment because um and you know for many years i've wanted to do this study of my exchange market intervention yes and marty certainly supported it from the beginning when i got this set of data from ted truman he was then at the fed and we've had many problems since getting the federal reserve bank of new york to make available the data on intervention for both the fed and the exchange stabilization fund the treasury yeah and i finally think we're going to succeed in getting the data they the fed the new york fed provided me with a lot of data from 1961 to 1991 but not complete and they did it very grudgingly they did it because alan greenspan had expressed an interest in having this release of research done but they didn't want to assign people to go to the archives to take this out if they dug something out and it wasn't complete that was fine with them and we finally got owen humpage at the cleveland fed who had been working in this area and to whom the fed the new york fed agreed to supply the missing information that was in the collection they sent me maybe finally we're going to have the opportunity to do this study and as i say the fact that the national bureau has permitted me to go ahead all these years just waiting for this chance to have the basic information for me is is a boom that i i can't possibly uh exaggerate it's wonderful so i'm looking forward to doing this research assuming i'm still going to be able to ahead but anyhow okay well let me i think the way i'm wrapping this up okay anna thank you so much and i'm gonna turn this off
