i'm david cutler and i'm delighted to talk to you a little bit about the economic cost of covid19 so this is a paper that i wrote with my colleague larry summers and it looks at how do we measure the total economic cost of cobit 19 where by total i mean partly the reduction in output the traditional gdp measure that economists always look at but also the health impacts which are particularly severe for covet 19 and add up to a lot of money here so that's what the goal of this paper is about um it was published in jama we are doing follow-on work so i'll tell you a little bit about areas where we are continuing to go forward i should say first though that you know in some ways what the way to think about these is this kind of very educated guesses about what the cost of coping 19 is obviously this is not something that we're going to know for certain but it's also something that's incredibly important to have good guesses about so that we can understand how big the policy response needs to be or what the likely impact on individuals is or what the impact on the economy going forward could be or how do we gauge the different types of scenarios that may occur in the future so that's our goal here is to try and give a very educated uh but realistic uh guess here so we divide the economic costs of coconut 19 into two parts the first part is the one which is relatively standard to economist which is the economic impact we're going to measure it over the next decade we have not compiled our own macroeconomic model of the economy instead what we're going to do is borrow from conventional models in this case the congressional budget office which is a relatively straightforward estimate of the impact for the over the next decade of covet 19. the second part where we're going to spend a lot more energy trying to estimate because nobody's really done this in this way is the health impact of covet 19. there are three different types of health impacts we're going to look at the first is premature mortality people dying before they otherwise would have we are going to value that using standard economic techniques of the value of a statistical life the estimates of that tend to be variable in the literature although not uh supremely so the us government tends to use numbers on the order of seven to ten million dollars for a life so we're going to take a seven million dollar value per life and so we'll measure the the lost lives using that rate second is there's long-term impairment for some survivors of covid19 we're going to draw on the sars experience and the experience of other people with respiratory issues to try and guess how how many people will have long-term impairment from covid and what the impact on their quality and length of life is likely to be both one and two here are for the population with covid19 the third uh one is going to be for people who just in the general population the increase in anxiety symptoms of anxiety and depression that we're that we are seeing for people throughout the the economy and so we'll have estimates of that and we'll value that using in this case the quality of life lost for an experience of anxiety or depression and the value associated with that then at the end i'll come to how big is this what should we do and so on so let me start off first with the lost output from the covert 19 induced recession um this is as i mentioned from the congressional budget office the blue line is their estimate from january of 20 of 2020 before the um pandemic and the orange line is from july of 2020 after the pandemic and so you can see here the loss now put particularly large in 2020 but actually continuing the cbo forecast that will continue for the next decade if you integrate between these two lines that is what is the lost output associated with the kobit 19 recession it's about 8 trillion dollars so the first part of our 16 trillion dollar estimate is eight trillion dollars associated with lost output that's about 50 if you do it exactly it's very slightly under 50 percent of the lost out of the the the economic cost of covert 19 is the loss output so that's the first part here the second part is the the the health consequence now for this we need to be able to forecast just as the congressional budget office forecast economic output here we need to be able to forecast what is the health impact of coca-19 and you can see it's quite variable it was very very bad in the spring these are deaths uh uh by week this it was very bad in the spring it then came down before going up again in late summer with uh relaxing of things it then came down again it's now going up again one needs to make some forecast about this uh what we assume is that coveted deaths will remain at the relatively low level they were very late in the summer for the next year so we have so so so so we've sort of forecasted that out for a year total deaths as of as of you know early um uh november or late october were about 250 000 deaths if you include um both the co direct coven 19 deaths and the additional deaths from non-coven 19 causes that we've observed this year if you forecast that level out for the next uh year you get to about 625 000 deaths so that's what we're going to take that's i believe a reasonable forecast i believe it's on the conservative end because for example we don't have any increase in mortality rate in winter as many people are worried about for example seasonal flu deaths get much worse in winter and people are worried that kobe will get much worse in winter as well so this is sort of on the conservative side although although you know trying to be pretty accurate about this so you take those 625 000 uh deaths you multiply them by seven uh million dollars per life and that's about four trillion dollars uh of lost economic uh value and you see that in the first row here and that's sort of the easy part of the calculation because uh the you know forecasting the deaths we measure those we at least are measuring those so it's easier to calculate the second row here is the morbidity consequences um here we really draw in the experience of sars um so in the case of sars which uh did not thankfully did not affect as many people about one-third of people with severe or critical illness which is typically the definition of that is typically hospitalization about one-third of those people will have long-term complications experience suggests um how bad is it well typically it's respiratory symptoms sometimes cardiac symptoms a little bit musculoskeletal type symptoms we took a kind of respiratory benchmark which is um the the quality of life lost for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease so long-term consequences of smoking which are very highly respiratory um and that cuts quality adjusted life expectancy by about a third so we we we apply that to the set of people who we believe will have severe critical illness based on the ratio of what share of people have severe or critical illness to the share of people who die and we have estimates of the number of people who die and that and then we multiply that by the same seven million dollars per life so that gets about two and a half trillion dollars uh per uh two and a half trillion dollars of loss from the morbidity consequences a lot of assumptions in there we tried to be on the conservative side of the assumptions but but not biased in a way just sort of taking as we as as we could to make to to to uh uh keep uh to show you the focus of them i will say that the morbidity consequences like the mortality consequences will certainly scale with deaths so any intervention that either reduces or increases the number of deaths is going to affect both of those rows the same way the third one is mental health and this one is really quite important um the population as a whole is showing very severe symptoms of anxiety and depression before covid if you did surveys about 10 percent of the population reported symptoms of anxiety or depression and it's now about 40 percent of the population of the adult population so given the size of the adult population that's about 80 million people who are newly reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression not all of these are obviously people who are ill with covid they're people who are worried about their jobs they're people who are worried about their loved ones they're people who worried who are who are just shut in and they and they they they are missing human contact uh or various types of contact so so that's so we take that whole population the estimates of quality of life loss associated with anxiety and depression can be very large um they can range up to about 0.4 or so in terms of quality of life loss for severe depression we take an estimate of about 0.2 we have point two and then we assume that goes on for a year so we take a year of quality adjusted life loss to point two we value that at a relatively conventional if low end estimate of a hundred thousand dollars per year multiply that by the 80 million people and that's 1.6 trillion dollars all told the health costs are eight and a half trillion dollars here um and that's just from those three consequences there may be other consequences that we haven't taken account of and people in as they hear this often say well have you thought about x or y and the answer is we haven't built in anymore but one could certainly do so this if you will is sort of the score card for the for the total so you have roughly seven and a half trillion dollars of lost gdp you have a little bit over 8 trillion dollars of health impairment for a total of 16 trillion dollars and that's the row that's highlighted here how do you make sense of a number like that like that's just an astronomical number well there are a few ways to do it so let me give you a little bit of sense about how we do it one way we do it is we say well what does this mean you know as a share of the economy and as a share of you know and as income for a typical family so that's about 90 of a year's worth of gdp is in there so that's obviously enormous that's you know far far greater than most recessions which i'll tell you a little bit more about in just a second or it adds up to about two hundred thousand dollars for a family of four remember not all of this is dollar loss that is you shouldn't think about this as all less income in the bank it is not but that doesn't mean it is any less real as a loss this is a loss of utility and we're valuing that utility after all the lost income it's not like what people want is sheets of paper with dollars printed on them in a little dollar sign that's not the value the value is the enjoyment of being alive uh end of end of uh of consumption in this case this these are people who are no longer alive or people whose consumption is significantly impaired because of uh health or or directly or indirectly from coca 19. so that's the um uh that's uh on the the sort of share of the economy uh there are other ways to think about it this is roughly four times the cost of the great recession it's roughly twice the cost of all the wars in the mid east since 9 11. if you take bill nordhaus's estimates of the cost of climate change and you sort of run them out to the future and then you kind of discount them back it's about 50 years of the cost of climate change so these are all of this is to say that these are just immensely big numbers we haven't seen anything so anything this big in an enormous amount of time the other thing that it that is um clear about this number is that it is so big that any intervention that can reduce the scale of the suffering will be immensely valuable so remember almost all of this is going to scale with deaths that is the lost economic output because people are not at work is scaling with deaths people are not at work in part because they're afraid of the getting kovid obviously the direct mortality consequences the indirect the consequences of morbidity and even the mental health impairments all of this scales with deaths so anything that reduces the mortality from covet 19 is going to be an immense economic benefit here we did a calculation about what the return to testing is assuming that people who get tested um then do some not all of them but many of them do some form of of isolation so that they don't infect others and just the spread just the reduced spread from people who are not infecting others can reduce the can generate a return to testing on the order of 30 to 1 even at a reasonably high cost of testing and at a reasonably low impact in terms of what it then means for subsequent uh people who get infected 30 to 1 is obviously not something you'd want to pass up i mean it's just an immensely high return here so in conclusion i i just want to say reiterate that these costs are are enormous and they will it really does um highlight the impact of sort of testing and limiting the spread and the huge payoffs associated with that because all of this scales with cases and uh with deaths and so uh actions that do that in a in a in in a good way are sort of going to be of enormous economic impact in addition to to uh to the health impact
