so uh just by way of motivation uh so what is the question we're asking here so as uh jim noted you know in our team more broadly we've been doing research on inequality and mobility using various administrative data sources and when the covet shock hit uh we started to think about how we could contribute to this very important crisis uh and like many others you know wanted to understand how covet 19 is affecting the american economy what policies might mitigate its adverse impacts going forward now in thinking about that sort of macroeconomic question of course there's a long tradition of studying those questions going back to the work of simon kuznets that catherine talked about in her presentation on foundational work at nber where macro policy decisions have traditionally been based on data from recurrent surveys of households and businesses so we use things like the current population survey or the monthly retail trade survey to construct uh i think vital aggregate information statistics we all rely upon like gdp unemployment rates and so forth but i think those data especially in the era of big data have two limitations that have become apparent uh in the pandemic so first they're only available at relatively low frequencies often with significant time lags so for instance if you're interested in data on consumer expenditures typically researchers would turn to the consumer expenditure survey which gives you information on a quarterly basis typically you know one year after the quarter that you're interested in uh and so of course from a real-time policy sort of perspective it's going to be difficult to use data like that um to make decisions second uh the data that we have from surveys largely because of limitations and sample size can't be disaggregated to examine variation across fine areas or subgroups so if you want to understand issues of inequality for example uh which wage groups or which sectors are being hit hardest by the shock what types of policies should be implemented going forward that is very difficult to do with existing data and so recognizing those issues what we sought to do is to build a publicly available economic tracker a publicly available data database using transaction data from several private companies to measure daily economic activity so at a very high frequency in a very granular way by zip code by income group by industry now i want to emphasize unlike a lot of recent research using private sector data which i think has been incredibly valuable so point to since diana's on the call the terrific work being done by her group at jpmorgan chase and collaborators in academia that work i think has been really valuable in the research results uh that have come out of it but the the model to date you know there and a lot of other work we do on our team relies on internal access to confidential data and that's for good reason you know there are serious privacy constraints that can prevent the release of that data and so as bill was correctly pointing out i worry with a lot of our graduate students you know how do you get folks in large numbers access to the data that are really i think the fuel of knowledge uh in the field uh at this point and so what we sought to do here is something a little bit different what i wanted to do is figure out a way to construct public statistics that are sufficiently granular for research and policy so they're disaggregated enough that you can make progress on lots of questions that people are interested in answering yet are sufficiently aggregated and masked such that companies like credit card companies for instance are actually willing to release the data publicly so there's a really sharp tension between those two goals and one of my objectives methodologically in doing this project was to try to figure out can you navigate that trade-off let's just try to do it as a demonstration and see if we can make this work uh to address you know some of the issues catherine was raising for example at the end of her presentation is this a feasible path for constructing national statistics going forward and so in the spirit of doing that demonstration uh what i'm going to focus on in the bulk of this presentation is how we use these new data to analyze the economic impacts of the kobit 19 pandemic and analyze the impacts of various stabilization policies but before turning to that let me first spend a little bit of time telling you about the data that we construct starting with the partners that we're working with to measure various key aspects of economic activity so consumer spending uh what we're going to do there is use information from various credit card aggregators so in particular we start with a company called affinity solutions which sees about 10 percent of credit and debit card transactions in the united states and manages loyalty programs for various credit card companies and so that gives you a window into what spending patterns look like in a very detailed way as you'll see in a second we're also incorporating data from mastercard which of course has another big window into uh spending activity another company called coin out so when you're looking at these different data sources one thing that i found is you know you have really good coverage from companies like mastercard but of a certain slice of transactions right so uh as we start to do this work and present some results colleagues would often ask us aren't you missing cash transactions and couldn't that be particularly important at the low end of the income distribution well it turns out there's this company called coin out which gives people rewards uh for scanning their receipts and so for about one million people you can get data on cash transactions from that source and so it's just an example of how you know you can triangulate various things i think to get a more complete picture of economic activity so we use that sort of information on the spending side we then get data on small business revenues aggregating credit and debit card transaction from different companies uh that essentially have a set of businesses that they're working with again seeing something like a 10 percent slice of the us economy from a company called wample complemented by a data from mastercard that will be incorporating shortly we then look at data on employment from various payroll companies so paychecks processes uh something like 10 percent of uh payroll um or seven eight percent payroll in the united states uh intuit is another big player in this market so combining these various companies listed here you have data on about uh 13 million workers employment patterns and hours of work and wages and so forth and then another important aspect of labor market is not just who's currently employed but what the prospects for employment are going forward and so there it's really useful to be able to measure job postings and we get data from a online job posting aggregator called burning glass which covers essentially all job postings in the united states and then finally briefly i'll mention at the end some data from a company called zern where we use to track long-term impacts on educational progress of kids which as you'll see i think adds a useful layer to this analysis so before i go on i just want to mention given the focus on data in this conversation today you know it's it's a big effort as deanna was pointing out to take these raw transactional sources of data and construct something that is useful for research and policy so we have a team of about 25 folks working on uh these uh data sets and you know that involves uh mundane things like dealing with breaks in the data because of changes in the clients these companies had and things like that to smoothing seasonal fluctuations to i think quite importantly dealing with privacy issues so as jim was noting particularly with the publicly traded companies there are serious restrictions in terms of what types of data can be made publicly available and so as you'll notice as i'm going through this in a lot of cases we're going to combine data from multiple companies we're going to mask things and index things in certain ways which allow us to get everyone comfortable and basically move forward in a way that complies with sec regulations and that's the type of navigation that i think is going to be crucial going forward to incorporate these types of data into public statistics one final challenge in working with any data like this uh is that they're obviously not nationally representative by design so the big advantage of the government surveys is that they are at least designed to be to provide representative statistics about the u.s population which is of course what we care about from a research and policy perspective if you take any one of these companies you're going to learn about uh how the clients of paychecks are doing not necessarily what employment looks like in the us as a whole and so we've spent a lot of time trying to benchmark these data sets against national aggregates in order to figure out which data sets to use how to combine them and so forth so i just want to give you a flavor of how that looks both to illustrate the pitfalls and the promise of these sorts of data sources so here is an example plotting uh data from the monthly retail trade survey in orange on spending in the food services category and so you know you can see how this bounces around and then dips right when the kovid shock hits and then we're overlaying data from the credit and debit card uh company that i talked about affinity solutions in green and what you can see here is the affinity data tracks the nationally representative data pretty well it's not perfect i don't certainly don't want to overstate things here so there are certainly deviations but on the scale of something like the shock induced by covid it looks pretty good so that's the case where we feel reasonably confident moving forward with uh with this sort of data give you another example on the payroll side we combine data from paychecks intuit and earn in uh and construct series that are shown in the solid lines for two industries food services again and professional services and you can see once again comparing to the current employment statistics the national statistics collected by bls it's not perfect uh but it's pretty good in terms of tracking things uh overall so again we think there's a reasonable signal here now i want to mention as a note of caution that there's by no means a guarantee like these examples might suggest oh you know you get private sector data and in general sort of lines up with public statistics that is definitely not the case let me give you an example that illustrates that so this dash green series is data from a company called home base which a lot of my colleagues in economics have been using in the past few months to study the covet pandemic to study labor markets and the reason for that is home base has made their data very widely available which has been a fantastic resource but as you can see here home base does not actually track uh the national statistics very well at all in terms of magnitudes uh and you know that's despite the fact that it has about 1.6 million workers you know it just illustrates that there are no guarantees here it's critical to do this sort of benchmarking to be able to use these types of data so what we do is essentially try to identify a data a set of data sources that track the national aggregates reasonably well and we then use that to see how far we can get and try trying to understand the impacts of covet 19 uh and then analyze the impacts of various policies so let me now turn to showing you how we apply these data starting by looking at the impacts of covid on consumer spending so if you look at national accounts data you see that the fall in gdp was driven primarily by reduction in consumer spending as opposed to changes in imports or exports or government purchases or private investment and so i'm going to start by looking at what happens to spending and using the the private sector data uh the public statistics constructed from that uh to um disaggregate the picture and understand what's going on in a finer way and so the first thing we're going to do is look at trends in consumer spending by income quartile breaking down the data by income group and so what you're seeing here is uh just a time series plot of consumer spending from the credit and debit card data uh for 2019 shown in the dashed line and 2020 shown in the solid line and what you can see is right when the kovid shock hits um in uh in late march in in mid-march you see that spending among high-income consumers falls by about 3 billion dollars uh nearly a forty percent reduction and then since that point you have a gradual recovery such that if you look at data as of uh a few weeks ago you're down about three quarters of a billion dollars about 10 relative to baseline now let's compare that to what happens to people in the bottom income quartile so for these folks you see that spending falls by about a billion dollars per day uh also a substantial drop but considerably less than what you saw for folks for higher income uh households both in percentage terms and particularly in dollar terms and then moreover if you look at what has happened over time you see that there's a more rapid recovery in terms of spending for lower income households and by the time you're in something like late may or june you're essentially back to baseline levels so the first key fact that you see and this is mirrored and what you see in the internal jpmorgan chase data for instance is that much of the spending reduction in absolute terms has been driven by a reduction in spending by high income rather than low-income households second key point uh is that most of that reduction in spending if you look at where it's occurring it's occurring in categories that you might think of as in-person services so things like hotels and food or recreational activities things that you have to go out of your house to consume as opposed to things like durable goods which as you all probably know are traditionally the things that fall a lot more in recessions um and so you know if you look uh at what this looks like in terms of changes in spending especially relative to the share of pre-covered spending you find that the reduction in spending is particularly concentrated in in-person services relative to the initial shares so these kinds of categories accounted for only a third of spending initially but they account for two-thirds of the decline so why is this useful to note i think it illustrates that the reduction in spending is driven primarily by health concerns among the rich rather rather than a reduction in purchasing power or the fall in the stock market or things like that because the nature of the reduction is very concentrated in things that might lead to an exposure to covet infection as opposed to what you might expect more broadly if people are feeling less wealthy so what i want to do next is show you how this reduction in spending by the rich in particular on in-person services then cascades through the economy to affect economic activity in various ways so let's now look at what happens to businesses as they have this fall in consumer demand and i'm going to exploit the fact that consumer demand fell particularly among high income folks for things that they consume in person right and where do you tend to consume things in person it's around your house locally around where you live and so it turns out to be very useful to disaggregate these data geographically now looking at changes in small business revenues by zip code and i'm going to give you a couple of examples that illustrate the key result and then generalize so let's look at the data by zip code here in new york city and what we're plotting here are changes in small business revenue from january to april and what you can see is the map is colored such that the dark red colors represent areas where businesses located in those places lost more revenue and blue green colors represent areas where they lost less revenue you can see that in the most affluent parts parts of new york the upper east side for example businesses are losing 65 70 percent of their revenues whereas if you go up to the bronx or you go to queens go to parts of new jersey newark and so forth you're seeing numbers more like 20 25 and that makes a lot of sense in light of the result that i just talked about on the consumer spending side high income folks are cutting back on the amount they're spending and that's affecting business revenues particularly in affluent areas you see the same sort of pattern in san francisco look at the most affluent parts of san francisco like pacific heights for example massive reductions in small business revenue there you look at berkeley for example but if you look at the less affluent areas like alameda or the east bay much much smaller reductions in revenue so uh you know generalizing upon this if you look across the united states at more affluent zip codes places with higher monthly rents for example you see significantly larger losses in small business revenue in those areas precisely because that's where consumer demand fell the most so the next piece if you kind of think about dominoes falling in in the economy what i want to turn to next is how that then ends up affecting employment patterns in the u.s turning to the payroll data and so i'm going to start by showing you the aggregate picture again disaggregating by income level and then turn to the spatial variation to understand what's going on and so uh what you can see here first is we're plotting data on the total number of people employed by wage quartile so just to be clear on the way we're constructing this we're dividing uh people into four wage groups based on initial wage quartiles and we're asking essentially how many jobs are there in the top wage quartile versus the bottom wage quartile week by week and what you can see here is i think two interesting things first there's a much sharper reduction in terms of employment for people at the bottom of the wage distribution than the top of the wage distribution so if you look at the trough around april 15th about a 30 reduction in employment for people in the bottom wage quartile compared with 10 at the in the top wage quartile and then you know we've heard a lot in the media about a possibility of a v-shaped procession well you do in fact see a v-shaped recession but only for people in the top wage quartile where you're basically back to baseline employment levels within about six weeks of the trough um and you stay around there whereas for people in the bottom wage quartile um you have uh less of a recovery still a substantial recovery but a recovery that has uh is only 50 of the way back to where you were in terms of job losses and then seems to have essentially slowed since that point based on time sheet data that we can use to predict employment patterns in more recent weeks so that's the aggregate picture let me now show you how that plays out spatially in connection to the sequence of shots that i described so if we now zoom in on employment of low wage workers which is where the action really is as i just showed you on the previous plot just look at the data again for the bay area you see a map that looks almost exactly what i showed you on the business revenue side workers who happen to work in say a restaurant in the affluent parts of san francisco are nearly 70 percent have lost their jobs whereas if you happen to work at a similar place you know over here in san leandro there's a 20 chance that you lost your job so it matters tremendously where you're working because of the sequence of shocks uh that i was describing so one final point on this again you see this more broadly uh across the united states higher rent areas tend to have uh bigger losses and employment furthermore this is also true in terms of hiring going forward so of course what matters in terms of economic recovery is not just who's gotten laid off but what the vacancies look like going forward and so if you look at the job posting data you see a very similar pattern where job postings are much lower in the higher rent areas than the lower end areas which i think does not vote well in terms of prospects for recovery in those places at least in the time being it looks like there's going to be sustained job loss for some time so motivated by those set of diagnostic results and jim if i could could i just check on the time i'm not able to see the time here do we have a few more minutes yeah i would say take about another five minutes it'd be great great perfect so in the last five minutes um uh let me now pivot from that sort of diagnostic analysis with these data and show you you know naturally the question is what can we do to try to mitigate those employment losses and try to uh restore economic activity as best we can going forward and so the way i'm going to approach that is again using these publicly available statistics that we've constructed to evaluate the impacts of three sets of policies that have been implemented at the state level and the federal level so the first thing i'm going to talk about are state ordered reopenings so uh you know there's lots of discussion of basically can you have executive orders that either shut down or restart economic activity and so what we're going to do is use these data which we can look at you know across every state and basically compare trends across states that opened versus closed at different times and i'm just going to show you one case study that summarizes the key result here we're comparing new mexico and colorado that both closed around a similar time but colorado began reopening about two weeks before new mexico did and the key thing to take away here is if you look at spending patterns or if i were to show you employment or any number of other statistics they basically trend identically in these two places you know if you pool dozens of different states you start to see you know maybe a one percentage point impact or something like that but there's hardly any impact of these policies in the grand scheme of things and the reason for that i think is quite intuitive which is as i was saying earlier the fundamental driver of the reduction in economic activity i think is a reduction in spending primarily by high-income households who have the capacity to self-isolate work remotely et cetera and i don't think it's fundamentally restrictions on economic activity that are driving what's going on until you restore consumer confidence i don't think an executive order to reopen the state is really going to do that much second major policy stimulus payments so as you know as part of the cares act uh about 160 million households received typically 1200 dollar checks per individual exactly on april 15th if you look at direct deposit data so what did the stimulus work in restoring consumer spending and then restoring economic activity here we can rely on the fact that we have daily data on spending and can again examine in a very fine way what happened right when those stimulus checks were sent out on april 15th and what you can see is if you look at spending for people in the bottom income quartile shown in the blue here there's almost immediately if you compare april uh you know 20th versus april 14th a 20 percentage point jump in spending when the stimulus checks went out uh a smaller jump for higher income households as to be expected given they have a lower marginal propensity to consume and get less stimulus to begin with so at a surface level it looks like the stimulus really works in terms of getting people to spend more but let's dig a bit more deeply into this so what we can do now is look at the data literally day by day the plots that i was showing you before were smoothed moving weekly averages now i'm literally going to date plot the data day by day and what you can see is if you look at april 12th or 13th versus april 16th there's a 25 percentage point jump in spending for households in the bottom quartile so again confirming that there's that huge immediate impact of the stimulus on consumer spending but if you now ask where was that money spent you seen most of that money was spent on durable goods which remember was not the area where spending fell to begin with and very little of it was spent on in-person services which is where a huge part of the cut came to begin with when the covet shock hit so why does this matter if you think about how macroeconomic stimulus would ideally work from a keynesian perspective uh what we're hoping is that consumers spend the money at the businesses that lost the most revenues that then who then use that money to hire back workers and then you have this kind of virtuous cycle that emerges in the economy if instead consumers are taking that money and spending it on online retail like amazon and walmart who a either use you know more capital than labor or b are relying more on imports uh the impacts of the stimulus in terms of the multiplier effect could be greatly diminished and so our sense from these types of data is you know there's less of a capacity for the stimulus to really have an impact on employment because of these reasons last policy i want to talk about loans to small businesses so the another major aspect of the cares act was 500 billion of loans to small businesses through the paycheck protection program for givable loans if you maintain payroll at a high enough level so did that work so we can again use the payroll data to assess that in a very simple way relying on the fact that small businesses for the purposes of the ppp were defined as firms with fewer than 500 employees and so we're just going to do a simple comparison of trends in employment for firms with fewer than 500 employees versus more than 500 employees and what you can see here is that before the ppp program began those two firms were having relatively similar trends in employment after the ppp was implemented firms with fewer than 500 employees have slightly more employment growth than firms with few with that with more than 500 employees that are ineligible for ppp the control group so to speak but that effect is not all that large and so you know if you estimate what the impact is it's about a two percentage point increase in employment as a result of the ppp program which is not trivial but when you recognize that we spent 500 billion dollars on the program it translates to a cost for jobs saved of about 300 000 and the reason for this is the vast majority of the ppp payments are going to firms that would have maintained their payroll anyway uh and as a result the marginal impact doesn't look like it's all that large which i think would have been really useful to know to potentially retarget the program differently if we could have seen this evidence you know within three weeks of implementing the program so let me show one final uh chart and then conclude so we have some time for for questions so naturally you know i think in a crisis like this we're very focused on short-run impacts how can we restore employment and so forth but i think it's also important to keep our eye on potential longer-term impacts and especially given our group's interest in long-term issues of inequality and social mobility we were interested in understanding what's happening to kids in this crisis in terms of educational progress and so this is data from a platform called zern which about one million kids in the us use as part of their regular school curriculum to learn math and this is showing you the number of math lessons that kids completed for kids in high-income households versus low-income households and you can see that when schools went remote in mid-march for high-income households there was a little bit of a drop and then pretty rapid recovery in terms of progress and that for low income households though there was a 60 reduction in terms of um learning that is persistent and that of course i think is very worrying in terms of uh what implications this has for the long run so to conclude you know i've already mentioned this so i'll be very brief you know i think there's limited capacity to restore consumer spending via traditional economic tools in the midst of a pandemic i think the fundamental issue here is addressing the public health uh concerns in the meantime i think focusing on things like shoring up the social safety net thinking about how you mitigate hardship for the workers who've lost their jobs i think is where uh we ought to be concentrating and then just coming back to the theme of this conversation and some of the issues that catherine raised in her presentation i just want to end by talking about where we're hoping to go with this you know diana talked about the need for a centralized warehouse to kind of collect all of this information i absolutely agree with that sentiment i don't think it should be one research group like ours that's happening to to put this together and when a crisis hits what i want to do is see if you could do this on a small scale as a prototype and now we've connected with the leaders of the ls ba and census the major statistical agencies of the us and we're starting a project to construct a more permanent system of granular real-time national accounts building on what we've done here i also want to emphasize that everything that i showed you in the previous few slides is constructed purely off of public data so to bill's question uh none of this is using internal confidential data it's all data that can be freely downloaded from a website that we've set up tracktherecovery.org that also has an interactive data visualization platform that you all can can use yourselves and then going forward we're also talking with many policymakers about how these data can be used at a state and federal level to try to fine-tune uh policies going forward so let me stop there
