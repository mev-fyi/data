thank you for uh including our paper uh in this uh web series uh this paper is joint work with andrew cuomo and jaden patel at mit uh my colleague pathak and emmut kuanwa from bc and what we're doing in this paper is to think about how prioritization policies and mitigation policies for uh covet vaccines uh interact with each other so these two things uh have been thought about relatively independently and this paper we're going to think about how we should think about uh jointly designing privatization policies of the vaccination with the mitigation uh policy that have been used so far so as we all know vaccination is a key to our goal of reaching herd immunity and to safely lift the social distancing masking and remote working restrictions that we have endured for the past year while the first vaccinations were given in mid-december it is expected to take a total of eight months to vaccinate everybody eligible in the united states who's willing to take a vaccine the current goal of the biden administration is to have everyone eligible to for a vaccine and is willing to take one by july 4th and this space is relatively slow because of two reasons first there is limited supply of vaccines but more importantly even if you have the vaccine doses themselves available the task of taking the vaccine and putting into someone's arm is quite onerous and poses a number of logistical challenges that have uh that have been uh a problem for a while uh it's finally starting to ease up but there's no hope of really making it to the finish line before before end of june at the same time in march of last year many states adopted phased approaches to reopening whereby restrictions on uh workplaces uh intensity in workplaces social distancing requirements masking measures uh the types of businesses that will allow to open restaurants indoor stadiums etc have been calibrated to the public health measures such as the new case load the number of debts uh the use of hospital beds for severe covert patients um and there's a constant economic pressure to lift these mitigation measures to the extent possible without creating a public health disaster because there's a huge both economic and psychological tool of abiding by these stringent mitigation measures while these two things have been largely thought about independently there's a significant interaction between how we decide who should get the vaccine first and the types of mitigation measures that we need to uh adopt so in this paper we're going to think about the interaction between these two aspects of uh covet policy so i'm going to go through how we have been thinking about both vaccine prioritization and mitigation measures before think before describing our evaluation approach and describing our results so the vaccine prioritization guidelines have been based on recommendations from the national academy of sciences engineering and medicine and as well as cdc's um uh advisory committee on immunization practices uh these these guidelines have thought about not only saving lives or life years but also a number of other issues such as reciprocity uh and equity reciprocity for essential workers and healthcare workers who have been uh who have been working tirelessly and putting uh putting their lives at risk throughout the pandemic and equity uh in order to address health healthcare disparities in the impact of covet across uh socio-economic and and ethnic and racial lines so in these in these recommendations uh there was a phased approach whereby in the early phases phases one and two which included a minority of the population uh we we vaccinated high-risk people extremely high-risk people with significant co-morbidities people in nursing homes and the very elderly as well as some essential workers such as school workers health care workers and grocery store workers the country is now moving towards phases three and four whereby the general population is starting to get vaccinations we're not yet at the young adult stage for every state but some states have opened the vaccination to the general population okay while these guidelines have been used as a basis of allocation there's a significant variation across the country in um in how these these policies are adopted and the adherence to these specific policies for example uh in several states such as connecticut and maine relatively fine age-based prioritization is being used connecticut for example is right now vaccinating those above the age of 45 whereas in alaska we've already opened up vaccination to the entire adult population now there's also significant differences across states in how which comorbidities are prioritized how they're prioritized and the occupations that are prioritized for example massachusetts higher education workers are not prioritized whereas in other states like california they are so the second thing that we have been doing in addition to these vaccine prioritization guidelines is thinking about mitigation measures here's a diagram of massachusetts uh phased reopening approach which was adopted in early march of last year in mid-march of last year we started off with sig with strong state-home orders that were gradually relaxed when the cases started falling in massachusetts over the summer and at some point we we got to phase three then during the second wave in late fall early winter because of worsening public health measures we reverted back to more cautious approaches okay so these guidelines look at new case loads debts hospital bed counts that are being used for covert patients to try and calibrate the extent of social distancing masking uh reduction in density measures that are required so in many cases restaurants will close down uh in some cities whereas other cities um restaurants will allow to open density density in workplaces was also regulated very tightly by the states okay so what we're going to do is we're going to think about the interaction between these two sets of policies in the in the disease dynamics for covert 19. and we will do that using what is now the workhorse model for thinking about for simulating the effects the prospective effects of various policies uh uh for covet 19. this is the seir model it's uh it's its letter stand for the various states an individual could be in and an individual could either be susceptible uh in which case which is an individual who hasn't previously had covet and is no has no immunity exposed which is an individual who just came into contact with an infectious person and is likely to develop the disease relatively soon an infectious person who after the first three or four days after exposure has the ability to potentially expose new individuals and exposure happens for susceptible people when they come into contact with an infectious person after an infectious period the individual's case either gets gets resolved either through recovery full recovery or uh the the person passes away okay now uh the way vaccination helps is by moving people from the susceptible state uh to the uh to the vaccinated state and for simplicity uh let's imagine that vaccinated individuals cannot be uh ever exposed although in the paper itself we uh calibrate the uh probability the efficacy of the vaccine to the clinical trial data that has been made available uh we're also going to assume that the vaccine is transmission blocking so that an individual who's vaccinated because they cannot get exposed and cannot get infectious uh are can never never expose another individual now there is there is some limited evidence that suggests that asymptomatic infections is also reduced if you're vaccinated although the jury is out there whether somebody who is vaccinated can ever get an infectious or not in the paper we will assume that for simplicity we'll assume that the vaccine is transmission blocking okay we will take this model and we will use an age stratified version of this model in which the infection fatality rate which is the probability that infectious person dies is age group specific in 10 year bins in addition the contact rates between susceptible and infectious individuals will also be age pair specific so older people or younger people might have different contact rates uh with other people in general and also may have different contact rates with people of different age groups okay now the role of mitigation can be introduced into this model by reducing contact rates so think about masking social distancing and other types of medication measures as simply reducing the number of dangerous contacts that uh that can occur between infectious and susceptible people and so what we're going to do is we're going to simulate the dynamics of this model and think about the various vaccination policies and the mitigation policy so here is um here's a look at the contact rates and the infection fatality rate in our eighth stratified model a model has eight age bins in 10-year groups and the last group 80 plus is in one single bin but i've aggregated these to 0-20 29 32 59 and 16 above on the left side i'm showing you the daily contact rates this is the number of contacts per day that are expected to be infectious from survey data uh and and this is pre pre-pandemic contact rates okay so as you can see the elderly have the lowest contact rates overall but the elderly individuals those above 60 plus are more likely to interact with people above the age of 60 than individuals below the age of 30. similarly individuals below the age of 30 are more likely to have other social or workplace contacts with other individuals of the age less than 30 but fewer contacts with older individuals and in each age group you see that there's more contact within the age group than across age groups but the age the contact rate is declining overall with age okay uh in this picture i've also shown you the ifr which is the infection fatality rate which is the percent chance that somebody in that age group uh is going to die from covet once they contract the disease amongst the age group of 0-29 the ifr is 0.005 percent so that is a very unlikely outcome that somebody with in that age group is going to get uh a severe case of covariating therefore and then after that pass away from covert above the age of 60 uh the ifr is almost five percent so there's a five percent chance for the elderly of dying from kovitch should they get it okay so now let's think about how you might decide to prioritize individuals from these different age groups if you wanted to minimize deaths and there are two different forces at play here first there is a steep ifr age gradient uh based on meta-analysis that have been done by others and this steep ifr age gradient pushes you towards vaccinating the elderly because they have the highest risk of passing away if they get covered id okay but assuming a transmission blocking vaccine there is another force at delay uh the contact rates amongst the young are also the highest so if you're a young person and the vaccine is transmission blocking then giving a young person giving this young person a vaccine creates a positive externality in others because it limits the spread of um of the virus and therefore indirectly also can protect the elderly okay so these two forces result in broadly two types of protection and vaccination prioritization strategies which are either protection strategies or containment strategies a continuing strategy is to limit the spread of the disease by vaccinating the spreaders these are the young in this model okay a protection strategy is to give up on limiting the spread of the disease but protecting those who are the most vulnerable okay and so these two forces together will determine which strategy is optimal now what we did was estimate whether which of these trap what is the optimal or the death minimizing strategy uh prioritization strategy under two scenarios uh the first is a mitigation scenario in which the measures are held constant throughout the vaccine rollout so we call this sustained mitigation these keeps restriction fixed at the levels of mitigation that we saw in december and early january throughout the vaccine rollout all the way through june july the second is a calibrated mitigation strategy which eases restrictions as the case cases fall in order to try to minimize the economic harm while maintaining maintaining maintaining reasonably good public health outcomes so in the case of cobit 19 it turns out that age-based prioritization which is a protection strategy is robustly optimal irrespective of whether we follow a sustained mitigation strategy or a calibrated mitigation strategy the way you can see this is uh in the black lines in the figure on the left the black lines are the optimal or the or the depth minimizing strategy and the horizontal axis gives you the number of days since the initial nations began on december 14th uh 2020. you can see that we get to we get to first the optimal strategy here is to first vaccinate the elderly their vaccination rates steeply climb before they plateau out they plateau out because there is some vaccine hesitancy which we calibrate based on surveys from the u.s census bureau after the elderly are prioritized our model says that irrespective of whether we use sustained mitigation or calibrate mitigation ages 30 to 59 should get vaccinated you can see this by around 8 6 around day 60 we start seeing some vaccination for that middle age group and once enough people from that middle age group have been vaccinated the model recommends vaccinating individuals below the age of 30. now that level is uh relatively low because right now the authorizations for the vaccines only extend to individuals who are above the age of 16. so only about half of the individuals in the lowest age group are even eligible for the vaccination okay now this optimal strategy differs from two benchmarks in the paper the first benchmark is a random prioritization which is none so uh no prioritization which is none which is given in the blue lines this vaccinates people in proportion to the population you can see that uh the black line the black lines heavily lean on age on the age gradient as opposed to the blue lines the third lines in these figures are the red lines which are the nasim the national academy sciences of engineering and medicine's recommended prioritization schedule so in order to simulate this we took data from the american community survey which has detailed information occupation as well as age uh household age structure to simulate who would get uh the various doses of the vaccines if he strictly followed the nasim guidelines the nascent guidelines does prioritize age you can see that in the top two panels uh the red line is above the blue line uh but it is not close to the black line so it does not prioritize age as much as what the uh depth minimizing strategy would recommend okay so it turns out that this protection strategy of uh of prioritizing the most elderly is death minimizing because of two reasons in covet first is that the case counts that when vaccinations began uh were extremely high in december on december 14th we had just come out of the thanksgiving holidays and we had a significant surge once case counts are high it becomes quite difficult for vaccination pace to keep up with the spread of the disease and you have to engage in a in a protection strategy the second factor is that the as i showed you earlier the ifr age gradient is rather steep so people above the age of 60 have a several factor higher probability of death from covet than people who are under the age of 60 or people under the age of 30. and that pushes very strongly towards uh vaccinating the uh the elderly if you are to minimize that okay but uh the takeaway from the slide is that relative to nasan uh the the uh sorry relative nation the debt minimizing strategy uh prioritizes age more finely and more heavily now what would happen under these two mitigation scenarios if you were able to follow the age based prioritization strategy and how does that compare with the other two prioritization scenarios that i that i discussed with you on the top graph we have the predicted path of new cases of covid under the two mitigation scenarios if you get mitigation fixed at the december levels our model predicts that there'll be a slight increase in cases but then there would be a quick decline afterwards as vaccination catches up and we start reading reaching herd immunity notice that cases decline even before herd immunity is reached the herd immunity lines thresholds are given in these dashed lines these dash vertical lines and the prediction of the model is that her diminuti dash her immunity is was about five to six months away uh under if 30 million people could get vaccinated per month okay if we raise mitigation measures gradually as case counts fall which is the calibrated mitigation strategy then case counts don't fall for a long time before finally we attain herd immunity and cases case can't start falling this is because as as we raise mitigation measures while uh case counts are falling we end up cancelling out the effect of uh vaccination by by reducing social distancing or masking measures on the bottom two graphs i'm showing you the cumulative mortality per hundred thousand under these three uh prioritization scenarios uh the age based prioritization scenario which is in black the no prioritization scenario which is in blue and the uh nascent recommended guidelines um by construction the age-based uh the age-based prioritization scenario the optimal prioritization scenario is going to reduce debts the most it's going to result in the lowest cumulative mortality per hundred thousand but what is remarkable is that uh the gap between the black and the blue lines is significantly higher on the right side with calibrated mitigation as opposed to sustained mitigation so if we end up raising mitigation measures or lifting restrictions as case counts fall then we will end up undoing some of the benefits of the vaccination campaign by uh by by allowing the disease to spread uh to the elderly in particular to the elderly okay uh in fact at this point death any deaths delayed by through mitigation measures are essentially live saved because vaccinations are not that far away a second remarkable point in this graph is that the black lines on the left side and the right side in the bottom panel which show you the cumulative mortality per hundred thousand uh in the age-based prioritization scenario are quite close to each other what this is saying is that if you follow an age-based prioritization scenario uh prioritization policy then even if he raised mitigation measures as opposed to sustaining it through to the end of june uh the change in the number of deaths the cumulative mortality would not be that high this is because the protection strategy is taking in we are protecting the elderly and through vaccinations as opposed to through mitigation measures and that allows us to raise mitigation measures while not affecting uh total death counts as much so in summary mortality is higher if either the elderly are not prioritized or if mitigation memories is eased but abandoning both prioritization and easing restrictions leads to uh significantly high debts okay now in in these figures we've also in this paper we've also looked at differences in speed across uh various um uh various scenarios and the differences in speed have a relatively modest effect on total mortality as opposed to either mitigation measures or appropriate prioritization so in this paper we showed that fine age-based prioritization even in the current phases in the general phases uh such as the the approaches that is being taken by is that is being taken in connecticut might uh have value in reducing debts um and easing mitigation during this period uh is likely to increase debts even though many people are getting vaccinated and this is especially true in states and areas where age-based prioritization is not being followed and most of the elderly are not yet vaccinated these are these are some simulations which have uh which come along with some caveats some of them are listed here first of all we are using a age-based approach to stratify the model and there's obviously some finer heterogeneity in contact rates contact rates might vary by socio-economic status by occupation by where you live et cetera and there might be heterogeneity within age groups in the risk of death from covet because of comorbidities and these factors can can affect and can be good rationales for the types of prioritization strategies that have been recommended by nasa for example where comorbidities and occupation have been considered new variants are also on the rise and these variants can influence vaccine has efficacy but our guess is that these variants if the vaccine is effective at all are more likely to push us towards age-based prioritization third vaccine hesitancy is becoming an issue these days and the presence of vaccine efficacy is more likely to push us towards emphasizing mitigation approaches and finally there's a question mark around whether vaccinated individuals can transmit the virus in our model we assume that the vaccine is transmission blocking this is consistent with evidence recent evidence particularly from israel that shows that the vaccine does reduce asymptomatic infections but it is not definitive about whether the vaccine does reduce the transmission of the virus so despite these unknowns we believe that thinking jointly about mitigation approaches and vaccine prioritization is valuable in shaping the policy discussion uh in the current place thank you very much done
