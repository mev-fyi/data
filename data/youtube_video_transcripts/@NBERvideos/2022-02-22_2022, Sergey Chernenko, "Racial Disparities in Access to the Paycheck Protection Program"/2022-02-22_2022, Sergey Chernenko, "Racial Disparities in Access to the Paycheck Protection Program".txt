um well this is joint work with david sharpton at harvard business school and in this research we're interested in documenting racial disparities in the paycheck protection program and exploring and quantifying the sources of these potential racial disparities in terms of differences in firm location uh characteristics existing borrowing relationships with bank and non-bank lenders and potential in terms of racial bias now a key empirical challenge in answering these questions is lack of data on eligible private firms including their characteristics and the racial and ethnic identity of their owners so our proposed solution in this research is to study the take up of ppp loans by florida restaurants which we think provide a really great setting for studying these questions because of a unique combination of interesting data and so first from um thanks to state level restaurant license data we have a well-defined population of eligible firms that should have been eligible for ppp we can link these data to corporate records to figure out the owner's name which we can then link to voter registration which in florida includes self-identified racial and hispanic identity and we can also link restaurants in our data to yelp for a wide range of kind of firm level characteristics such as the number of reviews the average rating whether the restaurant has takeout whether it accepts credit cards how many people visited the website etc and so this figure then reports the results of our main regression analysis essentially looking at the probability that a restaurant receives a ppp loan okay and these are adjusted probabilities compared to restaurants owned by white males so the bars represent the adjusted probabilities the lines here report the 95 confidence intervals okay so if we start with the blue bars they represent the analysis that doesn't control for any other characteristics except for racial and ethnic identity and so what we see is that black owned restaurants are 25 percentage points less likely to receive ppp loans compared to restaurants owned by white males so if a white owned restaurant is a has about 75 probability of receiving a ppp loan a black owned restaurant has only 50 probability of receiving a ppp loan uh the red bars adjust for location and so here in the red bars we're comparing restaurants that are located within the same zip code and so what we see is that part of the disparity is due to where minority minority-owned restaurants are located in particular in the paper we show that they tend to be located in areas with fewer bank branches per capita lower income and firms in those types of zip codes on average regardless of race tend to uh have a lower probability of receiving ppp loans so comparing within zip code black owned restaurants in particular are 20 percentage points less likely to receive pvp loans compared to white owned restaurants the green bars then include our full set of controls from yelp including farm age number of seeds whether the restaurant has existing borrowing relationships with bank and non-bank lenders a number of reviews average review etc and what we see is that even when we control for all of these differences observable differences between minority and white owned restaurants black owned restaurants are still 10 percentage points less likely to receive ppp loans compared to white owned restaurants we see a similar pattern but smaller magnitudes for hispanic-owned restaurants and for asian-owned restaurants they're essentially as likely as white-owned restaurants to receive ppp loans now we think of our regression specifications that adjust for this white set of um wide range of control firm level controls um so the remaining residual the 10 differential for black owned restaurants we think of this as most likely driven by the effects of racial bias and this can either work through discrimination in the application process itself and there are some audit studies that speak to this but it could also be that historical discrimination has discouraged some minority-owned restaurants from applying for ppp in the first place now one piece of evidence for the role of racial bias is the substitution from bank to non-bank lenders so at bing's the application process is likely to involve more personal interaction creating more scope for racial bias to affect the outcome and so what we see is that minority-owned restaurants are significantly less likely to receive their loans from banks these are the blue bars so black owned restaurants in particular are uh 16 percent less likely to receive pbp loan through a bank uh but black and asian owned restaurants are six and a half and seven and a half percentage points more likely to receive their ppp loans from a non-bank lender where the application process uh is likely to be automated to be online to less likely to involve personal interaction and so less scope for racial bias to affect the outcome there okay and for asian-owned restaurants we see that this the substitution to non-bank lenders essentially completely offsets their lower probability of getting ppp loans from banks but for black owned restaurants the substitution is not enough so that as we saw black owned restaurants are 10 percentage points less likely to receive bpp loans overall for hispanic-owned restaurants there doesn't seem to be any substitution to non-banks so that their overall lower probability of getting ppp loans is driven by the fact that they're less likely to get ppp loans from banks now to more directly get at the role of racial bias we look in the cross-section of counties in florida and measure county level bias as the average of implicit bias among white test takers who take this online test offered by project implicit called race implicit association test so for all respond respondents in a county we calculate the average response across them and the figures here report the results from our analysis um where uh in the left panel we look at counties with kind of like average level of racial bias and in the panel on the right we look at counties with greater racial bias so specifically counties that are one standard deviation above the mean of this measure of implicit racial bias and so what we see is that in these counties with greater racial bias black owned restaurants are 32 percentage points less likely to get ppp loans from banks we also see more substitution to non-banks than in a kind of county with average level of racial bias now one concern that one might have about the results in their interpretation is that perhaps despite our efforts to control for observable differences between minority and white-owned restaurants there are still some unobservable differences between them in particular in terms of awareness of ppp and potentially demand for emergency support so as an example there's a federal reserve survey that shows that among black owned restaurants that didn't receive ppp a higher fraction of them report that they were not aware of ppp so to try to get at this we look at the subsample of restaurants that received an idol advance grant so these grants were given directly by the small business administration as part of its existing economic injury disaster loan program or idle and so firms that received these idol advance grand grants they showed clear awareness of and demand for emergency support at the same time the idle advance grants were relatively small compared to the size of the forgivable ppp loans and so what we see is that the vast majority of restaurants in our data that received an idol advance grant also received ppp and so we can ask whether within this sub-sample of restaurants that showed awareness of and demand for emergency support uh minority-owned restaurants whether they were less likely to receive uh ppp and one further advantage of looking at idle advanced recipients is that based on the size of the idle advanced grant we can actually back out the number of employees and we add that as a control in our regression so that we're comparing restaurants within the same zip code with the same number of employees same characteristics and asking whether minority owned restaurants are less likely to get bpp and in fact we find very similar results to our full sample so with looking within the zip code and controlling for all of these form characteristics black owned restaurants are 16 percentage points less likely to get ppp uh compared to white owned restaurants one further advantage of actually looking at idle advanced recipients is that we can expand our analysis to all industries and not just be limited to uh restaurants where we kind of have the full population of eligible firms so we can look at all idol advance recipients in florida that we can match to corporate records and voter registration to get their racial and ethnic identity again similar to the analysis on the previous slide we can ask whether in this sample of firms in showing clear awareness and demand for emergency support whether minority-owned restaurants are less likely to get ppp and we in fact find that this is the case looking even within the same industry and the same zip code and controlling for a number of employees sales firm age existing borrowing relationships uh black and hispanic-owned restaurants are nine and seven percentage points uh less likely to get ppp loans compared to why iphone restaurants and in the paper we also showed that similar to the analysis for restaurants uh these results are stronger in counties with greater racial bias okay so overall in this research we document large disparities in the take-up of ppp loans uh we showed that black owned restaurants are 25 percentage points less likely to receive ppp loans compared to white owned restaurants uh location and firm characteristics including borrowing relationships explain about sixty percent of the overall disparity uh with the remaining disparity likely to be due to uh racial bias i'm sure that the results are unlikely to be due to differences in awareness or demand for emergency support and that they likely apply to a broad range of industries and so we hope that the results of our research help inform the design of any future similar emergency support programs thank you very much for watching
