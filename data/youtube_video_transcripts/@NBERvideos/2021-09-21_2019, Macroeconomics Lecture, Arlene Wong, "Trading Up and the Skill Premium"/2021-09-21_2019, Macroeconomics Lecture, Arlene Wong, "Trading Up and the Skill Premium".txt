so this paper is motivated by the rise in inequality which we've been talking about also in the previous paper it's motivated a lot of different policy proposals aimed at trying to narrow that gap between rich and poor ranging from making taxes more progressive wealth taxes subsidizing college tuition for low-income households and so forth and so to evaluate these types of policies along with other ones it's really useful to understand the dynamics first of income inequality so one natural question for that is are there forces that may narrow the gap between the rich and the poor and so one such force there are many others but one such force is the potential rise in the supply of skilled workers which through a canonical model would be a force that would lower the skill premium and potentially inequality and what we're going to argue in this paper that that such force is potentially weaker than like we might have expected because when people become more educated and become more skilled and they actually also change the composition of what they're consuming and that compositional change is going to affect the firm's supply of different types of skills so specifically what we're going to be talking about is what we call trading up so the idea is that when you have a rise in the level of income people demand more high quality goods and this high quality goods leads to a rise in the skill premium the reason for that is we're going to show to produce these types of high quality goods or services you actually need more skilled labor and so as households increase the quality of consumption this raises the demand for skilled labor and thereby contributes towards the rising skill premium now that kind of quality upgrading can actually be quite big so greg talked a little bit about it already but bills and cleaner for example estimate angle curves and they estimate that each year um it potentially would have risen by 3.8 percent at least since 1980 where the sample begins so what we're going to do in this paper um is first to empirically show that it is the case people want more quality as they become wealthier and that these high quality goods are more skill intensive we then propose a model that's consistent with these two facts so that we can use it on the understand the skill premium for the lens of the model what we're going to see is that actually any type of shock that increases the level of the income is also going to increase the demand for skill and then that endogenously leads to a rising skill premium so one implication of that is to is that we don't need as much skill bias technical change as we might have thought to explain the 25 rising skill premium that we've seen since 1970 so one thing that we do in this paper is to try to quantify and get a sensor for the past rise in the skill premium how much of it was due to skill bias technical change versus other things so what we do in this paper is feed in finales estimates for tfp and then feed in the quality change that's estimated by bills and cleaner and then ask through this model how much skill bias technical change do we need to justify that rising skill premium and this lens of the model suggests we need about one percent each year which is orders or manages less than what we see in the canonical model that doesn't have quality choice that actually requires about five times as much okay so we relate to very big literature on skill premium and what we're going to do is focus more on the structural change interpretations how we're going to differ from the papers in the literature is the literature is focused on a cross-sector shift so i spend less on food and relatively more on health care and services as i become richer we're going to be looking more at within the sector and one reason why it's actually important to think about within sector is because there are work that suggests a lot of the rise in income inequality is between firm within uh within sector inequality so we're going to be able to speak a bit more to those sorts of trends okay so the first thing we do in this paper is we want to think of a way to measure quality which is not directly observable now there are different ways one can approach this the first way is to proxy quality by relative prices of items within a category alternative ways would be to take a more structural estimation with utility functions combined with transaction on prices and quantity and back out what quality would be you could also combine in the third approach information on costs of materials two and three generally require stronger assumptions and more information and so typically those papers focus on more narrow subset of sectors we're going to go with the first one and we think it makes sense for two reasons first of all there's actually strong evidence it's pretty correlated with two and three and what it's going to buy us is we're going to actually be able to speak to many sectors services durables and non-durables to show this is a trend across all of them so the first thing we do is to show that as you become welfare you do consume higher quality goods this is well known um it's well established in the literature which has estimated quality and goal curse we're going to just show you a little bit with corroborating evidence based on our relative price measure you also see that's the case so you use the nielsen home scan data on groceries we looked at cex for durables and then we also looked at yelp data which covers a lot of different services i'm just going to show you the cex data and then just tell you it looks um you get similar sorts of trends that you see in the other sectors as well okay so the cex data what we did was we looked at the logo price this household pays for this type of good um at time t regressed on indicated variables for the income quintile plus a range of different demographic controls um that's been plotted here on the table so what we see is that as people increase in their income they're buying types of goods that are more expensive higher in quality on average the top income quintile buys goods that are about 80 percent more expensive than what the bottom quintile is spending now this is quite large but it's also not surprising because for durable goods and we're talking about things like sofas mattresses refrigerators most of the increased income there goes towards quality rather than buying more quantity so i think this makes a lot of sense now i've just showed you durables but in the paper we also show it for services and non-durables the second thing we show is that well the types of firms that produce these higher quality goods actually employ more skilled labor so this is more new so how we actually show this is we merge onto the micro data for occupation employment statistics from the bls emerge on the nielsen information as well as the yelp information for relative prices and then we use the information here that has occupations wagers and workers for each of the workers we classify them as high skill if their wage is above the average wage of college graduates in that industry the paper we consider a range of other classifications i think this makes sense so types of industries that have a lot of high-skilled workers include the finance management consulting industry and ones that don't have as much include hoteling and accommodation just to give you one more example so that it's a little bit clear in your mind what types of skills and occupations we're thinking about through this data set here's the restaurant industry so what we're going to see is when i look at within a sector and varying the type of quality of the firm do they employ more high skill labor so for the restaurant industry if we look at the types of occupations that this data actually has these are the ones that make up most of employment managers executives chefs first line food prep workers waitresses marketing and sales what's in blue is what's generally classified as high skill and so what we can see is that for example if we vary by quality and just take one of them chefs which are generally classified as high skilled requires training if we go from limited service restaurants such as mcdonald's they only account for about two percent of all workers we go to full service restaurants it's about 20 of all workers and if you go to a very nice restaurant called a linear in chicago it makes up almost one third of all of their workers so you see here that they're actually employing more high skilled workers now what's interesting is it's not all just in marketing sales what's what we actually see is that as you increase the quality of what's being produced there's more layers and hierarchy of different types of high skill workers so you think there's something involved here where you transform the product to a high quality good so what does the data look like so this is just grouping it by what we the different quality measures low middle and high the one on the left is based on yelps and mostly services the one on the right is based on mojo on nielsen so this is going to look at food manufacturing so what you see here is that as you increase quality you increase the share of high skilled workers it's about 1.5 to 2.6 times higher and this is true both in employment as well as wages so what have you seen first of all as people get richer they consume higher quality goods and second to produce these higher quality goods those firms employ more high skilled workers so what we then do is construct a model that has both of these features and think about what does it mean for the skill premium okay so we're gonna take a model that is as close as possible to the canonical model and then add two features endogenous quality choice and that higher quality goods require more high skill workers um there are two types of workers high and low skill we're going to have them in like the canonical setup as exogenous labor supply feeding in what is actually in the data we consider two models one is a homogeneous household model and one is a heterogeneous household model that consumes different qualities i'll just take us through the first one but the economic intuition i'm going to describe to you basically carry food to multiple goods okay so this is a homogeneous household model where the household pulls all of the resources from low and high skill workers they're going to consume one unit and choose the quality now we set up this way just to simplify it so i can show exactly analytically where things differ compared to the canonical model but at the end i'll talk about what happens if you add in quantity as well okay on the production side we have a very similar setup in that you have high skill workers low skill workers row governs the elasticity of substitution between the two a is tfp hex neutral s is a skill bias technical change what we're adding is q when q enters in this way for the calibrated parameters we end up having it's going to have two features matching the data the first is that price is going to increase with quality which is basically what we assumed in the data this is equilibrium price the second part is that quality is going to be more intensive in skilled labor and we can see that from the firm's first order conditions down there we take the log of the first firm's first order conditions we get this expression now this expression is what the papers in the canonical literature take to the data to estimate how much skill bias technical change do you need in order to rationalize the rising skill premium on the left hand side given the change in labor supply we see in the data so you back out the change in s you need now notice here we have an extra term which is from quality so from here you can already see because we have another factor driving skill premium we don't need as much skill bias technical change as we need it in the canonical model in fact quality is going to play three roles economically in this model this is the equilibrium quality that's demanded and quality is going to do two things first of all it's going to amplify any changes in the skill bias technical change and we can see it here it doesn't work you can see it here in the sense that if the skill buys technical change increases on the top equation that's going to lead firms to want more high skill workers because now they're more productive and that's going to push up the skill premium but notice if the skill premium goes up the average income for the household the level is actually going to be higher as well and because they have higher income they're going to demand more quality quality is going to enter that first equation and that's going to lead firms to want even more high skilled workers so it's going to amplify that effect the second thing it's actually also going to do is that any increase not just a skill bias technical change can also lead to skill premium going up so for example a higgs neutral change which doesn't have a role in the canonical model here it will because when you have a rising higgs neutral that's going to lead average income to be higher people are going to demand more high quality goods that's going to further push up the skill premium the third thing um which is kind of interesting about labor supply the existence of quality is actually going to dampen for the cali for given parameters that we have dampened the effect of a rising in labor supply so what happens here in the usual model is if you have more supply of high skilled workers that's going to push down the skill premium but the net effect on average income is actually going to go up because you have more of these high skill guys so even though the skill premium goes down the average wage is higher average wage being higher means that the household would want more quality and that's going to offset some of the labor supply effect okay so that's the what's happening economically in the model we then take a first pass at trying to get a sense of how important are the different factors now i'm going to show you our baseline results and at the end talk a bit about how you might want to extend this we're going to ask given the rising skill premium from 1970 to 2008 it's about 25 percent increase despite the fact that labour's supply of skilled workers has gone up how much skill premium skill-biased technical change do you need so what we do is we feed into the data label supplies the skill premium tfp from finaled we have calibrated parameters elasticity from essentially altar and then we feed in the bills and clean horizon quality to discipline the gamma we then use it to infer how much skill bias technical change do you need to justify the rising skill payment okay so here are the results first of all if you had no tfp or skill bias technical change but an increase in labor supply skilled workers then of course the the skill premium itself is going to go down it goes down by a lot in the canonical model and it goes down by much more in the canonical model than what we have in our trading down model because of the fact that when there are more high skill workers there's an endogenous response from quality that offsets some of that decline now we can then say how much skill bias technical change do we need to justify that rising skill premium in the canonical model this is what they do so there's a 25 increase in skill premium and through the lens of this bottle you actually need 5.5 increase a skill bias technical change every year to get the skill premium going up um the tfp actually plays no role here but notice its orders of bandages bigger than the per period tfp increase now we can ask the same question in our trading up model and notice here we now only need about one percent increase in the skill bias technical change and the reason is because quality is actually amplifying a lot of the income increases in this model so then we can also ask how important are the other shocks so the other shocks that can be playing a role is tfp the hicks neutral so we can also ask how important is hicks neutral for driving up the skill premium and we see that it accounts for about a third of the increase so what are the key takeaways first of all we don't smaller changes in the skill bias technical change can lead to pretty big increases in the skill premium secondly even and this is important going forward even if there's no more skill bias technical change the fact that average income is going up can potentially lead to an increase in skill premium and inequality in the future okay so the very last thing i'm going to do which is a more heroic exercise is to say what might happen going forward so one thing that we can do is just can say if it was the case that the college graduates continue to linearly increase and this doesn't do any of the cohort adjustments or compositional adjustments and selection we talked about all it does is say what if we just had taken the trend from 1990 going and continuing to increase to 2026 combined with finale's forecast of tfp what would happen to the skill premium what we see is that if there's no tfp shock then because you have more skilled workers in the canonical model that's a force that will narrow the skill premium and inequality when you have more college graduates in our model of trading down because there's a quality response having more high skill workers doesn't reduce it quite as much and it's a bit less there and in fact once you add in tfp we actually have the skill premium continue to rise all right one last thing on robustness and then i'll conclude so and we've set it up to look like the canonical model but we've extend if you extend this to have a heterogeneous household with different qualities or if we allow for quantity choice here um what we've done is to say now you actually choose between a homogeneous good and a good where you can vary quality we take the bills and clean our setup exactly and then redo our exercise and you get things that are actually not that different from what we have because a lot of the upgrading comes through quality okay so let me conclude um what we've seen is quantitatively we seem to need less skill bias technical change to rationalize the observed rise in skill premium um actually any shock that this income can potentially increase the skill premium some policy implications when we take this literally is that policies aimed at increasing the supply of high-skilled workers through the lens of the canonical model we know that's going to reduce the skill premium and inequality what our paper is saying is that you actually need these types of policies are potentially less effective than we would have otherwise have fought and the reason is because when they become more skilled they actually change the composition of consumption and the demand for those different types of workers
