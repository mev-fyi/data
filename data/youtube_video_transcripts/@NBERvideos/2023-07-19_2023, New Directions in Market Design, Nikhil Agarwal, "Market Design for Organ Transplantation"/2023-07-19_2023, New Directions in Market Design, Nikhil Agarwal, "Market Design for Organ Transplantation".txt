thank you so much for inviting me to uh this wonderful conference it's been uh great so far um I'm going to talk about a different part of the organ transplantation system than what uh typhoon talked about there's been great work on kidney exchange it's a it's a huge achievement of uh of Market designers to make this type of institution work but there's a different part of the organ transplantation system that relates to deceased donors that this room has not contributed to as much about and I want to I want to potentially impress upon you that's an important problem um and to present some of the market design issues and as typhoon mentioned early on there's a lot of changes happening in the deceased on organ allocation system uh the zionos is uh being being reevaluated and the structure of that contract is being considered because lots of potential inefficiencies there and also uh there are changes that put in terms of the allocation process itself so uh there are there are a few sobering facts that you really impress upon you that there's a severe shortage of organs in the United States there are over 100 000 patients that are currently waiting uh for a life-saving transplant and every year so far at least that I've seen in the last at least 20 years uh waitlist editions has outstripped organ Supply in 2022 62 000 over 60 000 patients were added to the waiting list and there were only about 23 000 transplants uh through uh all sources so there are thousands of patients that are dying while waiting while thousands others are being removed because they're too sick to transplant and deceased donor organs happens to be the largest source of supply for transplantable organs uh kidneys and kidneys and livers aside there are many types of organs that we require like hearts lungs and other parts that uh we can only get from deceased donors uh and the other this is all happening where you have this huge organ shortage and at the same time about 20 percent or more of kidneys that are recovered for transplantation are discarded every year so they're not we don't find a suitable donor there are other inefficiencies that I'm sure Jennifer is going to talk about as well but this is a huge problem that we could potentially make a dent on and that's been relatively little uh research on uh I'm gonna get into a little bit of the detail of how this process works just to give you a sense of the different components of the problem uh and also to impress upon you that there are lots of different layers that have made different types of incentives so the organ placement the decision organ placement process really begins from the organ procurement end there's an organ procurement organization that interfaces with hospitals uh and the and they are potentially going to be referred to Sea Stoner organs and then they have the option to potentially recover them now each of these organ procurement organizations happens to be a monopoly in their local area and uh there are reasons to think about why they may not be performing well they have lots of discretion uh in terms of how uh how which organs to pursue which donors to pursue and there are lots of incentives potentially out there there are some changes that have been previously made that I will refer to and some research that's being done but uh this is this part of it is a huge portion that can affect the supply of organs okay in addition to of course uh work that has been done by Mario and season colleagues in Al Roth and Judd Kessler on uh expanding the number of page number of people like you and me who register on the decision list that's one way in which we can expand the supply but another way in which we can expand supplies think about the incentives on organ procurement organization there are some parts of the problem that are not potentially the for view of Economics for example organ recovery is maybe not something that we should uh we we have a comparative expertise on all the transplantation of organs to the transplant center there are some logistical issues as well but they can interact in interesting ways with the rest of the problem so it's important to keep them in mind uh the part of the problem that we have mostly focused on uh so far as uh in the last 20 years perhaps is the organ matching and placement uh part of it right so here's our uh little brains thinking about the right mechanism to use for organ placement uh this is uh this is you can think of as weightless design problems where there's a waiting list of patients and they must be prioritized in some way and you need to give them incentives to accept uh the right set of organs okay so that we get good matches and we get good utilization and so there's work by a number of there's a lot of theoretical work on this uh starting from soon seniors in 2004 uh Block in kantala in 2017 and Jacob National's job market paper in uh that's published in 2022 uh that thinks about various types of environments in which you can think about greatest design and one lesson that has come out of this theory is that the particular details of how things work matter a lot so if every everybody agrees on what's a good organ versus what's uh bad organ and the ranking is identical that's the case uh analyzing soon the only thing that you care about is placing the organs and you want to minimize these parts so you want to give agents strong incentives to accept something and a last come first serve type of mechanism works well on the other hand if there's heterogeneity so that the organ that I care about is not the same as the one that fits well for you then you might want some degree of selectivity so that we are not too permissive and we we don't take anything that's offered to us we uh use our match values and we maximize that as well okay so depending on the perimeters of the market and the organs that are considered you can think about these as very different organs right so like a kidney is very different from a liver because you can wait much longer on dialysis when you have uh it's not pleasant but you can wait a little bit longer than with a dysfunctional liver or dysfunction harm um so in these contexts the data that is generated from these mechanisms can be used to identify and remedy market failures we can really try to understand how uh what what are the payoffs or what are the benefits life here benefits of various types of matches and perhaps we can Design Systems that or at least simulate the outcomes of systems that take that kind of heterogeneity into account in addition to thinking about the organ matching and placement uh problem the data that's potentially generated from this system uh which is administrate data on on uh to some extent on all the organs that are placed in the United States and what happened with the patients that came from it you can also learn about organ procurement as well as uh the treatment transplant follow-up work which we will talk about so I'm going to give you three examples on how data in this uh in this type of setting can be utilized and has been utilized and I'll draw on some of my own work and uh my my collaborators work on in these uh in these spaces to think about the different types of problems that we can analyze with data I'm not trying to keep it at a fairly high level the first example I've already started hinting at is the design of organ allocation policy so there's a priority rule that is specific to the patients and donor characteristics and when typhoon mentioned that there's a continuous distribution rule uh these priority rules used to be quite coarse with some waiting time points Etc prior to this change in livers and now it's a much more continuous rule so you can think of as a scoring rule that scores what types of matches perhaps are better than others at the at the same time based on the priority rule the agents are going to have some incentives to either accept or decline an organ because if you decline an organ you might get the next one so that turns into a rust problem uh to refer to something else that uh was said earlier Dynamic choice where you can think about which kidney to accept or which organ to accept uh and we want to design this so that we make the maximal use of the organs match them well reduce discards but also care about fairness and efficiency fairness and Equity uh we want to think about distributional uh across you know ethnicities and races across geographies and across the age distribution perhaps these are things that uh the policy makers in this space really care about right so having a uh very tightly uh calibrated model that can take all of these things into account can potentially allow us to simulate the effects of counterfactual organ allocation rules and there are a number of them that have now been developed uh starting from similar Asian modules from KP Sam and al-sam for kidneys and livers myself and my my uh collaborators login uh Paulo so many are in the room and uh trans and then Wonder as well and our transplant surgeon uh Michael Reese we did developed a Improvement on that that takes into account the fact that people's decisions might change if you change the organ allocation system this is something that the prior simulation methods did not take into account and this type of approach has been modified and adapted to take into account other kinds of incentives for example incentives to try to appear more urgent than you are potentially those kinds of gaming incentives that people have thought about and Endeavor allocation so the data from these mechanisms can potentially be used to fine-tune these simulation methods to really think about what are the effects of proposed policy design and that in that way we can affect and uh and uh potentially inform policy design and the potential gains that we find in these papers are fairly large a second way in which we economists can contribute using data is by thinking about the downstream effects of organ policy and potentially parag Pathak is going to talk about the use of data and school choice systems to uh utilize to estimate the value added of uh going to a school similar issue shows up in organ allocation it's considered unethical to randomly assign kidneys to different patients those kinds of randomized control trials which are the gold standard in the medical uh Community are not feasible in this case but it turns out that by just looking at uh randomly perhaps by chance I get an offer for an organ that you don't because of when we register perhaps you registered slightly before me uh we can extract quasi-experiments that will change who gets what organ and when we see whose uh what the survival effects of that are we can estimate the like life years from transplantation okay and there is there is potentially for selection here because people are accepting and rejecting organs okay so those are two ways in which we can think about data in this context now these two ways are fairly well understood within the market design Community but there are other types of methods other types of uses of data as well one important example going back to the uh the first step of the process is measurement and benchmarking so I told you that the organ uh procurement organizations uh have lots of discretion uh unfortunately or fortunately I'm not sure uh in terms of which donors to pursue okay and there is wide variation in their performance their measured performance if you look at it as a fraction of the eligible donors that are eligible to transplant and how many donors are actually extracted there is some some opos are at the level of one-sixth of potential donors and others are at almost half and this is great data set that uh Jennifer has been instrumental in putting together that uh you know you can access and you can see that there's wide variation in this type of uh performance metrics you might think that potentially these opio's are a bit different from each other so there could be some variation but it is very hard to explain the type of variation that we do see so there's something that potentially is wrong uh in 2021 there was a rule that established performance benchmarks based on a simple tier system on on these very simple metrics donation rates and transplantation rates that are that uh scores opos and there's a stick here potentially which is that if you perform very poorly then you might be decertified okay and uh now if you think about that that should bring up bring to your mind models of The Artsy competition whereby what you have to think about is what is the right metric in order to think about to score organ proclaimed organizations they are going to complain that myopo is different from yours and so we should use different rules and so what you want to really assess is what are the really likely transplantable donors and find uh ways of uh targeting that much better and potentially also finding opportunities so there's a student hamat Adam at MIT who's co-advised by me and marzaga shamey uh who has uh who has received this uh amazing data set from a handful of opios that have uh that have tried to take on a transparency objective to and they've given them data that very few people have access to that tracks uh the hospital referrals of potential donors all the way to uh transplantation and so this data Hamad is using for two different types of uh objectives the first objective is to try and think about how to design a better incentive mechanism that targets uh the right metrics uh the right metrics for organ procurement uh if a donor was potentially look like they could be transplanted transplantable but they're not for example because of other comorbidities these metrics are based on only age and the primary cause of death for example there might be comorbidities that make make them difficult transplant then we can potentially uh get better better targeted incentive schemes think about tuning the parameters of the art stick competition you don't want people to part fall too far behind or uh and while having an incentive to catch up but more than just designing incentives I think that there is a lot of role for using these data sets to design assistance uh pen handle uh and finding Zen talked about Ai and Healthcare and you can think about these large data sets as as trying to uh improve their predictions of which donors are likely to be transplantable one possibility one uh possibility is that the transplant organizations some people within these transplant organizations at least have the best of intentions okay maybe the best performing ones or maybe not necessarily the best performing ones okay so if you're incompetent I don't necessarily blame you but if you're uh mischievous or you're Machiavellian that's that's something that I want to go after so if you're somewhat incompetent because you don't really know which donors are likely to be transplantable and what are the utility of these uh attractiven these owners you might be able to use these data to develop tools that can help them uh do better so that's a dual objective that uh Hamad is engaging in and I think that this uh use of data can be uh more broadly applicable I motivated the stock initially by pointing out that about 20 of kidneys that were recovered for transplantation are discarded and you might wonder why are they discarded one potential reason why they're discarded is that the offer process is sequential so what happens is that if I uh if if once our organ is made available uh eyes the placement director can can go and approach a set of patients or set of transplant centers and suggest that this organ is available and would you be interested in accepting it all right uh I sometimes have to wait I often have to wait for a response because otherwise I'll be spamming people and maybe losing their attention so I have to wait for a little while to get their response and then once I get that response uh I can approach the next set of patients or transplant centers this is all while potentially the transplant the transplantable organ has been sitting on ice and it's been degrading in quality at some point when I approach you maybe 12 to 20 hours into the process uh E-Type all and I spent a night at one of the opios in New England uh some transplant centers might say that this has been this organ has been sitting on ice for too long and therefore I do not want to accept it anymore so in order to address this issue uh there is some discretion that this opio staff has which is to expedite an organ that they think is uh at risk of discard by bypassing a certain set of donors uh certain set of patients sorry and going to uh something lower down in the list uh by doing so you've given some patient an incentive to accept an organ that is marginal because now they're waiting time is much lower okay but it is done right now in an ad hoc fashion uh they don't know necessarily whether this organ is at risk of trans of discard and they do not also know which transplant centers are likely to accept them so one idea that uh we are working on that's funded by the kidney transplant committee uh um uh collaboration with somebody is to use these data to identify which organs are at risk of this thought early and to identify which transplant centers have utilized these org these types of organs in the past uh before and we we're intending to build the we have built a recommendation system that allows them to experiment with potentially different transport centers that they don't usually have uh relationships with uh in our tool we find that often Midwest transplant center should try and Target California uh transplant centers uh for a potential placement is they don't necessarily have a uh very close connection there and so uh identifying them is a little bit difficult for them based on the experience what these data might allow you to do that and so we are currently running experiments which are in Pilot phases that uses that thinks about how these tools are operating in canvas canvas uh uh improved transplantation outcomes so uh I'd like to conclude by saying a few things about data-driven Market design and how it might be potentially different from uh mechanism design approach to Market design so these organ allocation markets I hope you have already appreciated or multifaceted than many players they have varied incentives and this is a complicated system in which every single piece is separate and at a given point of time it is very difficult to convince a complete overhaul of the system and as iPhone mentioned you sometimes have to work in pieces and in doing so iteration is unavoidable it's something that I'll also mention that the world around this system might change and might evolve and you might require iteration and so Al has talked about putting on your engineering hat thinking about these problems not only how the theory of it works in the real world but a part of engineering is also simulation and data and constant monitoring and I would suggest that that is an important role that we should think about uh this this interface between Theory practice and uh and data and as the flow in a different context mentioned that sometimes you should put on a plumbing hats things are things are not working well and minor fixes like potentially recommendation systems can make a big difference uh it's seems sometimes simple but can can't have a large effect a second point that I've appreciated in thinking about these markets is that uh the agents that are interacting with these markets are important to think about we cannot design every single aspect necessarily and control every single aspect of uh of of design to some extent we have to leave some room for flexibility and part of the reason to leave some room for flexibility is precisely the fact that uh the world is going to evolve and then we need this flexibility it requires us to be to give some discretion to committees and contractors um and here I find that the art homes from incomplete contracts analogy is interesting to think about because what parts of the design are left uh unspecified and how the agent's incentives interact with these parts of the design are important things to also consider in your design process and I hope that you've I think I have convinced you that data is Central to this Endeavor because the simulation evaluation as well as recommendation but I don't by no means mean to suggest that data can solve all problems there's a close interplay between Theory measurement and practice and uh if you're interested more on that point uh Eric Buddhist I've written about that a little bit in our handbook chapter thanks
