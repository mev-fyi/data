okay so first of all thanks a lot for including the paper this is a joint work with jada bianchi from harvard medical school and dongos song from johns hopkins university so in the economics profession uh there's been quite a lot of discussion about the short-term trade-off between containing the kv-19 pandemic and preserving economic activity like uh jim poterba just suggested the economic profession jumped on top of these uh coveyed trade-offs however it seems to us has been quite a bit less discussion about the potential long-term trade-off between economic activity and human well-being in particular what we are interested in is to consider the possibility that severe economic distress can also affect human well-being in the long run and so what we would like to understand is the long-term impact of the convent 19 related economic recession on public health so to answer this question we adopt a time series approach and we use this to analyze the relation between unemployment the death rate and life expectancy we do this for the overall u.s population but also for groups organized based on gender and race so in the literature of course uh many scholars have thought about the potential link between economic activity and uh human well-being surprisingly there is no a consensus about the effects of unemployment on human health and the reason why is because there are several channels through which unemployment can affect mortality and life expectancy compared to the existing literature we take a time series approach while many of these papers were more based on a cross-sectional dimension or panel regressions and so this allows us to study dynamic relations between the variables of interest but also take into account what we would call the aggregate business cycle effects of uh recessions um with respect to the literature that is as focused on kobe 19 we cannot make justice to this video it's growing exponentially so here we try to report the papers are more closely related i think the main difference here is that most of these papers focus on this a short time trade-off and the papers that focus on more like long-term consequences of the pandemic they're mostly focused on the economic consequences as opposed to the health consequences that is the goal of our study so to put things into perspective let me uh um plot the variables we are interested in so here we have average life expectancy the age adjusted death rate and then employment rate we do it for the overall u.s population that's the black dash line we do it for african-americans those are the red lines while the green lines correspond to the white population so here when you see a square we are looking at women when you see a circle we are looking at men so there are some very uh relevant stylized facts that probably the audience here is very familiar with so there's been a general progress in healthcare and this has led to an improvement in life conditions average life expectancy has increased over time the age-adjusted death rate has been declining over time african-americans tend to experience a lower life expectancy and higher mortality rates but this difference has been uh declining over time and that we take this as an encouraging evidence nevertheless the differences still persist and also the differences still persist between uh women and men when we look at unemployment we can see that african-american population has enabled higher unemployment and also more volatile unemployment series um so what we are interested in is to try to understand the consequences of the evolution of these three variables for the uh akovider 19 recession so what we do is that for each group life so for the overall u.s population and for each group identified based on race and gender we're going to build a vector out of regression so what that means is that we basically run an auto regression in in the vector space and the vector contains the growth rate of life expectancy the growth rate and mortality rates and the level of unemployment we acknowledge the fact that that life expectancy and mortality rates are are likely to be observed with error we don't observe the u.s population in continuous time on top of this it's quite likely that life expectancy mortality rates are subject to what we call idiosyncratic short-term fluctuations they are not really related to the subject of the study that is the business cycle on the one hand and possibly improvements in life quality on the other hand for example coming from medical progress so to address this issue what we're going to do we're going to allow for an observation error in the level of this variable so we take into account that perhaps what we are measuring is only a proxy for this a deep component that characterizes the improvement in the quality of life and then we estimate the model with bayesian methods so what that means is that we are jointly estimating the vr coefficients but also these latent variables that represent life expectancy and mortality rates in the paper of course we have all details about this procedure the only thing i want to point out here is that we have priors on these coefficients but these priors are symmetric across the different groups so all the differences i'm going to describe next are going to be driven by differences in the data so to give you an idea of what this filtering exercise this joint estimation does to the raw data here i'm plotting the growth rate of life expectancy and the age-adjusted death rate in the data that would be the black line with the dots and has filtered by our models so what you can see that what this filter does it removes these spikes up and down in life expectancy and death rays they arguably are not really related to any uh secular change in health care or or the business cycle um once we have done this then what we are interested in is what happens if there is an unemployment shock so what happens if there is an increase in employment what happens to the growth rate of life expectancy and the growth rate of the age-adjusted death rate so we do we apply actually decomposition to find the impact of an unemployment shock so what that means is that our basic uh benchmark identification strategy is that a shock to unemployment can affect the growth rate of life expectancy and death rates with a leg so when we do this you you can see that we get a large increase and statistically relevant increase in the death rate and the decline in life expectancy in the paper we also describe the consequences of using a different identification strategy in which the unemployment rate can have a contemporaneous effect on these two measures life expectancy and death rate qualitatively the results are similar so i'm going to focus in the interest of time on just on this benchmark identification strategy so this is for the overall u.s population we can do the same for the groups identifies identified based on race and gender so here again the black dash line is the overall population so it's essentially the median of the impulse response i showed you a moment ago while the red lines represent the african-american population and the green lines represented the white population so on top i'm considering the response of the life expectancy and death rates to uh one standard deviation shock so as you can see for african americans we have a substantially larger increase in the age-adjusted death rate and a substantially larger decline in life expectancy now in this could be driven in part by the fact that african-americans tend to experience larger shocks to unemployment rates so you see this in the right column you see that the shock to the employment rate for african-americans are larger and this is consistent with what i showed you in the beginning that the series for unemployment for african-americans is more volatile so to try to understand what is the relative role of the transmission mechanisms versus the size of the shock in the in the second row of this figure i'm normalizing the initial impulse to be one percent for all groups and so here and some interesting patterns uh emerge first of all even controlling for the size of the shock african-americans show a larger decline in life expectancy uh when it comes to the age-adjusted death rate however the most striking feature is that for white women the impact of the shock is substantially large and this will become important later on when we will talk about the kovid 19 unemployment shock also for african-american women we still have a large impact once controlling for size so we can see that the differences get reduced once we control for the size of the shock but they are still there so so far what we have established is this historical relation between uh shocks to unemployment and mortality and life expectancy so the next step consists in using these evidence to try to form a forecast about the consequences of the kovid 19 unemployment shock so basically the consequences of the economic distress on life expectancy and death rates so uh this is already uh in doing this we already faced a data problem because on the cdc website the data for the last three years are not available so in order to do this kind of exercise we need to treat that these data has missing observations and try to infer the size of the unemployment shock just by looking at the series of unemployment and and doing essentially a filtering exercise so again in the paper we explain all the details but essentially what you do you back out the reduced form shocks and then you use the same identification strategy based on the cholesky decomposition to back out the kobe 19 unemployment shock once you do that you can look at how the kovi 19 unemployment shock compares to the typical unemployment innovation so in the first column here the kovi 19 unemployment shock is measured in terms of standard deviations so what you can see is that the for the world population is around 3.6 times the typical innovation to unemployment but when we look at white women this number gets at almost five standard deviations so remember that white women typically experiences smaller shocks than the rest of the population but kovite 19 this has been well documented in the literature but also in the press white women have been particularly affected by this recession because of the type of services that have been shut down as a result of kobe 19. however when we look at the absolute magnitudes that would be the second column we still see that african-americans tend to experience a larger shock so just to uh look at this from a different perspective what that means is that this recession is a bit more homogeneous in the way it has affected um african-americans and the white population and but in relative terms the white population especially white women have experienced an unusually large effect of the recession so now now that we have the size of the shock we can move to try to form a forecast for the change in life expectancy and the change in the mortality rates coming from the shock so here for each group in rbrs and for different horizons we are looking at the percentage change in life expectancies so i'm going to focus on just one particular horizon again in the interest of time uh so let's focus on the 15 years or horizon what you can see is that the kovid 19 unemployment shock implies a reduction of 0.83 percent in life expectancy so this corresponds to a decline of 0.65 life years when again we look at african-americans we see that these numbers get larger and remember that they were starting already from a less favorable situation when we look at the age-adjusted death rate we find that again at the 15-years horizon we have a 2.4 percent increase in the age-adjusted debt rate to put this into perspective this corresponds to 18 additional debts every 100 000 citizens and now again what is striking here is that if we focus on women african-american women and white women we again see a very large increase going back to the idea that they were subject to an unusually large shock and on top of that they seem to have a larger impact for a given size of the shock finally what we can do is to try to translate all these numbers in what we call excess tests so now this is a um a painful but nevertheless interesting exercise because a lot of the discussion that we have around cov19 is in terms of excess deaths so how can we think about excess deaths well is a comparing the outcome that we see as a result of the kobe 19 pandemic versus the accounter factual the basically asked what would be the number of deaths if kobe had not occurred so we can do this a similar exercise but instead of doing for the number of deaths in 2020 we can do this looking forward and in particular we can do it looking forward as a result of the unemployment shock so we can basically ask what is the number of deaths as with the unemployment shock that we have experienced versus a country factual in which the unemployment shock and not occur now this is exercise uh it's actually more complicated than what it sounds because essentially what you want to do is to reconstruct the path for the population to take into account that people essentially cannot die twice okay so what you want to do you want to adjust the path of the population with and without the unemployment shock so we take the census projections as our benchmark as how things would have been without the kovi 19 shock and then we reconstruct the population path using this change in the death rate an additional complication is that we want to translate um age-adjusted death rates to crude death rates and we do these uh base again on the historic correlation between these two variables what you get in the end well in the end you get that if you look at the 15 years horizon and the 20 years horizon you get uh excess deaths in the order of 0.8 million and 1.2 million at the 15 and the 20 years horizon not surprisingly given we are trying to forecast something 15 20 years uh down the road there is a lot of uncertainty but we think that these numbers are big enough that uh make you pause and think francesco about five minutes perfect thank you uh when we look at the african-americans the number are two hundred thousand and two hundred and ninety thousand so almost three hundred thousand and just to give you an idea this means like around point four and point five percent of the projected african-american population when we look at the uh white population we find excess deaths in the order of 0.8 and 1.1 million again at the 15 and 20 years horizon and when we put that in relation to the projected population we find the 0.3 and 0.4 percent so again here you can see that the numbers are painful for all groups but they seem to be in terms of population a little bit larger for african-americans and again you can see that if you focus on white men versus white women there seems to be a larger impact for white women and i want to stress that this is the result of two features first that for a given size of the shock the white women seem to have a larger increase in mortality rates and second that this recession affected particularly uh women both african-american and white okay so before concluding let me give you a a brief discussions to put these results into perspective so sometimes this paper gets interpreted as that we are advocating against lockdowns i want to clarify that we are not epidemiologists so we trust their judgment it's not our job to decide how we should contain a pandemic so there are recent studies that show that in the u.s alone more than 100 000 lives were saved out of lockdowns so that's the first thing i want to clarify second uh this is a study based on historical data and there is no shame in that because there is not much else we can do then learning from the past to try to understand the future but what that means is that there are a series of factors that could make these numbers better and a series of factors that could make this number worse for example the economy could recover faster than in the past maybe a shift in economic and social policies could reduce the duration of the recession and the severity of the recession this is also the first recession with the affordable care act so what that means is that people might still have access to some form of health care even if they don't have a job these are all factors that would reduce the impact of the shock on the other hand limited access to health care the temporary discontinuation of preventive care the loss of employer provider health insurance the fact that many people are fear fear to get second so they might be reluctant to seek medical advice might make these numbers worse so conclusions so we find that unemployment shocks can have a long lasting effect on life expectancy and death rates based on this historical pattern we uh forecast that kovi 19 the tall in terms of that so the kovi 19 might go well beyond what we see today through this additional channel that is economic distress of course there is an entirely different channel that is the fact that kobe 19 may also have some long-term health consequences that's something to consider that we don't really study here the shock will disproportion affect african-americans and women uh while the effect on white men seems it will unfold over long day a prolonged period of time our results imply that the trade-off is on only it's not only in the short run if we want to reduce the number of deaths it's definitely important to understand how to contain the pandemic but also to provide the policies that can help human health in the long run so if the final goal is to reduce the number of deaths essentially you need both kinds of policies thank you so i'm assuming that everyone can see my my screen uh if if not please just let me know so uh i just want to start by saying a very big thank you to the conference of the organizers for for this um this conference and in particular for inviting us to to talk about our paper which is going to be on the value of communication during a pandemic uh by looking at the case of corvid um so um this work is joint with belinda archibald uh who is uh from from barnard college so um basically to give you a sense of the roadmap and where you know where all of this is going i'm going to start by motivating you know what really gets us really interested in this question and then talk about the setting of the design i'll present the results and then we can conclude with some discussions and if there's time i'll delve into the connections to the literature okay um but but to get this started i just want you to simply imagine i mean i know not a lot of us can imagine that but you know in a much more you know refined well imagine that you are not able to communicate during discovery times but what do i mean by that i.e i mean that it's pretty you know it's very difficult for you to make a phone call use the web access social media and many other you know allied you know communication channels one when the unexpected need arises um the key question we're gonna try to get at here is whether that's such a mitigator what i call unmitigated communication barriers really matter in particular during a pandemic um does it matter for individual you know psychological or economic well-being and if we were to think of you know communication programs that hopefully allows us to mitigate such barriers how should we design those programs should it be a one-time life transfer or should it be some you know installment packages that allows individuals to smooth their communication over time and and i want to say that i also mentioned that this whole big you know kind of question we're trying to get at this kind of motivated by three fundamental facts the first fact is that again if you look all around the world they've been you know a remarkable number of communication interventions or programs that have been initiated in response to the arrival of the kubernetes pandemic so let me start from right here in the u.s i mean as you can imagine so right at the beginning of covet somewhere you know in march in april at actually um you know gave a free 10 you know gigabyte byte of internet data for for all this you know eligible customers and in part this was really important for those people who didn't actually have really better access to to the internet well going to my context so in ghana where i will be basically looking at as far as my presentation is concerned the government actually in response to that actually reduced the communication services tariff from nine percent to five percent again with the goal of trying to make you know communication more fluid and easily accessible um i mean again coming back to the us during thanksgiving you know zoom was so wonderful in providing us what it calls hashtag zoom together and the goal was to actually get people connected and be able to stay connected right throughout throughout the pandemic whilst they enjoy you know this you know um distant you know celebration as far as you know thanksgiving was concerned so in the paper uh we provide a leadership you know a role in terms of providing problems one of the first you know our global reviews in thinking about what the space of these programs although impartial but really you know very compelling to look at the wide range of programs that have really been enacted in response to the community pandemic and the simple message that some of these programs are one time some of them persisted for some time and you know you could vary at different levels coming from the government private institutions versus versus um different sources so i'm going to argue actually as far as this paper is concerned these kind of programs we're going to argue is particularly really important in developing country settings where actually the the informal sector is pretty large likely hit by covet and actually covet you know the content really threatens individuals who are really you know faced by what i call internal constraints by that i mean people who are faced by credit by income by savings and even by psychology and there's a lot of literature that speaks to this well despite all these remarkable programs that are prevailing within the space of you know pandemic we have literally no understanding about what the potential impacts of such programs are okay so that's the first fact the second fact again is very congruent with the first fact when we if you look at administrative data detailed administrative data from the largest you know telecommunication you know company the context that we are looking at on mobile financial transactions it basically demonstrates or eliminates the potential value of communication during the pandemic well two fundamental facts if you look at the data the overall market activity was going down mobile financial transactions were going down as you could think because of the depressive nature of corbett well what we do find in turn right the opposite rather in contrast is that the demand for mobile air time which again you could think of as the pictures of air time during these coffee times was going up so once everything was going down pitches for airtime was going up again try to illustrate how important you know communication is is important in this context well it turns out the second fact is also congruent with some baseline surveys that we did to motivate our people so we did we kind of had a whole you know a very comprehensive baseline corporate survey across low-income you know individuals in ghana and in fact look at what we find 68 of the subjects that we spoke actually indicated that their need to call family friends you know and employers that should have increased due to the cover disruptions but look at the contrast yet about 52 to 62 percent actually indicate that sometimes they are unable to meet such communication needs when the need arises again really speaking to the potential value of communication yet the fact that they could be binding communication barriers during the pandemic so you would think that combining all these three facts programs or what i call communication programs that will directly mitigate these potential but unmitigated communication barriers will likely have have impact on on welfare and by that i'm going to talk about psychological welfare and then and then economic growth just to give you a sense of you know what i will tell you because folks are unable to stay throughout my entire talk although it's a pretty short one so we're gonna try to get at this question using a field experiment okay so let me tell about so we designed and basically filled it two potential communication programs um in one um we have what we call a lump sum you know mobile calling credit arm where essentially we calibrate that again 40 ghana cities which is the equivalence of seven us dollars is equivalent to me the most basic communication needs during this time looking at the data uh so people we have one one group of people that receive this 40 gamers it is lump sum then in another program just to benchmark this lump sum transfer communication transfer with a program that has just two installments basically they receive it you know once per month for just two times you know of course we have a pure control group that did not receive any any of these communication transfers and we deployed basically these programs on a nationally representative set of low-income individuals in ghana and i'll speak to that very briefly about how we got to this so in terms of results again as a first stage we find a remarkable decrease in our people's inability to meet these communication barriers well what i mean by that so the interventions basically help the subjects the beneficiary subjects basically to basically mitigate all potential barriers that they could uh have really mitigated in the absence of our programs by almost 44 to 78 relative to what a pure control group well you think that this is what you'd expect right you give out this stuff well as a result we do find really meaningful impacts on on welfare in particular on what you know mental health so what we found is that the program relative to the control individuals in in the treated arms actually had experience mental mental distress again mental health is going to be bench measured using mental distress mental distress really went down by roughly 10 percent relative to control group severe mental distress which is again the severe version of mental health sorry mental distress actually decreased by almost 26 relative to control we do find some some traction some effects on domestic violence or intimate partner violence again um individuals so the treated individuals were about six percent less likely to threaten their partners but this does not really translate remarkably into they may be reducing the incidence of hitting their partners during the day the times that we look at while we do not find much impacts on on economic well-being by that i mean the impacts of our interventions and on consumption expenditures was essentially zero we we take this as a reassuring evidence because again these transfers are very low cost small packages to the extent that they couldn't really trigger large changes in in consumption projects um one fundamental again results that i think we're going to speak to as far as policy is concerned is that the installment credit program seems to have larger and more sustained impacts as compared to the lamsan programs which is really key in thinking about how to design these programs during pandemics so let me tell you a little bit about the setting so this study is going to be set in ghana ghana is located in the western part of africa and this is a country with a very high mobile subscription rate according to the world bank of about 134 percent what does that mean everyone has a cell phone it simply means that you could take an individual who has multiple cell phones so subscription rate is almost of 134 percent and we're going to draw basically on a nationally representative baseline files with our research partner which is the ghana sales car service so basically this is the the survey arm of the government the institution of government that really this is like the bls version of the us okay so they collect you know all these um you know sample frames of individuals so we draw on previous data from what they call a gana living starter survey seven and basically we're able to narrow down based on some previous exercise that we have done to individuals that were located in the basically the bottom 75th percentile of the income distribution so we're going to focus on people uh in particular who are standing at chance of being poor by almost 22 percent of the time at least and we're likely married so that we can get at these domestic violence issues well i don't think i need to motivate pandemic coping in particular because again we have all been part of it we and we still live in it but just as you know in in every other country or just as in the us ghana actually also you know the kobe 19 triggered a lot of economic impacts negative impacts in particular well beyond that the potential help impacts you know that you might think about due to the restrictions on mobility and human or social interactions so um on march 30th the government of ghana nanakufu adu actually introduced a lockdown in the two most economic areas in ghana or two most you know economic regions in ghana because accra and the kumasi metropolitan areas um this was later followed with a nationwide lockdown basic closure of all schools and and abandoned other social activities so during this time again intercity travel so traveling from one city to another except for essential services was entirely suspended within the city interested in travels actually vehicles have to reduce the number of passengers they carry to observe social distances um as of april 20 the lockdown was removed some of the restrictions were relaxed yet individuals continue to watch battle the impacts the recent again this has been revised and there is some restrictions that have been introduced so one nice thing about selling that nearly 100 of all subjects have indicated that they are aware of covet and the potential economic disruptions that this is really having on their lives which is very necessary but not sufficient for our work so um to motivate our work so let me show a little bit about the timelines and you know when the interventions came in and how all these things were deployed so what i'm showing here is basically um the evolution of our survey exercise so this really started somewhere between october uh september and then november we introduced the first intervention which uh basically uh is a combination of the first tranche of the installment program and then the lump sum and then towards the um the the end of november again we introduced the last trench of the second communication program in the in the installment program so just to motivate our interventions we started with almost three different waves of baseline data analysis basically to motivate and combine this with atmospheric data from from providers to get a sense of what is going on as far as communication is concerned so again this is to highlight the fact that it's been a very it's a panel wave that basically stretches from all the way from october to december so as far as our interventions is concerned uh we set the total value of our transfer for each subject to about 40 gallon cities which we calibrate using administrative data and the changes in communication parties during the pandemic to be enough to at least mitigate or take care of basic communication needs for at least a span of two months um so we employ a one by basically a three by one a one by three factorial design randomizing these representative subjects into our three treatment well two treatment programs and one pure one peer control so in particular we have about 376 individuals in the trip in the in the lump sum arm and then about um 371 individuals in the in the installment program whilst the rest were in the control program so to do this again we had to do a lot of partnership with outside the government um which is the ghana saskatchewan service we had to partner with a major telecommunication company in ghana to deliver these mobile credits um this is basically to highlight you know how we measure these outcomes because i think it's going to be useful in thinking about you know um the interpretation of our results so let's spend a little bit of time on that so the first point of the first stage results which is to get at whether our programs were really working so we started by thinking about how do we measure you know mitigation of communication barriers okay so again we started with a whole bunch of questions asking subjects whether they unexpectedly experienced the need to make a call or connect with others but they were not able to do that just because they simply lacked enough resources communication resources to remedy the cost right so that is kind of our first benchmark we also narrowed down even to whether they actually because of copy they didn't have enough what communication resources to what remedy those does cost um one thing and one common thing that you find within this space of environment by the way this is a pay-as-you-go environment it's unlike in the u.s where you have a cell phone planner you know you kind of you know get your goal towards the end of the month you pay as you go so one thing people do is that they tip in dire situations like covet they appeal to borrowing what they call save or sold airtime so these are really you know high interest bearing you know uh airtime that you can borrow from the telecommunication companies and typically you don't even get approved for that or you need to fulfill some some um some some you know usage patterns before you're allowed to do that um in addition they also seek for this new wave of credit which is delivered on mobile um on mobile platforms called digital loans again are very close to the market for mobile money and due to these unexpected circumstances again so we try to get at what people's likelihood of borrowing sos airtime along with what are seeking for digital loans so that's going to be the first set of measures to to get at you know how we are really mitigating the impacts of communication unexpected communication the second is getting at the welfare outcomes so we started with the economic outcome she's going to be on consumption expenditures so looking at about eight different items so seven is listed here food expenditure we have food inside a house and food outside the house talk about utilities personal care education health expenditure all the way down to durables um try and finish up within five minutes okay in five minutes okay great i think i can do that so well mental health we're gonna appeal to the the um the psychology literature and try to get at our mental health outcomes typically measuring mental health using what they call a kessler you know uh psychological index called k-10 which takes value from 0 to 10 sorry 10 to 50. and then we're going to define mental health basically as extreme version of mental health looking at k-10 values that are above 30 and again um we then directly elicit you know subjects you know um basically whether they really you know internet to sort of they hate their partners or training to hit their partners for the past seven days depends on the way so these are the results um the results are basically i'm going to report different set of results one thing i want to emphasize is going to be a standard treatment effects framework we take inference seriously we take attrition seriously and then we also take you know this modern economics you know literature and thinking about transparency in terms of you know um you know experiments so we're going to report uh combined machine learning with the treatment effects to demonstrate that our results are really not subject to p hacking and a whole bunch of other stuff so let me show you the first stage results so what we are showing here is that the communication programs actually led to a remarkable decrease in individual subjects experience about all mitigated communication barriers in particular again i've walked you through these outcomes before so again i can skip that but basically we find that there's a large decrease of about 44 to almost 78 depends on which outcome you look at in terms of their inability to meet communication barriers relative to what the control um if you look across the trajectory the effects are larger for the installment program related to the lump sum so let me again just reaffirm you know again i've projected these results before but this is basically a slide that shows the impact of the communication programs the real impacts on on actual well-being outcomes so again across the two you know uh treatment program the lump sum and the installment program you find that again for mental health uh which is basically the log k10 measure here decreased by almost 10 percent severe mental is uh distressed just by almost 2.7 percentage point that translates about 26 reduction relative to the control we do not find any impact on direct consumption expenditures which again is not surprising uh we do a lot of to understand these effects we try to benchmark this with what is really how do our results will operate we find evidence of what light impacts on the on the very poor people in the informal sector people who are located in the more locked down areas and less impacts on on less differential impacts by gender so to conclude uh the copy 19 pandemic actually really revealed a lot of economic and mental health crisis in particular for people who are bound by some of these internal constraints by by savings by credited by psychology we provided first again experimental evidence on the impact of providing simply very low cost communication transfers during the pandemic yet with remarkable impacts on mental health gary's shown that this program really matters for communication matters for in mental health but less impact on economic outcomes one conclusion is that a pandemic really has triggered a lot of programs this really might be doing a lot of you know um you know benefit as far as psychological well-being is concerned less so for economics again i'm just going to stop here no time but we contribute to a lot of literature that we can all uh appeal to thank you okay good so uh you know thanks a lot for the invitation uh these work that i'm going to present is joint work uh with randall aqui and emilia simeonova who are also joining us today and i wanted to start saying that we have all witnessed how the covet pandemic has affected all aspects of society pretty much including of course our relationship with health and health services that go beyond the mere impact of treating covet patients and so even though it's been talked about especially at the beginning of the pandemic as something that would be the that would make kovi the great equalizer the impact has by no means being homogeneous and so let me see if this moves but you know soon after the the pandemic started we really realized that racial minorities were overwhelmingly affected by it american indians in particular showed death rates of 1.5 times and infection rates of 3.5 times those for non-hispanic whites healthcare utilization was different among among reservation inhabitants even before the pandemic and that and the incidence of low density and infrastructure scarcity uh motivates the question of this paper which is where these populations affected differently in their healthcare usage by uh the love downs a word about lockdowns they have been widely studied as francisco mentioned uh today at the beginning it is difficult to do justice to the large body of new literature looking at the impact of lockdowns in different aspects but i would say that a a fair summary is that in general they show that they reduce movement and reduce social interaction significantly uh in in recent uh related work that i have done with um with amelia too we find that uh these lockdowns reduce on average uh traffic by uh forty percent and that they induce further voluntary social distancing not only uh as a reaction voluntary social distancing that can uh stay even after uh these are removed um and and there's other evidence that shows that uh this this social distancing as uh uh as a consequence of the uh these mpi these non-pharmaceutical interventions uh have been effective at reducing cases so uh this here so as i mentioned before uh reservations were cutely affected by uh kovit 19 especially those with worse socioeconomic indicators for example also in related work to this one uh with a million randall as well we have shown that covid19 had some unexpected effects on nutrition by reducing the access to healthy food uh in supermarkets in in some of these uh reservations uh in this work we also look at the effect uh on reservations but specifically on health care uh the the closest work we could find was uh work by zidane simon and wing in which they analyzed uh healthcare records electronic healthcare records and they find that lockdowns indeed affect the utilization of elective healthcare services and that some like healthcare mental health care were partially replaced by telehealth and they find that reopening or lifting of lockdowns increases utilization but does not bring it back to pre-pandemic levels right which which is uh consistent with this idea of voluntary social distancing uh remaining active even after these uh closures have been removed so uh we contribute to the area that you know the uh zidan zymon and wing uh study uh started analyzing whether there are any differential effects of utilization by inhabitants specifically uh native americans living in reservations uh instead of electronic health records we use phone mobility data to capture visits to health care facilities and and to compare to that work um we lose some level of detail about the specific purpose of the patient visit to the healthcare facility but we gain uh in terms of solving some of their local representativeness issues in the data and we also get a very accurate idea of the location of the home of the patient so you know regardless of where the hospital is that they visit we know exactly uh where they live and given that dayton healthcare utilization are very hard to come by especially on short notice and high frequency uh we believe that phone tracking is an excellent resource to to address this question this this table here highlights the the lower access to health care facilities that you find when you compare reservations in the u.s with all the locations that are off reservations right so with uh different with different types of uh facilities we find that they have lower numbers in terms of availability per 100 000 inhabitants uh we also see that people in reservations have to travel longer distances to visit these locations and see these longer distances are and even more important indication of availability because uh regardless of how many units or how many uh facilities they have nearby we see that a lot of them need to travel uh farther away for instance there is around eight fewer outpatient care facilities in reservations per 100 000 people than off reservations and in reservations people have to travel on average one mile longer uh to get to these facilities okay uh about the data as i mentioned before we use uh mobile phone data it provides you know very high and comparable coverage inside and outside of reservations which was crucial for to be able to answer a question uh in terms of the the npis the non-pharmaceutical interventions uh we focus for all the areas that are out there that are outside of reservations we focus on county and state level lockdowns um for reservations this is a little bit more difficult because reservations are not subject to the county or state implemented lockdowns uh lockdowns took mainly the form of casino and related businesses closures in reservations imposed internally by tribal authorities these were the main tools to reduce social interaction uh and contagion and so uh that's what we use for reservations fortunately in in our data most locations in and of reservation show at least one closure one lockdown implemented and one reopening uh we are we have data up until the end of the of the summer in 2020 uh so that allows us to to to study both the effect of closure and of the reopening uh we will use a different div methodology to estimate these the effects of these uh closures and reopenings on healthcare utilization uh related uh variables uh our our different div setup is standard uh we have two treatments the closure and the reopening of the economy which we call here npi lift and today i will focus mainly on the results on the number of visits but we have also analyzed other variables like distance traveled and visit duration one thing that is uh important here is that uh how to assign uh the mpi or or the you know the closure and stay a and lockdown so the way we do we do it in two approaches right the first one we simply allocate or assign the npi the the the lockdown to the location of the healthcare facility in another one and i'll show you which one you know how they compare in another one we actually look at the impact or we allocate npi or closure to the location of the patient's home we know where the patient lives because we can track their their phone and we determine the home location and so that allows us to contrast both demand and supply driven disruptions and we we include data from 2019 and a week of the year dummy so all the coefficients that you look at here are comparing outcomes between the pre-pandemic results in 2019 and the current time uh under the treatment right so they should all be interpreted as a comparison to pre-pandemic times in the same location um uh finally uh we we include also an interaction with a dummy that determines if the location of interest is in or outside of reservation uh the coefficient with these interactions determines if the effect of the treatment is different for reservations and so an insignificant coefficient for the interaction with the reservation dummy does not necessarily indicate no effect instead it affect it indicates that the effect is indistinguishable between uh in the uh the locations inside and outside of reservations all right so let me double check how much time i have jump to the all right um jump to the the to the results uh this this first table shows uh results for the categories that we considered among the ones that that we are analyzing the more essential so maybe i i miss showing you that but we are analyzing visits to uh general medical and surgical hospitals kidney dialysis centers outpatient care centers pharmacies skilled care care services and specialist office so here we have the results for the for the ones that are uh more uh essential uh the the first thing uh that we notice is that npis did indeed reduce healthcare utilization right so when you look at the uh coefficients here you find that visits to all of these locations including uh places that are considered very essential like dialysis centers where were reduced as a consequence of the npis then the next thing we see is when we look at reopenings right we see that there is an increase in this there's a recovery uh especially for example in the case of dialysis centers right shown by the positive uh coefficient in the first two columns in all in other locations like hospitals you actually see that uh there is no significant recovery but the fact that the coefficient is lower than the coefficient on the npi suggests that there is indeed some recovery but that it's not a full adjustment to the levels of 2019. in in in hospitals as i said specifically there's not a catching up on delayed services which is a a very interesting question whether people were just delaying uh delaying you know uh optional care and they were going to show uh a more than usual demand for this for for these uh for these services when we look specifically at the differential effect on reservations we see a more muted effect for hospitals and outpatient care facilities as a result of npis uh so these these two services are considered less essential that than dialysis uh in terms of of dialysis depending on how you measure it you see no additional impact but again no additional impact for example in the case of this coefficient should be interpreted as reservations behaving in the same way as of reservation locations in this case in this case seeing a catch-up effect right and more than proportional recovery of the usage of dialysis centers overall when you compare uh the coefficients what you find here is that there's a weaker reaction in reservations uh to the npis right both the decline is lower and the rebound is lower in reservations uh which suggests either that uh the npis were less stringent in reservations or it could also suggest um another dynamic that i think uh is more interesting and is consistent with the initial table i showed you of lower availability of these locations and that is if given the low availability of these services in reservations it could be the case that people were mainly visiting healthcare services when these were essential visits when it was extremely urgent or serious um to to avoid going to the doctor to the hospital and so in that sense we're looking at a type of usage that is less elastic right whereas maybe there were a lot of elective procedures being performed outside of reservations and so the demand uh was more uh elastic therefore explaining in a way why the reaction was was stronger outside of reservations uh this other uh table shows results for less essential locations pharmacies skilled care and specialists and the results overall are are similar uh i guess i will point out that for all of these elective uh procedure or for these less essential locations maybe it's a it's a better term uh you see that the utilization was uh significantly lower in reservations even before uh taking into account the mpi you know imposition or lifting right so overall they are using yes five minutes how much time okay thank you great um okay so uh other than other than that um let me see these results we find that uh mpis were effective also in reducing usage of of these facilities and there's some rebound and it's specifically uh strong in places that were less essential like pharmacies and again and again a weaker reaction uh in reservations right so uh the way to interpret again these uh the effect the final effect on reservations is to add the effect of mpi for example on reservation on the effect of the interaction and you will see that in both cases they seem to be working in in opposite sense uh we have uh results for dwelling time and distance and here i won't go into the details but what we find is that uh in general reservations travel longer distances they have a very hard time readjusting when npis are imposed and during lockdowns in general visits get longer which we interpret as more serious cases only visiting the health facility and maybe staying longer for uh for treatment um okay uh all right so so to conclude overall we see lower access to healthcare facilities and reservations this is this is true both when we look at just the availability of the services and also when we look at the distances that people have to uh travel when we focus on what was going on before uh the pandemic we also see that there's fewer visits even when after controlling for uh population so this could suggest that utilization for reservation well dwellers might focus on essential care uh and this could be consistent with a lower reaction to closures and reopenings in in reservation which is what we get from our analysis uh so reservations might not be delaying elective care because that they were not getting elective care in the first place but more essential care um and then uh finally you know uh i think i i mentioned this before um due to reopening some facilities uh show uh catch up behavior but show much less than full adjustment indicating reluctance to to social contact um and in terms of two issues that we are you know currently studying that arise from our results uh one is the the potential uh impact of lower access to to telehealth so as as francis presented communication plays a very important role uh and in this case it could play a role of uh substituting visits to healthcare facilities so we're studying a if that could be a possible mechanism that explains the difference especially when we have observed that access uh to to uh you know high speed internet is lower in reservations and finally uh reservations show lower elasticity to travel costs imposed by the pandemic in dialysis centers and we think that this could indicate lower availability of home hemodialysis services and so it would be interesting to to study that as well much and first of all thanks so much for the organizers for giving us the opportunity to present our project on social network shape beliefs and behavior evidence from social distancing during the covert 19 pandemic this is um the news in a series of papers that you know mike johannes and i have on the effect of social networks and here we study social distancing together with drew johnson marty conan and dominic russell um some of my courses should also be on the chat to answer questions as they come up so this paper has been motivated by the ongoing global covet 19 pandemic and we've seen basically for a year now these persistent appeals for people to social distance and to mask and stay apart to contain the pandemic but we also see that there are huge differences in compliance with and also in support for these social distancing policies and so what we want to study in this paper is what contributes to this what shapes people's beliefs about the pandemic and their subsequent social distancing behavior specifically what we you do in this paper we study the role of social networks and so what we do is we use individual level de-identified data on both social networks and mobility from facebook to show two main findings the first finding is that social network exposure to covet 19 shapes distancing behavior specifically individuals who have more friends in areas with more covet 19 cases they reduce their mobility more they engage more in social distancing as the pandemic progresses we see that changes in friend exposure affect changes in mobility and this effect in general is not driven by the french liability to work from home but seems to be a choice in voluntary social distancing then in the second part we want to better understand what drives this effect of friend experiences on social distancing behavior and so we look at beliefs and opinions that people hold about covert 19 and the imposed restrictions and what we show is that if people have more friends in areas with more covert 19 cases they are more likely to post about covet 19 suggesting they are more aware they post less about opposing social distancing relative than uh supporting it and they are less likely to be part of reopen groups suggesting that overall this friend exposure to covert 19 shapes people's beliefs and opinions that they express on facebook about the pandemic so let me tell you a little bit about the data that we use to reach these conclusions we have anonymized network data from facebook so this tells us each individual's friendship links as well as the location of her friends so we know for each person where she has friends and where these friends live we also have some individual level location and characteristic information so most importantly we know the location of that individual herself and then we have some demographics like her age and her agenda we also on facebook have information on mobility this is available for a subset of users who have location history settings which means they allow facebook to track their location history and so we use two measures of mobility our main one is whether they stay in their home tile a tile is about a 600 by 600 meter square and so we see whether they leave that on a given day we also have an alternative measure where we look at the number of ties that they visit on a given day finally for these people in our sample we observe their public posting behavior as well as any public groups that they join on the facebook platform okay so here's a first look at just mobility over time this is literally just a raw diet at the time series and what you see here is that starting in mid-march which is when the pandemic really hit the us and um a national emergency was declared the likelihood of an individual staying home just really jumps up from about 18 to like over 30 we see really the same picture when we look at our alternative measures the tiles visited where we see that the number of ties that people visit goes down dramatically starting in mid-march by like 40 what i will do now i will focus on this measure of staying in the hotel but everything you see also holds in this alternative measure so now our first key question is do people who have higher friend exposure to covet cases do they engage more in social distancing for this we need to measure friend exposure we first measure friend exposure at the onset of the pandemic as of march 15 which is the day when president trump declared a national emergency and so friend exposure is the friend weighted measure of covert cases on that day basically we take the fractions of friends someone has in each location and multiply that with the number of cases in this location so of course now you might be worried that it is correlated with other characteristics that people who on march 15 have more friends with exposure to covert at that point it was basically seattle and new york city that they might differ on other observables um for now we will i will just want to show you a little bit of raw data but i will do everything within the same zip code so i'm going to compare people who live in the same zip code we will then add controls for observables and we will move to a change on change or specification and things will go through i just want to show you all these things so here is the first um just raw cut of the data we divide people into two groups we determine whether there are above or below the median in friend exposure to covet cases within the ccta so within their zip code and we plot mobility over time for these two groups so here's what you see and what you see is that in the pre-period up until early march the two groups have really identical baseline probabilities of staying home of around 18 starting in mid-march for both groups the likelihood of staying home um increases dramatically but there's like this really strong divergence so people with above media and friend exposure relative to others in their zip code stay home um about 34 5 of the days in april may whereas for people with below media and friend exposure in those same zip codes they stay home on less than 32 percent of days by mid april may so far this was just pure raw averages in the data and of course there's a huge um concern for differences in other observables between high and low exposure individuals so now we're going to repeat the same analysis but we're going to estimate the coefficients including the following controls so we include individual level fixed effects so this controls for baseline differences in mobility between different people we also allow for time varying effects of individual and location characteristics namely whether a person went to college they age their gender and whether they have an iphone or tablet as well as their zip code so um if people are in a given zip code everyone behaves differently in certain weeks that's going to be accounted for we also control for some time varying effects of other network characteristics so same way that we calculated the friend rated covalent 19 cases we calculate friend weighted median income in the locations that someone has friends as well as population density and how urban these areas is so that we're not just capturing connections to big cities high population density areas or to richest cities controlling for all these um these are the estimated coefficients and you see that we have these um still like very flat basically zero pre-period of no differences and then it meant march people with above median front exposure they stay home more specifically up to 1.2 percentage points which is an increase of 3.8 percent relative to the average of staying home 32 percent um of the days for the below median average group and you can also see that there's a pretty high precision for these estimates so these are highly statistically significant i also want to mention that this doesn't seem to be a difference in the ability to work from home so we separately estimated in the paper these patterns for weekdays and weekends where you would think most people um don't work on weekends so if it is a differential ability to work from home we would expect much bigger differences on weekdays we don't see that at all we have another specification where we just estimate within a fixed effect for people who are same age same gender but also went to the exact same college because we think that also proxies um for the type of jobs they might have and therefore their ability to work from home and again we see no differences suggesting that it's just not driven by this differential ability to work from home okay so so far i showed you friend exposure at the onset of the pandemic but you might still be worried despite the controls we include that this is correlated with unobservable differences between people so what we're going to do now is we look at as the pandemic progresses where the changes in friend exposure affect changes in distancing and this is quite helpful because the early and the subsequent hotspots of the pandemic differ substantially and that also means that the correlation with observables of our friend exposure measure varies over time for instance at the onset of the pandemic when it was mostly seattle and new york it was the case that people who went to college had higher friend exposure to covet so there was a positive correlation but as the pandemic progresses and there's the hot spot moves through you know louisiana and the dakotas then this correlation actually flips and it is the people who didn't go to college who have a higher friend exposure to covet 19. and so what we're going to argue is that it's quite unlikely that there is an unobservable characteristic which varies over time in the exact same way that the pandemic spread geography through the united states so you can see this here on the map um on top you see march february and then april um then march to april april to may and may um to june and you can see how the exposure just changed it moves from new york and theater like those areas with high educated people to the south and then actually at some point the the midwest has the highest friend exposure so we exploit this to estimate this relationship where we look at changes in mobility on changes in friend exposure again we have the controls for individual level characteristics for the other network exposures to high income high population and city high urban areas and we also allow them to vary by month so to the extent that they might be different so what you see in the first two columns this is pulled over the entire spring and early summer is again that friend exposure increases the probability of staying home and even including individual level fixed effects so really just estimating off of changes for the same individual we find very comparable magnitudes suggesting that these unobservables are likely unlikely to drive our result when we do this by month we also see that changes in friend exposure in the same month affect changes in behavior in that month so if you look at june um changes in front exposure in june really explain behavior changes in that same month there are some small effect for earlier exposure changes but really it is the same month that has um the biggest coefficient the biggest predictive power again confirming that it is the contemporaneous friend experiences that shape contemporaneous behavior okay so so far i could hopefully convince you that individuals with higher friend exposure engage in more social distancing so the next question is why is that and what's the mechanism so now we want to understand the mechanism better and specifically we want to understand whether these people engage more in social distancing because exposure to friends and their local covert 19 cases makes um you know the risk more salient and makes them support social distancing measures more believe more in the dangers of maybe becoming infected so we look at four outcomes that capture these beliefs or opinions about covet 19. we look at whether people post about covet 19 whether they are engaging with the topic conditional and posting we look at whether they oppose or support social distancing measures we also look at the general sentiment of all of their posts whether it tends to be more positive or more negative and finally we look at membership in so-called reopen groups group that advocate reopening the economy as before we control for other network exposure fix effect and for interactions of location and individual characteristics to really compare similar people in the same location and their behavior our first outcome is the share of all posts that are about covet 19. and you see here this relationship between the friend rated cases that someone has and their share about posts about copenhagen and there's pretty strong relatively linear relationship between higher exposure to covert through friends leads to more posts about covet 19. so just in terms of magnitude if we doubled someone's friend exposure the share of posts about covet would go up by 17 percentage points or just under 10 of the baseline probability of posting about covert next we want to see whether people who post about covert whether they support or oppose social distancing measures and so we classify all posts by analyzing the language in the posts as supporting social distancing measures opposing them or just not taking a stand or not being about this and so now yeah five minutes okay perfect that that works well um so we capture um whether you oppose social distancing by the fraction of posts that are um opposing social distancing as um as a fraction of all of the posts that are assigned that either support or oppose those posts and what we see here is again this relationship between higher friend exposure to covert 19 shows us that people are less likely to have a post that opposes social distancing they're more likely to support these restrictions and social distancing measures for magnitudes again if we double friend exposure the share of signed posts that oppose social distancing goes down by 1.3 percentage points or that's just under 4 of the baseline so after looking at the posting behavior we have two more measures of sentiment and beliefs about covet the first one is a general sentiment measure so this is a measure that comes from the natural language um processing literature that just um you know captures a sentiment of all of the posts whether they're more positive or more negative and what we find is that people with higher friend exposure to covert 19 their general sentiment goes down about 3.5 percent of baseline for a doubling of the friend exposure our final measure is whether people join one of these reopen groups um there are quite a few that have sprung up on facebook from like you know free michigan reopen the economy and what we find is that people who have higher friend exposure are substantially less likely to join one of these groups a doubling of friend exposure to covert 19 cases is associated with a um 0.09 percentage point reduction in joining the one of these groups that's a 7.35 percent decrease relative to the baseline probability so overall for all of our measures we find that higher friend exposure to covert 19 cases makes people more likely to post and less likely to oppose social distancing measures less likely to join these reopen groups suggesting that a social network is actually a really important source of information and opinions about the covet 19 pandemic so finally in the paper we repeat our analysis at the zip code at the ccta level we use safe graph mobility data and we use the social connectedness or sci data the data is available freely for download at this website and so we look at the zip code including county level fixed effects to control for the general area of course that has a much much higher potential for compounds doing it at the zip code rather than in the individual level but we do think it is nice that our findings basically replicate in the sample of that is very differentially selected these are not facebook users these are um safegraph users and so presumably there are some different selection but we find very very similar results in addition it allows us a little bit more insight into some of the mechanisms and to support the idea that this is voluntary reduction in mobility specifically we find that people reduce their visits to businesses that we would think are essential so it reduced your visits to businesses that are non-essential like the arts or entertainment or restaurants food and drinks but there's no effect on businesses that you would think are more essential like health care or social assistance or a low contact like parks similarly we find reduced spending at places such as starbucks but no differential spending on places such as amazon where this should depend less on how people think about their pandemic okay so let me summarize um we showed two key insights in the paper the first one is that higher friend exposure to covet 19 cases leads to more social distancing behavior by individuals exposure at the onset of the pandemic affects social distancing for months throughout the entire spring it is not driven by the ability to work from home and as the pandemic progresses changes in front exposure affect changes in mobility for the ruling out many possible confounds that we might be worried about in short it seems to be that friends and their experiences are important influence on health behavior in this case social distancing second we show that higher friendly exposure to covert 19 cases leads individuals to post more about covert suggesting they're more aware to post less um about opposing social justice measure more in favor of them and to be less likely to be a member of the reopen group suggesting that friends influence beliefs about current events and i think this last piece of evidence is particularly interesting in the context of the pandemic because when we study the effect of social networks in other settings and we've done this quite a bit there's always an argument that you know social networks are just an easier form of information and it's not worthwhile for people to get information from other places but here people have really been bombarded with messaging about the pandemic you can't really argue that someone has not had access or has not been aware about this messaging and so the fact that friend exposure friendly experiences still have this very very strong effect suggests that there are something else rather than the non-availability of other information maybe trust or maybe you know um kind of trusting this information more that makes people rely on their social networks when forming their opinions thank you here we go okay thank you thank you for your patience uh thank you john and thanks to everyone for being here and for having us on the program i want to highlight first off that this is very much an interdisciplinary collaboration so my co-authors are here uh lindsay kobayashi who is an epidemiologist and jessica finlay who is a gerontologist and they're both at the university of michigan um and our paper is called uh caregiving in a pandemic covid19 and the well-being of family caregivers age 55 and older so americans are a significant source of unpaid or family care i'm going to use those terms interchangeably so even outside of parents caring for their children for example in 2019 approximately 40 million adults cared for a family member or a friend with a disability or a functional limitation and nearly 40 percent of grandparents provide some sort of regular child care support for their grandchildren additionally three-quarters of adults with disabilities or functional limitations rely on care provided by family or friends that's if they live at home but also if they live in congregate or institutional settings such as a nursing home or an assisted care facilities an assisted care facility and so in this last year of of our collective coveted reality many studies have documented the disrupted and perhaps even catastrophic impact of covid19 on care provided in formal settings including of course nursing homes and those who live in them and work in them but also on those who rely on regular care from other health providers as well as care provided in child care centers and in schools however with the exception of parents taking care of children which many of us i think are all too familiar with there has been less focus on on these family or informal care arrangements and there's a lot of reasons to think that these critical family support systems are going to be severely impacted by covid19 so family caregivers often rely on supplemental formal care inside of the home or or in the community so for example in the home in the form of home health aids or other respite care such as adult day care so these increase the risk of transmission right for example many home care workers have multiple clients and are themselves at an elevated risk for for covid19 so these formal sources of care were reduced or eliminated uh in the beginning of the pandemic while many respite services such as adult daycares were shut down so this leaves family caregivers potentially isolated and potentially having to take on more caregiving responsibilities meanwhile the substantial share of families who supplement care which is provided in in a formal setting were also probably increasingly unable to do so given limitations on visitors and and people going in and out of formal settings um finally a lot of caregivers themselves are older adults and at an elevated risk for uh for uh severe equipment 19 and so for example grandchild care arrangements and other intra-household caregiving uh becomes a very high-risk activity um along with being directly discouraged by a lot of social distancing regulation um so in this uh given the lack of evidence on family caregiving um in cobit 19 in this project we set out to provide some basic estimates of the magnitude of disruption to family caregiving caregiving arrangements during the initial wave of the pandemic and we also wanted to know who was most likely to be disrupted and if those caregiving disrupted disruptions were also correlated with other key disruptions to well-being that have been front and center during the pandemic so specifically uh mental uh mental health outcomes so poor uh poor mental health or or employment disruptions um so we're gonna approach this topic today using a national survey that was fielded in april and may of 2020 so the survey is the kovid 19 coping study which my terrific co-authors put together organized and fielded incredibly quickly between april 15th and may 15 of 2020 and it was really designed to provide a snapshot of mental health and well-being of older americans in real time and they were kind enough to let me sneak in and add a couple of caregiving questions and so the result of that is is what i'm going to present here so as i said it's an interdisciplinary mixed methods design the survey there's a cross-sectional national panel which i'm going to focus on today they um there's also a longitudinal snowball sample where they're able to follow individuals over time i'm just looking today at a national cross-section it's an online survey a combination of close and open-ended questions it was designed to take approximately 15 minutes 17 minutes so our national sample contains about 2500 individuals sampling frame was based on an existing research panel of of adults age 55 and older who use the internet so uh you know take the representative and the representativeness of this with with a grain of salt as with any other online survey okay so we asked uh we asked uh a couple of caregiving questions so specifically we asked in your usual life uh so at that stage usual life uh meant pre-covered 19 we uh we didn't think that our usual life would become uh covet 19 at that stage do you provide regular caregiving to a spouse or a partner uh elderly parent a child a grandchild a grandparent or a relative and another person with a long-term health conditions um and i want to stress again that this is a survey of adults age 55 and older so we're looking at an older cohort here and then we asked in the past week has the pandemic affected your regular care responsibilities so have you provided less care were you unable to provide care did you provide more care or did you take on new caregiving responsibilities okay and so then the outcomes that i'm going to focus on today um are going to be mental health uh and employment outcomes so for mental health we're going to use existing validated scales they're going to allow us to capture elevated uh mental health symptomology so we're gonna use um an eight item csd uh depression scale which i think is is is broadly familiar and we're gonna code a binary indicator for scoring three or higher on that scale so that's going to capture high depressive symptomology we're going to use a five item bec anxiety inventory coded similarly as an indicator for high anxiety and a three item ucla loneliness scale again as a binary indicator uh indicating high high loneliness um we have a self-rated health self-rated health which is measured on a five-point liquid scale so we're going to code poor or fair mental health we're also going to look at a couple of self-reported employment outcomes so was your employment at all affected by covid did you experience job loss or furlough are you working from home and did you experience reduced hours or earnings um and so i don't have time to to to share a lot about the literature but i want to stress that the reason that we're focused on mental health and employment outcomes is because there are large and overlapping literatures that show that family caregiving can negatively impact mental health and can and can reduce employment along multiple margins so um let me just jump in and start showing you what the data looked like what did we find uh about 23 of our full sample of of our full 2500 respondents uh reported being a caregiver in their usual life um so these are weighted means along with weighted confidence intervals and i include the ends here just to give you a sense of the size of the actual sample that we're working with it's it's not huge but um but it is nationally it is a national sample um so we found that about 47 percent of respondents were caring for a spouse or partner uh over 25 percent uh 27 percent uh were caring for parents 20 22 percent about are caring for a child another 20 percent are caring for a grandchild um and i want to highlight that almost 20 of caregivers are taking on multiple care roles right so they're taking on a number of these different roles and in terms of caregiving being impacted by the pandemic over half so 52 of these care arrangements were somehow impacted we found that 32 percent of caregivers uh found themselves either providing more care or taking on new care new caregiving rules while uh 20 were providing less care or were unable to take on the caregiving roles that they that they previously had so to look uh to take a look at these disruptions and to look at what kind of arrangements were disrupted um i'm going to show you this table which gives you the um rates of each caregiving type by disruption category so we find that spouse those caring for spouses or partners were much less likely to be disrupted while those caring for parents or grandchildren were more likely to be disrupted along with those in multiple care roles and overall we can summarize this to say but it looks like co-resident caregiver arrangements were somewhat less likely to be disrupted than than non-co-resident care arrangements um if we break this out and look at demographic characteristics of caregivers by disruption type um and just to to compare uh this column here gives you the the same characteristics the same means but uh for those who are not caregivers and so we find that overall um just just broad summary of this slide is that uh care disrupted caregivers are younger they're more likely to be female they're less likely to be white they also are high more likely to have been previously diagnosed with depression or anxiety they're more likely to be working than both and not disrupted caregivers or those who are not caregivers and they also looks like they live in counties with higher covet 19 prevalence both in terms of cases and in terms of deaths okay so uh the estimating equation we're using here to look at covariate adjusted relationships it's very simple um i'm controlling for all of our everything that we have in this survey that is measured um pre-coveted 19 including age gender race ethnicity etc i'm controlling for covid19 conditions in the county of residence including state fixed effects that will capture any kind of state level state level restrictions social distancing rules etc and so again our outcomes are going to be our binary indicators for high for poor mental health and then binary indicators for employment disruptions so first caregiving disruptions and mental health so i'll show you um the coefficients on our two key uh key indicators which is uh were you a caregiver pre covered 19 and then caregiver was were you a caregiver uh whose caregiving was disrupted so for um for all of our outcomes depression and high depression anxiety loneliness and then fair or poor self-rated health caregivers who did not experience disruptions do not have elevated um or better or worse mental health outcomes relative to non-caregivers however caregivers who did experience disruption also reported uh high uh high levels of of poor mental health so they were 17.4 percentage points more likely to to score high on our depression scale 18.4 percentage points more likely to score high on loneliness scale 15 percentage points more likely to score high on on the loneliness scale we see no change no difference i should say in in fair or poor self-reported health and these differences between these coefficients so between the effect of of caregivers uh and caregivers with disruptions are are uh also significantly different so caregivers with disruptions also exhibit poor mental health outcomes now we can look at this by disruption type some of our caregivers provided more care some provided less care or were unable to provide care so if we look by disruption type and i'll show you these graphically just to to limit the the uh the number of of digits on the screen right so first if we look at depression we see again caregivers um with no disruptions see no different uh mental health outcomes uh those providing more care and those providing less care see similarly elevated uh are scoring higher on our um poor on on our depression scale we see the same result for anxiety and the same same result for loneliness um and no really strong relationships for uh for fair or poor self-reported health so overall regardless of the disruption type right we see our caregivers who experience disruption score higher on on these mental health indices so seem to have poorer mental health outcomes during the pandemic five minutes sorry okay thank you uh so uh caregiving disruptions now we turn to work disruptions and again i want to stress that all of these relationships you know are purely associative i'm not claiming any sort of kind of direct causality here so here's the same table i showed you before uh now our outcomes are work disruption so any disruption and then job loss or furlough reduced hours or working from home and i'm estimating these on the subset of caregivers who are employed so this is a much employed i should say prior to the pandemic so these this is a much smaller sample so things get a little bit noisier here and you can see that here uh caregivers who did not experience disruptions uh look a little bit different than non-caregivers in particular they're actually less likely than on caregivers to experience disruption particularly they're less likely to lose their job they are somewhat more likely to reduce their hours however caregivers who do experience disruption are also more likely to experience employment disruptions in particular they're much more likely to experience job loss or furlough compared both to non-caregivers and those who are caregiving but did not experience covid related disruptions one more time looking breaking this out by by more care or less care right we can see here that those providing more care right are much more likely to report that their employment was affected and in particular they experienced job loss or and furlough or uh they were working from home right so if you're working less or you're working from home potentially you have more time uh to to devote to caregiving um we also see that those who were experienced job loss or furlough are also more likely to provide less care one concern here is that our caregiving question didn't specify unpaid care uh so we really wanted a a kind of capture a very broad range of caregiving so it's possible that um that we're picking up some paid caregivers here um i have an exercise um which i'll show you very briefly where we drop anybody who's employed in a um a care or a care or health or health adjacent profession and um really and we see the the the results for the positive correlation between more care and employment disruption uh remains the same here we see less less of a relationship for for those providing less or no care all right so to conclude uh we find that more than half of these family family care arrangements were disrupted women minorities and employed caregivers are more likely to experience disruptions and these care disruptions appear to be correlated with poor mental health uh among caregivers as long along with work disruptions among caregivers and and so while this is this is a snapshot of the situation on the ground early on this is looking at april march there was an ap nork survey from august 2020 that asked also as caregivers about their their caregiving role and they found very similar share of of caregiving was disrupted so suggest that these changes are at least semi-permanent um and and the next steps here are going to be to um look at the direction or try to tease out maybe the direction of these relationships uh maybe get a little closer to some causal relationships using uh larger longitudinal surveys um and think more broadly about what what these results uh tell us uh and what they inform us how they inform policy interventions uh to target family caregivers more broadly beyond just the parent-child relationship and uh just to finish off um because this this survey had some great open-ended questions we were also able to grab some some great illustrative examples of the relationships that we're finding so i'll just read um i'll just read one this first one here but if you want to take a look at all of them so this says my disabled daughter had 20 hours a week of licensed practical nurse caregivers during the pandemic i have had zero hours of assistance making my days very hectic while working from home extra cleaning extra cooking etc this person whose father is in a long-term care facility says i've never prayed so much in my life this last one is a woman who finds herself taking care of her husband with late stage parkinson's says i'm stressed and depressed okay so that's perhaps a somber somber note to end on but i think it those quotes really illustrate uh really illustrate some of these relationships that we're trying to capture uh in the illustrate in the paper thank you
