if you look out at the investment Universe thinking about assets that are more complex to less complex so examples of more complex assets would be things like mortgage-backed Securities convertible Bond Arbitrage credit Arbitrage and then you contrast that with standard liquid Equity markets one thing that's really puzzling is that the risk return profile in the complex strategies the mortgage-backed Securities convertible bonds look really attractive but the participation is really Limited so we all have pretty well Diversified and and we're pretty active in the equity markets and given the risk return trade-off maybe what we should be doing is taking the money out of our liquid Equity portfolios and investing them in mortgage-backed Securities or or convertible Bond Arbitrage the risk return profile is better so the question is why shouldn't we be doing that the answer to why we shouldn't be doing that is that those complex asset strategies require a joint investment not only in the asset class but in an implementation technology so think about most complex assets actually require a long position in an underlying asset say a mortgage and then they require what you want to do is you want to harvest the alpha say in mortgage-backed Securities meaning you want to get that extra excess return but you don't want to take on too much risk so in order to harvest the alpha what you want to do is you want to go along the mortgage-backed Securities and then you want to go short a tracking portfolio or a hedging portfolio that's going to allow you to eliminate some of that risk but the quality of different investors tracking portfolios is going to vary a lot so the reason that I as an individual I'm not going to invest in mortgage-backed Securities is that my tracking portfolio would be pretty poor it would be pretty poorly correlated with the underlying so my ability to harvest Alpha without taking on a lot of risk from my inferior tracking portfolio or inferior model is going to be really limited compared to an experienced hedge fund trading in mortgage-backed Securities in this research to understand this question about why there are these asset classes that appear to have these really great risk return profiles so high returns and relatively low observed risk we developed a new model to understand these things that really combines asset pricing with industrial organization so one of the things we know from industrial organization is that the excess capacity of of really productive producers can be used to keep higher cost producers out of the market so because they can produce at a low cost they can charge lower prices and that's going to make it unattractive for higher cost producers to enter so one of the examples that people are talking a lot about now is within the oil markets you have Saudi Arabia that has this very efficient technology and you have frackers that have an inefficient technology Saudi Arabia can actually price oil such that it's not optimal for frackers to participate to provide any oil to the market because of their better technology and in these complex asset markets the more sophisticated investors act in the same way the fact that they have better Technologies and face lower risk meaning they also require lower returns means that those lower returns are not enough to compensate the people with the worst technologies that would face higher risk
