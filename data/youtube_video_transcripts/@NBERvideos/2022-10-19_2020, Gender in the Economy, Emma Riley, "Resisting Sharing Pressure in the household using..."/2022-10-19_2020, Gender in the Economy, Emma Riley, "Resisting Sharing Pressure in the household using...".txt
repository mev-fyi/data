foreign thank you for joining for my presentation so my name is Emma Riley and I'm a researcher at the University of Oxford and I'm going to be presenting today my study which examines whether changing the form that a microfinance loan is disbursed in from cash to onto a mobile money account enables female business owners to overcome sharing pressure within the household invest more of the loan in that business and improve business outcomes as a result so to give a bit of motivation for this study um is the fact that microfinance loans are immensely popular worldwide so over 100 million 140 million poor people took out microfinance loans in 2017. of which the vast majority are women and demand is growing for microfinance products particularly in sub-Saharan Africa this is despite a series of influential studies showing that actually microfinance did not have the benefits that have been hoped for it um and there are a few benefits seen for either business or household outcomes across these these various studies um if anything Studies have shown that actually the returns to Capital might be particularly low for women um as compared to men um so in this study I'm going to be looking at with a family sharing pressure I might be acting as a constraint on investment and hence constraining the ability of female entrepreneurs to grow their businesses and this is Promised on the experimental evidence which um widespread sharing Norms can reduce investment and that the sharing arms are generally and particularly strong for women and have particularly um negative effect on uh women's investment decisions um and this also links to some field experiments which have shown that in particular circumstances women can see higher returns to capital investment so for example they can hide um loans or grants from their spouse or if they're the only member of their family that has a business so this really begs the question of how can we design microfinance loan products to take into account these widespread sharing norms and enable more female Enterprise growth so in this study I look at whether changing the form of a loan um changes the degree to which it's subject to sharing pressure and this is really built on the literature which is shown to ship for sharing Norms to be quite um dependent on the um form that money is kept in so for example sharing Norms are quite different the cash on one's person compared to cash they kept in a Rosco or saving account or cash which has been invested into the business um in a business asset so I look at whether changing the form that alone is dispersed in from the default of cash to onto a mobile money account affects the business of female Enterprise owners and I look at whether specifically sharing pressure can explain why the form of a loan might matter so I do this by randomizing 3 000 microfinance clients off the NGO Brack in Uganda if you have verified businesses into three different groups um so my first treatment which I call Mobile account involves giving a mobile money account to the woman and she's told that this mobile money account is specifically for her business so it suggested she could use it to perform business transactions or save money for her business to invest in her business or save profits from her business on the mobile money account but there aren't any formal restrictions placed on the use of the account and she also gets a training to make sure she's comfortable using mobile money um but she still receives her loan as cash in treatment one the main difference with treatment two is then you get everything from treatment one so the mobile money account designated for the business but this time the microfinance loan is directly dispersed onto the mobile money account and then lastly I have a control group who received their loan as cash and they don't get any new mobile money account so there's two important takeaways from there so firstly everyone in my study is getting a microfinance loan um it's just changing the form of the loan and the addition of mobile money accounts um and secondly the vast majority of people in my in my studies are over 97 had used mobile money before and were familiar with mobile money um so this experiment is also not about introducing mobile money for the first time it is about um designating mobile money accounts for a particular purpose and then um dispersing a loan onto those accounts so to give a brief preview of their results I find that eight months after the microfinance loans um were dispersed women who received the microfinance loan on a mobile money account have 11 higher business investment and 15 higher business profits than women who received the same microfinance loan but as cash um I see that part of the loan remains on the mobile money account three months after disbursement and it slowly worn down and um this I also checked this using sort of qualitative surveys to check that women didn't have trouble withdrawing the loan for example um that generally women described choosing to leave money on the account and did not report any significant issues accessing the loan when it was dispersed onto a mobile money account um I see my effects already driven by those who struggle with household pressure at Baseline um and I see the household as a whole is better off if the the loan is disbursed onto the mobile money account it's not just redistribution within the household I find no impact of dispersing um of not disbursing a microfinance loan onto a mobile money accounts are just just giving a mobile money account on its own um and this is primarily because the account is not used very much and I won't go into a lot of detail in the short presentation about that but um that is covered in a lot more detail why why women didn't use these accounts um in the the paper accompanying this presentation as I contribute to four main areas of the literature so primarily um to um the microfinance um literature so I provide the first evidence of changing the the form of a microfinance loan to to a digital form so on a mobile money account can lead to female Enterprise growth um I add the literature showing that if you give women control over that income it changes resource allocations and can actually um improve the situation for the household as a whole by removing the need for for sort of costly hiding strategies to be used I also add to the literature on default effects which is primarily focused on defaults around saving so so defaulting money into a bank account as opposed to getting it is Cash um so I provide the first sort of evidence this can also be used to improve business outcomes and I add to the literature on mobile money as a payment mechanism um by showing that um money given on a mobile money account is is kind of perceived differently and it's spent differently than money given as cash so I'll go through the study in a bit more detail now so the study um took place in urban locations so in Kampala and entebbe in Uganda and so it might not be generalizable to a rural setting um the study involved 3 000 female microfinance borrowers who were all taking out a new loan from Barack though they could be both existing clients or completely new clients to Brack about 80 were existing clients of BRAC the eligibility criteria was that the woman had to have her own phone which over 99 of them did very very few women were excluded for this reason and all of them had a business verified by BRAC which again could differ from other microfinance contacts where the business verification is is not so stringently enforced um the microfinance loans are individual liability loans as all black loans are now but they are um they still involve a group structure where women meet weekly to repay the loan and the women continue to repay their loan weekly and the groups as cash so nothing about the repayment changed even the women in the mobile disbursement group continue to repay weekly in cash and so the study took place in 2017 um and Baseline surveys began in February 2017 upon the point where a woman applied for a loan uh then all the women who applied for a loan within a given week were randomized in groups of approximately 200 women uh into the the two treatments and control group and they would then receive their loan and then the specified form the following week uh this then continued on a rolling basis until sort of June uh 2017 and then the Edline survey were started in October 2017 and coincided with so just before the the loan actually expired so the aim of that was so that women were still in their groups through paying the loan in order to reduce attrition I also conducted some focus groups in August 2018 and I have um transaction records from the mobile money provider MTN for the entire year of 2017. to give a little bit of background about the women in our businesses uh so the women are in our mid-30s and most have gone to a completed Primary School um two-thirds of them are married and most of the rest are widowed or separated um the household income is just under 300 a month and and women contribute um 40 of this from their business profits um the loan is four hundred dollars and the businesses are making about a hundred dollars a month which has said 40 of household income the businesses women have a quite inventory focus of the things like food stores or reselling clothes and shoes um and the majority of married women their spouse also has a business this is um in nearly all cases a separate business it's very rare for the woman to report that she jointly runs the business with her spouse and I saw quite High take up um of the the two treatments the women were offered the treatment and they they could refuse them if they refuse them they still got their loan as cash um so take up of the Mobile account was was nearly 95 and take up of the mobile disbursement treatment was 70 and in actual fact a further 10 wanted to get the the loan disbursed on a mobile money account when offered it but they couldn't do because of power Cuts or network outages so actually the demand for this was was very high and and women were quite enthusiastic about receiving the loan on a mobile money account uh which is encouraging for sort of if this was rolled out um later uh so to go through the results so I do an intention to treat estimates as we said there wasn't a perfect take up of the interventions so an intention to treat and curve a specification where I regress the outcome of interest on the two treatment dummies um the strata dummies and um a random error which since I randomized at the individual level um the standard errors are robust but there's there's no clustering here and I look at three primary outcomes which I pre-specified so that was self-reported monthly business profit uh savings or total savings and um Capital which is the value of both business inventory and assets described as used for the business uh so this table shows that the main effects on my primary outcomes um and so what you can see is looking at the impact of the mobile disbursement treatment that women had significantly higher profits about 15 higher profits on the um the Baseline mean of about 400 000 Shillings their profits were about 64 a thousand Shillings higher um and looking at business Capital um Capital was about 11 higher um so 200 000 Shillings higher on a on Amina of sort of um 2500 um thousand Shillings um I don't see any impacts of the mobile disbursement treatment on on savings nor do I see any impact of the Mobile account um treatment on any of the outcomes it was also interesting here is that between um between the Baseline and nine and the control groups see no change in their business profits and they also actually see no no change in that that business Capital despite the fact that they also got this this large amount of finance loan um if anything the only thing you actually see changing for the control group is their savings so they're saving about a hundred thousand um Shillings more um end line than they they were at Baseline um so that that sort of fits what it's been often seen and other studies in microfinance loans um so looking at the um the mobile money transaction records what I see when comparing the the women who got the loan dispersed on the mobile money account to those who just got a mobile money account and I don't show the control group here because this is only I'm looking at the mobile money accounts that I gave to women I don't I don't have data on on any personal mobile money accounts but amongst the women I gave mobile money accounts to I see that um the women who had alone disbursed on the mobile money account maintain a large balance um on that account over a period of time so they're keeping about a quarter of the loan on the mobile money account beyond the first week and now we're drawing that down and until um it's not sort of insignificantly different from zero until um around 60 days after the loan was dispersed so I then examines the mechanisms by which the mobile disbursement might have relaxed um constraints to business growth so I examined saving constraints but but dismiss this um due to little use of the accounts and the primary High bank account and use and ownership amongst this sample so I then focused on looking at self-control difficulties and social pressure to share money for both of these I make indices capturing a wide range of different components um of these dimensions and both of these include a dimension which um was used for the actual stratification of the sample and was an incentivized measure that women received received money for so again measuring um hyperbolic time preferences and a game measuring willingness to hide money from the spouse so firstly looking at self-control difficulties what I see is that if you interact um those who got the mobile disbursement treatment with the index the cell control difficulties there is some evidence that there are larger impacts for women who at Baseline had self-control difficulties um though women who didn't have self-control difficulties at Baseline still receive some benefit from getting the loan dispersed on a mobile money account um however I don't see the same heterogeneity when looking at business Capital so it seems like self-control difficulties are explaining something or there could be something going on here that's not able to explain um fully my results I then look at an index of pressure to share money with the family and what I see here is that the entire impact of the mobile disbursement treatment is really being driven by those who are Baseline reported pressure to share with their family and that's true both when looking at business capital investment and impacts on business profit so it really is those who who struggled with sharing pressure who were who are driving um the impacts of the mobile disbursement treatment and again I'm not seeing impacts of just the Mobile account I also look at a wide range of alternative explanations so for example redistribution within the household um as I said in the the introduction I see positive impacts overall on household income and consumption the household as a whole is better off I'm not just redistributing towards the women and her business um I also look at remittance flows experimental demands and measurement error and whether there's any sort of backlash um against the women so so either in terms of her spouse sharing less with her or or other kind of proxies of potential backlash from the spouse and I don't find any evidence of that or whether women are more likely to default on the loan if they receive it on a mobile money account and I don't find any impact on those so to conclude my study shows that the manner in which you provide a microfinance loan matters for how it is used clients who receive their loan on a mobile money account hold on to some of the loan on that account use it as and when they need and it then able to invest more of it in their business as a result they have AI business profits and higher household income and consumption as a result so generally my study suggests that increased tailoring of financial services for poor women to help address the constraints to help address social pressure constraints that they face um is beneficial so thank you very much for listening and if you have any any comments or thoughts on on my study then then please email me at this address um to let me know thank you foreign
