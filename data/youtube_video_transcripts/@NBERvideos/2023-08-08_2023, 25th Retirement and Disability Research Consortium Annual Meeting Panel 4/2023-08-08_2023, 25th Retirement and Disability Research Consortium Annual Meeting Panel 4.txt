we're going to move right on to panel four panel four uh returns to the research projects conducted by the four centers the uh panel is titled Economic Security of social social security benefits uh beneficiaries will have the same format as yesterday with three research presentations q a put it in the Q a please uh if you need live captioning there's a cc at the bottom of your screen the moderator for session four is Olivia Mitchell Olivia Mitchell is a professor at Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania uh she has a PHD in economics from University of Wisconsin or professional interest range is Broad but she has a focus on public and private pensions insurance and risk management let me turn the audio over to Olivia Mitchell thanks very much John I hope you can hear me all right we have a great session this afternoon we have three speakers and I'll quickly introduce them Bruce Mayer is from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy uh he studies poverty and inequality tax policy government safety net programs such as unemployment insurance workers comp food stamps Medicaid and as we'll hear the accuracy of household surveys his PhD is in economics from Northwestern Eric French will be coming to us from the University of Cambridge where he's the Montague Burton professor of industrial relations and labor economics his primary research interests are labor Public Finance health and applied econometrics and his PhD is from the University of Wisconsin and then last but certainly not least we have googly Elmo brischesi and I hope I pronounced that correctly he's a postdoc at the University of Chicago with a PhD from the University of Sydney and his research focuses on labor markets behavioral economics and public policy and as moderator I will give you a one minute warning you have 12 minutes total and we will delay all the Q a until the end of the presentation so with that Bruce please take it away okay thank you Olivia um this is Joint work with Aaron Hong Connor Murphy Jim Sullivan and Derek Wu the opinions expressed are our own and all results have been through disclosure reviews obtaining an accurate uh this is not advancing um why is that maybe hit escape and restart there you go okay um here we go obtaining an accurate picture of the economic security of the elderly is a critical issue for both researchers and policy makers much of the past work on economic security relies on survey income sources which are unfortunately prone to income Under reporting about half of private pensions and staff receipt is not recorded in surveys and a substantial share of SSI receipt as well recent studies that link administrative data to Major census surveys have found that income of the elderly are often much higher than reported in the survey data loan while the impact of SSA programs is often very different as well um another approach to examining income measurement through linkage is to examine consumption as it may be a better indicator of economic well-being than income as I've argued we provide um the most accurate examination to date of post-tax and in-kind transfer income of the elderly using what we call the comprehensive income data center kid we link the consumer expenditure or CE survey to administrative tax records and program data we are also the first to examine the role of key income sources in reducing consumption poverty for the elderly using administrative data and earnings and program receipt combined with the consumption data provides a more accurate picture of the impact of these income categories on consumption let me tell you about the data the survey data and the administrative data the survey data that we use comes from the CE survey we are going to use data from the early part of 2015 to 2017. these are survey months for which the reference period for income the previous calendar year aligns well with the tax data that we have for income components with non-response we're going to use imputed income values as the CE recently started uh imputing income we'll link the administrative data from all of our administrative sources that I'm going to tell you about in a minute to the survey using picks which you can think of as scrambled Social Security numbers um we're able to link a very large set of administrative data sources the sources cover earnings combinations of income sources on tax returns retirement income OASDI SSI veterans disability benefits the information to simulate taxes SNAP benefits and HUD public and subsidized housing program benefits all of the administrative days sets unfortunately are not easy to use as they are incomplete in terms of Courage coverage or available variables or both let me tell you how we construct our combined survey and administrative measures of resources um first our income concept is post tax post-transfer income the components of which include pre-tax money income uh which includes taxable income components and non-taxable components like SSI and TANF we account for tax liabilities and credits and we include housing benefits and staff which are in-kind benefits we create a survey only version by relying only on survey responses and then a blended version big combined survey and administrative data the um vast majority of consumer units what are the equivalent of families in the CE survey file tax returns for these cus we use AGI reported on 1040s as a starting point but administrative agis negative deductions and may miss some jobs and informal income sources therefore we continue to use survey uh measures of AGI when it is higher and reflects income plausibly missed in administrative records we take the administrative records to never be over reporting which is um we think not exactly correct but a very plausible assumption here we cannot perfectly align survey income components with the admin AGI concept so we modify it to get admin AGI what we call AGI start a match better we continue to use survey AGI star when higher only if survey earnings are non-imputed and at least one of the following holds key administrative data sources are missing for the entire consumer unit or a CU member is primarily self-employed or Works in a high tip industry for non-filers in consumer units we don't have 1040 AGI so we begin with survey post tax post-transfer income is our Baseline and we substitute administrative data for various income components wherever possible to create our Blended income we then use tax Sim to add in tax liabilities really subtract them and add in Credits based on 1040 variables but those variables don't include tax liability unfortunately um in constructing consumption we start with expenditures uh but then we make a number of adjustments we convert vehicle and housing spending to service flows we impute rental equivalent for those living in subsidized housing and we exclude spending that is better interpreted as an investment such as outlays for retirement including pensions and Social Security um to check our resulting data we compare the weighted Micro Data to administrative aggregates um this figure here shows the share of aggregate benchmarks usually from the national income accounts that the survey data in our Blended income measures capture you will see that overall the survey income measures are far below the benchmarks but our Blended income data are much closer to benchmarks some components are even slightly above benchmarks but they are part of a larger income concept modified egi that is still below its Benchmark other components like OASDI and SSI for example are much higher than their survey measures but still below the benchmarks to assess the economic security of the older population and see the implications of improving our income measures or using consumption to measure well-being we calculate the share of individuals in consumer units below the poverty line using four income or consumption series all of which are inflation and equivalent scale adjusted these resource measures are post-tax money income plus snap and housing benefits entirely from the survey data post-tax money income plus staff plus housing benefits that are Blended incorporating administrative data expenditures and then consumption which includes the flow value of owned homes and cars the poverty line we use is based on the national average supplemental poverty measure thresholds so here are the um poverty rates from our four resource measures survey-based income poverty and this is for the period 2014 to 2016 because of um our data requirements we pool years to get uh uh reasonably samples um the survey-based income poverty rate here is 11.6 percent but with Blended income it is less than half that only five and a half percent and this is for those 65 and older expenditure based income poverty is a higher 13.1 percent in consumption poverty is 10 and a half percent if you've seen other work by Jim Sullivan and myself the consumption poverty rate tends to be much lower than the income poverty measure but that's because we've accounted for consumption Under reporting and or anchored the rates so income and consumption rates are the same in an earlier base year we don't do either here better income measures and consumption measures tend to show um poverty rates for older lower poverty rates for older Americans in um Meyer and Wu we see similar large declines from incorporating administrative data in other household surveys let me jump and show you what happens to the poverty reduction um due to various income sources using our Blended data this figure shows how much poverty would rise in percentage terms if it gives an income Source were removed we see that relying on Blended income and examining consumption both tend to indicate a larger role for many income sources in lifting older individuals above the poverty line we see a smaller role for OASDI and the Blended income measure than the survey income measure which is a departure from the overall pattern last slide conclusions um this figure um shows the reduction or really the um what happens if we remove a blended income component uh from uh consumption or income and it shows that if we were to remove a survey income component we get a much smaller impact than if we remove a blended income component we see that with better income measures or consumption the poverty reducing impact of many transfer programs is larger and that's very noticeable for housing assistance SSI and Veterans disability benefits um so in conclusion our results show the feasibility of improving CE survey income measures and of examining the poverty reduction of transfer programs and other income sources using consumption data material well-being tends to be higher measured with Blended income and consumption than relying only on survey reported income program effects tend to be larger with Blended income and consumption than relying only on survey income data we're breaking new ground here using new data sets and linking them to a survey that has not been linked to administrative debate Data before we expect refinements in our future work but that won't be Speedy because of access issues and the disclosure process thank you thank you Bruce can you stop sharing please and let me now ask Eric French to come on good day Eric and Bruce you can mute yourself did you share your slides Eric there you go and makeup all right thanks so much for having me and allowing me to tell you about medical spending risk among retirees by race the previous two sessions have been great segues to this particular talk so Bruce Meyer talked about bringing together survey data with administrative data this paper will have a component of that and then William Doherty talked about differences in Financial Resources by racial groups now an important driver of financial well-being during retirement of course is going to be medical spending risk amongst these older individuals so just in terms of what we're going to try and do in the context of this paper is dig into the drivers of differences in medical spending by race so first of all we'll show you how much does Total Medical spending vary by race and by race would just mean whites versus blacks versus hispanic-headed households second we'll think about not just Total Medical spending but also what share is paid out of pocket and to what extent is Medicare and Medicaid important for understanding racial differences in terms of what is actually paid out of pocket relative to the total and then finally we'll show you in a statistical sense what explains these differences where we're thinking about issues such as household composition difference it is in health status education and the like now just in terms of a key contribution I think of this paper is that we've assembled a data set that captures all pairs and what this is now in the health and retirement study now the health and retirement study the basic medical spending component is for out-of-mod pocket medical spending so the HRS does a great job of capturing out-of-pocket medical spending but at least in terms of the survey that's really all that's captured what we've done is we've uh been able to link the HRS survey to administrative Medicare and also Medicaid records and then to try and capture private payers veterans benefits and the like we've also imputed all the other payers using data from the medical expenditure panel survey and again this is going to be household level data that we'll be thinking about um retirees ages 65 and older in uh their early 2000s so let me just jump in and show you some basic facts in terms of how medical spending varies by race so first of all just comparing the means what you'll see is that on average white households have Total Medical spending that's modestly higher than for minority households so for white households you can see that average medical spending per year is twenty three thousand dollars so that's eleven hundred dollars more than black households and sixteen hundred dollars more than Hispanic households now furthermore if you look at the distribution of medical spending across racial groups it's actually remarkably similar um so overall we're going to try and think about what explains these differences but you can see at some level there's actually not that much of a difference to explain now where there is a little bit more of a difference to explain is the percentage paid out of pocket so what you can see here in uh these red entries is that on average the share of Total Medical spending that's paid out of pocket amongst uh White households is 27.8 percent right so just in terms of what we're doing here is we are getting that here's the share household by household of all medical spending that's attributable to uh uh to out-of-pocket relative to Medicare Medicaid or other payers now what you can see here is that amongst uh White households that share is higher and it's higher by quite a bit especially vis-a-vis Hispanic households furthermore what you can see is that the key driver of these differences is actually uh Medicaid so on Medicaid of course is in uh a program for which there's an asset test as well as income and also medical needs tests as well and so this is a program that does seem as though it does redistribute resources uh from White households to racial minorities now in terms of the next thing that I want to show you a little bit is just to try and understand what potentially drives these differences at least in a statistical sense and then we can think a little bit more deeply about what are the deeper economic forces causing these differences now just in terms of what I've shown you already is that white households spend a little bit more uh in total um and they spend a lot more out of pocket than minorities now just in terms of some of the potential drivers that I I want you to think about first of all demographics so again this is household level data so white households they tend to have more uh old individuals within the household that they're also more likely to be married so almost mechanically um white households uh should have more medical spending just because the number of bodies in the household and we'll also think about other aspects of these households now in terms of what I'm going to do it's actually pretty simple first of all I'm just going to regress medical spending or the out-of-pocket share on a race indicator so of course the indicator on race is just going to give us that mean difference in medical spending and then by adding in extra covariance we'll see if we can explain uh these differences so let me show you first for differences in Total Medical spending by race and again Total Medical spending includes out of pocket Medicare Medicaid uh other payers such as veterans and private insurance payers so what you can see here so that uh Eleven Hundred Dollar difference in what we call the base case that's just the raw difference in mean medical spending per year by race the full what that means is that what we're doing is once we control for demographics a very large number of health indicators all the health indicators that are basically available in the health retirement study data education income and region we can uh we can fully explain um differences in medical spending taking it face value once we controlled for all these other covariates uh black-headed households on average actually spend 360 dollars more per year than whites you see the same basic patterns when we're thinking about hispanic versus white households again Hispanic households spend uh Less in total than uh whites however once we control for all these coverts they explain more um so just in terms of what's in this uh column that has these uh red objects here these are the shares explained by the different coverage so we're using what some people might call a galbot decomposition here what I really want you to take away from this is that when thinking about Total Medical spending um demographics and income fully explain all these differences in uh in in medical spending so again demographics just largely meaning that whites are more likely to be married and so household medical spending that's higher the second thing and I think there's actually interesting interpretation issues about this is that more Highly Educated households do uh spend more there's interesting questions about why more educated households uh spend more whether that happens to capture something about their ability to be an advocate for themselves with medical professionals to what extent it's related to something about they just uh spend more because they're very patient individuals they invest more in their health human capital the interesting issues here um and although that's really what I have to say so far again the same objects that drive differences in Total Medical spending between whites and blacks also Drive these differences in medical spending between Hispanics and whites uh the only other thing that I'll note is that help um it tends to be worse for uh both blacks and Hispanics so of course if you're in worse Health you tend to consume more medical resources so because racial minorities don't be in worse Health we would have expected them to consume a little bit more in the way of medical resources but again that's fully offset by demographics and education now interestingly uh the covariates that we're using they cannot fully explain out of pocket differences in uh the out-of-pocket share by race so just in terms of what the bolded numbers again show is that on average blacks spend uh 5.7 percentage points less out of pocket in terms of the total share of medical spending that is out of pocket now if we go to full what that again means is that once we condition on all these different covariates demographics health education income and uh where people tend to live we can explain part of these racial differences but not all of them thanks so just in terms of these uh key differences it happens to be health and also income so this sort of makes sense given that at the very start I showed you that Medicaid was important in terms of understanding these out-of-pocket shares and of course individuals with relatively low income are going to be more uh likely to be eligible for the Medicaid Program and again individuals who are in Worth's health status um they're more likely to get certain sorts of of benefits and racial minorities tend to have lower income and worse health so just in conclusion white households have higher Total Medical expending on average this is fully explainable by covariates such as uh for example education and again this brings up interesting issues because at some level we find no direct evidence of racial inequities and spending above and beyond what's explained by education but of course this begs the question of where these educational differences come from Furthermore we also showed that white households tend to pay a higher share of their medical expenses out of pocket this is partially but not fully explained by their higher income which makes them often less eligible for Medicaid and also their better health so in this sense uh the Medicaid and also to some extent the Medicare programs provide redistribution across racial groups thank you thank you very much Eric for being on time and so clear um let us ask you to stop sharing and I will next ask Google I hope I pronounced it right um to share your screen thank you and you can make it full screen okay so you can all see my first slide assume yes okay so thanks for the invite uh and congratulations to Eric Bruce and the other presenters today all wonderful and very very interesting projects um today I'm going to talk to you about our ongoing project on improving the take up and participation into the able savings accounts this is a joint work with professors Michael levier and Professor Harold Pollock but I also would like to acknowledge all the incredible work done by the inclusive economy lab team at the Harry School of public policy especially Jesse or and Patricia Vanessa Hoven who've been helping with this project obviously all the uh opinions that are expressed in this presentation are our own so um I will explain a little bit better what able accounts are all about in a second but they are essentially Savings Program and savings products that offer people with disabilities the opportunity to save money without affecting their uh Federal uh subsidy Federal benefits that they receive we have access to a novel set of admin data um in the state level in Illinois and we complemented that with different survey data sources and the picture that emerges from these preliminary work is that the take-up rate is relatively low not just in Illinois but also a nationwide and we have identified three key barriers to take up which is limited knowledge solo awareness some administrative barriers and obviously the financial constraints and I will talk to you uh later today also about this ongoing novel uh seating Pilots that um is being made possible thanks to the DRC generous brands so able accounts essentially are saving products uh that people living with a disability and their careers can set up that allows them to eventually gain more financial Independence for SSI recipients up to a hundred thousand dollars is exempt from what is actually the two thousand dollars resource unit so in other words if you are an SSI recipient in the US you cannot accumulate more than two thousand dollars in assets um and that is because his uh policy that was last raised and last implemented in 1989 and has not been updated since then luckily over the past four or five years this new program emerged as a result of like 10 years of advocacy um and lot being born called able that is now offered across 46 states that allows these individuals to put money aside and then eventually they can withdraw or spend this money directly on uh eligible expenses um without getting taxed and they also can act your interest by choosing different investment plans on these able accounts these plans are usually administered and promoted at the state level uh in Illinois uh I the program is administered and promoted by the United States Treasurer's Office who also happens to be our key partner in this project so despite the many advantages of this program we sort of realized that there is a relatively low take-up rate and we try to look at the reasons why that is the case to unpack the different barriers to take up we leveraged three main data sources this novel admin data sets from the treasurer's office in Illinois that includes 5164 account beneficiaries between 2017 and early 2023 we complement that with data from two different surveys one is a survey that we co-design with the treasurer's office they implemented last year on 2515 able eligible respondents in Illinois and Wisconsin and then the other survey that is part of the seating pilot that we have implemented where we ask individuals to receive the city money as I'll explain in a second to also answer a few questions so the very first striking result that we um realized and observed from the admin data analysis is that the take-up rate is not just relatively low compared to the SSI eligible population that could actually take up this program in Illinois but it is also not taken up homogeneously across the state if we map take up rates on the ZIP codes of Illinois what we see is that the large majority of accounts are actually concentrated in wealthier areas in other words higher income households are just much more likely to take up the program and own an account obviously this because of the particular circumstances of Illinois and the City of Chicago this also tends to be correlated with race and also education this is supported by survey evidence we have data from these other survey that we implemented last year that confirms the income disparities in takeout rates in other words wealthier households are more than three four times more likely to own an account compared to lower income households part of the barrier to take out that we've identified is the program awareness some individuals are just not even aware that the program exists and what we did find in this survey is that program awareness is significantly and substantially higher among wealthier and better connected households the interesting thing is that it's not just income per se but income might be more of a proxy of a broader set of variables that explain why higher income families are more likely to know about this program and one of these mechanisms that we unpacked in this survey data is that higher income households tend to be just more connected with several Disability Services organizations there's a lot of organizations ngos and not-for-profits in the state that offer services and assistance in the disability space and higher income families are just much more likely to be connected to those organizations or to actually be members of that organization issues interestingly also from the sign up survey of our seating initiative we did find that 35 percent of the individuals that we're not currently helping to set up an unable account actually learned about the program from the recruitment email of that pilot itself the other barrier that we've identified is a set of admin burden in the Behavioral Science literature this is usually a term that includes a broad set of actual complexities in the signup process maybe sometimes complexities with the I.T system or the compliance framework of a program or some other times also includes the perceived psychological cost of signing up and that includes also some misconceptions about the program and we did find that that is the case also for able as it is often the case for many other government provided programs and services across our two surveys we actually found that only three percent of respondents correctly identified all the program features um and that is a statistic that is not that much higher when we include people who also already own an account and so so that is quite problematic you know itself um the other Financial the other barrier they were identified is that low-income households are also concerned about not being able to save enough money into disabled accounts if they were to open one um strikingly we find that there is almost unidentical uh share of individuals in the low-income household spins uh between the two surveys that report having that concern of not being able to save enough money as a reason for Mount Albany in a non-opening enabled account however despite these barriers what we did find from this survey is that the program especially wants the features of the program are explained to survey respondents the program is very attractive to the large majority of people across all income groups more than 70 percent of our participants actually um said that they will be interested in opening an account and they find that the program is attractive so lastly uh what we have been doing since about June uh this year we launched an effort thanks to the rdsc support uh to enroll and see 400 new Illinois able accounts and what we do we um work with uh organizations that are active in the Disability Policy space in Illinois so far we have partnered with the Alcove Illinois Easter Seals progress seal um and Chicago Parks District to reach out to their members uh and individuals that might be receiving the mailing list to notify them about the existence of the able program and also to invite them to take up these Financial incentives that we're offering which consisted in a hundred dollars that gets deposited directly in their account upon completion of our signup survey and completion of the creation of the account the sign up of iPads the purpose of this a hundred dollars are from seating incentive is that ideally what we hope it does is um it offset all the perceived admin burden costs in other words it would make the sign up process or the pain of going through the signup process worthwhile so so far as up to last week we have received about 147 complete survey responses from these eligible participants and we are now in the process of matching that survey data with the Illinois state treasurer's office admin data to see how many of these individuals ended up opening an account receiving um the seating 100 account on action incentive and what we do see from the survey data is that the individuals who are taking part at least you know survey they plan to save at least a thousand dollars or more per year in these accounts The Next Step this is my last slide so the next step is to complete this seating pilot and we also plan to then as I said merge survey and admin data to track participants contributions and withdrawals over the next six months to know how they're using these accounts and if they keep them open how to engage with it and then early next year we will also Implement a follow-up survey to better understand their experiences ultimately the purpose is to understand exactly what are different mechanisms they play a role in these barriers that prevent greater take-up rate and inform uh policy makers on effective strategies to overcome each of these barriers and ultimately the goal is really to improve participation into this program so that we can improve Financial well-being and self-sufficiency of Americans living with a disability and their careers and in the long run of for the improve also their employment opportunities and earnings
