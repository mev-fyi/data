in the past few years several academics and practitioners have observed that inflation seems to follow an exogenous statistical process unrelated to measures of slack such as unemployment or the output gap and this connects to a broader literature that has documented the flattening or even disappearance of the philips curve especially in the most recent data now whether or not there is a phillips curve is of course important for the conduct of macroeconomic policies and in particular for monetary policy so much so that the heads of three major central banks have given speeches on this topic very recently turning to academia in the novel symposium in economics in stockholm last year harald yulik summarized the state of place saying that inflation in essence dances to its own music he joined bob hall and many other economists in arguing that this disconnect between inflation and measures of slack poses a big challenge to the nucleation framework for which the philips curve is a key building block so the question we ask in this paper is does this disconnect between inflation and measures of slack really pose a challenge to the new kitchen framework and our answer is no not at all on the contrary this disconnect between inflation and slack is precisely what a wealth a nuclear model with a welfare optimized and central banker would actually predict and to make our point we use the standard canonical mutation model which we take from geordi galli's textbook our central banker has standard a standard loss function that depends on deviations of inflation from target here denoted by pi t and on deviations of output from potential denoted by x t lambda measures the relative importance of output stabilization we service inflation targeting in the objective function so let me focus on the solution and the discretion the central banker maximizes minimizes period by period losses subject to an aggregate phillips curve or supply equation this philips curve is very intuitive it says that when the output gap increases or output increases relative to potential that puts upward pressure on costs and prices causing inflation to increase relative to the target it's also affected by cost per shocks collected here in the term ut and it can be shifted around by expectations of future inflation as represented in the first term on the right hand side the solution to this optimization problem is a targeting rule which is also very intuitive it says that when inflation is set to rise above the target the central bank will step in cooling the economy and causing the output gap to fall so this targeting ruling imparts a negative correlation between inflation and slack reversing the forces behind the phillips curve so here you can see the illustration of the two curves we have the upward sloping philips curve assuming here that inflation expectations are anchored at the target and there are no cost per shocks and the downward sloping targeting rule in equilibrium of course we only observe the intersection between these two points the two curves and hence we face a standard identification problem this identification problem is made worse by the presence of cost push shocks and changes in inflation expectations that shift the phillips curve around so in this particular illustration the naive econometrician will be more likely to identify the targeting rule and the philips curve let me highlight one more result from here in equilibrium inflation will inherit all the properties of the exogenous shock process ut for example if ut follows an ar1 process then inflation will follow an ar1 process so it does look that inflation in equilibrium follows exogenous shock the same intuition goes through in the case in which the monetary authority can commit to a future path of policies the only difference is that in the targeting rule we have price targeting instead of inflation targeting and hence inflation exhibits path dependence it depends not just on current cost push shocks but in the whole history of sharks so bottom line the new cajon framework implies that in equilibrium inflation rates should follow an exogenous process unrelated to measures of slack as long as central banks are doing a sensible job the challenge here is not really for the model but rather for econometricians it's an identification challenge i i'd like to stress that our point here is different from most articulations of the vet's view on why the philips curve has flattened that view has focused on the anchoring of inflation expectations weakening the reduced form correlation between inflation and slack our point um our the point we make in the in the paper is independent of inflation expectations even in a setting in which inflation expectations don't play any role the point we're making is that the relation the structural relation between inflation and slack will be masked by the endogenous conduct of monetary policy and this is of course you want to say that the policy makers at the fed were not aware of our point of course they knew it very well but yet many people miss the point and that's that's uh surprising because all the formulas i showed you have been around for at least 35 years going back to baron gordon so nothing is new here yet interestingly many papers discussing the flattening of the philips curve do not even mention monetary policy and if they mention it it's only to the extent that it affects inflation expectations so let me go to the identification challenge ideally what we would want is a very stable phillips curve or at least be able to control for any shifts in the curve and deviations in the targeting rule that move us along the phillips curve so create some variation in the output gap that is independent of uh cost per sharks or expectations now this is easy to see in the simple standard model however in the paper we we stress that the same intuition goes through in bigger more more complex setting and here i will focus on the uh big new keynesian model used by the bank of england called compass this is like our fr bus um importantly there's no single structural philips current relation between inflation and slack in this model there are actually multiple phillips curves because there are many margins for slack and costs however it's still helpful from the perspective of a policy maker to think about an average phillips curve conditional on demand shocks why because behind this many margins of slack and cost there is an underlying aggregate supply relation in the economy and in the model and this average phillips curve can get us closer to that underlying structural supply relation in a way that is perhaps more robust to specification than the model itself so so for the purpose of the exercise i'll i'll show you uh next we we will use compass and simulate the workings of the economy using all shocks in the economy we have 18 shocks a mix of demand and supply shocks and we will invite an econometrician to write to to run a philips curve regression here and we consider two possibilities in one the monetary authority follows a taylor rule which is estimated from the data and in the other case she minimizes the loss function similar to the one we had before i call this the discretionary optimal monetary policy although it's just an approximation to it so these are the naive phillips curve that our econometrician will obtain in compass in this model economy in the on the left you can see the case in which economy follows the taylor rule here the econometrician will observe a thick cloud but we'll be able to identify an upward sloping philips carving precisely but at least the slope will be in the right we'll have the right sign as we move towards optimal policy however on the right the econometrician can only see a negative slope and the intuition is the one i i gave you in in the simple model supply shocks an indulgence monetary policy impart negative correlation in the data and this is the result we see in in this in this graph let me show you what happens when we condition specifically and separately on supply shocks or demand shocks and this is illustrated in this set of plots the first show row shows you what happens when there are only supply shocks in this case it's a markup shock in goods market here the economic tradition cannot identify any positive slope he just she observes just a negative relation and that's it again the intuition is the same as in the simple model more interestingly is what happens when we move to demand shocks on the second row in the case in which the monetary authority follows a taylor rule which is suboptimal in this case the econometrician can identify the positive slope and that's good as we move however to optimal policy inflation collapses to the target and the output gap passes to zero so again the econometrician is in trouble and we cannot see the philips curve in the data so turning this into identification strategies it's clear that a key first step for identification is to be able to control for supply shocks this is neither simple nor sufficient it's not simple because many shocks are part supply and power demand and it's not sufficient because we still need deviations from the targeting rule to move us along the philips curve or at least demand shots that are not fully offset by endogenous macroeconomic policies so the solution the literature has resorted to is instrumental variables initially using lag variables as instruments this proved um problematic because gospel shocks can exhibit serial correlation which challenges the validity of the instrument more promising is what implicitly implicitly the literature using monetary policy shocks has been doing and in fact this instrumental approach with monetary policy shocks has been recently revived in a work of varnish on investors who use estimated effects of monetary policy shocks on output and inflation in order to retrieve the structural correlation in the philips curve in a way these monetary policy shocks are the ideal ivs they move the output gap they are correlated with cost push shocks and unlike other demand shocks by construction they are not fully undone by monetary policy so we can be sure that we are deviating from our optimal targeting rule but there are some limitations and valeri raymie has talked about them and previously um mark and jean-waven the key problem is that monetary policy shocks have been have become smaller and less frequent and if you look at the pulse 1890 sample for the u.s they are weak instruments at best so the solution we suggest in in this paper the most compelling one we can find is the use of regional data why well monetary policy does not fully offset or does not offset really regional demand shocks at the regional level so effectively from the perspective of each region they're facing a suboptimal monetary policy each region finds itself with an open output gap and a different segment of the phillips curve which is precisely what we need in order to retrieve the slope of the philips square and we can use time fixed effects to absorb any aggregate demand or supply shocks and also control for time invariant differences across regions so so this is the approach i will follow next and [Music] here as we map this into into the data the big mental adjustments you have to do in order to follow me is that when i go to the data instead of using the output gap i will use an employment gap the difference between unemployment and the natural rate so my philips curve in unemployment space will be negatively sloped and the targeting rule will be positively thrown so i think you can cope with that so just to fix idea ideas this is the phillips curve in unemployment space uh the vertical axis shows a quarterly cpi inflation rate in the us from 1957 to 2018 and the horizontal axis shows an employment gap and as you can see the slope is very flat and the key point people have been making is that this slope has become smaller over time in them particularly in the more recent periods and this is illustrated in in this graph here which shows a coefficient from a 20-year roll in regression of quarterly cpi inflation on the unemployment gap and as you can see since the mid-90s this slope has been shrinking and moving towards here so as i move to the original data would we will use data on uh 23 metro areas for the u.s this is semester data from 1990 to 2018 a period in which the phillips curve at the agri level has been very flat we use core inflation as a measure of price inflation and the unemployment rate both come from the bls and for inflation expectations we use the 12-month ahead price inflation from the michigan survey unfortunately the inflation expectations uh data are aggregated at the regional level but that's a limitation we have to live with and just a couple of comments on the data the some of the regions here of the sea the metro areas will have a disproportionate way that's the case of new york los angeles and chicago but overall they have the same trends as the remaining metro areas our sample covers about one third of the u.s population and weighted by the labor force the aggregate the aggregated panel data broadly match up to the uh the true aggregate for the us so it's uh it's a good pattern um so let me show you the regression resource results so all of these columns will show the regressions of metro area inflation on unemployment they all control for inflation expectations and lagged uh core cpi inflation the first column um i want to focus on there's an effect it shows the coefficient two minutes okay the coefficient or the slope coefficient which is uh very similar to the one you obtain from the aggregate data for the us and that's the illustration let me go quickly on that uh nothing changes or little changes when we add metro area fixed effects the slope actually doubles when we move when we include ear fix effects and that's absorbing again the aggregate supply and demand shocks or any changes in the aggregate natural rate of unemployment and the last one i want to um you to focus is our preferred specification where we control for ear and metro area fixed effects and here as you can see the slope coefficient is three times the one you would obtain from a pulled ols regression so and you can see the illustration uh with some effort uh here this shows the um philips curve for each metro area and then the resulting aggregates for all the regions so overall the results are consistent with the idea that because monetary policy endogenously offsets shocks to demand and leans against cost push shocks it's very hard to identify a phillips curve using aggregate data and implicitly what the econometrician does by using regional data is engineering a deviation from the optimal targeting rule given that they're all facing suboptimal monetary policy so just to conclude of course every everybody knows that the reduced form phillips curve depends on the mix of supply and demand shocks and that monetary policy is one of the factors in that mix however as i said before much of the policy and academic discussion in recent years has ignored this point and has estimated the phillips curve using ols on aggregate data that led to a criticism of the new keynesian framework used by most central banks today and we think that that criticism is unwarranted our paper is a call for a more careful identification and in particular one that takes into account the endogenous response of monetary policy encouragingly a lot lots of new work are now uh fighting back on the conclusions from the naive estimation of the phillips curve and in the last year alone we've seen work by marijuana messer geordis and his author jordan nekkio all again providing alternative ways and more robust ways to get at the phillips curve
