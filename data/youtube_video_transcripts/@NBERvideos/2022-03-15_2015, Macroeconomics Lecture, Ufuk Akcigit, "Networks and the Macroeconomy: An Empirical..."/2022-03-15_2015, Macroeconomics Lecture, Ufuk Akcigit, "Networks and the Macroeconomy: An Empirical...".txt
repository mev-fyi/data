okay so thank you very much uh the organizers for this fantastic conference uh this is a joint work with tarana simoglu and bill kerr who are both here and today i will be talking about networks and the macroeconomy so how are small shocks amplified and propagated through the economy well a recently growing literature has argued that the role of networks through the input output linkages across firms and and sectors could be one of those amplifying propagation mechanisms the idea is extremely simple a shock to a single firm or to a single sector could have much larger effect on the aggregate economy if it reduces the output of not only the affected firm but also the other firms or other sectors in the economy through the input output linkages with the with the affected affected firm or sector so clearly in order to understand the role of the role of networks for the macroeconomic outcomes it's particularly important to understand the exact specific transmission mechanisms and this will be the focus of our paper today so in order to understand the exact transmission mechanisms we are going to proceed in two steps in this paper first using an empirically plausible production function theoretically we are going to show you that when the preferences and production technology is called douglas then the transmission mechanism has very specific uh structure in particular supply supply supply side shocks propagate downstream meaning that it goes to customers not the suppliers of the affected firm or sector whereas the demand side shocks will propagate upstream meaning that it's going to affect the input supplying sectors or firms but not the customers so in the second part of the paper we go to the data and we test these predictions using sector level data from the us economy and in particular we focus on four different shocks in order to capture the demand side shocks we focus on industry import shocks from china and changes in the federal spending and in order to capture the supply side shocks we are focusing on tfp shocks and knowledge and patenting by foreigners in the us so without any further ado in the interest of time let me jump directly into the model so we are considering a perfectly competitive economy it's going to be a static economy let me emphasize this there won't be dynamics it will be stat it will be a static economy with any industries and in each industry the production function will take will occur according to the scope douglas production function so the producer in each sector j is combining inputs from different sectors and combines it with the labor according to this called douglas production function and z sub j is the sector specific productivity of sector j here the notation is important x j i denotes the quantity of goods produced by industry i but used for production by industry j so when we have two sub indices the first index will specify the producing sector the second index will specif specify the supplying sector and in every sector g in every in every sector j there will be a labor mark there will be a goods market clearing condition where the amount of goods produced on the left-hand side will be equal to the consumption by the household for this sector and then all the input demands coming from other sectors for goods j in addition there will be government spending and we are going to assume that the government spending is purely wasted in this economy now on the household side the representative household has a code douglas utility function across different varieties and they they all have the same importance in the utility function in addition there will be this utility of labor which is captured by this functional form gamma l and the government finances its expenses through lump sum taxation therefore the budget constraint of the household takes very simple form where the expenses on the left-hand side is simply equal to the labor income of the household minus the um lump sum tax now here is the main result of the model so let me also be clear here that we are considering any type of network structure here we don't restrict any uh we don't restrict our attention to any particular network so that's why if i'm connect to a sector then i might be subject to the shocks that the sector is is being hit and vice versa depending on the on all sorts of network structures therefore even though the model is a static model there can be all sorts of propagation mechanisms because of this two-way interaction a potential interaction across across sectors or firms so here's the first part of our main result consider a full set of uh sector level uh productivity shocks which is denoted by this ball z a vector of shocks for each sector the full impact of these shocks on sector j's output on the left hand side can be expressed as a sum of two components the first component is the shock that's hitting directly the affected sector dzi plus all the fluctuations of output in other sectors the sum of all fluctuations in other sectors summed but weighted by their importance for the production of sector i so since both on the left-hand side and right hand side we have output now we can collect all the terms output terms on the left-hand side and express the net change as a function purely of the shocks on the right-hand side now when you look at the second line now you can see the change in output in sector i is the sum of on effect the first term this on effect plus the network effect which is simply the vector of shocks affecting other sectors but which are accumulated through an an and um leontyaf metrics and in matrix form it can be expressed in this form the change in output in all the sectors will be a multiplication of the sector level shocks multiplied by the leonty of inverse and this leonty of inverse matrix is this magical matrix which has all the information about the linkages across sectors and this will be the important element here in terms of capturing all these propagation and amplifications so there are two implications looking at this proposition there are two major implications implication number one when there are supplies when the shocks are supplies supply side shocks in that case there are no upstream effects and there are only downstream effects the way to see it is looking at this coefficient here this coefficient says that sector i will be affected by all other sectors shocks because sector i is using goods from sector j all other sector j's not because sector i is providing goods to sector j but because sector i is using goods from other sectors so therefore here there are no effect on suppliers the effect is only on customers the second implication is that when we look at the own effect and the network effect these are uh the shocks filtered to the the leonty of inverse as you can see multiplied by these aij terms then one unit of change in the on effect versus network effect will have the same impact on the left hand side variable meaning that it's going to have the same impact on the output of the sector i now if we look at demand side shocks in particular for instance if we look at the government spending shock in that case again we can decompose the total effect into two pieces the first component is simply the government spending shock on the affected sector plus all the fluctuations in other sectors summed and invaded by their importance again uh uh from uh sector this time jay's perspective so here you can see that this time the supply side shocks will be affecting sector i because sector js other sectors are using input from sector i not the other way around so that's why the indices are particularly important so therefore on in the case of supply side shocks the for the third implication of the model is that there are no downstream effects only upstream effects so let me be careful here and make a a remark so when we look at the in the metrics form when we look at the change in outputs on all the sectors now we have this negative term here somewhat mechanical so to speak when the government spending changes since this has to be financed through the lump sum tax of the household because of the response coming from the household side there will be some reduction in output so but this is not because of the linkages of input output metrics but this is purely because of the household maximization problems so therefore this is not due to any uh supplier or or customer relationship and that's why we don't imply when we say downstream and upstream effect we don't mean this we all mean this effect coming through these uh coefficients here so let me try to provide some additional intuition through the help of a graph so in this graph the the economy consists of four different sectors and the main focal sector here of interest is sector number one and sector number one is connected to two three and four and each arrow points the uh the the supplier the air the arrows are pointing from supplier to the customer which means that sector goo sector two is providing goods to sector one and sector one is providing goods to sector three not the other way around but the relationship between sector one and four is both ways both sector one and four are buying goods from each other therefore we can summarize this as two being upstream to sector one three being downstream to sector one but four being both upstream and and downstream to sector one now let's consider a supply such a shock and in this case let's assume that there's a negative productivity shock hitting sector number one in that case the first impact of course is that since the productivity goes down the marginal cost of production in sector one will go up which means that the price of goods of sector one will go up when the price of goods of sector one goes up of course the customers of sector one will be negatively affected by this since they are purchasing goods from sector one therefore in this example sector four and sector three will be negatively affected by this so as you can see the effect went downstream because mainly the customers have been affected by this change in the marginal cost of sector one but now in this example both sector three and sector four is experiencing this negative effect in their marginal cost therefore their prices are also increasing both sector three and fours prices are also increasing but on the flip side sector one is also buying some goods from sector four so as a result when the margin when the cost of uh when the marginal cost of sector four is going up meaning that if when the price of sector four is going up now there's also a reverse effect now sector one is affected again negatively by this uh which creates a second round effect effect but when sector one's marginal cost again goes up further then we have again both three and four being affected negatively as a result we have this two-way interaction and and and some of all these interactions and the nice thing is that that's the beauty of the leonty of inverse matrix all these interactions two-way interactions are summarized by the leonty of inverse metrics that i showed in the previous uh slide now the question is why is there no upstream effect when there is this uh supply side shock to sector one well the reason is when sector one is being hit by this negative productivity shock the the price of uh sector one's good goes up and the quantity goes down and in this case in this particular case when the production function is called douglas the price effect and the quantity effect on the right-hand side are simply canceling each other out so therefore the demand for sector two the upstream effect is is unaffected by this change so therefore only the effect goes downstream but not upstream when the shock is a supply structure now let's turn to a demand side shock and in this case we are going to consider for instance a a negative government spending shock for sector one when this happens the first thing is of course the demand for sector one's good goes down as a result if i'm the producer in sector one now i'm going to produce less which means that i'm going to buy less inputs from my suppliers which means that all my suppliers are going to reduce cut down their production as well so therefore the effect here is going to be on sector 2 and sector 4 why because they are providing goods for me because they are my suppliers therefore the effect goes upstream in that case but now when they are when they are van sector 4 and 2 are lowering their production i'm also a supplier as sector one i'm also a supplier for sector four so as a result this is going to have a second round effect on me because of this uh linkages so therefore there will be a second impact on sector one due to this reduction in sector force output and this back and forth interaction again will create a a round off of effects which is again summarized by a leonty of inverse type of metrics in in in this in the proposition now in this case the question is why is there no downstream effect and only upstream effect in the case of demand side shocks well in this case what happens is that when there's a demand shock the relative prices remain chain it will remain uh unchanged so there are no effects on relative prices since the prices are unaffected therefore there won't be any effect on sector three so these are the predictions of the theoretical model to to test these uh strong implications we go to the data and and and we use the industry level nbrcs manufacturing uh industry database which spans the years between 1991 and 2009 in the first four years we have 392 four-digit industries afterwards we have 384 industries for a total of 6 56 60 observations and the industry linkages come from bureau of economic analysis from 1992 we are using the 1992 input output metrics and we compute the leontyaf inverse matrix the way the theory describes so what we are going to do now is that we are going to take the row shocks the pure shocks from different sectors and we are going to filter them or accumulate them through this leonty of inverse metrics the way i described earlier in order to come up with the supply side shocks and demand side shocks and now we are going to consider four different shocks first we are going to focus on import shocks from china federal spending these first two will capture the demand side shocks and then we are going to focus on tfp shock and and and foreign patenting growth and these are going to capture the supply chain supply side shocks and we are going to run this regression in the empirical analysis on the left hand side we have the log change in industry level output on the right hand side we have the lagged version of the dependent variable then we are going to include the own shock lagged by one period we are going to consider the upstream shock again like one by one period and then downstream shock lagged by one period and in all our specifications we are going to include time dummies and our regressions will be annual regressions so here is the first result first set of results on the left-hand side we have the change in log real value edit and we have the change in log employment on the right-hand side depending on which specification we include both the one one period lag up to three period lag dependent variable so the first finding here is that the own effect no surprise here the own effect has a very strong impact on industries output but more importantly in the case of this demand side shock upstream effect has a very strong significant effect on the industry's output and as theory predicted when we focus on the downstream effect in that case the effect is insignificant if anything slightly negative but again it's it's totally insignificant very much in line with what the theory predicted so another implication of the model was that the own effect and the network effect should have the same impact so therefore in this last row we are testing the prediction that the two effects have to be the the same and at five percent confidence level we cannot reject the hypothesis that the two effects are the same then second uh second exercise is focusing on federal spending shock as another demand side shock and when we focus on the results again the upstream effect just like the theory predicted has a very strong effect and when we focus on the downstream effect we don't get any significance in this case and then when we do the test again we we find that at five percent level we cannot reject the hypothesis of having the two having the same effect now in the third specification we focus on the tfp shocks as a supply side shock and this case in this case what we observe is that the downstream effect comes out very significant whereas the upstream effect loses its significant in many of the specifications and compared to downstream it has much smaller effect and when we turn into when we turn to the foreign patenting shocks in that case again as theory predicted we get very strong effect from the downstream side but we don't get any effect from the upstream side so next what we do is that so far we've included all these shocks in isolation in one specification we we put all of them together in one regression in addition we also introduce geographic networks so the idea here is that sectors of the firms can interact through the local labor markets as a result one one could expect that the shocks can propagate through the regional uh collocation patterns therefore we are constructio we are constructing a collocation index and we also introduce this geographic network effect on the left hand side and the first finding here is that when we introduce the geographic networks it has a very strong effect again on the left-hand side and when we focus on the demand side shocks then we introduce all of them jointly again as theory predicted they all come very significant whereas the downstream effect doesn't come they don't come significant in the first two specifications which stand for the demand side shock then we focus on the supply side shock in that case the downstream effect comes out very significant whereas the upstream effect doesn't have any significance finally so far in the regressions the coefficients are a little bit uh hard to interpret in terms of their economic magnitudes because we so far in those regressions we filtered the raw uh shocks through the leon tf uh inverse matrix in this exercise what we are doing is that we take a pure shock to a single industry and then we keep track of this sector's shock on the own industry and through this input output matrices on the whole economy so therefore this blue line in all specifications captures purely the own effect whereas the red line here captures the impact of the single shock on all other sectors in the economy and we just sum them uh here this is basically the total overall effect on the macro economy of a single shock to a single sector by one standard deviation shock and as you can see the network effect in all these specifications has at least as big impact of the own effect and in the robustness checks we in we we try to uh check the robustness of our results with respect to various specifications in particular we do our vr analysis we consider all shocks simultaneously as i described we exclude lag values we use different weighting schemes we introduce uh sector fixed effect in all in all those things the theoretical prediction turns out to be very much in line with the with the data so in conclusion there are three main takeaways from this study the first one is that when we consider an empirically relevant production function which is called douglas then supply side shocks have only downstream effect and no upstream and the demand side shocks have only upstream effect but no downstream effect and these empirical when we turn to the data the empirical patterns are broadly consistent with the theory both qualitatively and quantitatively and then finally as i showed in these uh impulse response graphs the networks are at least as large as the the own shocks uh in the in in the data so thank you very much
