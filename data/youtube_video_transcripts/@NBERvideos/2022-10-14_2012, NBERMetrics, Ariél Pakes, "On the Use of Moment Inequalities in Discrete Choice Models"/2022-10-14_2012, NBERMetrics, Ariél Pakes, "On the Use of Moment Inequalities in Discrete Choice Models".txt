so the way we're going to change the problem uh you know you always analyze these problems by discrete Choice all the discrete Choice problems but if you actually look back in economics a little while you know historically the same problem was analyzed a long time ago it was called revealed preference okay so this started with a famous article by Samuelson and how Varian had had a bunch of articles on it um and this is going to take off from that okay this is a starting point of that the difference between what I'm going to do today and what was done you know with uh starting with Samuelson is they never worried about putting errors in disturbances in that thing because they weren't really doing empirical work at any the level that we do they didn't have the data sets we have today they didn't have computers that we have today so what I'm going to do is put errors in the revealed preference thing and then show how you estimate given real real preference just reveal preference type arguments okay so it's going to matter the properties of the errors just like it doesn't just discrete Choice okay so it's going to be we're going to have to pay attention to that so what you work with now is not really a model and there is a model but there it isn't uh in a sense it's going to be much more weakly specified than the models you're used to in standard discrete Choice uh you know the way it's going to go is the following it's going to say I know what the individual chose and I know some other option that the individual knew that that he could have chosen or she could have it could have chosen okay uh rather than the one it did in fact choose okay at the very least what I'm going to assume is it's expected utility or expected return from the choice the individual made is greater than the expected return from the choice the individual didn't make so that's reveal preference okay and that's all I'm doing okay um the two things about it I'm going to have a parametrized model for the utility okay so that difference will be positive okay for some values of the parameter vector and not positive for other values of the parameter vector at the true value of the parameter Vector we think it's positive okay and that's going to be the information content of used in estimation okay the problem that's going to arise and this is what got the econometricians going which sometimes I'm a fellow traveler is that if one value of a parameter satisfies an inequality typically values close to it will also satisfy the inequality it's an inequality non-equality okay so we get estimators of sets instead of the set and this the property of the set is we know the true parameter at least in the limit the property of the set is we know the true parameter is in that set and that's all we know okay so it's going to be a weaker form of identification that formally it's called partial identification it's been in the literature in the econometric literature actually for quite a bit the first time I ever saw it was in a paper by marshak and Andrews on production functions the very famous pay the first paper on simultaneous equations bias was really marshak and Andrews on production functions but again it's only recently has been brought to that to sort of starting to be used and and the econometrics worked out okay in detail okay um I'm going to start with an example which is due to a student of mine who's either smart enough or stupid enough depending on how you look at it to go join a hedge fund afterwards and make a lot of money okay so his name is Michael Katz and it was in his thesis okay this is his thesis okay so he takes what is a real classic problem both in IO by the way and in Public Finance um I find I start with this example because the example illustrates very well exactly what's going on in this stuff okay and without doing anything formal so I could start with for example the the this paper about Pecos Porter ho anishi but then you get to these conditions which are right for econometrica but not the right way to explain it to people okay so I'm going to do it this way okay um so we're going to estimate the cost Shoppers assigned to going to a supermarket okay to driving to the drive time cost okay uh it's a it's a problem of big importance for public planets also now you probably don't know this but the third biggest expenditure category of people is food what makes sense right there's housing I don't know if automobiles is greater than food or not Transportation might be better than food but it's a big part of the economy maybe Health maybe I've got this around I probably have old data on that but it's a big part of the economy the other thing is it influences things like zoning laws zoning laws are
