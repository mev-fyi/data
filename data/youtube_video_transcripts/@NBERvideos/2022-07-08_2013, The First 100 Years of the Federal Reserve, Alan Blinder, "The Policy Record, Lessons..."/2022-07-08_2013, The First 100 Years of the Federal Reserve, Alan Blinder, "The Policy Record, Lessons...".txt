um let me start with an apology both to this panel and the previous one i made a very big design error uh which is i relied on united airlines to get from newark to boston i wish i could say i'll never do that again but i don't think i can the other design error i realized is it's not a good idea to try to eat lunch in front of 300 people so i apologize for that also ricardo offered a very long and rich menu for a discussant but the instructions to us were not don't necessarily stick to the paper so uh i'm going to pick one thing to disagree with from ricardo's menu and then raise three other design issues all of which are related one way or another to crises so the disagreement has to do with actually i think a little bit more what he wrote than what he said about including financial stability as a third argument of the objective function or not and i want to make clear before going any further i don't mean by that stopping bubbles from emerging let's forget about that that's not what i mean by financial stability so ricardo says three things uh and he reviewed them on the slide first there must be a measurable definition of financial stability well i have to disagree with that i'm an economist i like measurements but there is a lot of you know it when you see it in financial instability especially when it's acute financial instability and it may not lend itself to any speci certainly doesn't lend itself to any one specific metric analogous to m2 dot or the federal funds rate or anything else that we have used in the past einstein who is wise on many things once said that not everything that counts can be counted and i think this may at least in some instances fall under that rudrak that said ricardo mentioned this explicitly when he was speaking various interest rate spreads and measures of leverage i think can make tolerable though imperfect indicators and they are measurable but it's not going to be one that's the first point second ricardo says quote there has to be a convincing case that monetary policy can bring about a more stable financial system i want to disagree strongly with the word monetary policy there and just replace central bank policy because most of the things the central bank needs to do to preserve or restore financial stability wouldn't normally be called monetary policy they certainly have very little if anything to do with manipulating the federal funds rate third ricardo says quote financial stability must pose a trade-off with the other two goals being unemployment and inflation i'd say that on the contrary the central bank's ability to pursue those two macro goals is severely compromised when the financial system is malfunctioning and ricardo indeed mentioned that i've used that much time already huh so for that reason i wonder out loud often i'm going to do it again here whether financial stability ought to be treated as lexicographically before unemployment than inflation because you must have a modicum of financial stability before you can actually do anything about the macro goals and i must say the more i say that to the more audiences the more i'm starting to believe it so i'm not i'm not totally convinced but i'm on the way now for the three design issues uh related to crises first should the central bank be in the business of supervision and regulation as the fed is but some central banks are not you will note by the way that the ecb is headed into that business and the bank of england is going back into that business so this one time trend to get central banks out of that business seems to be reversing and i think for good reasons of which the most obvious following on what i was saying a moment ago is that if you want to pursue financial stability and i think you do the tools are much more supervisory and regulatory and much less conventional monetary policy tools the second reason of course is only the central bank has the unlimited means that comes with being the lender of last resort uh if you don't believe that as the controller of the currency and there are other reasons too such as the federal reserve here are central banks in general enjoy a degree of independence that is unusual in democratic societies and not obviously replicable by any other institution second issue was more foursquare on central banking in a crisis everybody in this room i think it's a big crowd prizes central bank independence it's not controversial here but as you know the fed in general and ben bernanke in particular has been criticized in recent years for cozying up too closely to the treasury and maybe even to congress in coping with the crisis these actions allegedly according to some people sacrificed the fed's hard one independence i couldn't disagree more with this criticism for several reasons first fighting a crisis really requires an all hands on deck approach with both the treasury and the fed and anyone else is involved like the fdic grabbing every any instrument that they can second if you think about it the crucial rationale for central bank independence in the economic literature at least and i think in general is the short political time horizons that will lead politicians to systematically go for too much inflation when you're putting out financial fires and worrying about how the markets are going to be able to close on friday the time horizon is pretty short and it's not very different that the treasury or and at the uh fed at the central bank in general and finally last but definitely not least in a crisis atmosphere it is potentially catastrophic to let markets see a lot of distance showing between the treasury and the fed much less to see the two at uh loggerheads third and final uh crisis-related issue uh which is the use of unconventional monetary policies after the crisis ricardo seems pretty clearly to want unconventional monetary policies to disappear into the midst of history as the crisis wanes and things start to normalize but i wonder about that the wisdom of that in terms of central bank design especially in a world where the zero lower bound may be encountered much more frequently than it has been in the past in the next hundred years of the fed i'm gonna make a prediction at my age there's no worry about this the zero lower bound will be encountered more in the next hundred years than in the previous 100 years um there are two major classes of unconventional monetaries one is so-called forward guidance which can come and does come in many forms and if it works on say the term structure of interest rates or anything else for that matter and it seems to why would central banks want to eschew the ability to engage in forward guidance in the future even in normal times why would it say the only piece of the yield curve i want to be able to touch is the zero maturity piece i don't see the logic of that yep that's all i need second major class of uh unconventional monetary policies is quantitative easing which again comes in many shapes and many sizes as we know qe unlike conventional monetary policy which aims so here's the contrast i want to make conventional monetary policy aims at the zero maturity riskless rate qe aims at longer maturities than zero or at some risky rates such as for example in the united states mbs mortgage-backed securities that's just an example it could in principle aim at a number of things so it is aiming either at the slope of the yield curve or at the risk spreads between whatever private security you're dealing with and treasuries not at the at the near end of the yield curve so again i asked a question analogous to the one i posed a few minutes ago why should central banks give up trying to influence the term premium or risk premia when and i have four last things and i have a minute plus the stop sign and then then you have the stop that had the two exclamation points i'll be i'll be finished before that first the funds rate is basically irrelevant to any meaningful economic activity that's the first point i could almost stop right there second point one of the greatest uncertainties afflicting actual conventional monetary policy was is and it i speak from experience here and there is a lot of the federal open market committee is in this audience and know that also one of the big uncertainties was always how the interest rates that really matter for economic activity would react to what we did to the federal funds rate those are the things we really cared about loan rates mortgage rates corporate bond rates and so on not the funds rate and third oh i think i said i had four i only have three david uh the claim that central banks should not be in the business of allocating capital which is what you hear all the time in particular about mbs and anything else that's in the private sector is really bogus because if you think about it just a little bit monetary policy has for decades if not forever worked its will on the real economy via two sectors housing and automobiles and as hillel might have said all the rest is commentary and it's not much commentary really almost the whole impact of monetary policy is on those two sectors when we tighten monetary policy we kill housing and we kill autos when we loosen monetary policy we give big boost to those two sectors so this whole idea that monetary policy pure conventional monetary policy is not allocative really has nothing behind it thanks [Applause]
