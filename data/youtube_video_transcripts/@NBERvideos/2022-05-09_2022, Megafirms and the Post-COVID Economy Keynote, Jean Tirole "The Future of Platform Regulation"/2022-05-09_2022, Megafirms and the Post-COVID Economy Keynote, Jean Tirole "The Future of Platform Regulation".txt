we have heard about all those big firms and we want to know how to handle them and and what i'm going to do is to list some of the challenges in doing that so when i grew up a while ago at mit taking dick's courses and paul kruskos courses that was simple so we had regulation of natural monopoly the rest was called antitrust and basically industrial policy was a source of shame for the family and and you know that technology has evolved and also we have neglected topics as usual and there is a blurring of lines uh between regulation and trust actually those platforms they look very much like utilities you know i mean that was said this morning several times low marginal costs high fixed costs at the same time we are seeing now a comeback of industrial policy and something that makes things interesting too given our currency of knowledge is that a lot of the challenges we face have to do with agreements among firms that otherwise compete so it's kind of competition stuff so firms which might compete actually may in various ways have to cooperate with each other uh we know that for iep sharing like patent pools cross licensing research on venture standard data pools tomorrow uh collective negotiation when you for example have a you know big a big supplier the buyers may want to get together you have common ownership i think florian is going oh bruno is going to talk about it this afternoon um lobbying when i say public good of course it's uh probably good from the point of view of the of the players who cooperate and you know there are actually efficiency reasons for doing all of that but uh there are also you know problems with that um so we want to know when whether you are get too little or too much cooperation in some some way and and we need a guiding principle and if possible information light rules and that's that's really a big challenge because you know sometimes we don't have quite the data to actually assess uh what to do okay um there is also a challenge for regulatory institutions uh um one is a bit on the side which is that uh all you know certain dominant platforms like google and and facebook are become media companies and of course that raises the issue of politics but more importantly for what i'm going to say the antitrust is not not that good nowadays because things are going very fast we don't have the data anti-choice is way too slow at the same time it's fair to say that all style regulation doesn't work either i mean actually we don't even try and there are good reasons for that that is two good reasons the first is that uh those are global firms if you saw the if you think about uh you know when i was taking this course you know that was simple there was a you know domestic attack a monopoly or electricity company or railroad company uh now they are global firms so who is going to regulate them what what would be the rate of return who is going who is in charge of uh actually getting cost recovery or the like uh the second issue is that uh it's moving fast you know the railroad technology has hasn't changed for 100 years or more whereas this is moving very fast and actually we don't follow the firms along their life cycle so sure you can say google makes a huge amount of money and we can discuss whether it's right or wrong but you know there's of course not everybody becomes a google and then you have to factor in the the property of success we have no clue about it it's a little bit like a drug in a sense you know uh you know if you wanted to do a rate of return regulation or performance-based regulation on drugs it's not that easy of course because you don't follow the firms for all those practices you worry about too much cooperation but we also worry about too little cooperation and one example of that is vertical contracting so typical uh typical uh feature is that you have a core i mean in the old time we would have called that an essential facility or a bottleneck or an upstream upstream infrastructure or something like that and those are two-sided markets all the big firms in the world nowadays are two-sided markets so they try to attract consumers and some sellers or some third-party merchants maybe it's in-house as well and that resists three kinds of issues uh the first is both actually on both sides you have the issue of transparency i'm going to cite eu examples because you know i think in europe we're a bit ahead in terms both of privacy regulation but also on detrust so they there's something about transparency are all those algorithms rank uh things i mean is that best thing for consumers or for the platform um then there is on the uh on the merchant side you have the issue of access fair compensation and on the core side there is the issue of contestability i mean can you have a new platform coming in and the core is defined in the recent dma the digital market act in a very wide way so it could be a search engine a marketplace an app store social network video sharing and so on um and we worry about you know contestability what we can we could do actually to make it such that an efficient entrant could enter and i will come back to that um now the chicago school of course says you know that's that's all right don't worry the platform has no incentive at least to to deny access to to the merchants or to the apps um or more generally to treat them badly because if it were to do that it is it will shoot itself in the foot uh if you have a better or richer ecosystem then you can charge more for to the consumer for access to the platform um and it's it's a little bit like modding in the mirror you know it's very wrong but at the same time it's very useful because it it forces you to structure your thinking and actually i i like it in a sense even so i completely disagree with it because it really makes you think now what's wrong with the chicago school argument um one of the thing is that you know the standard thing is that you know if you have better ecosystems for apps for example or complementary services then of course you can charge more to consumers uh on core services okay assuming you charge a positive price um of course when and that's that was the old story about regulation when your core services are regulated themselves you cannot raise a price on core services uh if you offer better apps or better complementary services a second issue is a chicago school argument is contestability and whether you know the the in the essential infrastructure might want to to remain an essential infrastructure and not be replaced by a competitor so you want to erect barriers to entry in the core market so one of the strategies you can use is to kill a number of apps or third-party apps so that if an entrant enters in the core market then there won't be apps uh to deal with so that the carlton wellness theory for example of apps barrier to entry the other thing that may happen is that you may want to acquire companies and those are preemptive mergers um and what's today a complimenter may actually become a competitor so you might buy either a substitute or a compliment because in both cases you might face a competitor in the car market to there so you know tomorrow and that was actually the the essence of the microsoft browser case uh regarding uh point b by the way when i learned io or economics that was simple there were complements and substitutes and that was so simple unfortunately there is no such thing as complements and substitutes and the the distinction is being blurred now because uh the products are they are morphed into new products so you know the complement may become a substitute there might be different usages you know you might be a compliment for someone switch it further and furthermore in a number of cases whether your complement or substitute depends on price um finally there are excities on third parties and that the case of uh best price uh guaranty or mfn cloud closes um and we'll discuss that later on okay so uh a little advertising for europe uh the digital market act uh which was just enacted and we focus is not not so much on on transparency and so you understand whether you get the best deal from from the pla from the recommendation but more on contestability and equity um so contestability kind of more efficient and trying to enter the core market and equity do the users in particular business users receive a fair share of their contribution to the ecosystem and do they have an equal access now if there is you know on the especially on the equity side there is this american innovation choice act which uh very much emulates um the dma so i'm not going to go through that now competition is big as you know um of course you have extreme cases so you could have pure player platforms like airbnb which doesn't own any apartment and therefore it's kind of neutral player it's it's a marketplace but not not a player in a complementary segment but that's pretty rare and you know most often you have some kind of competition where the platform is also uh in the market and not just operating the market and a market amazon marketplace is a good example but there are dowsers and the other extreme is of course vertical integration where you don't have any third-party suppliers now it's pretty rare as well but apple was as close as it comes through this kind of vertical integration okay so dma power you know talks also about uh protecting contestability um so you know besides this prohibition of tying between core services and other services um the dma also wants to uh allow multi-homing so no exclusive exclusivity requirement which makes a lot of sense of course you know if you think about huber versus lift if uber started asking exclusivity from the drivers i'm not sure how long lift will survive you know the drivers will go to uber and then the consumers will go to uber and of course the consumers can keep multi-homing uh also they do that more in the us actually than in europe i believe um so multi-homies is really the key but that has a number of implications so for example dma insists on the fact that business users should be able to indicate other channels through which they can the users can deal with them so facilitating this intermediation fascinating thing switching as well so imagine that you are a facebook customer um and you wonder whether you want to move to this new social network uh the question is whether uh yeah you have your pictures you have your posts and on facebook and so on so can you take them so technically it's feasible actually but there are issues i mean it's feasible for you but not for me because i'm i'm a wastebanks basket when it comes to computers but also you know i may want to leave facebook but i'm not sure i may want to multi-home or i may want to if i'm i'm not pleased with a new platform i want to come back to facebook so there is a dynamic portability which is important as well and dma is going in that direction i don't know the exact detail but it seems important there is this concern about data buyer to entry in the core market which uh dma is still a bit vapor but uh is trying to address uh by the prohibition of uh combining data from different sources obtained from from third parties i don't could be google it could be facebook i mean you know there will be restriction on facebook using data from whatsapp for example even even so that's the same same same business okay and then there's all this stuff about interoperability and you know that room that's rings about that goes back to the old telecom issues uh on on interoperability uh so that's actually interesting so contestability uh so when we grew up when i cam not you when i when i grew up there was vomal and ponza and willie graham which was uh insisting on it and run entry which gave you you know so basically it was it you could you know if you set a price which is above average cost or ram say price you know you an entrant can enter very quickly and charge a lower price of course usually prices we think of prices as being uh more flexible than investments but so any case that was uh that meant you know you can be a monopoly basically but not have any market power there are dynamic versions which are a bit more complicated where you have consumer inertia and network societies and the wealth effects are more complex because yeah for one thing if it's dynamic you get uh when when a new entrant enters the market and replaces uh at least replaces at least in part the incumbent then you have stranded consumers so the consumers of the of the incumbent actually have a lower net a smaller network and that's not very good um but there are benefits from contestability nonetheless uh because the incumbent left has to are kept on their toes um and that's basically boomer upon the really guy they have to charge low prices not because they they can be it enron entry but because they want to build a big network and erect virus to entry basically um if anyone they might also want to innovate now what's wrong with contestability theory it's not it's not that contestability i the id is wrong i mean actually it's it's good i mean if you can keep the incumbent on its toes it's wonderful but you know the efficient entrant may not be able to enter and that's you know that has to do with the barriers to entry uh or it may be able to enter but it's not going to enter because it's going to sell out to to the incumbent so that the defensive acquisition part okay so now six challenges for you i'm not sure i will cover the six but uh uh and i'm i'm sure you have you know in this laundry list i'm sure you have you have many other challenges that you are into us but yeah it's amazing how little we know uh and you know i think we we need both on the series side and on the ambiguous side we have to to make progress to help the policy makers uh deal with those so something which has been emphasized a lot in the last few years his most favorite nation clauses um and and there so i drew a diagram which is on a diagram thing of the platform as being being booking for example and you are a booking user and then you you you book a hotel or something like that um it's a nice service you get you you find what you want the problem is that the the hotel will have to pass at twenty percent of the hotel room price to to booking um now fine but the hotel will have to pass through this uh this this uh this fee this merchant fee uh and then um it might pass it through the uh to the booking customers but unfortunately booking is going to insist on the most fair nation close so that you cannot charge more to booking customers and you charge to to an expedia customer or or if you have a direct sale so that's one of the rare trick um rare cases in which actually you can tax your competitors and i think it's a wonderful idea you know that's a that's a dream for any firm to be able to tax the competitors because you know those 20 percent will be actually paid a little bit by your own consumer but will be paid by all consumers so that has raised some uh some questions of course i it's all we already face the issue with with payment cards by the way because we have the no surcharge rule which is basically a similar id um and this is this is a very uh basic and by the way it's going to be all over the place i mean you know your your alexa your your personalized alexa your personal assistant of course is is there not only to get data from you but also to charge a doctor you're going to call or the pizza which will be delivered to your home that's what it's about you know um so and that's been reaction to that especially in europe so so for example actually emmanuel macron six years ago went against the mfns but similar things were done in germany in italy in the uk and in sweden basically by saying no you are no longer able to use mfns it's it's it's not allowed sometimes uh the platform decided to abundant mfns actually i think in the us amazon doesn't use any fence anymore um so it's voluntary now if you think about why it's voluntary one of the reasons is that actually the prohibition of family offense is actually pretty uh ineffective it's pretty ineffective because um you know the merchants still even so they are not forced to give a best price guarantees they de facto give a best price guarantee because they are very concerned about being delisted so you know if if amazon actually sees that you are charging much less on another platform then amazon will delete you and at least that's there's some evidence of that um a resolve and lee paper i guess but they you know people have said that informally that you know you don't want to get into violation of m offense because otherwise you'll be you know the algorithm is not going to recommend you anymore the other thing which is you don't even have to make it implicit actually you create you create preferred merchant programs and you say okay you agree to my friends and then in exchange you'll rank higher in the algorithm and since it's an option you you are not forced to do it it's an option so it's legal that's kind of funny i mean but anyway the other issue with the prohibition of mfns is that actually they have also good features i mean i don't like mfns but they also have good features which is that they protect against old ups all that either by the consumer or by the pla by the merchant so the case of older by the consumer is the old showrooming argument which has been used uh to explain rpm for example to validate that to vindicate rpm um so i go to booking i'm looking for a hotel room in boston and and then i found the exact hotel i wanted and then i called the hotel directly because it will be cheaper on the hotel website so it's basically expropriating booking but conversely the merchant can expropriate you so just like you know if you if you book a flight on a low cost for for twenty dollars and then you notice that you have to pay fifteen percent uh fifteen dollars on your credit card payment or something like that after spending half an hour calling your family and and filling out all the forms and then you discover in the last screen of course that you have to pay for using a payment card so that your the reverse hold up so in a sense my friends have some good properties and the challenge i mean this is for you the challenge is really to find better regulations than just prohibition which as i said don't work very well and to do that you'll you'll have to take two-sided markets seriously which almost every court now uh pretends to do so yeah i'm afraid we get a lot of citations from them from the courts but when you when you look at the details um that they explain you know they often explain actually it's one market it's not on you know there's not a market for consumer in a market for merchants it's actually one market so far so good but then they say what matters is a total price you know whether in two-state markets the important thing is the allocation between the two sites um anyway um so what one of the things which is difficult but would be much better would be some kind of price regulation so you regulate the price of access so you know is 20 booking or 30 percent apple uh fee is this the right level okay well that was addressed for for payment cards um which is uh basically putting a cap on surcharging right in some countries um and in the user actually use uh a pigovian approach why piggon because the one who decides whether to use a payment card you know if it's if it's accepted by the merchant is actually the consumer so basically the idea is to have the consumer internalized externality on the merchant it's called the convenience benefit and it's it has been that's called a tourist test in the literature but basically it's it's being used by the eu but this is one of the rare examples where they try to get that some price uh regulation of the access price which is a very standard issue in regulation but you know in in in io is is less so and and there is a recent paper which goes a little bit beyond in which in a case in which the platform also brings information so you you go beyond the convenience benefit and you you had the informational benefit um but but the truth is that we know very little about those things so the future of of regulation here is going to be to we have to work on so let me say a little bit more on regulating access because there is an analogy with with the old cell regulation um a standard issue about self-referencing is basically um you have some consumers who have access to the infrastructure and then in fact infrastructure gives them access to an app or an app store okay and you know the idea for example is that you might actually uh give a free access to the core infrastructure say to apple for example to ios to the ios you give access to a rival app store and then the consumer will have a lot of choice but you know the big impact of course is that the core services will have to be paid by charging the consumer because you won't make money on complementary services anymore so there will be this let me be a bit more precise so actually i'm not going to take an app so i'm going to assume a single app um you have a consumer who has a willingness to play sita uh for the app uh for the in-house app um and so but we will access this app through the core the rival app is a little bit more efficient so actually it's offering a surplus sita plus plus delta and will charge on price p2 for for for the service and then us approach our set p1 now the question is whether the core is go at what price the core is going to give access to the rival app the internal price is zero of course the transfer price internal is zero but you can give a lin you can have a linear access price small a or a fixed fee capital a okay now in general we prefer small a because that that allows more more entrants to enter in the app market as a because capital a would be like a fixed cost of entering um also capital a may be difficult to compute if you don't know the size of the market or all those kinds of things now there may be i'll come back to that there may be some investment cost i which is smaller than the extra benefit for society of having this rival app so there is an issue about entry by the arrival app and in general you will have some benefit b per consumer so you might think about the benefit b as being a consumer benefit from core services so in the old telecom example that was a look you were using local communication and the app was a long distance service right but now it's it's a bit different and actually it makes a difference is that the benefit from actually one more consumer may not be uh this consumer benefiting from the core service but rather the the app actually making money from advertising or from data collection or something else and that's much more common nowadays which means basically that the app has a negative cost as a negative marginal cost okay and i'll come back to that in in a minute uh the total value to keep it to be captured by is basically b which is the benefit plus theta plus delta okay that's that's what you can capture minus i if there is an investment cost okay now in a sense that looks very much like the old style regulation of access that we developed in the 90s but with a few twists um um so let me let me maybe start with the competitive neutrality stuff so let's go back to this thing what happens when you change the access charge small a well the conventional wisdom is that nothing happens or not very little happens why because when say you decrease a the excess charge then you decrease the marginal cost of the rival app but you also decrease the opportunity cost of the in-house hub okay so if the access charge is smaller then the core is going to be a more aggressive competitor because it gets very little money on access at the same time the rival app is also going to be more aggressive because its marginal cost is smaller and on that it has no impact so in that sense the excess charge is neutral okay well let me let me issue a few caveats and by the way if you reduce the excess charge you can make it up by increasing p0 so not only the competition between the apps is not going to change but on top of that you can make up by increasing p0 in general now some caveats the first caveat is that you might say okay let's let's let the platform choose the excess charge okay now once the arrival app has enter it's going to choose an excess charge like delta equal to delta right so it's big it is basically going to capture the extra profit of the of the end threat um so that's what's going to happen but of course if the investment cost for the rival app is positive then then it's you know basically it's going to expropriate the the the innovator and and then you know there will be no entry now notice that there is attention exports and excellent because excellent the platform is very happy to commit not to charge more than delta minus i because that will allow the the rival app to enter whereas you know if there is no such commitment so actually the regulator is helping the platform in some way like helping excellently not exposed by capping the access price the other thing that that that may happen which violates this neutrality stuff is that this is zlb zero lower bound uh this is not a macro torque but uh the zlb is very important in io uh it's very hard to charge negative prices uh because of arbitrage and what happens is when you start lowering the excess price um then you are going to basically face the zero price constraint and then this neutrality will break down because you'll get to that bound where you cannot reduce the price even further um and that will be particularly true in the second case in which um you know there's a profit from the consumer using the app because in that case the um the you know the the rival app is going to make a lot of profit because it's going to capture the consumer is going to get b and possibly delta out of that so if you lower the excess charge you are going to end up with basically the price constraint the zero load bound constraint and that's going to imply lots of things so and that's actually what's well known in regulation which is that you are going to substitute an acce to the excess charge which has reached its limit um you are going to substitute basically non-price uh foreclosure and that's that's all debate about telecoms you know there was a huge amount of non-price foreclosure and the same thing is going to happen here and you know that relates a number of complaints against many of those giants so i don't i don't know so what i'm saying is that you know this this idea that uh the extra charge is neutral it's like again it's like uh you know modical and emilia in a sense you know it's it gives you a good idea of what's going on and but then you when you dig a bit further you you notice that it's not quite like that um okay defensive murder so defensive merger some of you in the room actually are much of much more expertise than i do so this standard merger review is targeting substitutes uh with the standard tools um but what we have seen more and more in the drug industry but also in in the tech industry is that the big guys are purchasing emerging firms and the burden of proof has has been very difficult for authorities how can you prove that it's an anti-competitive merger it's impossible you know the start of the example of whatsapp and instagram being purchased by facebook there was no data and that's true from for many things um and by the way that gives an incentive actually for the platforms to acquire very early to make sure there is no data around and the other issue which i want to mention is that should we just focus on substitutes given that in the digital world at least the attack is often from the side rather than frontal i mean because of network scientists it's not easy to attack facebook like this you may want to produce some a compliment or something like that and then spotify for example and then you move into into the social network business yeah the products change over time and that's very important now i don't know if i'm right i'm personally in favor of reversing the burden of proof for the dominant platforms and actually that's what the dma does i mean basically the the gatekeeper will have to notify their acquisition and and there can be some objections to the merger now understand their efficiency defenses as well some of them i don't think are very convincing so for example you know oh we are we are doing this merger because we need talent we are going to purchase talent i mean this talent will not go unemployed anyway you know if it doesn't go to facebook it will go to microsoft or whatever i mean come on um they also say oh yeah but if you if if you cannot sell out to a big firm you kill the exit mechanism in venture capital um well you know first we don't know whether the is bidder is necessarily the socially desirable acquirer but there are also other exit mechanisms like an ipo i understand it's less less common but yeah but you also have other platforms uh we may not want to go too far because if we say every big platform none of the big platforms could be possibly a competitor uh given this broad notion that complements actually may become substitutes then you may actually kill the the acquisition market but you know if they tell you we are buying because it's a compliment um one of the things you can object is okay but do you really need to acquire if you are worried about double monetization do you need to acquire this firm or can you just have some kind of uh i mean there are of course uh anti-trust possible hundred trust concern but theoretically you could agree on a price cap and actually if you have two compliments you can achieve exactly the same same same thing as integration by basically committing to price caps um because you avoid double marginalization that way and then of course you know in some cases you want to provide a seamless experience and that that's quite right okay so that that's actually um a big issue collective agreements that's another important thing on which we have to give some advice so competitors may get together for joint marketing or trans standard setting for collective negotiation so the collective negotiation will be more on on the other side of the buyers side and we always worry about whether it's exercise of countervailing power which might not be bad or it's a boycott of course and boy boycotts are illegal of course um and yeah for all those things we need to uh to have some kind of advice for for decision makers on on what to do and you know i think much more work is needed on that so a small start we did with josh on trying to look for rules which do not require information and make it less likely that agreements beyond anti-competitive so you see uses of things like independent licensing for patent pools price commitment prior to uh the finalization of the standard in the case of of standards and you know this other essential pattern stuff um but that kind of stuff that we need to develop in order to make it easier for for integer societies to deal with those cases given they don't have much time to decide they may not have the expertise and especially they may not have the data um yeah you have patents you create a patent pool what are you know what are your data to decide whether substitute or or or compliments and are they going to status substitutes and complements blah blah blah it's actually kind of difficult okay same thing yeah here i'm common ownership that will be discussed and you know this is um we don't need any new law by the way to fight common ownership abuses because we already have the laws we have been having them for a long time but we need guidelines and you know some people have made proposals on that so again you know it starts with a good idea you want you want if you have mutual funds you want to have diversification and you want to it's good for for the consumers at the same time of course you can create cartels here and there so we need we need to have rules which are going to to make sure that commonership is not going to to come in the way of that data well there are lots of issues with database to entry relationships to privacy and so on now economists have uh have worked a fair amount on the price discrimination so degree by discrimination by those firms which which have a lot of data because they know your willingness to pay and therefore they can charge your price which is correspond to your willingness to pay basically extract your surplus that may be become more difficult with the digital market act uh where gatekeepers may be prohibited uh from reusing internal data um so let's start out so degree price discrimination there's also the issue about the exploitation of our cognitive weaknesses and intel and internalities so we're worried about the platform and unloading layman's onto people who don't have a clue and it's not very hard you know people you know the platform i'm sure know quite well that i don't have a clue about most of the stuff and you can exploit me very easily and and and dump the elements but you know there's the issue about using our impulsiveness we know we click all the time or we want to buy and ship fast and blah blah blah and of course they use that quite a lot by the way another act in your europe which is called the artificial intelligence act which is not enacted yet will forbid any action that will circumvent uh the user's free will now what does it mean of course you know that that has been existing for for a long time you know every every french bakery is actually putting some smell of croissant in the street and that's really circumventing your free will right um so i don't know exactly what they mean by that but that sounds important and there are other traditional issues the breakdown of insurance because there is an airship the right to be forgotten the argument algorithmic fairness i mean lots of stuff we we should be working on and bring solution uh some i don't know about the us in but in europe it's very popular to think about data trusts i mean you know in a sense data is ultimate public good right we would like those data to to be um to be public consistent with privacy of course um and therefore we should have data pool there's a there's a worry and google and and so on by top checks that actually they have invested to get those data um other people think that the consumers have invested to give their data but anyway but then i'll do that i mean assuming that you solve the privacy issue how do you determine the access to this data pool will it be for free but then how do you reward the contributors to this data pool if you can reward them what price yeah you know what is the value of data i mean we know it's highly consumer specifically format specific early and then the the analysis is very important but the analysis i guess everybody will agree there will be a property right on that the sixth point is initial policy which is really making a comeback and you know that's another thing we we should be working on i think whether we like it or not it's going to exist and and we have to make it more more efficient so okay so let me that would take too long so let me let me stop here
