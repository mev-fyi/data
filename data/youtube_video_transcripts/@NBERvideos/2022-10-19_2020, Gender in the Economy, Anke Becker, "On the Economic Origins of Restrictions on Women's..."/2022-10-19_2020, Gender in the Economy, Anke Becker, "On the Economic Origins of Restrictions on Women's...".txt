okay hello everyone um thank you so much to the organizers for including my paper um on the economic origins of restrictions on women's sexuality in this really wonderful program um so this paper focuses on Norms and Customs that presumably aim at reducing women's incentives or women's ability to seek out extramarital Affairs so what are examples of such customs and Norms one very common manifestation are restrictions on a women's freedom of Mobility so think about any rule about whether a woman can leave the house by herself or at all or um rules about how far she can go uh away from the house and so on and so forth so how does this work how does this reduce her incentive or her ability to seek out experimental Affairs well it clearly are such restrictions clearly prevent her either from meeting potential Partners in the first place or it reduces her ability to freely interact with them the second very common manifestation are social norms restrictive social norms about women's sexuality so think about social disapproval of women's promiscuity or a social desirability um of of of women's virginity when entering marriage and so on and so forth in particular double standards between men and women about these things things how does this work well presumably through the internalization of such values it often also comes with social monitoring or increased social sanctions of such Behavior then finally what I study in this paper is a very specific custom chord and fibrillation it's the most invasive form of female genital cutting where the vaginal opening gets sutured closed and one one key feature of undergoing this procedure is that it makes vaginal penetration painful so this clearly reduces the upsides of having an extramarital affair and I think it's really important to understand these different customs and Norms because they clearly have negative Downstream consequences for women for example in terms of health this is very obvious in the case of female genital cutting but more generally any restriction about um how freely a woman can interact with men outside of the family clearly negatively impacts her um potential to to get an education um enter her ability to freely participate in the labor market so the question that I ask in this paper is why why do we practice such customs and Norms why do they evolve what is the underlying function or psychology behind them and um I make use of or I test an evolutionary theory that argues that all of these different customs and Norms around the world serve the same underlying function which is reducing paternity uncertainty so paternity uncertainty is a key Concept in this paper it is essentially a fundamental difference in information between between men and women so uh in their certainty about how related they are to their uh to their children so as a woman I always know that I'm related to my child but for men there's some degree of uncertainty and in particular this uncertainty varies across individuals across situations or presumably also across societies and the the prime example for high paternity uncertainty is male absence because women are absent they cannot monitor the behavior of women and so there's more uncertainty about it and this is important because um when men invest into children they have an incentive to decrease paternity uncertainty and as the flip side of this coin with male investment women also have an incentive to Signal their faithfulness [Music] um so so the key idea that analyzed this paper is that in pre-industrial times modes of subsistence differed in how uncertain paternity was um and in particular I argue that when you subsisted on pastoralism so when you subsisted on having domesticated animals that need to be taken out of pasture then paternity uncertainty was particularly high as opposed to say when you subsisted on on agriculture and this is because pastoralism or the comes with these these frequent and often extended periods of male absence right so so taking the hurt outer pastors is the defining feature of pastoralism these pasture grounds might be far away uh so you might be gone for a couple of days in a row in some cases even weeks and even if the the pasture grounds are close to Camp you often have to stay out at night to protect the animals from predators or from thieves and the more you rely on pastoralism um the more you also rely on traits trade for agricultural products so you frequently have to go to the market which which might be far away or which will be far away frequently um and importantly historical data really nicely shows that pastoralism in the vast majority of societies historically was um done by men and not by women so it's men that are absent and not women okay so the hypothesis that I test in this paper is that pastoralism historically favored the adoption of these different customs and Norms that restrict women's sexuality so it favored the adoption of infibulation restrictive Norms about women's sexual behavior or Customs that restrict women in their freedom of mobility and these norms and Customs than presumably have persisted until today so in a nutshell what I will do is I would show that variation in adherence to these Customs at the individual level today is predicted by how strongly individuals historically relied on pastoralism so I'm showing in this paper that in within country analyzes so always only comparing women who live in the same country today it is women who descend from ethnic groups that historically relied more on pastoralism that are more restricted in their freedom of Mobility today that adhere to more restrictive Norms about promiscuity and that are more likely to be infibulated and I provide um a causal interpretation to these results by relying on an instrumental variable approach uh making use of the fact that variation in historical Reliance on pastoralism is largely determined by ecological conditions and I also provide some um evidence that the mechanism Behind These findings is really male absence rather than potential alternative explanations such as male dominance over women per se or differences in historical Economic Development so the main idea I already said this is to predict contemporary individual level variation in adherence to these customs with how strongly these individuals relied historically on pastoralism so the Contemporary data on adherence to these different customs and Norms comes from the standard demographic and health surveys these are really awesome um nationally representative household surveys that have been conducted in about 90 countries since 1984. and one focuses women's empowerment and women's health so it has some measures for how strongly individuals are restricted in their freedom of Mobility um some proxies for Norms are Norm adherents about women's promiscuity and it also has measures or questions about female genital cutting okay and so based on information on respondents ethnicity I simply combine this individual level contemporary data with ethnicity level historical data on pastoralism and this historical um ethnicity level data comes from the ethnographic atlas um that is an anthropological database that has been widely used in economics as well um and so this essentially um is a collection of ethnographic information on more than 1 200 ethnic groups around the world okay and so using this database I generate a measure for pastoralism by combining information from two variables one um is um information on whether it was a herd animal that was the predominant animal in an ethnic group so herd animals are for example cattle sheep goats horses donkeys Rangers and camels um examples of of domesticated animals that are not hurt animals are for example pigs or poultry dogs Pals um and so I combine an indicator for whether it was a herd animal with information about how strongly an ethnic group relied on animal husbandry more generally and so down here you see this the measure that I generate then is is historical Reliance on pastoralism and you can think of this simply as an estimate of the percentage of calories that an ethnic group gets from Castor oilism and as opposed to say from agriculture okay and so what I do is then I in my um in my individual level contemporary database I simply assign each individual their ethnic groups historical Reliance on pastoralism and in total this gives me a sample of about half a million women who are descended from descendants from 275 different ethnic groups and who live in 35 different countries today and so what is the within country variation um that I make use of so um you on the one hand you can think of really large countries like Uganda where both historically and contemporarily um you have you have people from many many different ethnic groups so in Uganda in my sample I think I have um uh women from more than 25 different ethnic groups on the other hand you can think of tiny countries like Moldova in Europe where um simply due to migration I um I I have a lot of variation in in my sample so I'm all about today uh in the sample are women of Bulgarian Montenegro and Romania and Russia and Ukrainian and so on and so forth descent okay so the Baseline regression specification that I'm estimating is I regress a measure y so some some uh proxy for adherence to um one of these Customs or Norms that I'm interested in that I observe at the individual level I um that I observe for an individual I who is a descendant from an ethnic group J and I regress this on ethnic group J's historical Reliance on pastoralism always holding fix the country um often individual okay sorry always holding fix the country um and since time is short I'm not going to show you all the the results I'm just going to show you two results one for restrictions on women's freedom of Mobility so I proxy how strongly a woman is restricted in her freedom of Mobility by making use of the four the four following questions one do you think is being justified if a wife goes out without telling her husband yes or no um is your husband jealous if you talk to other men yes or no who decides about visits to relatives is that you alone or your husband alone or you and your husband together um and does your husband insist on no uh insist on knowing where you are yes so um regressing my generated restrictions on freedom of Mobility score on historical Reliance on pastoralism I find in line with my hypothesis that a one standard deviation increase in historical Reliance on pastoralism increases this um restrictions on freedom of Mobility score by 3.4 percentage points and across the three main specifications here in columns one two three um this this uh coefficientness is pretty stable and uh so in columns two and three I simply add controls that are exogenous at the individual and at the um historical ethnicity level column four you is is uh probably not the most um appropriate specification you can think of this as a kitchen sink regression where I add a lot of controls both at the individual and historical ethnicity level uh many of which are presumably are very plausibly endogenous um okay and then um as a second illustration of my main results I'm going to show you the results for infibulation so here um the measure is really simple it's simply an indicator that takes value one if a woman says she has undergone this this procedure this sample is much smaller since this question is only asked in 13 countries um where female genital cutting is practiced and so my sample here is only about 80 000 women in line with my hypothesis I find that a one standard deviation increase in an individual's historical Reliance on pastoralism increases the likelihood that a respondent is infibulated today by 6.7 percentage points and again the coefficient is pretty stable across these three main specifications in column one two three and also um it's quite sizable if I compare the coefficient to um the the unconditional mean of being infibulated in this sample is about 10 percent okay so um oh yeah and since time is short I'm not going to show you the results for uh adherence to social norms about promiscuity here I find similar results in line with the hypothesis for um nor materials proxied by either statements about about yeah about Norm materials or by um by actual Behavior okay now um let me just briefly uh mention the instrumental variable approach so crucial for identification clearly is the question what determines variation in historical Reliance on pastoralism uh turns out that variation in historical Reliance on pastoralism is largely determined by nature and so what I then do is I generate a measure for land suitability for pastoralism and use this as an instrument and the resulting the the IV results that I find are largely consistent with my OLS results so this gives empirical support for a causal interpretation of these results okay and this is just an illustration of the data online suitability um and then finally just just let me briefly mention a few Placebo exercises that I um that I run in order to provide evidence for the idea that the mechanism behind my findings is really male absence so um I mean the idea is that of course male absence is not the only feature that characterizes pastoralism as opposed to say agriculture but there are other aspects of course by which pastoralism differs from these other forms of subsistence so one is um that pastoralism is also a very male dominated form of subsistence um so it's mainly done by women sorry it's mainly done by men so it could simply be that all of these customs and Norms are simply um a consequence of men being economically very dominant over women uh for whatever reason that that might result then but um so what I simply do is I use a diff another form of subsystems subsistence that is also very major dominated um which is plow agriculture so I'm plow agriculture you need a lot of upper body strength and work by um Alberto the C9 and Paula Juliano has has shown this that um that this has consequences for labor market participation for example of women so I use plow agriculture as a placebo and find that um that there's no relationship between plow Agriculture and adherence to these customs and Norms suggesting that mayor dominance alone does not generate my results okay second um aspect by which pastoralism for example differs from agriculture is historical Economic Development again I even use other proxies for historical Economic Development as a placebo and do not find any relationship between these variables and adherence to these Norms suggesting again that historical economic development is not behind my findings and then finally it could be that that my findings are simply something about having domesticated animals more generally right and so um when I use animal husbandry with other domesticated animals so with domesticated animals that are not taken out to pasture so like pigs or poultry or fowls or dogs and as a placebo and again I I do not find any relationships so having domesticated animals per se again is also not behind my findings and to conclude what this paper shows is that it is women from ethnic groups that historically relied more on pastoralism that they are more likely to be restricted in their freedom to interact with men and so I think this this provides evidence for the idea that these restrictions can be understood as adaptations to historical opportunity uncertainty um and what I think is is an important finding from this paper is that concerns about women's Chastity are an important motivation behind behavior that is economically really relevant um and so um in a follow-up paper for example I uh now study the relationship between these concerns over women's Chastity and female entrepreneurship are um in in different countries okay and so comments are super welcome um and uh yeah thank you so much
