um i hope everyone has their second wind or third win for some more um afternoon talks so let's let's transition now um to talking about welfare analysis with um less standard policy instruments so um so far we've spent a lot of time talking about taxes and kind of touched on questions oh i forgot recording i touched on questions about um regulation um a lot of the time though and i um you know especially more in kind of popular press and the media what you see is a lot of discussion around um non-financial instruments and ones that are not also kind of con bans um and hard regulations so things around kind of social norms provision how efficient are you relative to your neighbors um various kinds of warning labels and various other kinds of ways to presumably convey information to people um oftentimes these kinds of instruments are described as nudges where i think the presumed definition is that these are instruments that are designed to affect choice without really affecting people's opportunities i'm not going to use that word because as we'll become more clear as i go through some basic theory and talk more about measurement and what we should be looking out for i think there are very few of any instruments that plausibly satisfy such a definition now alternatively you might say such a definition is too stringent but then the question is what is a proper definition that is kind of intellectually um useful for us so i'm so you know this is what people often refer to as not just i'm not gonna use that word just um so we're on the same page here um but the kinds of examples that i have in mind here are things like information provisions social comparisons reminders various ways of reframing decisions um defaults which doug will talk about later um advertising and so forth um there are various other kinds of notions that i won't touch on much except in how they relate the kind of concepts of wealth the kinds of formulas i'll show you in a few minutes such as libertarian paternalism and asymmetric paternalism and we'll also argue that these kinds of notions are not quite what we are want when we're thinking about rigorous modeling and measurement um but part of the popularity of these um kinds of policy instruments and why they're also often discussed is because there are a number of so-called nudging its um starting with the united kingdom and the usa and now many many different countries where the idea is to design these various kinds of instruments to achieve certain kinds of goals and they do often run randomized controlled trials which is great okay so let's think about um let's start with an economic formulation of how we might think about these policy instruments and where i actually want to take off is the formula that you already saw from hunt okay so when we think about the impact of one kind of policy instrument which is just a simple tax on welfare and this is the welfare that results from one particular type theta again what do we think about well we think about the corrective term we think about the impact on revenues through the fiscal externality so the substitution effect and then we think about the mechanical effect on consumer surplus and the mechanical effect on government budget nothing i just described about those three terms is such that these three terms really concern only tax instruments or in fact only financial instruments um or you know anything that we would describe as a standard instrument in economics in fact consider any kind of intervention of size sigma and consider either amplifying it or making it a little bit smaller now marginal changes and certain kinds of interventions are a little bit unrealistic but let's just go with this for now for just um thinking about the concepts um it's the same thing they're really kind of like three things we always think about we think about what is the impact on behavior and how that generates um corrective um benefits hopefully corrective benefits we think about the impact on revenue um now what might revenue mean here for an arbitrary instrument well there's a few things going on one is you are getting people to change their behavior so if there's a tax in place okay that substitution is still going to generate similar kinds of physical externalities two is you might think about um other kinds of interactions with other kinds of instruments that are in place and how that might affect revenue through the substitution effect and then there are similarly mechanical effects so let's say that we're talking about something like advertising the more you amplify advertising the more it costs that is exactly analogous to what we think about with taxes or subsidies the higher the subsidy the more it costs so it's a similar kind of effect and then there's a direct effect on consumer surplus so here i just call that an aversiveness term it doesn't necessarily have to be positive it could be negative because certain kinds of interventions might make consumers feel good but that's directly analogous um to how we think about the mechanical effect on consumer surplus right if a consumer can um generally purchases five units of something you increase the tax by dollar what is a consumer's mechanical aversion to that it's five dollars worth okay um same thing here except you can think of more generally about the direct effect on consumer surplus so again this is just a generalization and kind of at a high level you can really think about any kind of intervention this way and then all of the same questions the ones that was talking about before lunch come up we want to think about the relationship between treatment effects and bias so i was just talking about tax elasticities but more generally we're just talking about treatment effects and bias and how they relate to each other we want to be careful about consumers aversiveness or enjoyment of the intervention and we're talking about fiscal externalities and costs of implementation let me do something a little bit more specific this was a little bit more general than this helpful let's just consider a little bit more of a concrete setup where we have consumers who have a unit demand for a good x so they purchase it or not if they get it they derive utility v sub theta we have bias and again i'm thinking about bias in exactly the same way we're talking about money metric it's the vertical difference between a market demand curve and the demand curve that we have and what we specified as the welfare relevant domain and we have treatment effects given by taus of theta so that on post treatment consumers purchase the good of v plus gamma plus taus larger than its price and the utility they derive as v minus p minus um this aversiveness without the intervention they just purchase it if b plus gamma is larger than the price and the utility they derive is v minus p we have some producers in the background and for purposes of what i'm going to talk about today let's just ignore redistributive concerns okay so what does it look like so if we have an intervention with treatment effects taos of beta um in the absence of any other kind of policy namely in the absence of a tax that we might also be using to try to correct behavior um what are the welfare benefits of this well um it's really about the second moment so think about gamma plus tau is kind of post-treatment bias it's the extent to which information might have helped people make better decisions and sorry there's a theta missing here and this is kind of the pre-treatment bias so what we're really looking at here is just the difference in the second moments of post-treatment versus pre-treatment bias and then we have this aversiveness term in the background and then of course it scales by demand um what is the intuition well the intuition is just the cost of bias is quadratic in the bias so we're kind of applying a bunch of kind of hardware approximations um kind of type by type here and now we're taking the average okay so it's the extent to which the distortion from bias is reduced um post treatment okay now if you have a syntax in place and you can set it optimally using the kind of formula um that you saw before launch okay that's exactly what's going on in the background we're setting a tax to equal the average marginal bias um there's a similar formulation for how helpful um this alternative intervention is with an optimally set text and it's given by the difference in variances now so we're basically now we're demeaning everything so it's kind of the mean second moments that we're looking at which is intuitive because the tax has to equal the average marginal bias to kind of taking that all out you're taking out the average and now we're talking about these um the demean technologies which are just the variances okay so um i will illustrate the intuition behind these equations with some very simple examples but let me make just one high-level statement now which is what is an intervention that produces good behavior change it's not an intervention that has a large average treatment effect period it's an intervention rather that has attractive properties in terms of what it does to second moments and i just want to pause here so think about all of the nudge papers that you might have seen that are all about average treatment effect and look at these formulas it's not about the average of tau it's about what tau does to the second moment and it's particularly relevant um or i think this what i'm saying here has especially large byte when we're looking at the second equation here where we're looking at the difference in variances this is just completely um orthogonal to the first moment you know here what we're talking about here when we're talking about the second moment this is the variance plus the mean the average treatment effect squared so there is a sense in which the average human effect enters into this formula although it's not the same thing but there's a very profound sense in which the average treatment has nothing to do um with the welfare consequences of um a knot of an intervention when we can also set the syntax optimally so these issues are around targeting um roughly speaking and i'll illustrate this the second thing of course that we have to think about is the extent to which this intervention has direct um uh consequences to people's utilities so when we're thinking about social norms interventions where you're being compared to your neighbors you might feel really bad when you learn that you're doing a lot less for the environment than your neighbors are and even things that are somewhat innocuous or seemingly innocuous like that food plate that you saw um that might make you feel bad too sometimes you just want to enjoy your dinner not think about nutrition information can have very powerful effects on people's experience and we shouldn't just um assume that away we don't have to assume that it's the case but it'd be nice to kind of have a um framework where we can take it seriously and where we can try to measure it so those are the things we really should be thinking about beyond just average treatment effects we need to be asking what is happening to the second moments and we should be asking what is the direct effect on people's utility from things like i'm feeling guilty i'm feeling bad i'm feeling kind of shamed or on the positive side i actually feel really proud maybe get this mailer and i learn wow i thought i wasn't doing so well in energy con for con conservation but i'm doing so much better than my environmentalist neighbors now i have this nice glow and that's something that should be taken into account as well okay let me give you a simple example to make some of these issues concrete this is a very simple one um let's say we have consumers purchasing purchasing sugary drinks and either they greatly overestimate um the kind of um they purchase sugar drinks way more than they should because they are oblivious about health costs or we have some health conscious consumers who you know either they they definitely don't over purchase them maybe they even under purchase them because the health costs are kind of salient um and their mind may be more salient than other considerations that um they should be taking into account now let's say we have a sugar warning label that actually you know on average it does decrease consumption of the sugary drinks um but through what channels well the consumers who over consume sugary drinks because they are oblivious to health information you know there's a reason why they're oblivious to health information because they ignore the labels like this um so they're not going to react to the label the health conscious consumers well they're very very health-conscious you know to the degree that once you re-highlight sugar for them maybe they become over-sensitized okay and so they might they are the ones who are actually reacting to the label so in the end what we have is a policy that in some sense it seems to move behavior in the right direction because we are in a population that on average over consumes for great drinks and we do have a policy that on average reduces consumption of sugary drinks but it's terrible this is a terrible terribly terribly inefficient um policy to implement because it does exactly the wrong thing and where is that reflected it is exactly reflected in the second moments because what it does is it only amplifies the difference in the misperceptions of marginal utility of consumption between the health conscious and the oblivious consumers any questions yes please how much does context matter because in the u.s we don't have sugar warning labels so i remember there's like like mexico i think it's like it's a norfolk that have trigger warning labels and so does that like does like the frame of reference matter for this uh and how like how we think about the treatment effect is this a question about short run versus longer run effects you know they're kind of like what would happen if we put in a sugar warning label in the us versus took away the sugar rewarding label and yeah exactly mexican yeah i mean that's a good question i think um [Music] short run effects might differ from longer on effects because people might initially maybe react more to the information for example if something new happens you happen to pay attention to it so maybe the kind of example i'm giving here is potentially more relevant for shorter round effects the long run effects but i don't know i mean overall i agree that's a good question and that's something that i think the literature has started addressing a little bit um but we should be thinking about this very hard um in part because i think there's a lot of interesting psychology and economics that um would suggest why short run and longer run effects could be different and also the intersection with like cultural arts which is a factor that we haven't thinking about yet yes i think yes yeah and mexican so i know it's actually they've recently changed them completely and now they put so many labels that everybody's like of course this has five labels like this like one black symbol for everything that's wrong with this so now everything has four or five seasons i think example three might capture what was going on let's let's let me come back to this with my example i think i you actually have a nice description for motivation for my example three any other comments or questions okay um let me do um before i get to the example three i'm promising let me do example two let's now consider a population that is homogeneously biased um and let's say we have an intervention that changes bias um to zero so um quote unquote d biases half of the consumers and it does nothing to the other half okay so you might think this is kind of a model um asymmetric paternalism or libertarian paternalism you know it didn't help everyone but it unambiguously improved the decision quality of half of the people in the population um here's my claim with if you can optimally set syntax as this intervention as welfare decreasing why yeah exactly exactly when bias is homogeneous you can set a tax equal to that bias and you recover the first best what this intervention did is it generated heterogeneity and bias because now half of the people are biased and half are not so it doesn't no matter what you do now with the tax you will not get to the first best anymore and where is that captured um well it's captured in you know this is a very simple example of why we should be thinking about variances right the variance pre-intervention is zero the variance post-intervention is positive questions okay here's the third example and this is the one it sounds like let's say the intervention is in an average sense um actually offsetting the bias um so if you are a consumer with um bias of size gamma theta on average the treatment effect is going to be negative gamma theta okay so that looks pretty good um but um it's kind of confusing and you know that's just an app that's just a conditional average you know there's five different labels and you know there's basically noise around this some sometimes on i will over some data types will overreact some will under react and the way that i'm modeling this is with this epsilon term which is mean zero right so again conditionally um there's a sense in which kind of the conditional average of this intervention is really in the right direction but there's just this noise term epsilon here okay so it almost looks like it's well targeted so if you're just thinking about targeting from the perspective of covariances you know what is the optimal covariance between the treatment effect and the bias this is kind of as good as possible okay however this intervention is actually welfare decreasing both when you can use optimally optimally sets in taxes and even when you are constrained to not do anything with with taxation when the variance of this epsilon term is sufficiently high what is the intuition well the intuition is that this intervention generates more noise in people's decisions than the pre-existing biases did and i want to pause on this point a little bit right because um the welfare costs of bias are not just about an average sense in which people will over under consume something a large part of the welfare cause of bias is the kind of noise that it generates in the allocative mechanism right so when bias is homogeneous one thing that we do still have which is very good is that the consumers who value the product the most are still going to be the ones purchasing it so at least conditional on levels at least conditional on the equilibrium quantity sold and purchased the allocation is efficient once you introduce heterogeneity you're messing up that kind of efficient sorting sometimes you have extremely low value consumers purchasing the product and the high value consumers not purchasing that and that's extremely extremely bad for efficiency and so when we're thinking about efficiency then it's not even enough to think about um what is the treatment effect condition average treatment effect conditional unbiased you really need to think about the variance of treatment effects as well because of the treatment effects are highly heterogeneous and they're highly heterogeneous not just because um they're perfectly equal to the negative of the bias that can be extremely bad for the efficiency of markets as well that's what this example is capturing okay so that's kind of an important lesson too it's not even enough to just look at the average human effect conditional on what you estimated the person's bias to be you need to understand the dispersion i think that what you described what you were just describing about things getting kind of confusing and so forth for people as a potential example of how you can have very heterogeneous treatment effects which is quite bad for market efficiency any questions here okay let me do quickly say one more thing so this is all of this analysis so far has been assuming perfectly competitive markets with effectively fixed producer prices coming around about for example from a flat supply curve um all of this can be generalized to um situations where we have elastic supply so an upward sloping supply curve um and in fact also imperfect competition although here i'm going to assume kind of a symmetric cornea game in the background here now it turns out that even with all of these complications this version of these formulas is still recovered and basically the new key sufficient statistic we need to have is the pass-through okay what i mean by pass-through is when you increase the tax on producers by one unit what happens to the prices that are being set by producers now what is the impact of the intervention on prices well now in this world where we don't just have a boring supply curve um the intervention is in fact going to by shifting the demand curve it's also going to shift the prices up by consumers and the extent to which it does so is proportional to the average treatment effect of the intervention and one minus the pass-through rate so that's the effect on prices and one thing i just want to pause here on this bullet point is another i think extremely obvious to say thing that is um i think missing um in some sense shockingly missing from discussion of um quote unquote nudges in economics most shocks to demand affect the equilibrium and therefore affect equilibrium prices so in that sense most things are actually going to change opportunity sets so then again it's very it becomes very hard to talk about things like um libertarian paternalism you know a shock to demand that actually has a big impact that has a greatly increased as the prices fixed faced by consumers doesn't feel very um libertarian paternalistic to me in the sense of leaving consumers opportunity sets untouched but you know with that in mind if we instead kind of take standard approaches to welfare again building on the international tax formulas you get formulas like this um and the main thing i want to highlight here um is that the lower is the pass-through then even in the absence of taxation the more we should be thinking about the impact on variables so we need to go here the more we should be thinking about the impact on variances rather than just the impact on um kind of second moments that involve the average treatment effect squared okay um and let me illustrate this point with one more example so suppose we have a competitive market but it has fixed supply so we have a vertical supply curve we have homogeneous bias and we have an intervention that changes bias to zero for some positive measure of consumers and leaves the bias of other consumers untouched okay so again um by kind of um you know more informal colloquial type of intuitions we might think this is a great intervention it's definitely improving people's um decisions but my claim is that with and without taxes this intervention is welfare decreasing okay so forget optimally sets in taxes even without any other kind of intervention this is an unambiguously welfare decreasing intervention despite reducing bias for potentially very large fraction of consumers why okay just fix supply so what that means is that bias does not affect the equilibrium quantity sold and purchased okay that's kind of the key thing about this example so given that um and again recall what i was saying about noise in the market yes well basically the now the consumers who don't have bias are going to buy less of the ones that you are going to find yeah exactly it's before we were actually first best with fixed supply homogeneous bias is not actually bad for welfare does nothing the thing that's um bad for welfare with fixed supply it's all about the variance of the bias it has nothing to do with the mean level of the bias because again the quantity purchased stayed constant so mean shifts in consumers perceived marginal utility don't actually do anything rather what affects efficiency is the sorting it's as soon as you introduce variance and bias that's where you get to a situation where sometimes you have consumers with lower values purchasing the product with consumers with higher values not and so again and this has to do with what i was saying here capacitor is really low it's all about the variance this is a variance increasing intervention um and it is unambiguously bad for market efficiency yes yeah this example an example if so there's a chance that it's better to fire the people that have mobiles probably less costly than trying oh oh i see so we start with heterogeneous bias and now you're saying maybe there exists well for improving interventions that actually increase bias and we do that by making that is that exactly so that is yes exactly that is an implication yes any other comments questions okay um let's talk about measurement so when i say targeting what i mean is let's set aside the aversiveness term for now i'm gonna have a whole section on how to measure this direct utility effect let's talk about measurement of the second moments um so this is coming from work in progress um so um help us improve it um um so what we did is we measure um kind of the targeting of health information and fuel econo fuel economy labels um and um we have separate approaches to measuring bias in these these are two different applications to different experiments um so in the sugary drinks application um we basically follow the approach that you just learned from hunt before the break um that we use in the syntax paper to get estimates of bias um in the fuel economy experiment we have it set up that such that we can measure very very directly um so it's more stylized and more artificial but are without going into it because of time constraints the measurement there is actually very direct um and i think less um contestable than the kind of bias measures that we produce for the sugary drinks application um but i'm gonna set that aside in the interest of time um so here's what it looks like for um the sugary drinks application um this is kind of there's two things going on so first we collect the bias proxy so the self-control and the nutrition knowledge as well as health preferences and everything else we need to implement um the kind of strategy that we take in the sugary drinks paper then we let some time pass by so two days and then we invite those people back and they do a multiple price list okay and that's the baseline multiple price list then there is um either a control where nothing interesting happens or people encounter a one of three different kinds of labels while they do them the second mpl okay so again the control group also does the mpl but they don't have um a label so here's an example of labels here's a nutrition label treatment which really just highlights the calories um as people and then there's an mpl where they choose between um the sugary drink and an alternative that is somewhat similar but does not contain sugar and again it's a multiple price list where we're looking for crossover points here's a stoplight um warning label um these i believe have been i think the average treatment effects of these have been pretty high based on public health research and here's another warning label about how drinking beverages without sugars contributes to obesity diabetes and tooth decay now again i want to highlight when you look at labels like this you can imagine how this can make someone feel really bad you know imagine looking at this and drinking that pepsi it's not a very pleasant experience and we also have a component in the study where we measure aversiveness i'm also setting this aside an interest of time because i think the other studies i'm going to talk about for measuring aversiveness are kind of a better use of the limited time that we have here but just keep this in mind we're not completely ignoring aversiveness um and this isn't a good example of why we should um just intuitively why you might think it's a real thing um okay so um what is going on here so first of all labels change behavior so we're talking about willingness to pay here so this is relative willingness to pay for the sugary drink as opposed to the sugarless alternative um and all three of these um labels um decreased willingness to pain the graphic warding label has the biggest average effect on decreasing people's willingness to pay for the sugary drinks okay um so again um the average treatment effects um and i know i'm being a little bit mean to prior literature here but a lot of the private papers would just stop there and you know kind of pat you know pat themselves on the back we decrease people's willingness to pay for sure great drinks which we presume are bad okay but let's actually look at targeting um these interventions are not really that well targeted right so what we might hope for is that the people who are more biased um are the ones who respond more um and that's not what we see here um so here this is just a simple illustration with the median split where we have below median bias in blue and above median bias in red um so what you would hope to see is that the red is way below the blue but you really don't see that it seems like the treatment effects here looks like they're approximately uncorrelated with bias and so what does that tell us about the nature of this intervention well it's basically like a inferior version of attacks right because the treatment effects of attacks are by definition uncorrelated with bias it's that kind of blunt policy um as hunt was talking about and again recall treatment effects here are in price space so the treatment effects of attacks are by definition here homogeneous okay so attacks is similarly uncorrelated with bias but recall also what i told you the variance of treatment effects after you think about the covariance of the treatment effect with bias holding that constant the variance of treatment effects is bad and as you might intuit for an invention like that there is going to be a positive variance um so this just looking at figures like this what we see is this is an inferior version of a tax it's just this block but it introduces more noise now in the absence of attacks because the average treatment effects are still quantum the right direction and it's not like extremely poorly targeted um these interventions still improve welfare um although and that's in the blue although they wouldn't do that as much as an optimally set syntax would um in the presence in the presence of an optimally set syntax these interventions um decrease welfare and it's for the reasons that i told you all that matters is the impact on the variance of bias and these interventions do not decrease the variance they actually increase it because treatment effects are heterogeneous they're just uncorrelated with people's biases so this is this is a very useful lesson here again what i want you to remember is treatment effects are in the right direction in the absence of any kind of regulation the effects on welfare are moderately positive although um they are not as high as what we would get from an optimally set tax and if we alternatively can have sugary drinks taxes that are set at the right level we definitely do not want these kinds of labels they are just making things worse and less efficient any questions here comments yes can you remind me measuring the bias below where did the measures of bias come from so we elicit the same kinds of proxies that we elicited in the sugary drink exactly health knowledge and self-control um and for each person once we get a measure of those proxies we use the mapping that we have in the syntax papers to transform those proxies to a measure of bias again it's the same concept that we've been talking about before as the vertical difference between market demand um and demand that would um result result um in the welfare relevant domain so again bias here everything here is in price space biases marginal utility so it's kind of in people overestimate by x dollars per unit treatment effects are also in that same price space here so here you are either um doing the non-parts integration to all of them or no one can we think about another environment in which you in this environment you know the very interesting bias so you can say i only consult the information yeah well that's great i mean so certainly for labels that you need to put on the cans that's not going to work now there's an interesting consideration here so you can ask the same question incidentally about taxes can we practice something like price discrimination with standard policy instruments um and maybe um what we might consider is somehow it's more politically palatable to discriminate using non-financial instruments than it is to discriminate using financial instruments which then might give the financial instrument a little bit more of an advantage because it gives you kind of a mechanical way to um up their targeting relative to what you can do with something like taxes so maybe you know i don't want to um you know it's some it's an interesting thing to think about um i'm not sure it's that much more politically tractable to target non-financial things as opposed to financial things but um that it is an interesting consideration so yeah so here i'm at yeah so i thought you said i'm ignoring the distributive concerns so we're talking about a pure efficiency um framework here there is an additional interesting consideration and this comes out of the far he quebec's paper which is that um you know it depends and it depends a little bit on how you think about aversiveness and how you model the effects of that but you an additional potential benefit but it could also be a cost of the non-financial instruments is that they might be less regressive um you know in the sense that taxes are additionally regressive if you think about taxing sugary drinks you might think there's something about the warning labels that is less regressive but it really doesn't have to be that way um because again i want to apply the standard same standard considerations you know let's say that the sugar warning label um you know its treatment effect is a dollar you know just like a dollar or whatever not that's too high um you know it's 20 cents on the can you know just like a tax that is 20 cents on a can um so we're talking about money metric you know plus noise now we should still apply the social marginal welfare weights in the same way so in that note sense um the intervention is just as regressive as the tax but then it introduces noise and is less effective now on the other hand you know what would actually make it less effective in terms of sorry the so if i'm not just diametrically effective i'm not aversiveness of this so let's say versus correlated with treatment of facts um so if it's strongly correlated with treatment effects you know the thing that would make the aversiveness terms less regressive for this intervention um is if the treatment effects on low income people were also lower than the other high income people which is not good either um alternatively of course the good world is one in which um the treatment effects and the aversiveness effects are kind of de-linked so we have this um you know idealized intervention that has very large effects on the behavior of low-income people it doesn't have a large aversiveness effect on low-income people um and that kind of makes it distributionally advantageous to the tax then um but again the presence i guess the main point is the presence of redistributive concerns again does not somehow mechanically skew things towards us preferring on non-financial interventions um you know it's just an additional consideration that in some cases might make us like more in some cases might make us like them less yep i think there were at least there was at least one other and did you have a did someone else have a question yes the comparison between the nonprofit division and the taxi is that sort of impressive assumptions that the tax is like um they said as uncorrelated but like doesn't that depend on the elasticities as well no the elasticities matter too it's just that when i'm talking about treatment effects i'm always talking about treatment effects and how they affect willingness to pay right so one dollar tax in essence lowers willingness to pay by a dollar so that's the sense in which the treatment effects of the tax are homogeneous that's what i was trying to convey here and the reason i'm talking about treatment effects here and i'm converting them to price space instead of talking about kind of the horizontal difference between demand curves is because i want to talk about i want to make apples to apples comparisons we always have a vertical measure of bias right because that's an interpretable quantity you know once we go horizontal it's what what doug was saying at the beginning you know if you just define it as somehow just the difference between utility functions then it's you know not a very meaningful thing as long as we're keeping it in price space we kind of have a single benchmark um that we're always holding constant so we always want to think about bias that way and then when we think about treatment effects we want to do apple samples comparisons but yes of course elasticity still matter in the same way that they matter for taxes they're going to matter for um the these other kinds of interventions as well all of the same if there's one thing you remember everything we do for taxes we need to do for any kind of policy instrument so just call it a nudge and say we're doing libertarian paternalism everything we do for taxes we need to do for all policy instruments okay um very quickly um when we did fuel economy labels it's basically the same story um they move willingness to pay in the right direction so average human effects are quote-unquote in the right direction they're uncorrelated with bias um and so um again what we are in a situation is so we kind of have the variance and of the treatment effects and the covariance with bias and you can see here how um higher variance is going to lead to lower welfare effects and again you can see here when we're talking about the dashed line versus the solid line and the presence of a tax these kinds of interventions are welfare decreasing even though in the absence of attacks they're basically an imperfect substitute for the tax so they have a modest positive effect on welfare let me quickly talk about measuring these kinds of aversiveness effects so um a common approach here um is an avoidance design what is people's willingness to pay or avoid to pay sorry willingness to pay to avoid or receive one of these kinds of interventions there are a variety of um applications of these kinds of avoidance designs although we have to be careful so if you recall what doug was talking about in the morning there's a strong set of assumptions that we need to make for these kinds of avoidance designs to properly price out the direct welfare effects of these interventions you know if we're thinking about something like i'm just going to pick one instead of picking on my own paper you know we're thinking about something like that home energy um i'm going to defend my paper we're thinking about something like um you know hope energy reports you know let's say they operate on behavior by you know making people feel kind of bad about not conserving enough energy okay and now someone comes to you and says hey here's this thing um that is going to motivate you to conserve more energy by you know potentially making you feel bad if you don't conserve enough energy um do you want to try to avoid this thing it's kind of uncomfortable to say you know if you're the kind of person who experiences guilt from this intervention it's similarly uncomfortable to say that you want to avoid this intervention so that's kind of what i mean by the non-comparability problem um in this context doug already covered the applications the kind of sharing and guilt i just wanted to illustrate it um and yet another contact so we have to be careful you know but we need to start somewhere you know we always make assumptions and certainly these kinds of avoidance designs um give us a lot of information um you know and i kind of picked on a particularly bad version of this but if a lot of what's happening with these labels is perhaps more about information provision with information actually generating kind of real utility for people then um some of these um issues with non-comfortability problems might not be so relevant in this context so there's that's kind of the good version of this um so um so what hunt and judd did um in this paper so they're studying these um home energy reports um and there's been you know after hunt's 2011 paper there's just been a huge proliferation of papers that do versions of these kinds of social comparisons um showing that they do have you know relatively large effects um on people's um energy use this is kind of an example of one and then what they did is they treat this as a good and there's a multiple price list that elicits people's willingness to pay um to receive these kinds of home energy reports if you're just pricing it out um it's you know very nice very direct um design um um took a lot of you know it's you can find the hunt my understanding is this was enormous effort and a lot of work um but it's very cool to be able to implement something like this at large scale um so you get a whole distribution of willingness to pay you know for some people it's positive so you might think of this as people valuing kind of the informational component you know these things are maybe teaching you how to conserve energy better some people maybe really like them because they just the off chance that you might be better than your neighbors just gives you so much utility um you know and some people don't want them so there are also negative willingness to pay values and then on average you know and here's kind of a graphical illustration of cost benefit analysis um so once you have these willingness to pay we can go back to doing standard cost benefit analysis there's the costs which include retailer revenue loss and implementation costs there's the benefits which include externality reduction and on average this willingness to pay is positive and what i take away from this figure is the importance of measuring these effects because if we thought that that mean willingness to pay with zero then it looks like the costs outweigh the benefits once we incorporate it um we have a different the benefits and the cost stack up against each other in a different way comments or questions here on any supplementary comments what a great paper yeah um anything else okay so let's talk about a related paper and which is work i've done on social image since hunt this is your turn to pick on me so go for it that's not picking um okay so um we have kind of two so we have two sets of experiments here with social image one is using social image to i'm in a field experiment that that promotes attendance to the ymca on the other one is social image to promote charitable giving i'm in kind of more controlled online experiments um here's the um the social image treatment um this is what i don't know how um we convinced the ymca to this but they let us do this which is basically for anyone enrolled in this study um what would happen is at the end they would receive um basically an information table like this which lists everyone's names if they were in the social image treatment the number of times they visited um the ymca and i should say the reason there's dollars raised is this was kind of part of it was labeled as a component of this um kind of grown thrive pilot where every time people attended the ymca an anonymous donor um would contribute two dollars um to their local um ymca branch okay so you know the image motivation here is twofold maybe you want to seem kind of like a healthy person who comes to the gym regularly or maybe you want to seem like a person who really took this um kind of additional attendance charitable incentives attended um seriously um now what we did on top of this um and again i'm um i'm not giving you a very detailed explanation of the design okay but roughly speaking um most people were exogenously assigned to either rece be in the social image arm or not so if you were not um you were not part of this okay um but for every everyone had a chance to affect the likelihood that you know they could affect it a little bit and we elicited willingness to pay this way to basically increase or decrease your chance of being assigned to the social image arm okay um so it was really a change in probabilities the way that we did it though is um the results i'm going to show you are going to be you should interpret this as willingness to pay to either be in the social image arm with 100 chance or zero percent chance so that's there's a reason there's um a design trick that allows us to do this rescaling even though really it was kind of what we're talking about is increasing or decreasing the likelihood of being a social image arm but the kinds of questions um we also used as a strategy method style elicitation so instead of just asking people what is your willingness to pay to be in a social image arm we did this in a contingent fashion okay where we elicited willingness to pay if people thought that they would attend zero times we elicited willingness to pay if they would attend once um twice and so forth so the final randomization was actually done at the end after we could observe people's attendance now the reason this is important is we know that people misforecast their behavior um so it could be problematic we would get potentially very upwardly biased estimates of the direct effects of social image if we're in a world where everyone thought that they're going to go way more than they do and therefore derive a lot of positive image the other thing that makes the strategy advantageous is now we get multiple data points per person and so we have a lot of data to really plot out um what these kinds of social image incentives look like for different levels of attendance now before i show you that first of all again you know there's this standard question of what is the average treatment effect and the answer is it's positive and it was actually quite large so the social image intervention and this is just using the exogenous assignment um to the majority of the people and increased attendance by about 1.2 visits off of a baseline of 6.9 it's a big effect um but what do the um welfare effects look like well what our elicitation method allows us to do is basically plot out um action contingent or kind of signal contingent demand curves for social image so what i'm showing you here just in this plot is just two demand curves so one is what is the demand curve for social image um conditional unattending the ymca zero times and the second one here is what is the demand curve for social image conditional on very high attendance so you can see a large outward shift meaning that social image is a much more desirable good when you have high performance okay so it's a standard interpretation here and in fact again as i was saying what our elicitation method allows us to do is produce a demand curve for kind of all possible sets of attendance now once we have demand curves we integrate to get consumer surplus and so what we can do is construct figures like this where we plot out the average image payoff for each possible level of attendance and there's two things to note here um one is that this is concave right meaning that people are less sensitive to increasing positive image than they are to decreasing negative image so that's bad we would prefer it to be convex um so that people are very sensitive to positive image and not so much to negative image and what you can also see here is that um the dashed red line here is the average level of attendance and so the dashed red line the image payoff is negative these two facts together imply that overall the social image intervention is a negative sum intervention right because if image was zero at exactly the average level of attendance and you have concavity you know this is kind of a standard result analogous to how we think about risk aversion that would imply that already the average image payoff has to be negative just because of the concavity but on top of this the point at which social image is zero is not even the average at the average it's already negative and so together this implies that it's actually quite a negative sum intervention um and so setting here if you think about setting all of these targeting issues aside this is an intervention that does not stock up so well again relative to more traditional policy tools like taxes and subsidies you know depending on what you think are kind of the what you think is the marginal value of public funds but we have some calculations in the paper suggesting that the marginal value of public funds would have to be pretty high um for the social image intervention to be more efficient um than stay in attendance subsidy yes dimitri i wonder whether with these kinds of arguments you're being very generous to taxes and subsidies in the following sense we know that there are behavioral issues with taxes and subsidies having to do with assailants any degree in which people understand you know that there's a lot of heterogeneity in sales therefore using a tax or a subsidy is going to create a lot of variance in the response as well which you seem to be assuming away yeah and i'll talk about the variance and salience tomorrow tomorrow morning so what i have in mind here is something more like um i think the kinds of syntaxes was talking about things that kind of very transparently affect prices you know not kind of less conspicuous things um you know in the context of the ymca yeah we probably don't want to structure it as a tax credit that's the sort of thing where there are very heterogeneous responses and um level of understate awareness and so forth you know but maybe if it's kind of a some salient thing that is as close as possible to just affecting people's membership prices um you know which people are kind of used to seeing and so forth i'm thinking a little bit on the fly but you're absolutely right so when we want to make um the kinds of comparisons to incentives that i'm making um what we should really be thinking about is very very simple to understand um totally transparent things that are analogous to excise taxes that directly affect the posted prices of products something that is more analogous to a sales tax that people don't see is going to lead exactly the kinds of problems that they're just talking about sales taxes no we're not exactly the same yes exactly yes sugary jinx taxes those are more those are generally more like excise taxes that just affect the posted price directly yeah um okay so um takeaways um you know npis i think are a little bit too popular um because of you know i think we sometimes perceive them as cheaper and more innocuous than they are um instead you know i'm not saying they're worse than taxes or subsidies you know rather the point i'm really making is they could be um there are lots of examples where they might be better more efficient than taxes of subsidies but we won't know until we basically treat them um using the radical and empirical approaches that are essentially the same ones that we use to very carefully scrutinize the efficient efficiency properties of standard policy instruments um so it's all about careful modeling and measurement you know in terms of future work what i would just say is there's a lot a lot of work studying average treatment effects and it's you know been a relatively successful industry there's very little work that is actually studying welfare effects and the kind of way that i conceptualized here of these non-financial policy instruments and so i think there's really tremendous tremendous opportunity um for writing papers on these kinds of instruments that are specifically focused um on welfare and i hope you consider that so um leave it at that and then after break um doug will do um the second lecture on this there's a question yes [Music] michelle's question earlier um i guess when i'm thinking about this group like elizabeth has this recent more context we've been talking about sort of like is there any documentation within any of these contexts of like you know attrition or like drop off by like levels of five like differential drop off by bias level and if there is or what is that what is the implication of that sort of the welfare comparisons of something like this versus yeah i mean it's a great it's a really great question um which highlights i think two important things one is it's actually very hard to answer your question because most of these studies do not have um even proxy measures that can allow us to think about how treatment effects co-vary with bias you know in some of these contexts we might consider proxies like education for example um where we might think higher educated people are making more informed better choices you know but it's um it's not the strongest um proxy um and then i believe the second thing you're highlighting is when we see that the average treatment effects um in the larger scale rct implementations are lower than an academic study should we be upset about that um and the answer is i don't know you know maybe maybe in fact the welfare effects for all we know could be higher um in the large-scale implementations than they are in the academic studies and in fact maybe um the reason the average human effects are lower is maybe we're in the lucky state where these are well targeted the academic studies somehow recruited people with lower biases um and um you know the story could be very different from the one we might um infer if we're just looking at average treatment effects as a measure of success
