the Q a button at the bottom of the screen let's get the presentation started with Monica and presenting your findings from a project Monica if you'd like to pull your presentation up great can folks see my presentation yes perfect um thanks Bob thanks all for the opportunity to present our rdrc project which investigates the effect of suspending in-person services at SSA field offices on disability applications and allowances this is work with Michael Anderson and Gina Freeman at Mathematica and with Chris Earls at SSA all opinions expressed in this presentation are our own so SSC has historically provided in-person services to applicants who need them or prefer them these services are provided at more than 1200 field offices Nationwide and as you can see from the Red Bar on the figure in March 2020 as I say closed its offices to the public to protect the health of the community and they remain closed all the way through March of 2022. during this period SSA found ways to expand its remote Service delivery options including installing dropboxes at offices and Publishing all the local office phone numbers online so our research question was what was the effect of suspending in-person services at field offices on disability applications and in answering this question we have two goals the first is specific we'd like to better understand the effect of covid-19 on applications and on applicants but the suspension of in-person services is also something that we can exploit in order to gain insight into questions about barriers to access and program participation more generally the first component of our empirical approach is descriptive we investigate how applicant characteristics vary by mode of application we Define three modes in person online and by phone and then we compare the characteristics of applicants that use each of these three modes next we investigate how the likelihood of initial allowance varies by mode of application after controlling for applicants and local area characteristics such as the demographic composition and Baseline economic conditions of counties in which applicants live and the idea there is to understand if the mode itself is associated with likelihood of allowance in both analysis I just described are restricted to applications that occurred pre-pandemic the second component of our analysis involves estimating the causal effects of the suspension at in-person Services by using difference in differences for this we'll aggregate the data to the county quarter level we'll compare counties with a field office with a match set of counties without a field office that's our first difference and the second difference is looking before and after the suspension of in-person services in March 2020 so we assume that people who live close to field office are more affected by the suspension of in-person services than people who live far away from a field office we can therefore use the latter group as a comparison group and this empirical approach hopefully enables us to isolate the effects of the suspension of in-person services from other aspects of the pandemic that might have affected applications such as the unemployment rate stimulus checks and many other factors we'll investigate effects on the volume of applications initial allowance rates and the demographic composition of applicants so those are our main outcomes there we're using five main sources of data on this project two of them are SSA data sources and three are publicly available data sources our main data source is SSA structured data repository which includes information on application mode applicants education age disabling condition and determination outcomes we'll also add to our analysis information from ssa's electronic claims analysis tool which tends to average your information on applicant work history compared to the SDR the publicly available data we're using our field office address locations from ssa.gov the American Community survey from which we obtain information on the urbanicity demographic composition and Baseline economic condition of counties and finally the New York Times GitHub repository which contains information on covid-19 cases and deaths over time at the county level so moving on to our first set of results as a reminder in our first analyzes we investigated how applicant characteristics differed by mode we point folks to the forthcoming working paper for the full set of findings but I'll just share a few key results and all the differences I'll describe are statistically significant using a chi-square test so this figure shows applicant characteristics by mode of application in the months prior to the suspension of in-person services the bars on the left show the characteristics of applicants who applied in person the middle set of bars are for people who applied online and finally the right set of bars are for people who apply by phone for each group of applicants we show the share of applicants with less than a high school education the share that speaks English the share of white residents in the applicants County of residence the share of applicant addresses that are Urban rather than Rural and the share of applicants that have a field office in their County finally the line above the bar shows the median household income of the applicants County of residence so what we find is that in-person applicants are least likely to have finished high school 30 percent have not completed High School compared to 20 and 27 percent of online and phone applicants they're also least likely to speak English while the majority of all applicants speak English over 90 percent uh a larger share of in-person applicants don't speak English compared to applicants using other modes in-person applicants also live in counties with lower shares of white residents compared to other modes and plot applying in person could provide the greatest opportunity for receiving assistance making it a more attractive option to groups of applicants whose disability or background make it more challenging to apply using other modes conversely online applicants were most educated and were most likely to speak English compared to applicants using other modes they also lived in counties with relatively higher median income apply online requires familiar familiarity with navigating online forms which could be correlated with relatively higher levels of Education finally phone applicants who are most likely to live in rural counties with relatively lower median income and a higher wide share of the population they were also least likely to live in a county with a field office next we investigated whether the way in which the individual applies to SSI or SSDI for example in person or by phone was associated with the likelihood of receiving an initial allowance after controlling four applicants in local area characteristics we found that online applications were three and four percentage points less likely to result in an initial allowance relative to phone and in-person applications respectively this could indicate that some modes of application facilitating application quality better than others for example online applicants may not provide complete answers to questions or may not understand a question correctly without in-person or phone assistance this could hurt an online applicants chances of an initial allowance but in an important important caveat here is that these results are descriptive and are not causable there may be differences between applicant groups that we haven't controlled for and that may be driving these differences and allowance rates our control variables are also correlated with allowance rates in ways one might expect we find that older applicants those with low levels of Education um in those with a mental disability are more likely to receive an initial allowance in a second component of our analysis we investigated the causal effect of in-person suspensions on total applications and on applicant characteristics we match counties with a field office to those without a field office and then implemented the difference in differences analysis I described earlier prior to matching counties with the field office deferred from those without a field office in important ways which are listed on this slide post-matching the differences in the demographic compositions urbanistity and Baseline economic conditions between the two sets of counties were not statistically significant or were significant but not meaningfully large all right so this slide shows our difference in difference results the results are preliminary and may be refined as we conduct our tracks the outcome variable here is the number of applications per 10 000 County residents and the figure is showing the difference between counties with a field office and the match set of counties without a field office relative to the difference in the first quarter of 2020. so as you can see prior to the first quarter of 2020 counties with a field office have similar Trends to the match control group the exception is q1 2019 and we're still investigating to what might be investigating what might be driving that difference the fact we see in the second quarter of 2020 represents an 8.6 decrease in applications attributable to the suspension of in-person services this decrease is slightly smaller in the subsequent Quarters at about 5.5 percent it's possible that ssa's efforts to expand remote Service delivery options over time mitigated the initial effects of the in-person service suspensions together our results imply that the suspension of in-person services causally reduced applications our results are aligned with prior work the shpande and Lee find that the closing of SSA field offices led to a 10 decline in applications in the surrounding areas our analyzes examining the effect of in-person service suspensions on applicant characteristics and allowance rates are underway however this descriptive work that we've done indicates that after the suspension of in-person services at field offices the share of applicants with less than a high school education decreased this potentially suggests that the suspension in-person Services may have affected certain disadvantaged groups such as those with low levels of Education more than others our results have several policy implications first we find that different groups of applicants use different modes of application this could have access and Equity applications for policies that aim to expand or reduce the use and take up of certain application votes indeed we find that the suspension of in-person services causally reduced applications not everyone who wanted to apply was able to apply using alternative modes of application applicants with low levels of Education may have been affected more than other applicants and policies that aim to raise awareness and use online services could significantly reduce application barriers to many eligible individuals however it's possible that they may help some groups of people more than others one minute second our results indicate the mode of application could be related to application quality there could be several potential reasons for this for example when applying in person or over the phone assistance from an SSA employee could help ensure that questions are answered as completely as possible further work is definitely needed to better understand how mode affects the completeness and quality of SSI or SSDI applications and whether some modes are best suited to some groups of applicants more than others and this could you know ultimately inform potential application supports such as access to an online chat with an SSA employee for modes of applications that tend to be associated with relatively lower application quality but again I want to mention the caveat that our results that is the differences in the adjusted rates of allowance of initial allowance could be driven by differences in African characteristics that we couldn't control for all right uh thanks very much everyone and I'll pass it back to Bob thank you Monica great presentation uh next up is JP Aubry JP would you like to pull up your presentation can everyone see the presentation yeah no not yet one more time here one moment so that's fine that's why how about now perfect yeah okay sorry about that um thank you everyone uh and uh really pleased and uh excited to present uh Recent research that I completed um on using online tools to improve uh SSA Service delivery I start with the uh the standard disclaimer that the results and conclusions expressed in this research are mine and mine alone so for today's uh brief presentation I'll be covering four topics uh the first is a brief uh summary of SSA Service delivery and online tools uh the next we'll discuss the survey instrument that uh was uh produced in order to analyze and assess how individuals use SSA online tools then we'll discuss the results through describing respondents claiming process and finally look at retirees or self-reported satisfaction with their claiming process which was also asked in the survey so online tools are a great way to improve SSA Service delivery they streamline the claimings process for retirees it reduces administrative burden for SSA field offices and can help maintain Services during emergencies such as the recent covet pandemic but the share of retirees claiming OS oasi online has grown minimally since 2012. what this figure shows here is a share of the total applications received that were filed via the Internet and so there was an increase from you know a pretty dramatic increase from 2007 to about 2000 12 and since then it's kind of hovered around 50 percent with a an increase obviously during the pandemic that is sustained to maybe closer to 60 percent foreign so to investigate this trend we asked retirees and near retirees about their use of ssa's online tools throughout their claiming process what I mean by that is we ask whether they communicate with SSA online by phone or in person before they claimed whether they claimed online or in person and whether they communicated with SSA online by phone or in person after claiming um so that way we really get the whole the whole process in our throughout our survey and then finally we asked them to rank their claiming experience on a scale of one to ten with 10 being the most satisfied the survey instrument also asks for valuable details about the claiming process so for those who submitted their application online the survey asked if they did so from home or field office or another public location for example a library for those who failed or never tried to submit their application online we asked what were the reasons that they didn't claim for those who contacted SSA before or after we asked for those reasons as well and then for those who rank their satisfaction with the claiming experience we also um asked them if they had any suggestions for improving the claiming experience for retirees so from this this server instrument the first major takeaway I'd like to discuss is that although we see that about 50 maybe more of retirees ultimately file via the Internet our survey suggests that only around 40 percent claim totally online that means you know without contacting SSA in person or by phone beforehand or afterwards right so I think that was kind of a major Insight that came from the survey that we found that was the first major takeaway another major takeaway was that non-white retirees are less likely to claim totally online so when we looked at the respondents and um separated them into racial categories focusing on white Black and Hispanic because they were the largest three um categories in our sample we found that both Black and Hispanic individuals were less likely to claim totally online again that's without contacting SSA at any point through their process than white and the difference was statistically significant when we looked into the reasons that individuals cited for contacting SSA um we found they could be divided into into two broad categories those that are more amenable the policy solutions for example um obstacles to using SSA online services such as data errors or general lack of awareness um regarding online tools or basic inquiries about benefits most of which may be possibly handled online looking about figuring out the basic eligibility or getting a sense of your basic uh benefit levels and then there are reasons that the respondents provided that were less that we thought were less amenable to policy policy Solutions uh for example complex inquiries regarding issues like spousal benefits or the tax implications of receiving Social Security income or just um a general distrust of online tools or preference for in-person interaction um those reasons were a little more difficult to uh for us to see a a policy solution um and when we look more closely at the at the reasons Within These two categories uh by race we found that Hispanics are more likely to contact SSA for basic benefits for data errors particularly before they claim so these are you know two reasons that we had placed in the more amenable to policy Solutions categories right uh kind of just getting some basic information about the process or correcting errors getting basic benefit information those two reasons were were why Hispanics contact the SSA when we looked at reasons for contacting SSA um during the application process what we found is that uh in most for most reasons there weren't many differences by race that were statistically significant uh other than in terms of comfort using the internet and so black individuals were more likely to apply in person due to discomfort using the internet or unfamiliarity with the internet and computers um and so but otherwise you know the reasons were not very different across race so when we think about the policy Solutions and the various um reasons that black or Hispanic individuals contact SSA during the claiming process more often than whites um when we kind of basically remove those reasons as as a reason for contacting SSA in our analysis we can get some sense of what a policy solution that would address those issues might might do right um and so when we do so what we found was in general uh the share of respond that respondents contacting SSA drops right it currently um we see about 57 of the respondents say they contact SSA at some point in their planning process if you if you remove the reasons that we categorize in the more amenable to policy Solutions if you remove those reasons you find that only 37 percent of individuals would have to contact SSA in additional in addition to the overall decrease um in contact info SSA during the claiming process these if you reduce these reasons um for contacting SSA you actually reduce the racial differences as well in contacting SSA especially between wife and Hispanics um which is driven in part by the fact that Hispanic individuals are more likely to contact SSA at least in our survey um for reasons like data errors uh and getting basic benefit eligibility information both elements and reasons that we've we've categorized as being more amenable to policy Solutions moving on to the satisfaction with claiming um you know the major takeaway here for um from the survey was that satisfaction with the claiming process is high uh you know the average uh score self-reported satisfaction score by by respondents was 8.4 percent right and it's heavily skewed um upward uh you know 70 of individuals uh report a score higher than eight um or almost 80 percent score uh higher than eight uh and so very few uh had a poor satisfaction score in terms of their experience with claiming and just over 20 percent of retirees thought SSA needed to improve uh services so we also um had a follow-up question after after individuals provided their claiming um score or the sorry the satisfaction score uh and ask them if they'd like to give any suggestions right about ssa's Service delivery and only 20 felt the need to that need to suggest improvements um and which I find it's also a good sign in terms of people's overall claiming experience and and importantly there really was not any statistical statistically significant difference across race um you know it's all right around 20 or a quarter uh of individuals um provided any feedback and and 15 provided positive feedback in most cases um and the vast majority just said no suggestion everything is is okay finally among the 20 that did provide um some suggestions uh what was the most common was reducing wait times um so here we kind of have a a chart that categorizes the most common reasons among the 20 Who provided a reason at all or a suggestion at all when we found that wait times were was by far the most common suggestion after that was uh providing more instruction on the process um allowing in-person visits clearly those were for those who were claiming during um covid uh improving Services fault communication but those are much smaller relative to wait times which almost 20 percent of individuals who provide a suggestion listed as a as a possible Improvement one minute whatever yeah well done JP
