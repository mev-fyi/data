i'm going to talk today about the evidence emerging from a new data product produced by the u.s census bureau called the business formation statistics it's a new data product that was developed in collaboration with academics like myself and a team at the board of governors it's providing rich new information about entrepreneurship in the united states that's been particularly valuable in the pandemic crisis so why are we so interested in what's happening with business formation if there's lots of evidence that shows that new employer businesses are disproportionately important in terms of contributing to job creation innovation and productivity growth and we also know that employer business startups particularly are uh have at least historically been highly pro cyclical so in the great recession there was a sharp and persistent decline in employer startups and there's lots of evidence that the slow recovery is is in part attributed to that uh a slow recovery of startups we're going to see in this new evidence in the pandemic after an early decline there's been a surprising surge in new business applications and today i'm going to explore the basic facts about the surprising surge discuss why this has happened and the implications for the recovery from the pandemic so here i'm showing you some of the basic statistics from this new data product and let me describe the nature of this new data product it comes from administrative data from applications for new employer identification numbers it comes in at a very high frequency to the census bureau comes in on a weekly flow basis they've actually been getting it for years but it was only a few years ago that we the female that i talked about earlier figured out wait a second we could use this not only to help the census bureau replenish its business register but actually as a data product itself the bfs now has two two primary series it has a monthly series which is very timely it's released within two weeks of the end of the reference month and so for this chart shows you data through may 2021 and there's also weekly data that i refer to later that's released on the thursday after the prior reference week so so why is this data informative well it turns out particularly for employer businesses it's not surprising it's informative because you have to have an employer identification number to be a new employer business but it turns out there's a there's lots of information on the form that allows you to kind of characterize what the nature of this new business is intended to be so you can see one thing i want you to see in the chart is if you look at the black line that's the overall business application it's called ba ba for app business applications you can decompose that into two parts uh hba which are likely employer businesses and where's that information coming from basically from check boxes that the uh applier says well we're planning on hiring workers for the mhba it turns out to just be residual we'll see in just a second that the hba actually tracks actual business startups in terms of employers quite well and the nhba attracts non-employers quite well but before going to that evidence you can you can immediately see the surge that i've spoken about so you can see early in the pandemic around april and may of 2020 there was a decline in business applications of all types and then there was an enormous surge just unprecedented surge particularly in the summer of 2020. and then you see it actually kind of tapered off a bit and then there seems to be a second wave and so actually the second month highest month on record is may 2021 this data goes back to mid um 2004. so for this information to be informative we'd like it to be connected to actual business startups and and the and the good news is is that it is actually part of the business formation statistics is linking the micro data on the applications to the actual business startups and so in the left-hand panel i'm showing you this hba series again and then i'm showing you actual business startups um as well and they are the ones that are directly linked to the business applications now those actual business startups actually the series only goes to 2018. after that because there's such a tight relationship the business formation statistics includes projections which you know may or may not hold but but based upon the historical record we're reasonably confident the main point i want to make out of this chart is that historically there's been a very tight relationship between the likely new employers and actual business startups on the right hand panel i also show that there's a close relationship between the application for likely new non-employers and movements and non-employers itself and so as moving forward we're going to stipulate that there's been a tight empirical relationship in the past between these and so that these series are informative about the business formation process now the biggest surprise is just how dramatic the increases are in a period of contraction and to make that point here i'm comparing what happened in the great recession versus what's happened in copenhagen and it's a simple little event study that i'm characterizing here so in the left-hand panel i picked picked a a week zero and it turns out i picked uh the week ending uh september 13 2008 that's when laban brothers collapsed and then accumulated applications for both likely new employers and non-employers forward but then also did that for a base period back in 2006 and then took the difference between the two and so the black line tells us that difference and you can see that applications for likely new employers declined relative to the base period in the great recession and i think considerably there's actually a slight increase in applications for likely new uh non-employers in the in the great recession but but as we're going to see on the right it's quite modest relative to what we see what we've seen in the cobot 19. so in cover 19 we did the same kind of exercise the week zero here was the week ending march 7 2020 and and again did the same exercise accumulated forwards and backwards and then compared this to a took the difference with a base period in this case the base period was back in 2018. and you can see this enormous surge that's actually proceeded all the way through june 2021 so this is using that weekly data that i talked about that's available um now through the end of june and and and the numbers are large so just just in terms of uh new and new employer businesses we're about 500 000 uh businesses ahead of the pace we were over a similar period in the base period we're about 1.5 million ahead in terms of a similar period for likely new employers now it's not just that the applications have surged but they've searched in particular sectors and so here on the left i'm showing you the patterns for likely employers and the right for likely non-employers and the sectors where they search for places like retail food and accommodation professional scientific and technical health trucking warehousing finance and construction now many of these are sectors where we've seen dramatic restructuring changes in the way that businesses do work with their workers and with with consumers and so as we're gonna see uh there's gonna be increased evidence that this is part of the reallocation and restructuring that that's apparently going on or has been going on in pandemic and in the recovery this can be especially seen when you look at more detailed industry so in a special release last october the census bureau and its weekly data for 2019 and 20 released three-digit industries that's much more detailed than the broader sector data that i was just showing you and this big surge in applications in retail it's not for all retail indeed bricks and mortar retail there hasn't been much of a surge but there's been an enormous surge in online retailers what's called non-store retailers in terms of the makes codes so actually the that sector loan that one one three data sector loan accounts for about 33 of the surge and and the concentration is evident here too because there are over 300 three-digit industries and about 10 of them account for about 75 percent of the surge so so the question of course is why this is happening what and and in turn a related question is what's different from the great recession a key piece i think is that financial market conditions are dramatically different financial markets collapsed in the in the great recession with an especially large adverse impact on startups and young businesses and and this is because housing prices declined and the availability of credit uh particularly from banks uh dried up considerably in in in the great recession and was slow to recovery in contrast financial markets have remained quite robust in cobin 19. there's also some we might say mixed evidence in terms of what the impact of the stimulus packages on the one hand the stimulus packages provided more resources to individuals might have been helped them start up businesses on the other hand there's actually one key component that actually probably was a damper the payroll protection program uh was designed to support existing existing businesses not new businesses and so it's well known in terms of economic theory and actually evidence that if you if you uh support incumbents that will tend to both stifle exit but also entry so i might say it's actually even that much more surprising that we've seen the surge that we've had so so why do we think we've had this surge we're still trying to figure this out this is brand new data product and very timely data but but i think there's increased evidence that covet 19 both during the pandemic and as we recover from the pandemic has changed the way that businesses uh interact with their workers and the way businesses interact with their consumers and so that's provided lots of opportunities for new new businesses to form it's also been the case that not all existing businesses have been able to pivot actually the evidence is from from other sources that small businesses in particular have been amongst the hardest hit particularly by the way in sectors like uh retail trade and and food and accommodations and in retail trade the large businesses have been been better able to pivot to online activity and delivery activity and the rest now of course there's big open questions going on right now about uh how how permanent is this shift to online mediated transactions remote work we really don't know the answer to that question but what's great about the bfs is it's giving us a window into what businesses are doing what they're thinking about indeed actually doing in terms of starting new businesses so in terms of looking forward you know i don't i don't have a crystal ball in terms of what's going to happen here but i think that business formation statistics uh offers a a unique perspective on on the nature of the restructuring and reallocation it's incredibly timely for this kind of data the actual startups data and the actual exits data that we have is oftentimes quite dated whereas this data is incredibly timely now in thinking about what the implications are going to be going forward i think a couple of things need to be taken into account one is when you look at the business formation statistics and then look at actual startups it actually takes some time between applying for the new employer identification number and and starting up a business oftentimes that's four to eight quarters so we're just beginning probably to see the the impact on things like employment from this employer started from the surge last summer and and the search this spring it's too early to tell the second thing is even after new businesses start up what do we know well we actually know that most new employer businesses fail actually many of them don't grow but what's striking about the united states is a small fraction tend to grow very rapidly and have made it enormous contributions to job creation innovation and productivity growth so that's really where we don't have the crystal ball we don't know who who are going to be the the new successful superstar businesses that are likely to emerge from uh this surge in a business formation the main point is that we we've long known that startups are a critically important part of ongoing creative destruction and so the surge in startups is going to be quite important for helping us understand the nature of restructuring reallocation during and post-pandemic i'll stop there
