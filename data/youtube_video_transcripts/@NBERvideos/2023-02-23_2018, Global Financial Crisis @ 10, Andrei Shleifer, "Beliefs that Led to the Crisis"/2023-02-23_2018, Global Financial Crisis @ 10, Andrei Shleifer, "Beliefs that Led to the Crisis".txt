the remarks I I'm gonna make is a base in a book that's going to uh appear in August or September that I wrote Whitney College in aioli called the crisis of beliefs which is a book largely a theoretical book but also a book about uh motivated and spending a lot of time in the financial crisis so you should all buy it even if you don't read it the uh so the main points of what I want to make I basically um three uh and they're very much addressed the question of what have we learned in the last 10 years um the the first is that there's been huge Revival of research on credit Cycles uh which shows that uh Financial uh crisis or Financial Credit Cycles follow very predictable patterns of credit expansions uh and crisis that don't happen suddenly uh but rather uh arrive at this rather deliberate speed and are in part predictable second I think what we've learned is that the U.S housing bubble and the crisis of 2008 look very much like a standard credit boom followed by a crisis and the recession and I'll try to illustrate the facts of that and the third point which is what I think is probably a little more novel to what I'm going to say is that there are also patterns of expectations and beliefs that evolve over the course of the cycle which are an important part of the predictability but also a pretty standard in the 2008 episode and similar to the ones earlier so let me just summarize some of kind of what I think are the highlights of research on credit Cycles over the last 10 years so this is a from a study by shulotic and Taylor um on uh on the predictability of a financial crisis uh and it on the uh x-axis you have the change in the credit to GDP ratio over a five-year period uh and then on the y-axis uh you have the probability of a financial crisis and the the point of that paper on that study is that the bigger is the credit expansion uh the uh more likely uh is the financial crisis this is from a study of Mian Sufi and Werner which looks at a similar issue using a household date that data rather than all credit and it looks at growth of household debt on the x-axis and GDP growth in the future period on the y-axis and again shows that there is a fair amount of predictability which is to say rapid expansion of household debt tends to predict uh slowdowns in in economic growth this is from a study of Jeremy Stein and his colleagues which looks not at credit expansion but a measure of credit Market sentiment developed by Greenwood and Hansen on the y-axis and looks at the relationship between the level of sentiment and I'll talk about that a bit later and future growth in Real GDP and again finds the highest level of credit Market sentiment or high levels of credit Market sentiment with some reliability predict declines in GDP growth so there is a thing called credit cycle which is to say when we see credit growing uh when we see high indicators of credit sentiment that pretends slowdowns of economic activity going forward now there are kind of two very broad views and I'm now painting with a very broad brush of understanding this phenomena there is a traditional view which I tend to associate with Bernanke and Diamond divik which is that you know you have an economy which is kind of Rolling Along there is a bad shock which could be bad fundamental news Sunspot or whatever that gets the uh Financial system to begin unraveling there are all kinds of amplification mechanisms adverse selection Agency problems fire sales and that this through the credit Channel leads to a recession which is to say in these models expectations tend to be rational in crisis amplify bad news there is an alternative view which is you know I tend to associate it with Minsky and kindleberger which is that a big part of financial instability comes from beliefs rather than from rational expectations and that the growth of credit and the high levels of investor or credit Market sentiment are associated with driven in part by extremely optimistic beliefs that when there is news leading to the corrections of these beliefs or perhaps because believe self-correct because things are not as good as people expected there is a correction of expectations that leads to the unraveling of the financial system and the recession I mean the two views are not that different in terms of how Things Fall Apart but they are very different in terms of uh how the system how depression the financial system gets built up uh and uh how uh the crisis believes begins so what I would like to show to you is that I at least you know the weight of evidence I'm not saying anything is conclusive here it's been shifting toward the second point of view and away from the first here are kind of my three random but my three of my favorite studies that uh show that in fact errors and expectations are important for understanding this phenomena the first is from what is now a classic study of Greenwood and Hansen that looks at the measure of credit Market sentiment which is the blue line which is the share of high-yield bonds of risky bonds and the Total Bond issuance so this is a quantity-based measure you also have price-based measures and what this uh graph shows what this picture shows is when that measure Hive and there's a lot of issuance of risky bonds the return on these bonds going forward is low which is to say there is some indication of overpricing of risky debt at the time of buoyant credit markets this is from another aspect of that which is the banking sector this is from a study of Baron and Sean which shows that in fact if you look over the course of credit Cycles internationally you see evidence of the fact that as as credit expands and Banks increase their lending the credit the stock markets is cheering for the banks and they earn very high Returns on their equity and that this credit expansion and high Returns on banks actually predict uh poor Returns on Banks and poor performance going forward so again some pretty direct evidence of errors and expectations coming from financial markets this is from a paper which is right off the press actually is is from Stephanie Rossi and his co-authors and he does something which economists again this is what we've learned from the crisis have now done increasingly which is look at the expectations data and to try to ask you know what were people thinking what were they expecting one of the strongest predictions of the official of the rational expectations hypothesis is that changes and beliefs cannot be predicted okay which is to say I cannot use information available today to predict how your beliefs are going to change from tomorrow to day after okay that turns out to be not true in a lot of data and this is a a a a an association between the same measure of credit Market sentiment that Jeremy used and Greenwood and Hanson use on the x-axis and on the y-axis is the change in analyst forecasts of earnings growth of companies from year t plus two to year t plus three and what it says is that when credit markets are buoyant you can predictably expect analysts in the future to revise downwards their expectations of earnings growth of companies so this is evidence from expectations data that good times predictably uh anticipate uh uh reversals in beliefs in a way which is not consistent with rational expectations hypothesis so this is kind of the kindleberger Minsky view expectations dry bubble Drive bubbles credit cycles and predictable uh not again predictable with probability one but predictable uh reversals so how does crisis of 2008 fit into the picture what uh what how does it compare and so the question I'm going to ask is you know first I'm going to look at what happened at the crisis but then I'm going to try to also look at what what is the evidence on beliefs of the participants in the financial system so this is the picture which I assume everybody has seen which is this is Philippe's picture of the housing bubble which shows that real home prices in the U.S Being relatively uh constant until the mid-1990s and then uh experiencing a massive uh increase until 2016 or so and a collapse afterwards uh uh this is what is commonly referred to as the housing bubble uh this is the again a very standard picture on the fact about a credit expansion uh during the housing bubble and the fact that U.S household debt outstanding Rose from less than 4 trillion uh to almost 14 trillion uh at the peak so again as in a standard uh credit cycle you have massive expansion of household debt this is some data on the role of a subprime data risky debt which of the sort that the green one and Hansen were talking about but in the household level uh in credit expansion and you see that what has increased most dramatically perhaps right close to the peak of the credit bubble is the issuance of securitized uh debt and uh the share of a subprime mortgages in that securitized debt was uh was extremely high so again in terms of credit expansion the whole thing looks uh uh pretty uh standard uh what about going forward well this is I'm sorry one more picture which is that parallel to the increase in leverage of the household sector you also see increases in average of the financial institutions these are the this is from a study by Hyun shin and Daniel kashup and others on the growth of Leverage of uh in the U.S financial system and investment Banks so what happens in 0.607 well what happens in 0607 you see this for the from the Schiller picture is that home prices begin declining or the growth of home prices uh uh stops before home prices begin to decline and then you see uh an increase in defaults on subprime mortgages so this is from a study by Chris Palmer which shows that the fraction of the cohort that defaulted of mortgages issued in different years and you see that of subprime mortgages I should say that for 2006 2005 originations these numbers ended up being just colossal which is to say that there is bad fundamental news that start coming in you know 607 regarding the defaults on mortgages regarding the path of home prices and the credit cycle begins to unravel this is again a very standard picture on what happens uh this is the prices of mortgage-backed Securities uh of of different levels of riskiness with the red line being the safest one and and so on and what you see is that starting in the summer of 2007 and this is really important for thinking about the financial crisis the bubble and the financial system slowly begin to unravel and I want to make the comment that it's very very slow so you have the first tremblings and financial markets in the summer and the fall of 2007 they get patched up as I'll show you by the Federal Reserve and then you have a period of close to a year in which nothing too dramatic happens but the first bad news seriously bad news in financial markets and the housing happen in uh in early to mid 2007. now what happens after that is that you have the usual correlates of the uh what we describe as a financial crisis but you don't get a financial crisis so this is what happens to asset back commercial paper Market which is one of the main uh short-term borrowing Market financing mortgage-backed Securities you see that this Market essentially disappears in 2007 or or collapses as as the holders of MBs are unable to to to maintain their positions and have to sell them this is the Twin Side of the decline in prices you see in 07 in early 08 huge increases or this is the middle of this picture in in volatility but again the system does not collapse why does the system not collapse is because to a large extent the Federal Reserve begins a very aggressive series of policies providing liquidity you to financial institutions creating new liquidity facilities that prevent the whole liquid wholesale liquidations of positions for financial institutions and so for a period of a year banks are losing a lot of money home prices are falling uh there are rescues of some financial institutions by bear Stearns but the system holds together the system holds together so this is again a slow arrival of the financial crisis not a one moment arrival that is very typical in other episodes as well and the system holds together until September of 2008 when uh the when Lehman goes bankrupt and there are many people who've written about the Lehman bankruptcy and why it's pivotal whether it was a mistake whether it was not a mistake that's not the subject of my comments but it clearly was the pivotal event uh separating this period where it looks like the government was able to keep things together to the period where things really fall apart these are some correlates of Lehman you see the flight of short-term money from uh Prime money market funds to government money market funds which is to say that investors fly to safety you have many other correlates one thing to make sure again since the question is what's new after the crisis is that people in finance understood these mechanisms of unraveling of the financial system extremely well even prior to the crisis which is to say the mechanisms of fire sales liquidations increases in runs increases in margin requirements on short-term debt and what what Bruno Mars and Patterson called liquidity spirals in a very nice paper which was written way before the crisis all of this happened just like uh like uh Financial economists understood there was some new and important elements you know there were dramatic failures in derivatives markets which I think Daryl Duffy will talk about uh but the outline of how things unravel was uh was pretty standard this is just a picture about what uh the importance of fire sales in the mortgage-backed Securities markets and the dramatic declines and then subsequent increases uh in prices of AAA rated rmbs now here is a slide which I think again speaks very clearly to the point that the crisis had a long time coming and was not some kind of a surprise or some unanticipated Shock that resulted from Lehman this is a Time trajectory of IMF forecasts of the losses for the world and U.S banking system that were anticipated uh from the time that home prices started to decline so in October 07 the IMF forecasts 200 billion dollars of Mark to Market losses uh on asset-backed Securities and cdos and U.S banks in March 2008 this estimate gets raised to 720 billion total 200 billion for U.S banks in October 2008 these are the estimates me it actually before Lehman the the IMF predicts a trillion dollars in global losses to financial institutions and 400 billion dollars in U.S Bank forces the reason I'm mentioning this is that by this summer of 2008 and probably before the the the evidence is pretty explicit that the financial system is in very very deep trouble okay and it comes from IMF it comes from security prices it comes uh from uh many other sources and that's a very important point I think to keep in mind so that's the story what I hope I've shown you again is that the U.S financial crisis looks uh like a very standard credit cycle with a bubble credit expansion some bad news and disappointment with respect to the housing bubble and a very slow unraveling of the financial system followed by a collapse in September of 2008 and then very effective government rescues but which nonetheless do not manage to prevent a deep recession so the question is what were the beliefs what were they thinking what was why did the bubble and the crisis follow the path that they did and what I want to show you is the last piece of this presentation is that in fact that expectations or beliefs and in particularly inaccurate expectations and beliefs play a very Central role in understanding the evidence now there is now now amount of evidence and beliefs during housing bubbles many people in this room have contributed to this one of the first papers which is the one that summarized here comes from Bob Schiller and his collaborators who've conducted surveys in four U.S counties of beliefs about home price appreciation and they asked a very simple question of noverage over the next 10 years how much you expect the value of your property to change each year and what you find is that during the five-year period before 2008 these are the averages for annual expected growth rate if people expected home prices to grow 10 percent a year okay which is uh pretty extraordinary expectations of home price growth and again we've now seen a lot of evidence from many countries that a central picture of housing Bubbles and credit Cycles is this very optimistic expectations about home prices as I mentioned another Central piece of the story of this crisis the conversion of mortgages into uh mortgage-backed Securities this is another one of the canonical pictures of the financial crisis which was uh I think found first by Paul Willen and his collaborators at the Boston fed which is from a document and you can think of this as a sales document but there are many other documents like that produced by Lehman Brothers fixed income research in 2005 on the future path of defaults and potential mortgage losses uh in the U.S economy and what you find is of course a picture of complete Insanity so they expect that there is an 80 percent probability uh that nothing bad is going to happen at all and home prices are going to keep growing uh maybe at a slower pace which of course would lead to very small losses to the riskiest branches of mortgage-backed Securities and Total Safety of AAA rated Securities they attached some probability to pessimistic and meld out scenarios something like 20 percent but again these scenarios turn out to be vastly more optimistic that has uh has actually happened so at least if you look at the data on expectations on mortgage defaults and losses they appear to be utterly unrealistic during this period as well both in terms of totally ignoring the word not being able to understand the worst case scenario and uh also attaching too low probability of bad outcomes now the last two pictures on expectations I want to show in terms of what people are thinking is what were the professional forecasters and the FED thinking over the course of 0708 as you know home prices began to decline and there were defaults on mortgages and significant reductions in prices of MBS so this is from the survey of professional forecasters and the way to read this picture is that at any point in time I show in the uh with the light line the forecast of growth over the next year and with the dark line the actual growth over the next 12 months okay and what you see in the survey of professional forecasters is that even as late as the summer of 2008 okay this is really quite important even as late as the summer of 2008 people expect continued real GDP growth over the next 12 months okay the reality of course is minus four percent okay so the professional forecasters uh completely missed the risks uh the downside risks building up in the United States economy what about the FED they have much better information uh well you see the same story again the light line is the forecast the dark line is the reality uh the uh the black square is the July 30th 2008 uh green book forecast for the August 5th meeting of the fomc and you can see that at that meeting the forecasters that the board increased their forecasts of the growth of the U.S economy to something like a positive one percent okay so I mean you have to take this data seriously if you want to understand why uh uh the crisis was such a surprise uh why uh the system unraveled so rapidly so at least at the at their at their main forecast the fed the FED forecasters completely missed what was about to happen it turns out that it gets better which is that the the the the one of the governors or whoever asked the FED uh forecasters to prepare a scenario what's happened with the scenario or severe Financial stress which is this is the scenario in which credit losses and solvency concerns and intensify for many financial institutions blah blah blah so the FED forecast is predicting this scenario that the expected they'll be expected minus 0.4 percent real GDP growth in the second half of 2008 and rising at 2009 uh Positive Growth uh with unemployment peaking at 6.7 percent okay so six weeks before Lehman the FED forecasters had no idea what was coming okay and if you actually read the discussion of this there are a bunch of presidents of regional feds who accused the FED forecasters of being too pessimistic uh so you know either you think this is useless information because who cares what fed forecast is forecast uh or you think that there is a problem with how we think about this so what are the bottom lines the tail risks appear to be neglected by both investors and policy makers uh liquidity interventions but there were no aggressive attempts to get Banks to raise Capital despite all these enormous losses so what the reason that Lehman was so important and the system has unraveled so far so rapidly is that markets learned that in fact the financial system was interconnect much more interconnected through various mechanisms that people thought and so Lehman precipitated this learning this change of beliefs that was so Central to how the system unraveled and this is what we try to go through in detail in the book let me just say two words about alternative theories and then I will conclude you know here are the theories which all of us in this room love but they're largely wrong one theory is a moral hazard I think the central fact about the crisis and where again has worked on this is that the banks The Regulators financial markets all believe the same thing okay so the idea that somebody was tricking somebody and taking advantage of them had some special information about what was going to happen that idea flies in the face of all the evidence the second idea which is equally appealing but equally wrong is that the crisis was just a bank run it is surely the case that at the end of it all we saw a bank run but that is at the end of it all after we've had years of a bubble and a very very slow deterioration of the financial system to say that the crisis was a bank run you know when you look at hospitals 90 percent of the people die of cardiac arrest but you know that's not the reason they come to the hospital it's they come for many reasons and they die of cardiac arrest so that's the same thing it's the it's the final collapse but that is not what the crisis is okay so uh just the last slide so what are the main lessons I would say there are four lessons uh extrapolative expectations essential to the housing bubbles the continued neglect of downside risk is then is very Central to understanding this delay period of 2007 uh 2008. Economic Policy was obviously brilliant and fantastic after Lehman but I think all the evidence suggests very clearly that it was behind the curve between 07 and 08 and not fully appreciating of the risks building up in the system and it seems to me and that's I guess my main punch line is that it's very hard to tell the story or to piece the story together without following the evolution of beliefs of both policy makers and Market participants thank you very much
