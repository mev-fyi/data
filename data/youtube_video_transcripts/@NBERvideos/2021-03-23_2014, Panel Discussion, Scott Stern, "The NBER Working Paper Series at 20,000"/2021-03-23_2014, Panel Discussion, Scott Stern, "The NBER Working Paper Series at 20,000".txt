about a little bit to kind of have a moment of pause um maybe even put a little bit of data to the problem of what it means uh that the nba what the nbr working paper series means during this moment over the past uh several months where the 20 000 working paper um was issued now as i was kind of you know kind of preparing for this panel a little bit i'm not going to be a presenter but i always prepare slides um that means i'm in a business school um i did kind of come along as i'm not sure of how variant is here but you know hal and his team are recently released at google the google scholar metrics uh and the most uh thing that they emphasize is what is called the h5 index this is the number of papers published in the last five years by this source that have been cited at end time you know each time so the h papers have been cited h times of papers that have been published in the last um five years now not surprisingly uh nature and you know very generalist uh journals nature and science and new england journal medicine uh kind of top this ranking um my you know personal favorite the ongoing international does came in at number 17. um but interestingly if you look at um in the top 20 the only economics related activity is the nbr working paper series at 168 and um indeed once you look through the entire ranking of the top hundred on the american economic review is the only economics journal um and then the review fund and then two of the leading finance journals uh kind of towards the bottom there um so i think that that really kind of speaks to something that those of you are here and i think the broader community kind of can probably engage with which is that the nbr working paper series seems to have a very significant influence on scholarly discourse in economics and that was why we are here um today so um i'm going to get out of the way really quickly um it's going to be a very simple panel um we're going to start with jim perturber i've kind of recollected you know kind of i went using the mbr search function i found the first kind of the date of birth of this author for the nber at least in the working paper series i didn't look up the books and so um we're going to start with nbr working paper uh uh uh a working paper series on number 508 uh jim perturba um then we'll be moving to nba working paper series uh 375 followed by some kind of late comers a little bit uh later in the program glenn and josh
