what is factorless income well start with a measure of value added you can think of taking gdp from the nippas and subtract some measure of payments to labor you can think of compensation from the nippas and further subtract some imputed rental payments to capital so for r i want you to think about computing a hall jorgensen user cost and multiplying it by a value for k that you also get from the national accounts and you're typically left with a residual a residual which at times over the last 60 years has been large and has fluctuated a lot over time that's what we're going to call factorless income and there's a question how should we allocate and interpret factorless income well one possibility is that it's economic profits pure profits in other words firms earn revenues that exceed their average costs another possibility is maybe that we're mismeasuring k that we used to impute or to calculate that factorless income maybe there's missing investment flows for example which causes k as seen in the national accounts to differ from the actual k used in production and finally maybe our imputation of the rental rate isn't so good in the sense of you know maybe it's missing missing a risk premium or something that causes the imputation that we use to diverge from the actual implicit rental rate that firms are facing and that's causing them to make their economic decisions now we're not the first by any means uh to think of these possibilities for the treatment of factorless income in fact there's a large and rich history of papers including many by people in this room that would fall either either explicitly or or sometimes implicitly sometimes without really drawing it out into these categories but what we're going to do is we're going to treat each of these cases in turn and try and draw out and to some extent compare and contrast repercussions of each of those treatments of factorless income for things that we as macroeconomists care about whether it be the evolution of technology or trying to understand the drivers of growth or inequality as examples okay so how do we construct factorless income and you can see the equation again repeated up here we're taking data from the u.s national accounts which means the nipa tables and the fixed asset tables we're going to strip government from all the relevant terms and study from 1960 until 2016. so why we're going to take gdp again less government and wl our baseline is just raw compensation again less government but but we show in the paper that we can consider other measures of labor compensation it's going to be largely robust the key points that we want to make so then the question is how do we measure these implied rental payments to capital well we're going to aggregate the categories of capital available in the fixed asset tables up to three different types of capital the first is going to be indexed by i to capture it capital and the second by n to capture non-i.t capital and those are the two types of capital we're going to be think uh thinking about as used by the private sector in production and then finally we've got residential capital indexed by h that's going to be used to produce housing services consumed by the household how do we calculate r so so we're going to get those k's from the national accounts or the fixed asset tables how do we get the r that we use to multiply those k's well we're going to use you know uh calculate a rental rate a la hall jorgensen um in the actual paper it's a little richer we include information on taxes for example but just to for presentational simplicity here i'm just showing you three inputs into that calculation one is psi j which is the price of capital for that type of capital so for example you can see here that you've got a capital gain or loss if you um are investing in or using um you know a computer there's going to be a capital loss as the quality adjusted price of that computer goes down over time and that's going to contribute to your implicit rental rate there's r here which we're going to measure based on uh 10-year treasury yields and a moving average of realized inflation and then so that's the real interest rate and then of course there's a depreciation rate which can be again specific to each of these three types of capital and when you put that all together what do you get well just to sort of show you it and just to be clear the plots i'm showing you here and throughout this talk and in the paper are all five-year moving averages so they're all smoothing out some very high frequency movements the left shows you the share of labor in value added so wl divided by y which is relatively flat but declining in the last several decades and the right shows the paths of the capital shares of each of these three types of capital so you can see the red dashed line shows the path of it capital which grows slowly and steadily plateauing around five percent recently of gdp and of course the other types of capital exhibit these big movements which of course we'll get to later so 1 minus the sum of these four lines is the share of factorless income that's what we're what we're talking about in this paper now let me jump into the first way that one might want to interpret this factorless income which i'm going to call case pie again to capture the case where we're going to treat it as if it's all pure profits this is what you get you get this big increase in factorless income as a share of gdp since the early 80s or under case pie a big increase in economic profits since the early 80s this has been shown earlier by barkai and that's been referenced by a lot of academic work you know journalists discussions of public policy as supporting the view that monopoly power has risen uh that this is one thing that's contributed to the labor share decline and also even been discussed in the context of potentially reevaluating our anti-trust regime and one thing that you see if you extend back the exact same methodology but all the way back to 1960 is that actually you know this particular measure of economic profit share was higher on average in the 60s and 70s than in fact where it is today and there's a lot of you know i mean we're all macroeconomists in the room so you might recognize a pattern that looks a lot like this namely what i'm showing you here in the red dashed line which is the path of the real interest rate that we're using to generate the black line again to be clear we take the real interest rate calculated in in one of several ways but this is our baseline we use that to calculate the rental rates are and when you then inject it it produces this path for the profit share which has a negative correlation with the real rate of something like minus .9 so one point we want to make is under this particular interpretation of factorless income if that's the logic that one wants to use to support the view that markups have risen or that profits has risen one needs to have a little more of a nuanced view it's not just markups alone that would be changing you'd have to have some mechanism where markups and the real rate are moving together with a very high negative correlation even at relatively high frequency similarly and it's not exactly shown here but i showed you that very volatile path of non-i.t capital share earlier and there's important implications of that volatility for technology i'll show you that case pi is going to imply very volatile technology and i'll show you that process later in the talk next let me move on to case k so case k considers the possibility that there's unmeasured investment spending so here x u stands for real investment in the unmeasured capital stock and you might have in mind things like spending on training or anything that a firm would do that the national statistical authority would mistake as intermediate input spending but which we as economists would want to think of as final spending well if we've done that at some point in the past then there's an unmeasured capital stock which we're going to call ku which earns a rental rate are you and so you'd want to revise uh in this case it's the income side of the gdp identity such that you take y there and add this unmeasured investment that would be nominal gdp on the right hand side you'd want to add ru times ku the the rental payments to this unmeasured capital and of course this now equals y tilde which we'll think of as revised gdp sort of the true gdp that you'd want your model to be matching now you can rearrange this equation such that everything on the right-hand side is either known or can be assumed whereas on the left-hand side you're left with these two unobserved terms and what we do in our case k is we solve for a law of motion or i shouldn't say a series of paths for these four variables the price investment rental rate and stock associated with unmeasured capital that satisfies this and therefore resolves and accounts for all variation over time in factorless income but which also obeys the functional form of the hall jorgensen user cost and which of course obeys the law of motion for capital so there are strong restrictions over time on what we choose for these terms because of course the price today is going to matter for the user cost even tomorrow and investments today is going to matter for the capital stock tomorrow etcetera etcetera okay now there are many such paths that would in principle absorb all time series variation in the user cost many we happen to choose one that aims to minimize the scale of the gdp mismeasurement if you will minimize the scale of the amount of investment that's missing relative to gdp and we do that because if we found a series where gdp growth was 18 in our model but three percent in the data we might not find that so plausible so what i'm showing you in this left plot here is the resulting series of investment spending for each of these types of capital relative to gdp and one thing we learned is that the red line which shows you that unmeasured spending series doesn't have to deviate that many times by that much uh you know from zero the typical year there's one two maybe three percent of gdp spent on this unmeasured capital which means that gdp growth as reported by the bea won't be so far off from for example what it would be here in the model the one exception we find is actually in around 1980 or so where it has to get bigger another way to think about the implication of that is to look at the scale of the unmeasured capital stock relative to gdp and that's what we show here we find that you know from 1980 to 2020 let's say the scale the magnitude of the missing capital stock doesn't strike us as obviously implausible it seems in the ballpark of other measures with a very similar concept for instance done by people in this room like like bob and andrea and others the hitch though or the catch is that as you go back in time you do require a larger and larger in our view less and less plausible stock so one lesson we learned is that it is the case that you could plausibly in recent decades have relatively small scale mismeasurement accounting for variation in factorless income but you probably then want to expand the notion of what you consider unmeasured investment beyond things that would be unique to the recent decade or two you don't want to just think about things associated with the i.t revolution for example next i want to go to our third case which is case r so case r starts from the acknowledges that there's a lot of reasons or factors that are omitted from our calculation of the rental rate things like a risk premium or an adjustment cost let's say and so what we do is we say let's move little r which was the real interest rate let's impute a different r i'm going to call it our tilde such that when we then calculate the three versions of capital r the different rental rates we absorb fully time series variation in factorless income what does it look like when you do this well the red dashed line shows you the implied artilda series which you can see behaves quite differently from that black line which is the initial real interest rate that we used to originally calculate factorless income i think you should focus less on the level because the truth is by assuming a constant profit rate in the economy of 0 or 5 or 10 i can slide this thing up or down focus instead i think on the time series variation and one thing you notice is that in 1980 or so from then on despite this big decline in the measured real interest rate that we use you have a much flatter path for the uh what we're calling the revised opportunity cost of capital and this is one way actually that we think of we think this is stemming from very similar forces and logic as the result by caballero and farian gurinshas for example that the risk premium over those last two three decades has been rising it's very much like saying the wedge between the dashed red line and the black line has been rising over that period one other interesting thing that case r does is it has differential impact on the rental rates across capital types so think about it capital which is the rental rate shown on the left-hand side what matters for your user cost of a computer well it's going to depreciate a lot you're going to have a massive capital loss over time a 2-3 percentage point change in the real rate doesn't mean so much for that rental rate and for that reason you see the red dashed and black lines are somewhat similar by contrast for the non-i.t part imagine a factory it could be a very big deal if the real rate or the opportunity cost of two three percent different and so you can see in this type of capital um case r significantly smooths out the time series uh evolution of the user cost and that's going to have really big implications for technology for example if you were to you know compute technology the relative shares of each type of capital will matter and i showed you early on that it had this nice smooth evolution whereas non-it had this big wave and this will attenuate that and make the relative shares even within the capital share more stable so these three cases all present very different things now what do we do after documenting some of these patterns in the data we move on to a model we start with a neo a variant of the neoclassical growth model where we add business and housing sectors we add multiple types of capital we have capitalists and hand-to-mouth workers and i won't have time to really delve into the details of the model but the core assumption on technology is that it's ces between a bundle of capital and labor where the bundle of capital itself is ces although we'll just focus on the cobb douglas version of that and where the elasticity of substitution between the capital bundle and the labor bundle is denoted by this sigma and the model is going to be essentially saturated with enough exogenous processes such that those exogenous processes can be are capable of fully replicating the endogenous variables in the model are matching the endogenous variables of the model to the equivalent variables that we see in the data but remember that when i say the equivalent ones in the data i should clarify as interpreted differentially among each of these three cases so for example case pi has a variation or fluctuation in the profit share of gdp so that's going to have a different set of exogenous processes than cases r and k which don't want variation in the markup over time for example so let me start by showing you the first thing that we do with the model which is extract some of these uh processes and let me show you what the labor augmenting technology process looks like here it's detrended and i'm showing you two versions of it one on the left with a high elasticity of substitution 1.25 and one with a low elasticity of substitution 0.75 you can maybe start with the equation at the top which just shows you all the ingredients to this extraction that we're doing there's really three terms there's the wage which is just data that's going to be taken the same across all three cases but the remaining two terms are different across the cases pi is in there excuse me mu the markup is in there and that obviously is different in case pi than in the other ones similarly even the labor share sl is different because in case k gdp we assume is not properly measured and so even case k will have a different labor share from let's say case r and when you look at the evolution of technology here you find that there's markedly more variability required to map required of labor augmenting technology to reconcile the model with the data viewed under the lens of case pi then under the lenses of case k or case r the next type of thing that we do in the paper is we shut down one by one those exogenous processes and run counterfactuals the goal of which is to understand how each of the three cases might influence our inference on what each process means for economic or macroeconomic outcomes like the labor share here but you could also think about inequality between a capitalist and a laborer which we do or other outcomes like growth which i show here so the way to read this top line is that the baseline meaning from the data as interpreted under case pi k or r what is the baseline change in the labor share from the late 80s till the early two thousand tens and you can see it's basically three percent across the cases there's a slight difference in case k again because case k has a slightly different path of gdp and for example uh if we look at the effect that mu the markup shock has we get very different inference across these three cases regardless of what you believe about the elasticity if we look at the effect that mu the markup shock has on the labor share in both cases of case pi it accounts for more than 200 percent essentially of the labor share decline by contrast you know things like case k or case r become much more important or sorry say that things like capital augmenting technological change or this is really i.t specific uh capital uh technological change will matter does it matter for anything everything that we're interested in which case we're in no and just very briefly the reason we showed this at the bottom is this shows counterfactual outcome of uh output which is log q and if you consider the decline in the it capital price it has relatively similar effects on output growth across all three cases in both elasticities so to summarize for many questions and i want to emphasize it includes for understanding the labor share decline but also for much more the interpretation of factorless income matters we're skeptical of case pie and at the very least we think if that's the motivation that's going to be used if this is the evidence that's going to motivate an attention to markups we need to to be careful that that path looks the way we showed all the way to the 60s and that there's a large negative correlation with the real rate we're a bit less skeptical of case k the particular version that we show has an implausibly large unmeasured capital stock around 1960 but we think we've laid out a methodology that others might be able to use and find better paths it's not like we think we've solved for the globally most plausible path for case k we're most optimistic about case r which does the least damage to our assessment of the macroeconomic narrative over the last 30 years but admittedly it requires some elaboration on what the source of the wedge is and we acknowledge that we don't provide that at all last thing i'll say is you know lucas in my work originally we thought that there was a lot to be learned from the cross-country comparison in their experiences with respect to factor shares for example this paper obviously we focused just on the united states but we think it would be fruitful to explore the path and the potential allocation of factorless income in other countries as well
