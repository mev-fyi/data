it is impossible not to realize that the financial crisis raised issues and transformed essentially every one of the fields that we work in and that the nber carries out research within uh in corporate finance uh banking moved from a fringe topic to a core issue right in the center of the field in monetary economics uh new and innovative ideas for interventions and trying to affect output moved from very quickly from white boards and and seminar discussions into into practice with speed which had not been seen I don't think at any previous time in public finance and in macro after many years of thinking that fiscal policy was basically an afterthought and that monetary policy was the core device for thinking about and operating in terms of stabilization the tables were turned and suddenly the fiscal policy became a central input in 2000 we were having discussions about what we were are going to do in the United States because we were running surpluses and we were thinking about what would happen when we ran out of government debt and they were active proposals for perhaps the treasury could purchase shares in private firms and that would be one thing to do with the Surplus well of course by the global financial crisis and a few years later we got to the point where the treasury owned shares and private firms but it was not for the reason uh that we had thought we might be there back in back in 2000 uh well in marking the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis and trying to take stock of How It's influenced the way we we do research what we know in economics and how it's changed the agenda going forward seemed like it was a very natural thing to do this year at the summer Institute the task of what do you put in and what do you leave out when you're trying to think about what we've learned and what remains to be learned after the financial crisis is an enormous one we all know that there are many topics that we will not touch on during the course of today I'm sure they'll come up a little bit in the in some of the Q a a in the discussion but I think that we've managed to identify four really meaty topics on which we'll have paper presentations
