so i'm coming really from a financial perspective you know the prompt was you know ai will make financial markets more efficient yes no or just kind of what's in my context of the way i was thinking about is well what is finance for anyway and can computers do it that's obviously a very glib way of thinking about what we're going what's going on but you know it's kind of amazing and i think that the um the organizers deserve some credit for how well finance was soaked um was captured by the two papers today um roxanna did this a little bit in hers too it's kind of we really got the two pieces of the two big uh hats or umbrellas that finance folks at business schools or in um departments would wear they'd be either the asset pricing or corporate finance hat and all of us you know typically wear one hat or the other sometimes we scurry between the two of them but these are the two big ones these are our two big flagship journals kind of these are the two topics and kind of really the the at the risk of being very general about what's going on here is that i think the two papers are capturing distinct thoughts about how ai will affect finance so one is about how firms respond and adjust to the risks that they face so that's this um there was this paper by um beit stu and wang that was thinking about kind of corporate finances this concept of there are risks and that has economic consequences on how firms structure their balance sheets how they behave that's corporate finance and sort of how the funding of that happens and so then we want to think about well what's the implication of how ai will interact with that that obviously is a very corporate finance kind of question and then you know there's this question more generally of well if we think about asset pricing how does ai affect pricing and hence the allocation of credit in credit markets so the reason why we care about asset pricing beyond just wanting to make money is that that joke um you're making about well how are you making money off of this is the reason an economist would say that they care about asset pricing is well what we care about is getting the prices right so that credit is allocated efficiently and that was this um this paper uh by kao jiang wang and uh and yang and so um you know i kind of want to just go through the two of them they're going to touch on things that are going to be similar but i just kind of want to go through so in this in this first paper um by bates and all is that like there's a lot of pieces here and earlier today we were talking about labor issues um given with ai but if we just purely focus we can just purely focus on the finance aspect of it without getting into the labor and still have a lot of interesting things to dig into and the one thing i would say to the authors i think would be interesting is that there's this broader point in which ai kind of engages with the minimum wage literature which is obviously becoming a huge deal which is about the extent to which capital when does capital respond to changes in the minimum wage so papers by um dan erinson at all and isaac sorkin um have kind of touched on this but the risk what i wanted to talk about is in the basic do and wang paper is that there's this idea that the what the ai is solving for the firm the thing that minimizes risk is this idea that there's an exposure to risk that incomplete credit markets fail to solve right it's this idea that labor's inflexible there are shocks and we can't draw on credit or it's too expensive and so we need cash around to hedge against this risk right that's the whole idea behind this it comes up in a lot of settings it comes from this idea of incomplete credit markets and as a result if we sort of fix that inefficiency coming from the labor from labor by having some sort of labor replacement that now it's going to be more efficient since cash can be used for investment or for dividend payments and what's interesting is about this is that this kind of mirrors all the concerns about how does ai create value pasqual was kind of talking about this is like what are we doing with ai is it that ai creates more investment or opportunities or is it just paying out more dividends and so this is the tension here that's showing up in a kind of another example is that they have more cash that they can get rid of now on every period sort of getting revenue and then they can give it out or they can invest it the question is obviously what are they doing the paper really only finds evidence for dividends but that's typically very challenging to find changes in investment on at a small scale but the other side of the coin that i wanted to highlight which is this fact that yes it's true that basically it's reducing this risk exposure but is it creating other new kinds of risk exposures so this is my question here is that so fine so you get rid of this labor risk exposure but ai hasn't inherently fixed the risk from having imperfect capital markets right you still have these banks that aren't willing to give you loans because of whatever imperfections in the market and are there new shocks that are a consequence of being a very ai-centric firm so do you need to purchase upgrades so think about this as like in a labor force when you all of a sudden to change your labor force composition this is the type of shock that you might have or scaling up and down you know there may be things that you need to do as a firm and are you going to be susceptible to hold up problems from the supplier of your ai capital so if you think about this once we start thinking about this as a competitive market where now you have to buy certain types of capital from certain types of producers that's going to be a form of new source of risk and if the capital markets are still imperfect which it's not obvious why ai is going to fix that per se then that's just going to change the type of financial exposure that we see so on net it may be an overall gain for these firms but i think in a lot of the thought process here is that there's this unexplored source of risk here to consider and the competitive nature for these ai markets who's providing it like how concentrated the providers of ai is um that's going to be really important for thinking about how big of a risk this is so that's kind of on the corporate side i think that basically the point here is to say the way we think about corporate finance is we're exposed to types of risk and we think about how firms have to respond when we get closer to things being perfect markets that's going to fix it but now we can turn kind of to asset pricing and in asset pricing the idea is that you've you focus on factors that determine prices and so in a lot of models of rational asset pricing information plays a huge role and so the obvious point um in today's paper was to say how ai can play a really important role for improving information aggregation right for things that are routine like highly liquid stocks or things where we see a lot of information and this is really consistent with a literature that talks about inattention so this is actually if you go back and macro right this is there's this nice literature thinking about macro asset pricing that chris sims basically says look we can think about rational and attention it's this idea that people have finite information processing and as a consequence that's going to have really big important implications for macroeconomics you know his in his handbook chapter about this he says something along the lines of everyone ignores or reacts sporadically or imperfectly to information most days i take no action at all based on the information i viewed if you asked me a half hour after i looked at a paper what were the numbers i viewed i'd you at best be able to give a rough qualitative answer it's basically this idea like we're just finite in our ability to process things and so that seems like a pretty great case for an efficiency win you know robots don't sleep so we get a lot more efficient aggregation of information it would be a lot it's kind of i think a nice thing the author should think about it straightforward to kind of embed how these ai technology changes would show up um when you think about this is very nice paper by juan and liu about how rational attention affects portfolio allocation and we know that inattention matters for asset prices so marina nesner has a bunch of papers where what they show is basically that firms try to kind of give information at times when people aren't paying attention so like when you have bad news you give it out on friday because nobody's paying attention on friday and they go home and the federal government is excellent at this typically you know if you really want to sandbag something in the media cycle you go out on on friday or a time when people are not paying attention that's a very natural kind of human aspect and one would imagine that ai wouldn't suffer from that in the same way i think the one caveat that i would like to highlight for the authors um because they didn't talk about in the paper is that even if the sort of machine is doing well you kind of have to think about like they're saying one way in which the machine is doing well but it is important to think about what is the right loss function to put over types of predictions so what types of earnings do you want to get right or wrong and is there co-variance in how you get things wrong and so that would affect portfolio allocation i just want to kind of flag that for the authors because that's sort of a first order thing that comes up in this setting so you know in the asset pricing setting i'm kind of saying okay well i think the answer is pretty much yes i emailed a friend who's the hedge fund manager his response was i think the answer was pretty clearly yes ai's already been very huge he kind of highlighted all the same things that i had in mind for this inattention automatic scraping of earnings releases machine learning tools help sort through publicly available information credit card and other sources of data fed into ai high frequency algorithm trading like this has all been sort of really important in financial markets already and it's not that new in the sense that quant firms have been at it for 20 plus years i kind of pushed him a little on this and i said well you know what about competition or other types of things and you know in his views it's it's really hard to train quant models for black swans and in terms of competition there may be crowding which is going to create kind of volatility um so i think there's this element to which there's going to be some amount of basically competition or collision in terms of who's working on what and so i think the last point that this this asks is that as more people are doing this in financial markets this may create what are called factors in the market so there's this element to which um adrian nitula and miura have this paper and there are a number of follow-ups that basically say intermediate intermediaries like banks play a big role in pricing assets if we get more and more ai this may create new risk factors if people start to move in kind of the same way so it seems this may offset slightly the benefits it seems like a big deal the other big problem is of course these black swans or the question of is somebody going to be at the wheel when we see things that we haven't seen before um i'm out of time so the the comment that i just want to end on here is that you know so i went to swarthmore and our economics department's t-shirt was valuing equity over efficiency since uh 1863 i have a paper with fooster and co-authors that argues that efficiency improvements can maybe have disparate impacts and have equity issues the pricing of risk is very complicated and so you know that's something to really keep in mind about all of these things you know the common argument for efficiencies we can do transfers but it's going to be kind of important to think about how we can do so so thanks a lot
