define the defining situations in which current markets either freeze or issuance and volume activity are very low and we're going to talk today a lot about liquidity and usually when you think about liquidity in financial markets you think about the field of market microstructure which is actually about the quantum mechanics of financial markets uh we are not going to go to the direction uh we are going to talk about liquidity that is uh induced or uh present because of the security design um of uh of debt contracts so what are curry's market phrases is a very um broad definition we refer to large declines in the volume of transactions in both primary and secondary credit markets that occur over a non-driven period of time what comes to mind is the most recent financial crisis when we see many parts of the credit markets comes to a complete uh halt and we see liquidity dries up but by no means this is a recent phenomena uh we we will show you evidence on other financial crisis 1873 1884 1893 1907 the great depression these are all at times mostly in in in fashion crisis that credit market stopped so what do we do first we provide evidence on current market freezes we will provide evidence on uh issuance in private primary markets what we usually refer to as funding liquidity and we will do a more uh in-depth analysis of market liquidity which is what happens to trading in current markets mostly during the most recent financial crisis once we show you the the evidence we would like to have some sort of an interpretation of what seems to be driving current market freezes and we are going to compare two main theories one of them is asymmetric information and other selection and the other one is heterogeneous beliefs um so let me start with the first theory the asymmetric information all the selection theory of liquidity it's a security design approach to that liquidity it argues that liquidity of in current markets is driven by the payoff structure of of debt contracts influential paper by peter dimarzo that writes an optimal contract for pulling and punching or asking back securities and more recently papers by uh by bent and dan gorton and bank that look into liquidity and current markets the underlying intuition is the same intuition that you have for liquidity with asymmetric information you need to have symmetric information about payoffs uh to have liquidity and the question is how do you achieve such symmetric information in current markets and the main intuition that comes from the models uh by dan goten and homestorm is that when you have debt that is sufficiently over collateralized or the debt value is high enough even if you have asthmatic information for a large range of the potential value of the debt contract there are no implications to that this is all coming from the very simple payoff structure of that contract and as you can see here to the right on the uh to the right of the king um the debt is safe and even if we have differences of opinions about the payoff there are no implications for for value when the debt is not safe when the firm is in default to the left of the king this is where asymmetric information can have consequences for value they use the term of information in sensitive religion to the uh uh to to to the part of the line or the payoff that is to the right of the king and information sensitive uh to the left of the cake uh so this is uh a model that uh you can view this as being uh another way to look into myers and muscle but from the other side uh with implication to our liquidity what comes from this model is a very crisp prediction about the relationship between liquidity and prices which means that i'm going to use very loosely the term value of collateral or value of the bond but actually tells us when the value of the bond is high it's going to be liquid because that we have semantic information we don't care about other selection when the value of the bond declines when it's to the left of the king then it becomes less liquid in many ways and we see it in the analysis that we uh that i'll show you later on that flips the way that you think about liquidity to some some extent many years people who did research on liquidity had to convince people in our surprising that you have to price liquidity they have to one regression of price on liquidity and i guess that they don't like what we say is that we actually have to run regressions of liquidity on price now of course liquidity is priced but liquidity is also determined by price and that's what we view is being one of the main predictions prediction of this uh theory the alternative theory of one alternative theory it's not the alternative theory is one of heterogeneous beliefs how do you avoid the note read the result of the note trade theorem when you have to assume that participants in market and differences of opinions some are optimists some are pessimists and to the extent that market participants are certain uh in their assessment of the of the state of the world or the value of the the value of the of the collateral the value of the bond then you can achieve trade this here we also have a very crisp prediction which is when you have more liquidity when you have more torturity of belief um so this is what we do and this is what we take into the data but before we move to a thorough analysis of the secondary market liquidity i want to we want to show you some evidence on credit market phrases throughout history and here i'm going to refer to the primary market of cases in which issuance of security seems to rise up you know so you probably have seen a version of that before this is an issuance of um non-agency mortgage-backed securities or private label uh mortgage-backed securities and this is a market that was very active before the crisis and then it stops um it's not only that the mortgage makes the queue with these market stocks it's also asset-backed securities that are not uh directly related to um to the mortgage market stopped as well interestingly you also see a significant degree in the issuance of corporate bonds these are plain vanilla equivalent bonds issued by the regular firms that are not connected directly to the financial sector we see the kind of issuance there as well and as i said before this is not a recent phenomena there was a massive crisis one of the largest financial crisis uh in history in 1873 which was followed by a deep recession according to the nbr cycle dating it's second only to the great depression we see decline of issuance there you look into the great depression and the bond market this is industrial bond uh disappears for a few years you know this is uh uh taken from a paper that i've written with the mittens papani colorado and and uh carla finland showing that uh financial factors were important determinants of employment in in the great depression and actually the counterpart of the mortgage-backed securities these are the real estate bonds of the rolling 1920s similar to mortgage-backed securities but different similar because they are backed by individual property it's different because there was no pulling and punching um and this is the way that most of the build most of the construction of the building of skyscrapers in new york in chicago was funded and the market disappears in a great depression so the question is why do market disappear the results that we show you show substantial declines in bond issuance during and after the onset of crisis it is consistent with um liquidity dries up viewing downturns in the spread of miles and mushrooms or a more dynamic version of that as in lucas and mcdonald however you know when you look into primary market you cannot rule out that reduction in issuance is driven by lack of open demand stemming from lack of investment opportunities so we would like to go more deeply into secondary market and see what we can say over there let's start with the model of liquidity and asymmetric information the main prediction of the asymmetrical information adverse election theory is that when bond value deteriorates um you enter the information in sensitive region and liquidity declines as a first cut into the data we look into sometimes serious evidence we start with the financial crisis of 1873 for which we have collected information on all bonds that were trading this is weekly observation for every bond with readiness words what do you see here look into the red line the deadline shows you that there was a crisis this is a a portfolio weight a weighted average portfolio of prices of bonds and you see the sharp decline in prices and the decline also persists you have to find a measure for liquidity of the bond market in the 1870s and we went with bit of spreads so the blue line shows you bid ask spreads uh in the 1870s uh for every bond but we aggregate it up we normalize it by the mid price don't want to get into the technical details but very clearly you see that we have this negative correlation between between uh prices and illiquidity um now this is the financial crisis of 1873 but you will see a very similar phenomena when you look into the most recent facial crisis of o709 what do you see here the blue uh the blue line is the price of bones these are copper bones plain vanilla bonds nothing exotic no asset-backed securities and following lehman you can see there was a short drop of more than 10 in prices of bonds that persisted for a couple of months the red line is a measure of illiquidity don't want to get into the technical details we used to be different uh in another paper we used three different definitions of liquidity or liquidity they all show the same picture so this is a measure of inequality it's based on the gamma measure that was uh developed by bao pan and one which basically follows on the world 84 notion of liquidity you see very clearly here that prices and illiquidity are negatively correlated so the question is what do you do you know we move to running regressions these are regressions that are controversial because that's one liquidity on price rather than price on equality we lag prices by one month of the nation here at a monthly level that doesn't solve the problem because the large price may contain information about future liquidity so i know that this is microconference so you don't worry about indoctrinating but but we have another paper i want to refer you to our paper that information and inequality in which we do a thorough analysis of um of um shocking the prices with exogenous strokes and trying to find and and trying to see how moving price with shocks that are exogenous to uh illiquidity are affecting the liquidity and we find significant results for that we do a battery of tests that establish um in our opinion the causal relationship between prices and equity we don't do it here what do we find we find that as you saw from the graph that when you run a measure of illiquidity whether it's the gamma measure in the first two columns for the o709 crisis or it's the bit of spread um for the 1873 crisis there is this negative relationship between uh price and liquidity the negative relation between price and liquidity survives uh when you control for a bond fixed effect you control for year by month fixed effect again this by all means is a causal relationship but in our other paper which is much more micro oriented we do everything that we can to show that this relationship is in this course um okay so that's it seems as if there is a merit to the argument that uh the debt payoff structure of uh of um of the power structure of that contract uh seems to be an important determinant of uh of liquidity um and um we now move to an alternative theory which is the theoretical genius beliefs you know remember you have to have a measure of heterogeneous beliefs at the security level and then if you have more uh heterogeneity and beliefs you would expect to see um to see more liquidity not easy to measure heterogeneity of belief we use two off-the-shelf measures one of them pertains to the disagreement between s p and moris about the underlying rating of the security the other one pertains to the dispersion of analyst forecast none of them are perfect analysis focus of the stock that of the firm that issued the board and none of them is perfect each one of them might be measuring different things both of them have been used in the literature to measure differences of opinions so we start with some sort of a macro more macro aggregate look into that and when you look into the data it seems that if anything differences of opinions have only increased during the crisis they definitely didn't decrease whether you look into analysts focused dispersion or into the curricula in this agreement at the security level on the horizontal axis we have the degree of disagreement between s p and moody's so zero they agree and four and as you move to the right the dc remote on the vertical axis you have inequality if anything it seems as if securities for which there is more disagreement are less liquid uh the opposite of the prediction this is uh on the horizontal axis you have a measure of analyst dispersion more dispersion to the right less dispersion to the left if anything if you have more uh dispersion securities become more illiquid which is the opposite of the prediction then we put it into a regression illiquidity on and uh the results that we get are either that there is no relationship or that the relationship goes the other way along which means more dispersion less liquidity this is with some bond rating differences this is with uh analyst focused uh dispersion then we try to run some sort of a horse race between prices and measures of um of differences of opinions uh and we find that either distances of uranus are no longer related to liquidity or again they go in the wrong way price effect is always there the question is whether the price contains some information about uh about um uh belief dispersion if anything we find that price has a negative relationship with uh belief dispersion which again even if spice is catching to some extent belief dispersion it goes the other way of what the theory would predict and here we show you a regression in which we have a nonlinear structure of four or four different bins for the rating dispersion and price and if anything they show that um that uh um when you control well with uh with the bonfix effect the results goes away when we look into analyst dispersion it's the same story price is always negatively related to liquidity measures of dispersion which we might not be capturing this version the way that the theorists have thought about this version but we use the measures of dispersion that exists these measures have been used in studies of uh lincoln get a genius beliefs to stock returns in the past or they have been used before in the case of liquidity um they don't seem to uh have much bearing on on explaining liquidity so the next next question is you know we are not we are not here to declare that the theory of heterogeneous beliefs and explain that in liquidity is there we only say that it doesn't seem to explain inequality of the bond market in the 08 09 financial crisis but the question is how much of illiquidity can we actually explain just with mere prices with the alves selection uh version of the story and to do that what we do is to estimate a regression model of um inequality on a non-linear structure of of uh bond prices and then use the regression models to predict liquidity for each of the bonds and then aggregate it up and see how much of the liquidity can be explained with the decline in prices um so first you know why are we doing that because as you saw before there was a major shift uh in prices of bonds in the crisis you see here that the the curves on the right shows you the prices before lehman curve one this is a cds the curve on the green curve shows you what happens immediately after element and then over time it goes back so there was a shift in prices you can also see it if you look into the probability density functions how prices um um go moves move to the left uh prices uh places go down so we use these shocking prices or these change in prices to see what happened to uh can we predict illiquidity and here's what we get before the crisis um we can do uh an okay job up to our weight in explaining liquidity the same holds uh from 2010 and onward in the crisis depending on the specific specification of the regression we can explain between 25 and 30 of the liquidity uh with just prices you know there's a large uh fraction that remains unexplained but still you can explain about 30 of the variation with the declining prices so this is uh you know these these are these are our main results and then we move in to discuss some uh potential policy implications the policy implications stem mostly from our work on credit traps that you know we have written 2012 and here's the intuition that we have is if you buy into the model of other selection information sensitivity of that and one is interested in monetary theory that is designed to boost lending the main concern is that if you move uh not quickly enough you're going to move when asset values are already deteriorating asset but you're already deteriorating balance sheets are weak then even if you are going to inject liquidity international sector fashion sector is going to be reluctant to issue to the real sector given that the real sector is now in the information sensitive region so one idea here is that of course if you want to move you have to move before balance sheets are too weak because of weak balance sheets um moving into the information sensitive uh sensitive region are going to make it less likely that the banks would would lend to firms i mean what we have done in the other paper which we think is relevant here is that in the interest of increasing asset values or strengthening balance sheets one can think about fiscal policy that is going to strengthen balance sheets that after the fiscal policy monetary policy would be more effective because of fiscal policy would make sure that balance sheets are stronger so we are referring to things like uh reduction in in in in tax rates et cetera um so this is what we have you know the conclusion that we would like to know is that the data is consistent with an information sensitivity theory of liquidity as in donegalton and hopstorm we have here we do it in the context of the financial crisis um outside of crises we have done a thorough analysis of 10 years of liquidity uh and prices for the bond market in our other paper in which we have done everything that we could both with cross-sectional tests as well as with ivs to convince uh convince the readers that indeed illiquidity should be priced but also inequality is affected by prices uh between a quarter or a third of the increase in bond liquidity after the collapse of lehman can be explained by merely the fact that bond prices have declined and you know with the caveat that our measure our our results are as good our conclusions are as good as the measures we find little support for the hypothesis that opinion dispersion explains liquidity illiquidity in the financial crisis of foreign online
