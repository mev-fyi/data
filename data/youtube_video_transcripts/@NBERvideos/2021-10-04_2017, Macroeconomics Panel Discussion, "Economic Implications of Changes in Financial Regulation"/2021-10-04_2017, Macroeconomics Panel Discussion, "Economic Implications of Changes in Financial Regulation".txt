we were encouraged to kind of narrow our topics since financial regulation is a very broad topic uh into uh pieces that we're particularly interested in so i'm going to talk about and use my time to talk about mortgage regulation mortgage policy which was an area that i i worked on a bunch when i was at the treasury department and i want to share some thoughts about how we were we were thinking about it so this slide i'm going to give you some background on key institutional and regulatory developments in the mortgage market since the financial crisis so this of course is a very kind of complicated topic a ton has happened so i'm not i'm not going to do it justice but i'm going to distill it down into three bullets so the first thing you want to understand is that um fannie and freddie uh the gses they were put under government control in 2008 um so benny and freddie those are the the big financial institutions in this country that buy and securitize what people would consider to be kind of garden-variety american mortgages so fixed-rate 30-year not too big not too risky or supposedly not too risky loans um so it's been eight and a half years and uh those eight and a half years have been full of talk about how we really need legislation that establishes a new permanent mortgage finance regulatory framework however fannie and freddie have remained in conservatorship there has been no such regulation or legislation sorry um second development i want to note is that new activity in the private label mortgage-backed securities market uh it dried up during the financial crisis and it never revived um so so it's kind of a striking thing and um as an aside here i will note that um i'm really glad that you are featuring this paper this afternoon on the housing boom because the paper uh makes a point that is also made in some very interesting interesting work by chris foote and paul willen and lara lowenstein that um that basically the increase the excess of borrowing lending that occurred during the financial crisis it it was across the credit spectrum it was across the income distribution so this view that um somehow the pls market was disproportionately responsible it's just it's just it's just wrong i'm glad kind of the narrative is now being clarified um third development i want to highlight is that there has indeed been some constructive regulatory progress in that in the mortgage area there are new consumer financial protection bureau rules that better protect the consumer uh there are stronger capital standards for banks which certainly which apply to mortgages and certainly uh help make the banking system safer okay so um now i want to take a minute to talk about what i see as the current situation in mortgage markets and and and what it implies for macro growth so um the number one concern that you you hear people express is that the supply of mortgage credit looks like it's still tight so here are a couple of charts that that kind of uh make that point so on the left you can see mortgage purchase originations and what you see in that chart is they they dropped a bunch after the housing uh boom during the bust and they've come back up but they've only come back up to their 2002 level and just to appreciate how low that is you need to realize that the number of households is up by 15 uh since then and this is this measures in billions of dollars house prices are up by more than 50 since 2002 so this is a low level that we're at now and then the graph on the right shows you credit score at origination for mortgages so it shows the median it shows the 10th percentile what you can see is that credit scores went up a bunch during the financial crisis and they really haven't come back that much or come down that much they remain well above where they were in 2002 so this is kind of pre-boom okay so what do we make of these graphs um so you can i think it is certainly true that low originations and higher credit scores they can reflect factors on the borrower side on the kind of demand for mortgage side i mean we know that the financial crisis depleted people's assets that they might use uh for down payments um you know people have more student loans you could argue people are less interested in owning homes and maybe it's all concentrated kind of in the lower end of the risk spectrum and so you could you could explain the charts i just showed you but at the same time so some of those factors are probably coming into play but at the same time there's lots of evidence suggesting that factors on the lender side are playing a big role holding back mortgage credit in here you can look at surveys of senior loan officers who say they really haven't unwound much of the tightening of credit standards that occurred during the financial crisis um if you just talk to banks they talk about how they're being much more cautious than they used to be about um about lending because uh because they're worried about um kind of bite from the regulators uh you know there are measures out there of how much time it now takes to underwrite a mortgage uh it's up to five hours it used to be one hour before the crisis takes much more time to service delinquent loans so there very are um likely to be uh lender uh factors on the lender's side that are explaining the thai credits situation so another interesting feature of the current situation is that housing of gdp the housing share of gdp remains low and this is a pretty one easy one to see this is just residential investment as a share of gdp and what you can see is that it's now uh around 3.8 so it's down from 5 uh prior to the crisis and uh what people like to point out is that well if you took that 3.8 and you brought it up to 5 that would add more than a percentage point two to growth over some period um so that's true um but then you take these two facts together and it begs the correct the question would greater access to mortgage credit boost gdp growth well so here i'm actually quite skeptical so first of all the economy is already at full employment so kind of boosting mortgage demand uh is uh you know either because a fed reaction or some other mechanism isn't likely to raise the level of gdp um but i think the other more uh uh important factor and this is something we were just talking about at our lunch table um we've seen this really rapid growth of home prices i mean they've snapped back they're now back to their levels um at the peak of the housing boom um and so we've had kind of not much booming and queue and a lot of movement in p which kind of suggests that there's another constraint there and um i think i think i think there's there are good arguments that uh that the real constraint is with house and supply either land use regulations or something else that's holding back home construction okay so uh that's microgrowth uh just a few thoughts on the current situation with mortgages and what implies for risk to the macroeconomy um so one point to note is that given reforms to date and uh the still tight credit conditions i told you about there is just much less risk in the system relative to pre-crisis um but then the other important thing to recognize is that most mortgage debt continues to be backed by the us government so here's a graph that makes that this point this is uh mortgage originations by kind of type of backer um who's holding a credit risk and what you can see here uh if you look at the gray portions of the bars and then which is uh the gsc securitization and the black portions which is um uh those are uh fha federal housing authority loans those are that's the government program for kind of lower income higher risk people you can see the gray and black uh they amount to almost 70 percent of mortgage erration origin nations right now so this is down from immediately uh immediately kind of post-crisis when it was up to 90 but you can see uh it's still well above where it was kind of in the early 2000s okay so um of course the implications here are that um you know if the market were to come under to go into distress uh come under stream uh the debt is going to be backed by uh by the us government either through the gsus or through the fha so um for that reason um that's probably good news uh in terms of risk to the economy although it leaves the taxpayers of course on the hook okay so um just to to sum up that those points the current situation with mortgages i don't think it's probably a big deal in terms of macro growth at least in the near term or in terms of risk to the macro economy but that doesn't mean that uh we like the current situation with mortgage regulation and mortgage policy um you know the problem with the current situation it's not desirable it's not sustainable and uh you know what i mean here is that uh we don't want i mean it's not desirable for several reasons i mean we don't want the taxpayer on the hook for all this credit risk the government isn't particularly good at innovating so you worry about that with the government uh having such heavy involvement in the mortgage market when it comes to kind of the still tight credit conditions um you know they may not be a big deal in terms of growth and risk to the macro economy but it's undesirable from a distributional point of view and there are a lot of specific stories i mean economists have not nailed this down exactly what's going on but there are a lot of uh stories people tell that suggest that kind of the current situation with the gses being in limbo and so much money being done during by the government is contributing to the problem so for example in the case of fha loans um you hear a lot about how lenders are just very worried about making loans that have any kind of processing error and that's explaining part of their kind of super caution when it comes to lending because they're they don't have clarity about what the repercussions would be from the government side um so i think these things would be fixed um you know if we could have more uh entry uh from the private sector into the mortgage market but what you hear i mean i don't have uh this has not been established definitively but what you hear from uh people in the private sector is that they aren't coming in because they can't compete with the government um in terms of sustainability of the current situation this is a somewhat narrow point but um the gscs right now they're in conservatorship um there's still just over 20 is still owned by private shareholders but the current conservatorship arrangement calls for all the profits of the gses to go back to the treasury department um you know on the treasury side they provided all this support during the financial crisis and they continue to provide a substantial line of credit to the gses um but basically there are lawsuits uh by some of the private shareholders that are arguing the situation is not unfair and um the further the longer this continues with the all the profits going to the treasury department it's going to be um it's gonna be hard to kind of sustain the current situation given legal challenges and also political pressures so um there are uh so so let me get to gsc reform uh there are a number of proposals out there um that have come come out in the eight and a half years a lot of them are good interesting proposals if you try to read them they'll probably make your your head hurt because they have a lot of complications but they are out there um the promise that there are practical political obstacles that are going to make reform difficult to achieve and um on my list here um first of all the financial engineering issues associated with the with mortgage markets they're very complicated um if you don't have the patience to kind of figure out uh healthcare reform i mean try figuring out the financial engineering associated with the secondary mortgage market so that's that's a political obstacle um second uh complication and where's jim stocks over there i worked with jim stock on gsc reform in the spring of 2000 2014 and i think this will resonate with him they're very powerful from a political perspective what we would used to call stakeholders with strong views so this is the mortgage industry the housing industry consumer groups um they have loud voices and in fact the there was almost us gsa reform in the spring of 2014 but it was brought down at least in part by a lack of ability to agree with the about what the affordability provisions would be in the legislation um third it's not just a matter of figuring out where we need to go a lot of these plans say well here's where you want to be it's a matter of how do we get there um and that can be really really complicated uh so there are a lot of people out there who who really hate fannie and freddie and just want to kind of get rid of them all together but i think we need to recognize that the further that we move away from the current infrastructure the harder it's going to be to implement and then lastly um there are big uncertainties including what happens to the cost of mortgages these are things that you just can't nail down definitively and what that means when uh when it comes to kind of trying to do reform is that any reform is going to involve winners and losers the losers are the prospective losers are always going to be able to hire someone who is able to uh you know argue that oh the cost of mortgages will will shoot up if you put so much much of the system back into private hands and that's just going to be those sorts of attacks are going to be hard to uh to kind of shoot down analytically and that's going to be an obstacle but i don't want to kind of end on a negative note here um i would say there is good news and the good news would be uh that most experts agree about the basics of what's needed when it comes to gst reform so like i said the plans uh that are out there there are a ton of them uh it would probably take you weeks to sort through them but people have sorted through them and you know what after you do that you kind of realize that the plans all have a lot of features in common so um here's what's on my list so first of all plans out there in general much greater role for the private sector including private capital backing more of the risk of the system secondly plans out there generally have the government backing the catastrophic mortgage risk okay um so that's one role the government plays and then importantly the government has more has flexibility to do more if the system comes under stress and i think that this part that i've italicized here that's a really important kind of point because there are there are some plants out there that would just put it all in the hands of the private sector but history has taught us that um the government is going to step in if the mortgage market threatens to go down so it's better to have uh this kind of built into a system um in there and you know able to access um in on an on an orderly basis uh than to just let chaos uh break out and have the government come in um a third feature uh is that um of these plans is that the in general that secured the entity that securitizes the government-backed mortgages is a government run securitizer and i think this is actually another important feature because you want to avoid having a too important to fail private private entity in this role or else you're going to end up with an entity that needs to be bailed out um so those are the features in general these plans um as for the pls market uh which i told you dried up uh and really has never revived uh it's not clear we need to kind of make it come back my view is that um i mean i've asked a lot of smart people about what their understanding is that why the market hasn't come back and i think where people come out is that the economics are not working right now that it's just not profitable to have that market and i think what needs to happen is we need to to really resolve the situation with the gses um and and then see what happens to the pls market and see if there is some sort of obstacle that's holding it back or whether it really is just a market that is not going to be profitable to be in over the longer run um so so anyway that's that's my last slide i guess uh my main takeaway would be that um even though it doesn't seem like the current situation really is a terrible thing in terms of growth or risk of the macro economy we really should be trying to move towards kind of permanent longer term gse reform and i think um we really the political obstacles are going to mean that uh you know the plan uh that we come up with may not be the perfect plan from an economist's point of view but i think as long as uh what we end up with incorporates some basic features that uh that will end up in a much better situation than what's likely to happen given the current unsustainability of the current conservatorship arrangement which is that there'll be some sort of modification to the conservatorship arrangement but basically one that leaves the market in limbo so that's it i'll try to say a few words about bank regulation and try to speak in particular to a couple places where you know in in the many number of things uh out there a couple that seem like they at least might be potentially in play uh with the new administration one of these is the stress testing process the so-called c-car that the fed does and the other is the um what's called the orderly liquidation authority this was title two of dodd-frank it's the legal authority which basically allows um the fdic to take over and resolve a failing bank holding company okay say a little bit about both of those but let me just do like a you know a few words of conceptual framing at the beginning which is i don't think i would have to spend a lot of time convincing anybody in this room that broadly higher capital requirements was sort of a sensible thing for various reasons so i won't okay but but uh uh you know moral hazard but i'm not gonna do any of that uh i just wanna say i think a piece of it that's underappreciated is the dynamic aspect it's one thing to say you want to have a higher level of capital it's another to think about how you rebuild capital after an adverse shock so i'm going to call this dynamic resilience and i think this is a very important and somewhat underappreciated i think and i'm going to try and relate the the the specific policy stuff to this this idea but just as an example suppose you set capital requirements to ten percent and you convince yourself that's like a pretty robust thing to do because the worst shock we've ever seen in history was five percent okay so then along comes a shock and it's only three percent so the good news is you're still well solvent and you know the government's not on the hook and all that but if you were binding at ten percent and you have to be binding again at ten percent and they've just lost three percent three percentage points well you know if they don't raise new equity and you don't relax the capital requirement they're going to have to shrink their assets by 30 okay so from a you know macro prudential perspective if you care not only literally about bank solvency today but about credit creation asset sales all that kind of thing you need to get some capital back in the system i should say algebraically you need one of two things you either need to be willing to relax the capital requirement after an adverse shock or you need to get capital back into the system and both of those are sort of important challenges in their own right so basel iii regime nods at the former they say well of the the capital requirement 2.5 percent is a conservation buffer which in principle after a bad thing you should be allowed to dip into in practice it's not at all obvious that banks will be willing to dip into this because they know they have to get back their shareholders know they have to get back they're kind of in the penalty box until they get back so they're going to kind of want to get back and maybe they'll kind of constrain asset growth and of course on the latter the getting new dollars of equity into the system it's all well and good from a social perspective but after the shock you know the bank's debt is trading impaired and new money in this is the classic debt overhang problem new money in is good for the bondholders but it's viewed as dilutive essentially to the equity holders so without some force applied they're not going to just happily recapitalize um on their own okay so that that brings us to sort of stress testing and um the original you know the first stress test which was done in may 2009 sort of in the in the you know in the heart of the depths of the crisis was quite successful you know lots of lots of issues one thing it did that i think was really smart is when it looked at the banks it didn't say well you know you're got pretty big losses you need to improve your capital ratio by two percentage points which would have given them the choice between doing it via numerator or denominator i.e new dollars of equity or shrinking it said to bank of america you have a 33 billion dollar hole you need to get 33 billion dollars of capital in that was i think a really central conceptual insight so you know again lots of things done right and done wrong i think that was a that was a good thing and one of the one of the one of the reasons that the the banking system was able to kind of bounce back after 2009. so that was i think the good part of the 2009 stress test the bad part of the 2009 stress test is it was done in 2009 for god's sake i mean you know forget about crystal balls you know nobody knew you could see this crisis coming where by mid-2007 it was sort of happening okay everybody knew between mid-2007 and lehman brothers the banks paid out more than 100 billion dollars in um dividends and share repurchases while raising very little new fresh equity that was a massive policy failure okay so you know even if you couldn't see anything coming ahead of time the thing didn't just happen overnight it dragged out kind of over a couple years before the worst really came so the failure to recapitalize was was a huge policy error and to me the whole not the whole but a very large fraction of the virtue of doing stress testing is that you will have a process that allows the regulators next time around to intervene and to force new dollars of equity into the system so you know they're stress testing every year and i think it's great you're trying to build sort of a process and a set of institutions but really the test is going to come next time we have a 2007 and ask are they successful okay so as i said i think stress testing is one of the things where things are a little bit up for grabs because this is a case where personnel really is policy it's not about legislative stuff it's you know who succeeds dan tarulo who just left uh this week um in the in the the the sort of fed chair bank supervision you know how you design the details of that test are really really important and one thing to recognize is doing it during peace time it turns into a quite different exercise so doing doing it during peace time and this has become one of the flash points is what you're doing is not forcing recapitalization you can't be doing that kind of constantly in steady state it has become a sort of off the books de facto capital regime so in other words whatever basel iii says your capital requirement is if the stress test is more binding that is your capital requirement and the individual weights on individual assets will vary according to that so for example bankers will complain i don't know how valid this is that the stress test puts a higher effective risk weight on small business loans why because in the stress scenario they're assumed to do badly so one of the things there's a lot of complaint about is there's relatively little transparency into this and you know when you set capital requirements in on a rulemaking basis there's a whole set of due process that you have to go through and you have to put them out for comment and so forth and this does that kind of a little bit um you know with less with less due process so i think there's a sort of interesting tension here to be managed and on the one hand of course if you're a regulator and you don't really like the rules and you'd like to be tougher it's nice to be able to kind of bury some of the toughness in the stress test and i'm absolutely sympathetic but if you're sort of managing this thing and what your real goal is i don't want to spend too much of my political capital during peace time because i absolutely really need as much institutional backbone and toughness as possible you know when things get tough maybe you're willing to kind of open that up a little bit and i'm not saying you know it's an all or a nothing thing but you could imagine a little bit more transparency on some of these things again not because it's the first best but it's a second best way of trying to trying to manage this tension i mean one thing that was very interesting and dan tarulo just gave a departing speech he said another aspect of the stress test has been the so-called qualitative thing where you can flunk some of these banks basically because the risk management processes are not very good or their you know computer systems are not very good he made a point which i thought was very politically shrewd which is you know we've done that and it's been sort of helpful at this point it may make sense to take that out of the very very high visibility spotlight of the stress testing and make this part of the more normal bank supervisory process it was getting to the point where citibank was flunked once the second time their ceo said if i flunk again i'm going to resign so you're putting the fed in the position of during peace time firing the ceo of a major bank over something that's qualitative and a little hard to describe again i'm making a sort of a purely political point which is how much do you want to do that and have to explain in front of congress when the real most important thing is having it something that's going to work in a in a repeat of 2007. so i don't mean to sort of prejudge exactly the answer but that's the way i would be thinking thinking about you know where you're willing to dial back and where you absolutely feel like you need to need to hold the line second thing i want to mention is the so-called orderly liquidation authority so this is title two of dodd-frank it gives the fdic the legal authority to essentially act as a resolver of a bank holding company and importantly as part of that there is a piece called the orderly liquidation fund which allows the treasury to essentially extend a credit line to a failing firm it's essentially like a form of debtor and possession financing in case there's a liquidity run against the firm okay that is vulnerable i think most of dodd-frank is essentially not going to be touched because it'll take 60 votes to to undo it okay this is different this one title two is different it's different because of this orderly liquidation fund because it's a budgetary authority my understanding and other people who've looked at this say it can be done under reconciliation and therefore only take 51 votes and there is a not highly economic desire to do this in part because it has budgetary authority it's scored the cbo scores this at this authority as sort of using up 15 billion dollars of budget headroom so you know if you want to like do your favorite other tax reform thing here's a way to find 15 billion dollars so this is potentially vulnerable this is i think one of the better post-crisis uh things not that it was going to work beautifully but at least it was again an attempt to take a failing firm to be able to have a bunch of its debt be converted to equity so that the private sector wasn't going to have but to allow that to happen or to make that a little bit easier there was going to be this credit line to kind of prevent a liquidity run at the same time that you are actually using private sector money to recapitalize so you know i don't i don't know how to put odds on this i think it's still probably hopefully less than 50 but it's alive it seems to me a live issue um and that's when i think that would be concerning for financial stability also i think they're very likely to be um sort of adverse international repercussions if this goes away so for example the u.s has worked very closely with the uk on all these resolution plans and of course goldman sachs and morgan stanley and all these guys have very big broker-dealer subsidiaries in the uk if we basically pull back on our willingness to provide liquidity to these firms what's the rational reaction for the uk regulators they're going to want a ring fence they're going to want to basically do a bunch of stuff to protect their own interests and given the more general kind of environment around protectionism i think this could lead to a bit of an outbreak of sort of financial protectionism what is to be done if if things go this way i mean i think it's not a good thing the one very second best thing i would suggest as part of this process there has been a debt requirement imposed that basically these banks in addition to having to have equity capital have to have a certain amount of long-term debt at the holding company that can be easily converted into equity okay you know if you don't have any ability to provide liquidity i would at least want to have a bigger slug of equity at the point of failure so that there's less likelihood of the private market wanting to pull back so if you took away that authority for me at a minimum i think the right thing to do would be to revisit these debt requirements and to think about making them i i think that'd be a good thing to do either way because either way when the treasury has to decide to lend then the more it has sort of a big slug of capital um newly created capital i think the easier is the is the thing okay so that's that's it i think i think that's that's one to kind of keep and uh keep an eye on okay thanks i'll just start off saying these are my thoughts um and not the thoughts of uh fidelity investments um and i would also mention that um i am a market participant i'm an empirical economist um i am one of those people you have been discussing this morning you know there's people who you know what's going to happen with stock prices what what are inflation expectations uh what's going to happen with the bond market that's that's my job so um happy to be here and if you would like to observe me in the future you know please give me a ring um so uh i am going to talk a little bit uh in defense of um we'll talk about you know comments on the intersection of regulation monetary policy and macroeconomic vibrancy and i am going to make a defense of price discovery capital allocation risk and return and volatility i think all of those things are really good things i think everyone in this room thinks these are good things i think regulation is a good thing i think it's also good to understand sometimes when regulation starts to change some of the dynamics in the market so i'll talk about i'll i'll be very general very non-specific non-theoretical et cetera et cetera what regulations are you talking about lisa i would say maybe it's sarbanes-oxley maybe it's dodd-frank maybe it's the erisa decisions back in the 1970s maybe it's the new dol ruling maybe it's the fed's qe policy in zurp all of these things i think have affected the market and some for good and some for bad and i'm just going to talk a little bit about this idea of vibrancy so many of you have talked about productivity and there's just a little chart of productivity and maybe one of the questions is why has productivity been not very robust this cycle lots of ideas i don't have one reason for why that is i do think at the same time we have such a low productivity rate um the share of of of income that goes to the corporate sector is actually quite high so ah that's kind of interesting that might not make a ton of sense so why could this be happening and so i will go back to i think what middle school kids learn about when they learn about the great depression or maybe it's maybe it's what high school kids learn about but on the left hand side i have a picture of the dust bowl which i think all of you know was about monocultures that you keep planting the same crop every single year and the the soil fecundity falls down and you hit it with a drought and all of a sudden the wind comes and away goes your topsoil and we have the grapes of wrath and one of the big uh contributors to the great depression on the right hand side somebody i showed this to one of my colleagues and he said why do you have broccoli there that's a two pictures one on top of each other one is a top picture of a rain forest and the and the picture here with the white square is um uh research uh that's been done on the vibrancy of of a rainforest why why do we have all these different animals and species and plants and trees and big trees little trees and what they did here with this square is they sprayed it with fungicide they just killed the stuff in there and what they found was that the dominant species or trees or plants in the forest just boomed and the competition that was going on in that little square all the little seedlings etc basically got removed and then the larger got larger the more dominant got more dominant et cetera why am i spending so much time time talking about this i do think that to some extent the combination of the regulatory environment that we have and the monetary policy that we've been running may in fact be creating some of these dynamics i'll mention i read a piece from grants interest rate observer this past week that i i i actually got permission to give you all a copy but um i think the ecosystem i'm living in is a much less robust ecosystem than i used to live in that's fine but i just want to all let you know that it's different but i put this paper uh in in the other room when i'm done so let me talk a little bit about a couple of things these are observations i told you i'm an empiricist not a theorist this is uh new companies going public peaks in the late 90s has continued to go down and it's not just its new listings and d listings right so just that's interesting um this is u.s firms this is total firms this is public and private firms this is new entrants and new and exits so both of those have gone down so the you know think of those seedlings on the bottom of the the rain forest that they're just not coming the small business formation is not happening and the big guys are not exiting why is that is because you're you're not getting this you know um proper um uh birth and death in the market okay you're not getting that vibrancy that you have historically gotten and and this is you know this is a big long-term chart you know lisa you're making huge you know leaps and assumptions but i i i do think this is very interesting this is um the age of firms and you can see the firms that are 16 years old and older the big big trees that's more than a third of all firms today okay that's a that's a very big change in sort of that ecosystem that we we live in so why is this happening and i'll talk about sort of four concepts one is what i call central banks and market dominance um and and karen and actually both of you i was so thrilled that you both came before me because um you know it's important if the government is the market it's important to realize you are the market you're no longer the referee on the field you are the key player on the field so i'll talk a little bit about central banks i'll talk about low rates from a supply side perspective i'll talk about cheap credit and high visibility and what the reaction of people like me the market participant the cfos of the world when you give us low rates and high visibility what do we do i'll tell you i'm i'm sure some of you have a guess and then price discovery and why it matters so here we have the yield curves of the three major central banks of the world we have negative rates in some places we have ultra low and others there's sort of two stories i want to tell you um the first is um [Music] ultra low rates um and quantitative easing now i put a picture of warren buffett on there and and it's because i'll just tell i'll make a fairy tale story for you and the story is that something horrible has happened to berkshire hathaway and it's on the verge of bankruptcy and warren buffett gets up on the podium in front of the television cameras and says whatever i can do i will do and every month as long as we're in trouble i'm going to buy 20 billion of berkshire hathaway stock okay what do you think berkshire hathaway stock will do it will go up in value no matter what okay he is going to be a buyer um if i'm an analyst covering berkshire hathaway what's my number one concern what is the biggest thing i'm trying to figure out is oh the day that berkshire hathaway is a going concern he's going to stop buying so i better you know i better get the heck out of berkshire hathaway stock before he stops buying now quantitative easing i understand why we want to get lower rates and we want to create that nice positive demand dynamic cetera but it creates a very uni-faceted fixed income market so when we analyze these yield curves the japanese yield curve and the u.s yield curve in particular and we do a principal component analysis sort of how many things are affecting how that yield curve moves pre-crisis you know when when the japanese basically got to zurp or zero interest rate policy it became a very unifaceted yield curve when we went to zurp we became a unifaceted yield curve so there's very few things moving this thing around there's not lots of price discovery and buyers and sellers and movers it's it's the warren buffett which happens to be the central bank at this point uh really affecting uh the price the other thing that's going on and i apologize this is really basic stuff but this is a price control you you you introduce super low rates you have a price control and your willingness to extend credit into a market where you're not allowed to charge the price you want to you will offer less and so for example the mortgage market there's lots of things going on in the mortgage market but why does the private sector not want to get back into this market part of it is they can't price it appropriately so that's something to think about that there's a supply side effect of ultra low rates not just a demand side effect um you know in terms of vibrancy i i think it's interesting uh we have um another aspect in the market which is uh we have passive investment vehicles passive investment vehicles are let's call it spx or the index s p or the low vol etf or the hyg high yield [Music] vehicle these are vehicles where you buy the basket you don't you don't have a discussion well i think you know this is cheap and this is expensive and i really like this management or i don't like this management you buy the basket period that's a third of the u.s equity market today so all i'm highlighting is that those baskets do not do on market analysis they just buy what the market tells them to buy um and and we can see that again with principal component analysis so this this is just uh what number of factors explains 50 of the variants in the uh in the in that in the russell 3000 we can see um sort of these big macro shocks that we saw post-crisis the the the gfc the european banking crisis uh the uh the the debt ceiling crisis etc um but generally the the amount of sort of signals that we have in the market is getting less and less so again just think of those that that that forest floor just a little less dynamic than it used to be and then i i just want to talk about a lot of talk about expectations and you know response to expectations and signaling and yes the central bank has been extremely clear about what wants to do with rates and yes they have made rates extremely low now if i'm a cfo of a company my bread and butter is this thing called roe return on equity this is uh the dupont model it just decomposes where does roe come from and this the world is a scary place um you know certainly 2010 2011 2012 we still don't really know what's going on what's the tool that i use again and again and again and that is the seconds from the last which is leverage okay so the u.s non-financial corporate sector has been using leverage they've done exactly what you wanted them to do sort of they didn't really invest they they just use leverage so um you know this is this is what we've got it's maybe not my favorite piece of news you know i'd much rather have us investing in um in in in vibrancy and operating efficiency and all those good things but but this is this is maybe one of the things to think about going forward so those are those are my thoughts and i'll take it off
