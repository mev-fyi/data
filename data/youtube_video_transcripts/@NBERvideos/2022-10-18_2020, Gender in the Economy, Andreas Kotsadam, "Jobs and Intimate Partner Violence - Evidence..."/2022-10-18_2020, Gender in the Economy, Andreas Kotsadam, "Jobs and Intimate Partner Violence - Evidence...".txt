I will present the paper jobs and internet partner violence evidence from a field experiment in Ethiopia and the paper is written with me and has been the language so intimate partner violence and there's large costs in terms of women's health productivity shame and fear it is a problem that is prevalent in all countries of the world but to varying degrees the costs are really large so a fair and Hoffler estimate that the cost of the world GDP is around five percent uh and in sub-Saharan Africa it's even larger so it's estimated that the cost amounts to around 15 for the region CDP uh in partner violence it's a large problem in Ethiopia which is the context where we do our study there are many theories about the relationship between employment and intimate partner violence the most simple Theory simply states that if women become employed they will automatically become empowered and when they become empowered the implementation violence will will be reduced and of course there are other theories a more neuron series stating for instance that if women become employed their Partners may not like it and they may use violence to counteract The increased empowerment by the by their Partners in order to reinstate their power within the family it is also the case that if intimate partner violence is used instrumentally in order to extract resources it may very well increase when women get a job because there are simply more more resources to extract so in general one could say that how one how one views this phenomena theoretically it depends on whether violence is seen as expressive or instrumental and whether the effects are moderated by other behavior and attitudes of the micro and macro level so most previous evidence on the relationship between employment and in the Republican islands is based on correlational studies and they find both types of correlations in particular one finds that employment is correlated within internet personal violence and more intimate partial violence in in countries that are more acceptance of violence whereas in in countries where violence is less accepted than the relationship seems to be negative that is the correlation so such correlations are of course Very illustrative but they do not tell us whether employment the vaccines intimate partner violence whether intimate partner violence affects employment or further which is very likely there are some other factor that affects both employment but there are of course studies that have used better identification strategies and just correlational analyzes and in particular there are a series of papers using biotic instruments and the findings from those studies is that when labor markets have better conditions for women abuse decreases in the US and in the UK but it increases in Mexico and an area suspense in Spain where men are traditionally Breadwinners so our project is the first identify the effects of jobs on with partner violence using a randomized field experiment so what do we do we cooperate with large farms in Ethiopia to randomly assign African women with Partners either a job offer or not we collect Baseline Data before organization and follow-up data at three points in time so the experiment was pre-registered and everything I'm going to show you today is pre-registered we have some exploratory analysis in the in the paper as well so what do we find well first of all we find that based on employment is positively correlated with abuse that is if we just take the women at Baseline and we look at whether they have had the formal job ever before we find that those that have had a formal job before are more likely to have been abused in the last three months and this is exactly what we would find if we were to down the demographic and health survey data for Ethiopia or for sub-Saharan Africa in general so this this correlation is nothing special for for our deficit but this correlation is what you find in sub-Saharan Africa so we have a clear first stage predicting employment earnings income and time use so for instance we find that that the probability of having a job or having been working during the last six months is uh is 40 percentage points higher you've been randomly assigned to being after the job the earnings are also more than double it has clear material consequences but we can reject relatively small average effects on partner violence in any direction so it's not only that it's not statistically significant for the coefficients is quite close to zero and uh and there's no average large average okay so the field experiment was that we we cooperated with 27 large factories mainly shoes and garment factories in a deal built randomly Assam assign around 1500 African women with Partners either a job offer or not we collect Baseline Data before randomization and then we collect follow-up data after six months after a year and after one and a half years these are the regions in the field where we do where we do our study so how does this work well the company's first assess all job applicants and determine whether each applicant is eligible for the job or not and then lists are created containing eligible partner entry-level applicants as a given Factory in time and then within this list we then randomly assign uh people tired of getting a job offer which we call treatment Auto control group and this is possible since there's a large excess demand for jobs so when this factor is higher they are usually have set up a sign on there on the front door of the factory areas and there are many many people coming so there are many more women who want this job than can actually get the base pay is collected using a detailed survey instrument so we have a survey team that whenever one of these firms wanted to hire our server team went there to these factories and they interior women and then they went there again after six months after a year and after one and a half years and the women are into before they start working and the first follow-up data collection is six months after that right so we find the reassuring the treatment and control women are balanced almost at the Baseline covariates that are themselves predictive of abuse and out of our 1500 reminisce and women we have interviewed around 1300 for the six months follow-up around 1200 for the one year follow-up and around 1100 for the 18 months follow-up so there is definitely some attrition but important the attrition is not correlated with treatment uh the only thing that is correlated with attrition is H whereby younger women or more difficult to to find the gamma so we measure abuse using uh using standard survey techniques and standard survey questions is self-reported abuse mostly that we use and we base the questions on the sequencing that the violence against women instrument is using and we use the conflict tactics so in particular we use specifically trained staff that have a strict protocol to ensure privacy so if anyone is within hearing distance they do not ask the questions about the internet partner violence and they instead ask them later on and in particular one uses different questions ranging from pushing shaking and slapping to attacking with a gun knife or other weapon and this is in order to give the woman multiple chances to to reveal them to reveal the abuse and also so that there will not be any definitional questions about what the views is this is this is strictly defined as have your partner ever select you and then if the answer yes the question is has this happened within the last three months or not okay so we create our main dependent variable from these questions that's just abuse last three months which equals one if the respondent has been abused by their partnered in the last three months and we find that 19.3 for the women in our sample have been abused So based on specification is simple than regressing whether you have been abused in the last three months of the first follow-up we regress that on the treatment dummy that is equal to one if you're randomly assigned to a job or not and that include list fixed effects because remember that the randomization occurred within this list so these are important straighter variables then we can control the outcome control for the outcome of Baseline and other controls if you want to and we always show results both with and with us and a vector based on control variables includes things like religion education age and and whether people have been working before yeah so the first stage is done we find that there are effects on the randomization employment and income as already shown you the large effects on the probability of having a job and on earnings and interesting we also find that there are effects on the share of the share of earnings within a couple so whereas women on average in the control group earn around 26 23 of them of the couple's earnings this increases by almost 20 percentage points if we're more randomly assigned to have a job the probability that she earns more than him is also almost bubbled so that's uh that's important especially if we believe that the theories about um about the status inconsistency then there may be a discontinuity at the point where she actually starts I mean more than him that's important that we have some we have some first stage there as well and then income from any Source not only from from factory work it's it's definitely increasing quite substantially if the women are around the neuroscient to jump off okay they also see effects on time use so we see that uh not surprisingly the number of hours worked again in any type of job however the responder wants to Define it it's increasing mainly at the expense of leisure and the little bit that the expense of building household work but note that household work is not decreasing as much as always works are increasing so there may be a double shift going on here whereby women's total amount of work is and uh factory work so interestingly we don't find that men are increasing their household work movement is not working but we do find instead is that the eldest daughter is usually picking up some of the snacks yeah they they mail the story is usually doing a bit more household work we also find that women reduce their social and religious activities and they attend less political meetings as I showed you before there is uh this is negative but it's quite close to zero uh if we if we include all the based on control variables is very stable it feels that the calculations instead include optimal control variables by this double the biased lasso approach is very stable as well and if we conduct the equivalence tests we can reject that the effects are relatively relatively large so we can we can say that uh or relatively small I would say so we can we can say that we can reject relatively small effects both positive and negative we do find some effects in the in the first follow-up on emotional violence and if we if we look at the different components of emotional violence we find that that it seems to affect all aspects of emotional violence to some degree so if people are women are less likely to have been healed humiliated threatened or insulted by their partner if they were randomly assigned so why don't we find any effects of employment on on our main measure Implement partner violence well there could be many reasons for this it could be that employment does not affect importance mediators such as empowerment or gender refugees it could also be that it affects different types of women in opposite directions and that the effects doesn't cancel out it may be that female employment at the individual level is not important on its own but it is a relative position within the couples that matter the states inconsistently theories in particular it may just be that it takes longer times the results I have shown you so far is just a six month follow-up or our Master may be biased by reporting issues and we try to to deal with all of these aspects in the paper and uh to the best the best of our ability and I will now show you some results in that so what I think is it's really driving the results is that we do not find any effects on the on several important mediators we should say so we don't find any effects on on women's attitudes with gender equality we don't find that women become more empowered if they get a job we don't find that acceptance of abuse it's affected in a in a large way and we don't find an effect on controlling Behavior so if I would have to invest my money on why there isn't any effect on um it would be because these jobs do not seem to affect women so that they so that they become more empowered so we learned a lot at heterogeneity and in particular we interact the treatment with all the Baseline characteristics and we do not find any heterogeneous effect based on any other based on control variables so if we interact with whether women have been working before or not whether whether the restitutes whether they have been beaten before whether their age education religions only we don't find anything at all but there seems to be some heterogeneous effects with respect to empowerment and Baseline whereby treatment causes abuse increase for women that were less empowered at the basement but of course we are testing many things and some things should turn out significant this is very plausible but uh but it should be interpreted as a character so when we look at relative resources then we find that status inconsistencies do not seem to trigger abuse at all in our setting and in particular job offers are not correlated with abuse for women with partners that are not working so it's not the case that if she becomes the main Breadwinner that then violence starts to increase you see no indication of that and in general relative incomes within the houses do not seem to matter much for abuse at all once we use the random assignment or jobs to control if you just take the the control group and look at the relative incomes for the control group the one would think that the relative incomes matter a lot but it seems to be mostly driven by by selection so it's not the relative income itself it's basically something something that drives both the relative income and so if we look at the longer term effects uh we'll more or less find the same thing so if we look at the effects after a year one and a half years there are still in the first stage on unemployment and earnings we were quite worried about that but it still seems to be a substantial effects on on the material resources of being randomly assigned to a job but there's still no effects on abuse and effects on emotional violence are not stable because we find them again after one and a half years but there's no no effect after one year so it's difficult to know how to interpret them we are no longer in the long run heterogeneity with respect to empowerment we no longer find that interesting finding after one year and one and a half years of those that were initially a baseline differentially empowered had different effects of effects and then of course our reporting issues so whenever you measure self-report reviews it's a function of two things right so it's a function of whether you have been abused and whether you want to report the abuse and we were very worried that that getting employed or being reminiscentered job may affect both of those things right and they are very difficult to separately identify so it could affect whether you want to report abuse or not and there are many different theories for that it could be that people want to report it more because they have networks and talk about such issues more so it could be that that um people uh people want to report more violence if they're Randomness on the job but it could also be that it's less we don't know so we don't think that there's at least any kind of experimental demand effects going on because neither enumerators nor the respondents had any reason to believe that the main interest was in Industry investigating intimate partial Islands and we frame the survey as one to study the lives of women seeking work in the industrial sector in Ethiopia and the survey is also long it takes between one and one half hours to complete paint use and only a small subset of the questions are about the internet partner violence but most importantly do we conduct list experiments and while these may show some signs around the reporting it doesn't seem to be that much so they're not statistically significantly higher reporting if you use the list for instance uh but more importantly we don't find that on the reporting is related to whether you're randomly assigned to a job or not and not whether it's not related to whether women are working or not so to conclude does employment affect internet partner violence well if you look at Theory and periods empirics they point in different directions um and we are the first to use randomization of jobs such as the causal effects on violence so now the results suggests that we can reject relatively small effects on our main outcome but there may be important short ground had to be made and of course as the margin we study the effects on this one where everyone is applying for a job it could be the case there is a decision to apply that causes violence and not the actual work itself it could also be the case that the contextual level employment is more important than the individual level employment and indeed if you go back to the theories about domestic violence in particular the bargaining theories they of course argue that that outside option it's sort of thriving we're driving the reduction in in the part of Ireland so it shouldn't matter whether you work yourself or if you can work whether you you use your exit option and give the families but in any case even it goes the things are true our results speak against all theories that focus on the individual level or the couple level resources it's very interesting and they are of course very complex dependent whether you would find this if you were to randomly assign jobs in the US so normally it's uh it's totally an open question so thank you and my home page you can find the paper the pre-plan and also the data and there's much more in the paper of course thank you for listening
