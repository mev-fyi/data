good afternoon uh rather so good morning to everybody thank you for the opportunity to present our work particularly to the organizers and also to the gates foundation our topic is looking at cape verde mozambique's development successes but when you try to understand what success is that's where the difficulty comes in hopefully we'll have one or two good insights which will convince you that we've we're on the right track identifying what constitutes success for these two countries outline of my presentation we're looking first at motivation giving you interpretive framework and then looking at empirical analysis the results and the intuition that's my focus before drawing some conclusions i'm sorry should we go back home great job oh here we go home there we go sub-saharan africa we know and some africa has been doing relatively well until the crisis but we also know that the development hasn't been sufficient to ensure uh progress for example on the millennium development goals problem is knowing what to do what are the right policies what are the right institutions and also how to implement the reforms on the institutional front and the policy front which will then allow you to achieve better progress in terms of economic development uh so getting consensual constituency for reform is not easy and we know sometimes that this is perhaps easier on the regional level where the affinity is either on geographical basis and we would argue also on historical grounds so the into regional integration has a lot to do with perhaps finding the constituencies for policy and institutional reform this doesn't often happen and perhaps the best known example is the eu we know that the unique countries try to resolve common problems and the way to do this is to come up with a cooperative framework which allows you to produce what we call mutual knowledge about policies institutions monitoring at this level so this peer pressure and peer comparison which will then allow you to implement the reforms and the policies you you decide upon however outside the oecd this approach is rather so knowledge is not an easy task but within the portuguese community there's a recognition that this is part and parcel of development effort cplp is the community of portuguese speaking countries you have them there in the background this is a relatively recent group but in its 2006 bissau declaration they emphasized the need for mutual knowledge and here we have uh history or cultural affinities as you well complementing geographical affinity in order to come up with a mutual knowledge necessary to implement policy and institutional reform taking this one step further within africa the five portuguese-speaking african countries a group known as palop they've also come together because they recognize they've got common problems which they want to tackle and here obviously it's not the geography as you can see they're very diverse so in this sense there is a recognition that they have something in common which allows them to work together to also promote development within africa why did we focus mozambique well there's a widespread recognition that both countries are trying to overcome adverse conditions and they doing something which appears to be going well in terms of geography okay states with little natural resources and a very adverse climate mozambique has history of bad history in terms of he's trying to overcome or rather trying to overcome the consequences of a civil war which is very protected at the height of the cold war and yet both countries have have increasingly adopted policies and promoted institutions which are actively contributing to what we're going to see a little later in terms of development just a few graphs to give you an idea here we have cape verde compared to a regional grouping the west african development community ecowas we're looking at per capita income 99 1990 international dollars and here we have the regional average and the cape verde average and as you can see cape verde is performing in the more recent period as outperforming its region uh to a lesser extent but also true we see mozambique on the path which is putting it beyond its regional and even if you compare rhetorical based grouping when you look at pelop the pelop group is more volatile but it performs and compares favorably with in this case the southern sub-saharan african grouping we looked at other comparisons our focus will be on trade diversification and we see in what way this contributes to economic convergence in both countries but we had a concern about looking at macroeconomic policy and financial reputation we looked at the development goals and governance indicators as i said foreign training economic growth our focus we try to adopt a broader approach that's in our paper most of those results and in two annexes which detail the studies the complementary studies which accompany our analysis but for now to expect here also here francisco's presence he had a helen in providing us some data which allowed us to look at the world bank enterprise so idea of what these two countries are doing on this cape verde has more developed financial markets greater macroeconomic stability lower corruption and the state where the rule of law is more grounded bliss and he has a the less less exported orientated firms less technology licensed to foreigners higher taxes in a higher regulatory environment and again have a combination in others less well placed that generally situates and the idea is obviously that you giving more weight and you're giving emphasis and you're pushing for those positive aspects which will allow countries to move forward what's our interp framework thank you no problem so i was now going to tackle our interpretive framework uh how are we thinking about this problem as i mentioned defining success is not easy especially when you're trying to do it to the macro level with limited data and while you're reading that what we're really trying to say is development is really a question of managing two things resources and relationships you do that in a specific context uh globalization for example will allow you to access to perhaps different opportunities in terms of relationships in terms of resources governance the institutions and the policies will determine how effective you are at making use of both resources and relationships and the interaction between both aspects and this kind of topic how globalization and governance interacts to produce convergence is a relatively recent concern especially as globalization is all dominant but in if you think about it the problem is really you've had successive waves of globalization what's changed over time very often is the context which is determined by history and geography one of the recent studies by eigen green leblanc they've looked at the impact that globalization had on democracy and vice versa we looked at that relationship given our backgrounds and our research interests we understood that you can't just look at something as static as democracy whether you vote or don't vote but you had to look at the quality of the institutions which behind that and we found that this relationship was sensitive to regional context and convergence so our model what's in our heads when we pull this problem in that paper we had convergence to the frontier in this case the united states gdp capita we had globalization and we looked at freedoms political freedoms civil here we have the two components political rights civil liberties we also looked at economic freedom uh here's an example of one some of the relationships we had what we're going to do now is have this in our heads and collapse this freedoms into both so we're looking at the relationship between convergence as measured by the gaps to the income frontier the united states and globalization which we take to be a measure of trade diversification that's uh what's in our heads and we're trying to understand this relationship so how do we measure success well we can just look at this relationship and we're going to seek to identify policy and institutional determinants of successful export diversification and convergence for ecowas and sadek firstly the context is important as we'll as i'll explain shortly and then we'll see to what extent the lessons that we can draw from these two regions apply to the respective countries so what's our model we aim to have a medium meaningful characterization of this divergence diversification convergence relationship where we have policy and institutional variables as well as certain control variables economic convergence we measured the income gap the idea is if you close the gap you will approach the united states export diversification we use the number equivalent of exports which is the inverse of the hefendaal index the idea is the more diversified you are the more you will be exporting uh on graphs as well as some of the results is the relationship between income gap on the vertical axis and number equivalent on the horizontal axis if you look at echowas and as you can see there's no clear-cut relationship if you clips this to look at the country means you have the expected relationship between what the theory would traithee would predict is that as development occurs you will have diversification and diversification also helps the convergence the idea is that countries would you can develop when you focus on doing new things doing the existing things in ecowas what we then looked at we use this graph to sort of identify two things which allow us to make comparisons meaningful comparisons the first is a country which is clearly highly diversified in the regional context and also has good convergence so that would be senegal and we also then delineate the area of this to focus on those countries which have high diversification and also high convergence basically it's uh basically from five onwards and below 94 and a half we looked at that quadrant and we also looked at the opposite quadrant the idea here you look at the region try to understand what policy and institutional effects work and then you look at the best performers in both schools and perhaps the worst so you have three measures the low indication high convergence that looking at this furthermore there's a huge data issue when it comes to trying to direct impacts here really the influence of south africa we also looked at other variables i would love to have time to spend here but government deficits are going to be important and here freedom assessments they come from these come from the freedom house and the fraser institute and they are measures usually measures of the quality of the underlying institutions this is the the situation for cape verde the i we don't have a theory and i don't think that anybody has really a theory of how these two freedoms interact but we do know they tend to trend together they tend to be a positive relationship in ecowas uh that's not very clear in sadek the relationship between economic and political freedom is a lot clearer modelling strategy is again you've looking at the full sample plus these two sub samples we start off using um actually ols and two stage least squares so we look at the relationship both directions separately we try obviously to control those typical problems your unobserved heterogeneity simultaneously and we settle on the three stage least squares because that allows us to look at the relationship at the same time both ways so what's our model here it is we have income gap and number equivalent and then we have policy variables some of which you can see there inflation government deficit degree of openness and institutional variables as well as control variables and we try to test to see these are more important in explaining this two-way relationship i'll speed you the details of all the various tables you'll find in our paper just focus on the high regime in ecowas and and the first we noticed is that the relationship in both these subsamples is as expected in other words we have diversification would bring about convergence urgent diversification would work in the other direction looking at the next variables which are other analysis also identify that important notice that the political freedoms for example in sadek increasing political freedoms and increasing economic freedoms will and the other way around there is an interesting difference between samples however predominantly is towards greater diversification whereas in sadek stances towards cases you have freedoms especially economic deficits for example in sadek excessive government deficits prevailing tendency within the region we take this to be a sign of regime credibility the same holds true for ecowas again a picture is worth a thousand words at least that expectation when we look at some of those explanatory variables and we look at the full sample high and low here for example we're looking at convergence it's government deficit and where is where do you see greatest um a convergence precisely when you bring down you have a government deficit which is clearly below 10 percent and that's in the high regime looking at the low regime we don't see any relationship if you now look at inflation again controlling inflation seems to be very important in the high regime to ensure convergence looking at freedoms rather openness first before looking at the freedoms there's no clear-cut relationship for the first low sample low convergence for the full sample the relationship is is also not very clear but when you look at ecowas in terms of openness it seems to be that openness is associated with a degree of open speech lying between 45 to 75 we have similar results for sadek now looking at the freedoms this is our most striking result in terms of not only the fact that we had the two-stage least squares as i'll refer to shortly as being very important but graphically there's a clear difference between being in the low regime and high regime when it comes to the combination of political and economic freedom the same holds true for sadek those two stage least squares results are referred to here we looked at between effects and fixed effects in a certain way we're looking at geography and also country specific historical maybe aspects and economic freedom in state is very important and when you're trying to look at and explain uh income uh convergence you see that it's a combination of economic freedom and political freedom which is very important and the results are very strong if you look at the tables you'll see that the the estimated coefficients are very strong overall when you look at fixed effects economic freedom is very important so this reinforces some of the ins i really had in terms of the importance of the combination of policy and accompanying institutional arrangements so what about cape verde mozambique i mentioned there was a lack of data our modeling strategies understand the region sub samples of the region and now we had dummies for the countries and we used to uh within the average regional average but you also compare with the best performers which we identify in the case of sadek it would be mauritius and in the case of ecowas as we saw it was senegal and we see that the contribution of cape verde is very similar of uh christians to that of senegal diversification both countries are diversifying and the contribution this is in the full sample so we hear we have the dummies which give an assessment of how these two countries are contributing to the region very similar between cape fear and senegal mauritius we don't have we were not able to find the value for diversification but looking at the contribution to income conversions we see that uh they're again very close some graphs which illustrate this here we have cape verde compared to the ecowas average income capital frontier whereas the region is diverging cape verde is converging so there's clearly something specific to this country in addition to regional shocks perhaps which explains this last part that is worth looking at it's clearly more diversified graph as you can see diversif increasing compared to the regional average it's clear cut but if you look from 1919 onwards which is when it was a huge land political stability the trend which had existed of increasing divergence is clearly been changed or and the region in fact is also getting worse but the gap between mozambique and the region is closing here mozambique is actually becoming more specialized than the regional average so for these two countries what you see is that they have to the region which are broadly similar to those countries you would consider to be the best performers within their chosen policy options we sustain that this is due to the combination of policy and institutions which they've adopted we've measured this in a simple macro way but hopefully this is the very first good insight as to what would constitute success and the kinds of things you would have to look into more deeply to assess these two situations so what are conclusions clearly ecowas is becoming more diversified while sadek is becoming less diversified and both mozambique and cape verde are following the regional trend so here the regional comparison is important looking at the high regime and here's some very good results which i think legal freedom drive convergence suggesting effective institutional arrangements there's some commonalities between the high regimes these are this expected two-way relationship convergence entails macroeconomic stability political and economic freedoms are higher in both cases and freedoms affect diversification policy as do government deficits but they're doing different directions and they counteract as i mentioned the prevailing regional stance which to we take to be a sign of credibility uh one final point regarding cape ferd and mozambique our estimated impact for these countries based on their coefficients reinforces some of the some of the intuitions and some of the results that we saw in the graph brief that we presented why is this important also important placed to look for success because more objective way of assessing what kind of policies and what kind of institutions are likely to matter and what kind of interactions are likely to be relevant uh so that's part of obviously our ongoing research agenda one of the projects i have with this business school in south africa is precisely to measure more accurately event based spreadsheet which will is then going to be assessed by international paranormal interdisciplinary panel looking at economic as constitutional aspects and the ideas to be able to come up with indicators governance civil liberties that will allow us then to have not only variables which have more variability for context based how these challenges we also believe that this is a contribution and this is my final comment to greater mutual knowledge not only on a regional basis but as i mentioned there is a strong argument in our we believe for also historical cultural linkages and producing mutual knowledge within a cooperative framework which tells us how to go about doing things better which is really managing resources and people so that you actually get the outcome in terms of development which all countries actively seek thank you very much for your attention
