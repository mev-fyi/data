um thank you for inviting me to discuss this paper it's um let me just start by saying it's it's great to be back here it's been a while there's a lot of familiar faces i think this uh this research paper here i think the capital commitment paper is is a great paper and i think to some extent mark in his presentation was underselling the importance of this research here and i think in some sense the question that we are getting at in this researcher is one of the most important open research questions in finance so let me just apologize up front that if i get a bit carried away here it's because it's great to be here this is great research so i'm just having a great time so let me um elaborate on why i think this is a a good question to study so just to set the stage here as mark discussed what we are studying is the asset allocation problem of an institutional investor so we have a limited partner investing in private equity just just to set the stage i think this is a trend is the difficult problem let me say there are very few papers out there right now that are trying to solve for the optimal commitment policies for limited term limited partners and private equity also i think this is a tremendously important problem and i'm only half joking when i'm suggesting that everybody in this room here immediately give up your other research project and start working on this project is question instead because it's tremendously important it's tremendously understudied and this matters a lot so let me just back up a bit and explain what i mean so first as mark was explaining when the institutional investors and we're talking sovereign wealth funds pension frontier they allocate capital to private equity the way that works is that you make a capital commitment today and then this capital commitment is made to a private equity fund the fund has about a 10-year life and this capital is gradually called and invested and distributed and there is a large component of the liquidity in that process so that's the first part the second part is that this is a tremendous a difficult problem so i think it's difficult for two reasons one is a purely numerical reason so if you think about this from a dynamic programming problem what happens when you start looking at limited private equity investments is that every time the limited partner invests in a new fund it creates at least one new state variable in the limited partners the dynamic programming problem so you need to keep track of at least how much money is allocated to this fund and typically you need to keep track of more than that what that means is that if you invest in 10 funds well then you immediately have 10 different state variables which is intractable moreover the number of state variables change as the number of fund changes as well so just from a tractability perspective this is hard the second reason why i think this is hard is more from an economic perspective what i mean by that is that once you sorry once you get into the details of how private equity is organized there is a lot of different economic effects going on at the same time and i think it's fair to say that we don't really understand which of those are first order and these focus on and which one aren't then me also say that when i say there's very few papers that solve for the lp's optimal portfolio problem what i'm really trying to say here is that i believe there are really only two papers that do this one is the paper we're discussing here the other is the one i've written with them with nicolette geometry and i think sort of the reason why the the the fact that i'm the co-author on the other half of this literature right now is probably why i'm standing up here discussing this paper today but there are only two papers in this literature here so let me say why is this an important problem well when i think it's important for two reasons and i think in some sense marquee was understanding why this is important the first so what we always talk about when we talk about private equity is that the amount of private equity investments in the world are increasing and that's definitely true when this increase is dramatic and it's persistent and that's the fact i think equally important is that the distribution of private equity investments is puzzling to put it at least let me just give you a few pointers if you look at the norwegian oil fund this is the largest pool of institutional capital in the world they have looked at private equity and they have decided that their optimal allocation right now is zero if you look at calpers it's a large pension fund as you know they have around 600 billion dollars they have looked at private equity and they have decided that their optimal allocation is between nine to eleven percent if you look at dartmouth college where i'm currently affiliated we have about an eight billion dollar endowment and the managers of that endowment has decided that the optimal allocation to private equity is 38 so just as casual evidence what we're looking at here is institutional investors that allocate to private equity in a range from nothing to 38 of their portfolio now one reaction to that may be that these investors have different preferences and different beliefs etc etc and these are optimal i'm not convinced that that's that that that's the answer for two reasons one is that the differences i think are simply too large to be explained by optimal behavior the second reason why i think that's not the answer is because this this term here i'm teaching a class in quantitative private equity and one of the one sort of like one of the one of the one of the privileges of that is that i've been had an opportunity to call around so let's call it just sort of advisors and investors in private equity in the world and talk to them about what is the most sophisticated approach they have to managing private equity investments and if so let me be careful about how i work this but let me put it this way to say that if your expectation is that these investors are thinking carefully about the nature of the liabilities and their preferences and modeling the illiquidity and the dynamics of these investments and if you expect that that is the answer that they give you if you answer you ask them how they do this then you would be surprised so let me just leave it at that and dive into how what what this paper does so what as mark was describing representing and solving a numerical like numerically we're solving the portfolio problem of the limited partner this is an asset allocation problem this is pretty standard approach this is a continuous time portfolio problem it's carrier utility we have the investor here is dynamically reallocating investments in liquid stocks and bonds this is perfectly standard we can think of this as the workhorse model in this literature the lp also commits capital so in this case one to one infinite number of private equity funds so how does a private equity fund work in this literature as mark was describing the problem that arises here is that you allocate capital you commit capital to a fund like this up front then a period of time passes only then is the capital that you committed called and invested then another period of time passes and then this is distributed back to the lps now the problem that this creates for the lp is that you may commit a dollar of capital to private equity today but after a time this time has passed and this capital is called then you may regret that you only allocated a dollar and you may have wished that you had eloquent sort of committed two dollars if you're if you have your wealth has increased or or sort of even worse for the lp if your wealth has declined and you're in crisis then this one dollar may at that point be too much and you would regret you had committed that much at that point so there is this lag in the time from the commitment to the actual investment and that creates a friction for the limited partner here now what you can see once you introduce a fund like this into the analysis you're already creating two new state variables for the investor one is the amount of capital in this fund the x and this analysis the second is we need to keep track of whether the fund is in state c or state d so that complicates the dynamic programming problem for the lp so i'm not going to go into the details of all the analysis there's a lot of stuff here so even just in in both in bullet points outline what is going on we're calibrating the model using various private equity data i'll get back to that a little bit later solve the model for investments in one two one infinite number of funds you introduce a secondary market you can only sell at a haircut you cannot buy so this is reasonable as well introduced to macro states to adjust for liquidity cycles i think this is important because there is a notion that investments in illiquid assets are particularly costly when we are in a liquidity crunch so i think that's important we extend this to epstein sin preferences so there's a lot of action going on in this analysis here the way they then proceed with their main analysis is they're basically comparing four different economies they call this the liquidity stack so as mark was explaining we start with the baseline scenario where basically this is the most realistic scenario where you're exposed to these different risks of uncertainties that we were describing and then we are shutting them off one at the time and then we are comparing what is the welfare increase for the limited partners here when they are no longer exposed to these different risks so this is a model with incomplete market so we are making this comparison think of this as a certainty equivalent comparison so we can look at what is the welfare laws for the investor or sort of the welfare gain when we are exposing them to fewer and fewer of those risks so the main findings from marquia was that well if you can invest in more private equity funds then you would like to allocate more capital to private equity the analysis tops out at around 20 of the of the institutional investors capital committed here when they can commit to an infinite number of funds mark was describing this as there is a large cost of commitment quantity this is this effect that you allocate today but your situation may change so you may wish to you had allocated a different amount and if you shut that effect down then that gives a large welfare gain for the investor there's a surprisingly small cost of the commitment timing risk here which is this concern about the the timing of of when the capital capital call happens i think that's surprising and this is some certainly an interesting finding as well so in a nutshell i would say i think this is a great paper i think this is an incredibly important topic i think this is vastly understood now we have two papers in this literature this is great i think the paper contains a large number of different economic effects which i think is good i think the uh results about commitment timing risk and the uh commitment side raise the novel and interesting i'll definitely decide this in my own work i think this is great i think the concerns i have about this analysis may be mostly down to a question of perhaps research taste i think sort of at the same time i think this paper does perhaps a little bit too much and at the same time this paper does perhaps a little bit too little so i'm i know i'm hard to satisfy up here but let me try to explain what i mean by that and sort of give a direction for how i think this analysis could be sharpened even further so to start with the concerns the paper made you a bit too much so as i talked about this is a difficult numerical problem every time you add another private equity fund to this you add a number of state variables what that mean and then the approach to this is pretty much just their brute forcing the whole dynamic programming problem here which means that if you look for the intuition behind the economic effects that are going on those are in the first order conditions and the first order conditions look like this so now i i may be a lazy referee but when i got to this point i started somewhat skimming the analysis to understand what was going on and i think that my excuse for that is also that the authors provide no intuition or explanation for what these terms mean or which of these effects are important so i think when we talk about this as being perhaps a bit too much i think the analysis here is already so complex that the mechanisms behind what is driving these effects become a little bit of a black box this is important because there are the analysis is still stylized and there are some economic features of this analysis here that are perhaps not entirely realistic so let me just highlight two of them for example one thing that's going on here is that part of the analysis the lp can only invest in a single fund that means that if you're an lp and you find yourself underexposed to private equity you need to throw away your current fund before you can invest in a second fund so that means that activity in the secondary market here may be some extent be driven by the fact that investors need to get rid of their current fund before they can invest in a new one so the analogy to public markets was that you could only invest in one stock so if you want to invest in apple you can buy that you want to invest in ibm you have to sell your apple before you can invest in ibm obviously that's not realistic and i would like to understand this economic effect better is the magnitude large is the magnitude small what is driving this then the intuition is there now as a second example of this one of the features of this um this this optimization problem here is that the in the lps can some extent they they the timing of the investments in private equity is stochastic but what one of the things we don't allow the investors to do here is to wait until they allocate to the next fund so when you're investing in two funds you have to invest in the next fund every time the previous one distributes its capital and i suspect that the investors may sometimes benefit from waiting the reason for that is by waiting you can get the uncertainty and the other fund resolved and that will help you better determine the amount you want to allocate to the other fund so there's i think there can be a benefit from waiting now they don't allow for that in the analysis and i'm not convinced that the economic effect of this is large there's a hint in the discussion that suggests that this could be relevant and again it would be great to have a better intuition for this but again the intuition for what is going on is in here somewhere so it would be useful to get a better understanding of the economics that is driving the analysis now the second problem i have that was the second concern the second suggestion is that despite doing a lot the paper may not be doing enough so what do i mean by that well so the figure i have up here is that this is from a recent draft for we're preparing a handbook in economics about private equity and jim jenkins done together with some co-authors wrote a chapter about uh private equity uh where they're sort of outlining uh the the the structure and mechanics of private equity and figure one is this this is describing sort of the typical structure of what private equity is and how it's organized so if you look oh i i have to stay up here so i can point but we have the investors on the right-hand side and there's the one two three these are the lps and the analysis they're investing in funds this is the private equity funds in the analysis it's investment portfolio companies this is what it is now but we also have other investors investing in direct investments and co-investments we have debt providers that are providing capital to the portfolio companies we have credit lines that can go directly into the fund we have other funds so there are other aspects of this problem here that are still not captured in the analysis that we are we are seeing here so if i have sort of a laundry list of different economic effects that i think are relevant for understanding private equity the laundry list would look like something like this so we have the lp's investment decision it committed irregular times we're sort of capturing that here with these personal arrivals although we're not giving the lp's perfect choice over that they can commit to an arbitrary number of funds well one two or infinity that seems reasonably arbitrary but perhaps not entirely something that's important when you talk to practitioner is this notion of access to funds and selecting funds that they want to invest in we're not discussing that here at all i think in some sense that's perfectly understandable because we have no idea how to analyze this but it still suggests that there are first order effects of this problem here that we just don't have in the analysis and we don't know how to handle and we can sort of keep going down through the different economic features here and many of those are captured in this analysis but some of them are not now i think i wanna i wanna highlight this because they spent some time on this fact that this is a realistic calibration of the model and i think this is perhaps the part of this paper that i'm least happy about so from one perspective i just think that these models here are not ready to be taken to the data i think calibrating these models open an entire new can of worms in some sense it's a little bit of a distraction from understanding the economic effects going on so i think this is we don't we're not really at the point where we can actually take these models to the data and expect to get reasonable estimates out of it that said i think there is also and i don't want i don't know how much this is i think there's also something interesting going on in the way they do the calibration i don't want to get into details but i can just point out that the pme calibration that mark was talking about as i understand it the way they're approaching this is using a single moment condition to nail down four different parameters of this problem and while this moment condition is non-linear i think this is still what could be described as somewhat of a heroic calibration exercise and i'm a little surprised that you're going down that route because i think there are much more immediate ways of doing that calibration but again i think in this in general i think that the calibration here is perhaps a little bit of a distraction in general and my preference would be to focus on the more economic effects all right i have just two more slides so let me let me uh wrap up here i think the the fact that you're pushing this as a um as a sort of a more of a realistic analysis also puts us in a slightly so like so like this this this spot here where you come up with this con recommendation that the maximum investments that lps can have to private equity is 20 so that's what's come out of the model so i don't know what to relate that number to but i know that dartmouth have an allocation this is from the dartmouth investment office describing the current allocation of the dartmouth endowment and just looking down at the rows here we can see that the allocation to global equity right now has a target of 25 percent their location to private equity and venture capital is at 38 so just as a first order check the numbers here seems to be somewhat out of the range that you suggest and it's hard for me to reconcile that does that mean darkness is off does that mean you're not analysis is missing stuff so i'm not quite sure these numbers here are ready to be taken to the data but to end on a positive note i think that the table here that shows the current location for the dartmouth endowment also underscores the economic importance of this problem so if you look at the numbers here what we are allocating to illiquid assets venture capital and private equity is one and a half times as much as we are allocating to global equity this is a large part of the portfolio this is dominating the portfolios and if you look at the right hand column here these are 10-year annualized returns so this is annualized returns in percentage points what dartmouth has earned on its private equity location is 23.3 which is about 10 percentage point more than what they earn on traded equities so this is 10 percentage points accumulating over a 10-year period this is a lot we're not talking basis points here we're talking orders of magnitude so this is an important problem to understand all right so let me wrap this up so my conclusion is i think this is a great paper i think this is an important problem there can only be a i think we can only have it would only be good with more research in this area i think this literature is also at the point where we're still trying to understand what are the relevant first order effects i think this paper takes a solid step at the commitment risk and the commitment timing issues i think this is a great insight and i certainly learned something from that i if i had a wish here and this may be more in terms of taste i would like to see more intuition and a more transparent analysis i understand these problems become complicated but it becomes difficult to understand what is going on if you do want to run with the calibration i would suggest that you tie that more directly perhaps to some of the um some of the some of the data but we can talk about that and but but that being said i'm perhaps less excited about the realistic calibration part of this i think the literature is just not ready for that yeah thank you
