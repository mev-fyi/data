my presentation will also lead off from gordon's earlier this morning but we want to try and take the next sort of logical step to ask about u.s exports and employment and to what extent do these offset the job losses due to imports but let me start with some familiar diagrams here's employment and manufacturing in the u.s and a couple of other countries and we start to see this substantial decline beginning around the 1990s surely technology is a big part of that story and these two decades from the 1990s to 2007 or 2011 will frame uh the studies i talk about here here then is uh what happened to the share of world merchandise exports and we can see the big rise in china accelerating after its accession to the wto in 2001 and here then is the very familiar diagram figure one from auteur doran and hanson uh we have the decline in manufacturing employment as a share of the working age population uh compared with the rise in chinese imports as a share of u.s domestic consumption and we can see chinese imports rising there's sort of an inflection point in 2001 just where these uh curves have out where these lines have happened across from 2001 to 2007 chinese imports into the u.s in fact doubled over that period there was a more substantial decline in manufacturing employment it's not really obvious from this diagram but pearson shot they start off their aer paper observing that manufacturing employment was about 18 million workers fell by 18 from 2001 to 2007 so that's somewhere in excess of 3 million workers over that narrow 2001 to 2007 time frame and so then we have the the question are these related uh adh um sort of the one a key motivation of their paper is to say well you can't really trust this time series right this this time series apparent time series correlation could be due to a lot of things i already mentioned technological progress reducing employment and manufacturing and of course that arguably did account for a big part of the surge in china too so if we really want to isolate the impact of chinese imports per se on employment in the u.s we want to go to that commuting zone level that they do we want to look at chinese imports across different industries and then we want to look at the share of employment in different commuting zones accounted for by those industries look at those historic shares those are the bartek weights and then we construct a kind of a weighted average measure of import penetration from china and when adh do that in a regression framework i'll show you a regression in a minute they get these kind of results not much impact in the 70s or the 80s we start to see a substantial impact this is the effect of a 1 000 per worker increase in imports from china on the change in manufacturing employment this is as a share of the working age population substantial impact in both the 1990s and in this 2000 to 2007 period but of course it's really in the latter period 2000 to 2007 that these imports from china are growing so much so in the latter period if you multiply this regression coefficient by the observed increase in chinese imports you get job losses of about 2 million workers and that is very substantial right because the drop in manufacturing employment over this narrow period 2001 and 2007 was somewhat over 3 million so this 2 million drop is a lot and it's not just in a loss of jobs in manufacturing you also have a shift of workers to not in the labor force so you do have a rise in unemployment but also you have a substantial increase in workers who give up looking for a job and finally you do have some wage effects surprisingly uh somewhat bigger wage effects outside of manufacturing in services uh these in here in this chart i also show you some regression coefficients on the impact of wages remember this is primarily outside of manufacturing in in services and partly for that reason as it turns out that the biggest impact here is on females without college education and i'll say a little bit more about services in a minute okay so with that introduction we then ask what about exports right now now auteur dorn and hanson they did bring us exports in to a limited degree because they looked not only at u.s imports from china they also looked at u.s net imports from china so imports minus exports and they didn't actually get much action from comparing one with the other from making that change so my focus is really going to be on u.s global exports there's two papers i list here where we've looked at that first one uses a regression framework that i'll show you very similar to autor door and hanson second paper uses a global input output analysis and then thirdly i want to come back to the question what about other sources of consumer gains in the united states due to lower prices from china aside from employment gains per se so here's what happened to u.s global exports in real term over the 1990s and 2000s they doubled they doubled whether you look at 1991 and 2007 or let's skip over the global financial crisis and take it to 2011. i was recalling didn't the obama administration have a goal of doubling u.s exports well they did double i don't know exactly what their time frame was right but but they have doubled um and uh and then we also heard chinese imports doubled over quite a short time frame 2000 2007 but we sort of got a doubling in both here uh you can already hear from the words i'm using i'm okay with comparing u.s global exports with imports from china even though that's kind of an asymmetric comparison i've been pressed to do a little bit more by referees and so on and uh so i have you look at u.s imports from other sources it just doesn't change the picture that much right it's us imports from china that's important that china shock the the the scale the magnitude the speed of that really makes a difference in the data so i'll stick with that here uh for this talk and then on the export side i mentioned and gordon mentioned earlier it's hard to get much impact from u.s exports to china alone adh didn't find it made much difference and part of the reason is was gordon said some of those are in services or services embodied in intellectual property and so on uh so i mean i have done some work in these papers uh uh on on exports different countries but for the most part i will look here for my talk today i'll be comparing u.s global exports with imports from china so here's what you get across commuting zones if we just look at the picture for a minute it is the case so the top one shows import penetration into different commuting zones constructed in the way that i referred to just a moment ago and the bottom diagram shows export expansion or export promotion uh these are exports and this again is a weighted average using your historic shares of production in industries and then we use those to weight the u.s export growth uh and there's you know visually seems like a strong correlation but of course really the reason the reason for this in this diagram is i'm only looking at manufacturing imports and exports so the lighter shaded commuting zones in either diagrams are those that don't have much manufacturing so that's really what's dominating in both these diagrams but still but still it is encouraging that lots of commuting zones that apparently experienced big import penetration from china also had the potential for export expansion via their their manufacturing base and in fact did achieve some export expansion is what i'm showing in the blue here so let's look at this in a regression framework here's a sample regression in the first line here so this is a long difference of employment over 91 to 2007 or 91 to 2011. uh it's actually a panel we do 91 to 99 that long difference and then 99 to the final year we we stack those two uh there's the regression coefficients on import penetration from china in the first row they're negative and substantial they're actually a bit a bit larger when you're also including the export expansion term here which i'm doing these are positive uh and they're they're more positive they're larger in magnitude in in the longer period 91 to 2011 when you include those years and then the other thing we can see from these diagrams it is absolutely essential to include the lagged historic share of manufacturing employment as a control variable if you don't include that control you really get very small export effects here but it ought to be in here and that's what we just saw in the diagrams we looked at and there's other controls in included here as well so if we take these regression coefficients and we take the changes in import penetration export expansion added up what do we get so the uh the red the the red bars here in the bottom of this diagram are the employment declines due to import penetration so if we take that middle bar 1999 to 2007 i i get a loss in jobs in manufacturing of 2.58 million that's a little bit bigger than than the 2 million estimate from auteur doran and hanson but but pretty close if we extend that however to 2011 we get 3.2 so that's growing uh if you focusing again on 99 through 2011 that final bar if you compare the red with the blue the blue or the employment gains due to u.s global exports you get a difference of about 1.3 million so that's the net impact on jobs net negative impact on jobs due to the combined surge in imports from china and u.s global exports so that's still pretty substantial over that later period starting in 1999 or you could start in 2000 or 2001 wouldn't matter but in that decade of the 2000s here you do get this unbalanced effect if you're willing to include the earlier decade so if we include the 1991 through 1999 decade right that's where you had 2 million job growth in exports and only a 1 million job loss due to imports so if you include that in then the net effect over both decades net effective trade is a is a moderate net loss of 200 to 300 000 jobs in manufacturing that is not that big that's about one-tenth of the job loss from 2000 to 2007 alone right you know so then you get a quite moderate effect so this is kind of a textbook result if you like and we were happy to confirm that and find it that this u.s export growth does offset job losses due to imports if you look at the particular industry so here's the first period 1991 through 1999 these industries that declined are kind of traditional industries miscellaneous furniture leather stone and glass apparel and so on right not what we think of hi as high tech or even perhaps the most dynamic industries however if we look at the the second period oh my gosh we got electronics machinery transportation uh and so on computers are definitely in there within electronics i mean now the industries that experience this job loss are really are high technology and very dynamic industries so the nature of the shift between these two decades is very very different it also turns out if you look really carefully at the these job losses and job gains by commuting zone by decade there's also a difference it's really impossible to tell from looking at these diagrams but if you do the correlation coefficient in the first decade 1991 through 1999 correlation coefficient between the job gain and job loss and these are both expressed as a percent of the local population so we are controlling to some degree for size to some degree right that correlation coefficient in the first decade is 0.5 not bad in the second decade 1991 through 2011 it drops to 0.2 insignificant probably right 0.2 so there really was something different not only in the industries that we saw but also in the way this is spread across commuting zones between the job gains and job losses so if i could just summarize this first paper and then i'll go on to some others uh if we look at the full two decades the 1990s and the 2000s we got about a 0.3 million net job loss due to trade so that's uh that's modest that's close to our textbook result that job gains due to exports how to offset job losses due to imports however if you just look at the 2000s post wto recession by china then you do get a larger loss about 1.3 million and it's in that second period indeed when some key industries in the united states electronics machinery transport are most impacted and we also have a decline in this correlation of job losses and job gains by commuting zones okay so in the second paper i want to talk about we use a different methodology we use a a global input output analysis probably many people here are familiar with this but i'll just show this this in a brief picture uh in the upper left cell here we'd have country a selling to country a those are goods from its industries going to other industries and some of those goods from industries also go to final demand that's another uh sell there in the top row but we don't stop there we also have country a selling to country b country a selling to china is country c and so on so this is the the global input output analysis that most people here will be familiar with so that's what we make use of that's what we make use of uh in comparison with the regression analysis of auteur dorne hansen well this is a little easier you can sort of plug it through the input output table and you and you sort of know you're going to get substantial effects uh what do we find we confirm 2 million job gains within manufacturing due to the growth in u.s global exports and about 2 million in job losses due to imports from china so they pretty much balance but now we can really take account of services right because services are in the input output table we don't have the difficulty of measuring them using bartek weights and and so on we can just plug it through and indeed we find a further four million job gain in services due to u.s global exports about one-third of that comes from u.s exports in manufacturing and those upstream linkages to service and about two-thirds comes from u.s exports in services and then directly impacting employment and services so it's four million job gains in the service sector due to the growth of u.s global exports and services and manufacturing so that is really big and there's only a very small and inconsequential job losses due to service imports so whereas manufacturing kind of balances out in fact you have a huge gain in services i'd say you've got four million more jobs created by u.s exports and services through this input output analysis i can show a few of these numbers more carefully fact let me just jump to this this this this bottom one here here on the the first column here in manufacturing i got that 1.99 or 2 million job loss and uh in resources i also get a half a million uh excuse me 1.99 million job gain due to exports in resources i also have a half a million job gain and they're in services i have the further 4 million job gains for 6.5 million in total balance that against the 2 million job loss on the import side which is predominantly in manufacturing a little bit in in other sectors so again uh that two million job loss is is pretty similar to what adh find it's it it's fairly close to what i found in that earlier paper but now we have this big big gain on the export side okay so if we now broaden our canvas and say well what about other gains aside from job gains and exports what do we find for consumer gains so i show one paper here with uh mary amity and midai and john romales uh and here we look at china's boost in exports and we argue first actually we we don't think that this was only due to wto recession right this was the uh the key variable introduced by pierce and shot the reduction in uncertainty as china joined the wto reduction in uncertainty in the united states so it didn't have to receive an annual vote in congress to receive normal trade relations we find sort of in in contrast that we think a big part of china's growth was due to its own reduction on tariffs on its own intermediate imports and then a productivity boost to its own industries in fact we think that's just as important as the reduction in uncertainty due to wto entry in any case if you put the two of these together and you say what what was the sort of the net impact on the united states now we're we're focused we are focusing here on merchandise trade right exclusively merchandise trade especially manufacturing trade but if you you take our gains and you compare it to the entire u.s economy okay then you get a reduction in a u.s price index of one percentage point total from 2000 to 2007 that's not per year that's total so that's a one percent gains from trade if you like a little bit smaller than some of the estimates that steve referred to of two to eight percent that you'd get for the u.s i mean fully in agreement with those but remember we're only looking at one small piece of trade over a narrow period 2000 to 2007. so we find that that reduction in prices in the united states is in part to the declines in china in the chinese export prices by their own firms but that also had a pro-competitive effect in reducing prices of other firms u.s firms or other countries in the united states and that finding is all supported also supported by other recent research studies so let's take this one little piece think about this as sort of an empirical paper if you like we're just trying to track those chinese goods as they come into the u.s what are all the price effects and now we put that into a a much more sophisticated computable general equilibrium analysis though here's the work by caliendo devorcan and pero that gordon also referred to forthcoming in econometrica so this is a computable general equilibrium they've got 50 states 22 sectors so as far as they're concerned they have 1100 labor markets right is the way they think about it and then they have a very sophisticated model of worker choice over these 1100 labor markets workers face costs when moving between markets those could be real costs due to lost wages but they can certainly be psychic costs right it's just hard to move it's hard to leave your industry it's hard to leave your town but these psychic costs can't be just anything they're constrained by the data right they're disciplined by the actual mobility that we see so it's essentially a discrete choice model of workers across all these regions disciplined by the the degree of mobility that we see across labor markets and in regions so they find in their study uh in in the early version 0.8 million manufacturing job losses due to the doubling of chinese imports they model that as a product pure productivity increase actually not is due to wto recession just a pure productivity increase a little bit consistent with my work with marion media and john romales that i just mentioned uh in in the more recent version that point eight million manufacturing job loss is is actually shaved down to 0.55 million so i can't really explain just standing here why this isn't two million why why don't they don't get an adh kind of number but bear in mind that it's a very very different model now because they have this sophisticated model of worker choice between regions they have costs of unemployment some of these workers can choose to be not in the labor force right they can try and you know match that moment and generally workers are unemployed for a period of time before they find something else if they find something else so they do get positive gains from trade their gains are 0.6 6 tenths of one percent of gdp but that's already shaved down by one quarter due to these transitional costs of unemployment so that knocks a quarter off your gains from trade without that gains would have been closer to one percent of gdp and indeed they're very dispersed across regions uh and across industries so here's the sectoral contribution to changes think reductions in manufacturing unemployment furniture manufacturing computers and electrical goods metals textiles to a lesser degree so an interesting mix of both the high-tech and the low-tech industries they've included and here's uh the regional contribution to the drop in manufacturing employment and california is the biggest due to the import competition in computers and electronics followed by texas and then some of those other high bars are more states in the heartland so this is this diagram is very influenced by the size of the state and then my final diagram let's let's look at welfare changes across labor markets right so these are states uh that they're looking at here um and it's a very heterogeneous response here i'm only looking at the positive welfare changes i'm sorry this this this this curve was cut off there is a very thin and long tail of negative changes but it's in very few regions it's in very few regions right so there is a thin tail of negative regions but in most places they get these positive long run effects of this china shock so if i could just uh try and give an overall summary uh we know from the work of adh and and other works by those authors and others that the the china shock had this effect on decreasing jobs in manufacturing around 2 million if you look just at the 2000s it's going to be somewhat bigger than that if you also include the 1990s i'm arguing you get more or less comparable numbers and offsetting numbers offsetting numbers if you also look at exports manufacturing exports if you include service exports then you got this pure four million dollar job gain that came from the input output analysis i neglected to mention i was actually surprised that this input up analysis gave such similar results to a regression analysis because the input output analysis is really a shift in labor demand right you don't have full equilibrium imposed it's a shift in labor demand you would have thought with upward sloping supply curves that the equilibrium changes in labor demand would be less than the shift in labor demand but that's not what we find empirically we find that the results in from the input output analysis the pure shift in labor down is pretty similar to what you just get from the data as adh do from a regression analysis if you only look at the recent period then in fact exports u.s exports do not offset the job losses but if you're really willing to take kind of a long run analysis as the last paper i mentioned you do get gains in most regions and i was reflecting on that a little bit right uh the final paper i mentioned is substantially a a competitive model there's elements of monopolistic competition but substantially competitive model and by its nature that's going to tend to give long-run gains in many regions so do we think this is sort of built into the model well maybe but maybe this is a very realistic description of where the u.s economy is today we got unemployment less than four percent uh we're at the uh you know at the end of a long export boom as far as i can tell it started earlier but continuing to this day stock market is booming uh maybe more than any other time in the last decade or more uh workers are more and regions are more aware of these export opportunities and partly because they've been chipped away by some foreign tariffs recently right farmers are very aware of their reliance on exports and many many other industries so i think uh i think the question we all ask is you know in a month from now when we come to the midterm elections are we going to see a different pattern of voting behavior or a reinforcement of where we are right will the current administration get credit for for this boom which i think started earlier but continues to be a boom on the export side thank you
