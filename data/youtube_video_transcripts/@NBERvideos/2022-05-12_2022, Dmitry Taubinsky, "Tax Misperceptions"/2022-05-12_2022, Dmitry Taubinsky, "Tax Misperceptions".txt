okay so um let's pick up where we left off yesterday so there's one more lecture that i think goes into the fundamentals bracket which is a set of basic questions around what people understand about taxes how they perceive them the extent to which they pay attention to them and then of course after this lecture we'll have our wonderful external speakers talking about various applications so relative to yesterday where we were primarily focused on situations in which people were making mistakes in the absence of any intervention and then we were trying to put in interventions to try to counteract those mistakes at least somewhat the focus of today is actually on how standard uh relatively standard tax tools might cause people to make mistakes because they are not um correctly perceived or because they are not fully attended to so um what we want to relax here is the core assumption and public finance that all that really matters are the tax incentives that are in place not how they are framed um described and implemented and this really is a core assumption for example it underlies a lot of modern optimal tax theory where we think about mechanism design approaches to design um to thinking about optimal policy and of course to do mechanism design you are essentially making a kind of implementation and variance assumption because you're saying i'm just going to think about the incentives and only later on will i worry about implementation of these optimal mechanisms with familiar looking tax systems but of course there's a lot of recent empirical work that challenges this assumption people might be inattentive confused employ various heuristics to optimize with a complex tax schedule in place and so forth um there's a very clean and simple illustration of this idea that comes from a real effort lab experiment by avalor and yeager where people are generally are putting in real effort that generates some payouts and there's some kind of experimental tax scheme that's also in place and what they're able to do is holding incentives constant consider one tax schedule that is described by 22 tax rules and then another tax schedule that has the same incentives but is described by one transparent tax rule okay and what they find is that subjects are um um people are less responsive to incentives in the complex tax condition um visibility of the tax matters um so for um there's a um common finding i'm replicating in a variety of different settings now that people are not attentive to fully attentive to sales taxes right so sales taxes are charged at the register you're not really looking at them when you're going in to purchase a product um and so you might suspect that because they are not as in your face as opposed to christ people might not react to them as much as they did to poster prices um and this has been um confirmed in a number of different settings people are more responsive to taxes that affect the poster price directly like excise taxes than they are to these less conspicuous sales taxes um that are just added on at the register um similar findings for road tools where you know if you're just using easy pass and it's just kind of charged automatically you're not going to be as responsive and similar findings for income tax rules um there's also limited knowledge many taxpayers don't know their marginal tax rate um and of course it's not even that easy to figure it out given all of the different tax rules in place so in some sense it's not um that surprising um and similarly taxpayers can differ a lot in their knowledge or awareness of the eitc and the benefits that it generates um so one form of this confusion which is getting more into heuristics is this very nice study by feldman at all that shows that when people lose the child tax credit so that their average um tax rate goes up but not their marginal what actually happens is that people reduce their reported wage income and what that suggests is a confusion between average and marginal tax rates or some kind of broader confusion about how the tax system works and what people should be inferring when they see their average tax rate um going up okay um so that's just a very quick overview of the kinds of issues we're thinking about um i want to now zoom in and just take a little bit deeper so i want to think about first measurement and welfare implications of tax aliens and then two measurement and implications of income tax misperceptions any comments or questions before i did again okay so let's start with the chatty looney and craft um 2009 paper um so um here's the empirical framework so let's consider an economy with two goods um x and y um with the price of y normalized to one and p the pre-tax price of x um so y is untaxed then x is subject to a sales tax tau that's not included in the posted price so that means that the tax-inclusive price of x is going to be q equals 1 plus tau times p and x of p comma tau is going to denote the demand for good x as a function of the posted price and the sales tax that's in place now of course if agents optimize fully demand should only depend on the total tax inclusive price so it shouldn't matter if we are in a situation in which the posted price is p in the sales tax is tau or we are in a situation where the post and price is one plus tau times p and there's no sales tax in place it shouldn't matter how you partition um the total price that consumers actually face and so what full optimization implies then is that the price elasticity should equal the gross of tax elasticity which is just another way of saying it doesn't matter how you increase the total tax inclusive price if you're a fully optimizing consumer it shouldn't matter if you do it through the posted price component or through the tax component so this is great because this is a very testable looking hypothesis okay um and we can test that by doing our standard thing um to measure elasticity we elasticities we log linearize and we regress log um demand online price okay except here we're really going to take apart again the total um tax inclusive price and think about log price and log gross of tax and the key question is whether sigma equals 1 which is the full optimization assumption or whether it is less than 1 meaning that people are less sensitive to variation in the sales tax than they are to variation in the price so sigma here is going to be a measure of the extent to which people are attentive to the sales tax now there are two strategies for estimating sigma and these should be very familiar um given everything we discussed um last time so one strategy um is to basically manipulate tax aliens by making the sales taxes visible as the posted price okay and i'll um go over this experimental strategy shortly but just basically imagine an experiment that just makes poster prices tax inclusive so you run this experiment and what you are going to measure then is the impact on demand but recall what we were talking about last time so when we're looking at the impact on demand that's the horizontal difference between kind of the um the observed demand curve and the one that would result if people were fully optimizing generally we're interested in the vertical difference and sigma is something that actually characterizes the vertical difference because the vertical difference in fact equals one minus sigma times the absolute value of the tax um and so how do we go from horizontal differences to vertical differences well hunt taught us yesterday that for that you just need the elasticity of demand right because that tells you the slope and now we use geometry intuitively think about it this way let's say that the sales tax is ten percent and this experimental strategy um increases demand or sorry decreases demand by five percent what that tells you then is that sigma is one half because it is telling that the effect of making taxes salient makes people perceive the total tax inclusive price to be five percent higher meaning that people are previously missing five percentage points of those ten percentage points if the impact of this intervention on demand is let's say two and a half percent um that tells us that sigma is three quarters and so forth okay so that's strategy one um strategy two is just to compare is literally to run this regression for this you need exogenous variation in both prices and taxes and to look at these um coefficients oops okay so here's strategy one um so they manipulated axe aliens um by generating new tax at a supermarket and this is a gross this is a major grocery chain where 30 of the products are subject to sales tax and this was in a city with approximately seven and a half percent scale it's taxing the data they have a scanner data on price and weekly quantity sold by product okay so this is what it looks like um above you can see the original tag this is what you normally see when you walk into a store and below is the experimental tag that says okay it's actually this plus the sales tax which gives you this total tax inclusive price so it serves as a reminder it serves as something that simplifies calculations so what's the experimental strategy well it's actually a triple different strategy because um within a store some of the products subject to the tax are treated um and others are not okay and the treatment variation is actually at the eye level so for example deodorants get the external tags um but um toothpaste which is in the same aisle does not get an experimental tag um so that's one difference okay you can also think about variation across stores so treatment occurred in only one store but there are two nearby stores with similar demographic characteristics that did not receive any experimental tags and then finally we can think about differences over time the treatment period was up for a specific three weeks um and we can consider what happened in other dates at which there was never any treated tags at all so this is what it looks like um here's the difference in difference estimate of the external tags that reduce demand by about um two units um so this is just going over time and across products okay um now um to really test um all of the parallel trends assumptions underlying the difference of difference you can consider a placebo test where you have the other two stores that never received um the external tags and you can perform the same difference in difference estimation there okay comparing differences in treated versus untreated on products over time um and here this is a this is very comforting i mean the placebo stores the difference difference estimate um is zero and then to um be fully rigorous about comparing the treated source to the placebo stores here we can just take the difference between these double differences to get a triple difference estimate of a reduction of about 2.2 units so that's the horizontal difference um now to really complete things um we need to get um a price elasticity of demand for which they just use some natural price variation um across these different stores and then combining this impact on quantity purchased with the price elasticity of demand gives a sigma of about one-third meaning that people react to these inconspicuous taxes as if they are one third as large as they actually are now what are some concerns about this experimental strategy here yes i think in some cases [Music] you mean to go from this quantity effect to an estimate of sigma we have to be careful about how we estimate the price elasticity yes good okay um but even before doing the translation that's a great point before even doing the translation what might be some other problems here well one thing you might worry about is something like demand effects people are not used to these new tags so they might become actually overly sensitized so it's a big assumption um to say that with these um tax people are going to be i'm fully optimizing you might worry a little bit about leverage of bias because there are a lot of prices that end in something like 590 or 599 so one thing the tag does is it takes you from something that starts at five dollars for example to something that then starts at six dollars which looks like a particularly large difference you know a 20 cent change that takes you from 590 to 610 does feel larger to many people than a 20 cent change that takes you from 570 to 590. okay so so that's why it's all it's when possible i'm trying to do something multiple ways um and this is one of the great things about this paper they have a second strategy for thinking about tax aliens um and what they do here is they look at alcohol which is subject to both sales taxes and excise taxes now excise taxes are directly um going to be affecting the prices that are posted and so we have these two sources of variation as long as there's variation both sales taxes and excise taxes and to get this variation they exploit state level changes um so here's a bin scatter of how of changes in law of demand on changes in log of one plus b are excise rate um there's a clear response people are clearly um elastic to changes in excise taxes and here's what it looks like when we do an analogous thing with changes in sales taxes it's pretty flat so it's much smaller elasticity um we can formalize this in a depression framework you know largely speaking across different specifications of different types of controls what we see is a very significant response to changes in excise tax rates and the very muted response that is statistically indistinguishable from zero for sales tax rates um so across two strategies what we see is that on average people under react to the sales taxes questions here comments okay so now let's think a little bit deeper so these are results about average under react oh don can you just have one point about that paper i think is important is for the grocery store experiment uh they actually have a survey uh as people were exiting the store where they asked them about what they thought the sales tax was and the interesting thing in this paper is that they get it right so people seem to know what the sales tax is and for me that's always kind of made a creative question mark about what the mechanism is here because you know dimitri described another version of this whereas this is something new and you know they're reacting strangely well maybe that's what's going on or alternatively you know go back to this idea of the context can affect salience um it may be that you know i know i'm paying a tax i don't like paying taxes i know i'm paying taxes i know what they are i've taken them into account i think you know i have that in mind but if you rub it in my face i'm going to get annoyed about paying taxes and get aversive to paying taxes so you know there are other things that could be going on here and normally maybe we wouldn't think about those other things as being you know the likely mechanism the fact that people are shown in the paper to understand the taxes suggests maybe it's not characterization failure so and i think this paper uh does a better job with that so well thank you for that introduction [Music] so so um so these are excellent questions that i was wondering about as well so let me tell you a little bit more about what i think are the mechanisms um across two papers there are two key facts um that i find very interesting and that also kind of broadly inform us about what it means to be attentive or inattentive to um inconspicuous incentives um so one um is that people actually do pay more attention to larger size taxes so that sigma parameter goes up when the stakes are higher um and two there's actually a lot of heterogeneity where some consumers overreact in the sense that their sigma is actually larger than one um and so the story these two facts um suggest to me and i'll go over the experimental design um that generates these two facts in a moment um but the story that i want to suggest um since i was asking the question is i think what it is is people just being averse to performing the calculation you know if we don't want to think about the text there's a rule of thumb that we use you know for some people that rule of thumb is you know if your sales tax is seven percent i'm just going to act as if it's 10 because i know how to move the decimal point over and then it's very easy for me to think about the tax you know there are other rules of thumb you might imagine where people might just add um a dollar and pretend the dollar is the sales tax for any item that's priced below 10 or 15 and then you do something else um for higher priced items um and the way i think about it is there's this thing that we can do when we are not exerting any mental effort or we can try to exert more mental effort which we might be more motivated to do when the stakes are higher and then we get closer to the truth and our computation of the tax and then we act as if we are um um you know our sigma is closer to one yes do you think this is a deliberate decision do you think people go to the grocery store and are looking at the toothpaste are deciding to you know do i share their mental effort of multiplying it by 1.0735 or it's just more automatic and building illegally yeah i mean it depends a little bit on what exactly you mean by deliberate versus automatic what i'm going to show you is that people are very responsive to stakes right so um the sigmas get closer to one when the stakes are higher to me that suggests that it's at least in part deliberate now you might argue you know maybe people just have like a meta strategy that at some point they just decided they do one thing when the stakes are higher and another thing when they're lower then they don't think too hard about their attention strategy on a day-to-day basis i don't know if you want to call that deliberate or automatic you know the word i don't want to use is rational i don't want to use rational inattention deliberate and intention i'm fine using i think it's a reasonable description of um of the facts that i want to suggest to you today okay so let me talk to you there's two papers um the one that really digs into these mechanisms is the paper with my student william morrison and so i'm just going to talk about that experiment yes um why wouldn't it be guilt because the shedding paper specifically deals with like beauty products for example which is not necessarily necessary and we know that when you post calories next to like ice cream people buy less ice cream and so they may not necessarily that be that people don't want to pay taxes it might just be like ah they're reminded of the higher price when they go guilty so i guess that's a point for your paper of using common hospital comments instead but sorry sorry but under that story um that's still you use the word reminded right so people are forgetting something um in the mechanism that you describe because there is also price variation right and so the question still is why are people more sensitive to price variation than they are into a tax variation okay fair enough i think why if i oh sorry go ahead and so i i think there's a fundamental difference between like necessities and monsters and stuff right so it's like what if people are just more price responsive luxury goods as opposed to possible good okay let me formalize this i think this is an excellent comment i i would take the your comment um as follows and i should repeat that i forgot to repeat comments and questions um so your question is people might feel uh every people feel guilty about spending in luxury goods and being reminded that the luxury good is more expensive and generates a strong response from people so the way that i would put this is there are a variety of reasons why people might choose to ignore taxes so when i say that an attention is deliberate i think the thing that probably immediately pops into your head is something that is closer to a rational attention kind of framework where there are just costs of computation but we can be a little bit broader than that part of the cost of paying attention to the tax might be something like guilt as you suggested um i think that's okay and i think that would fit in with the kinds of results that i'm about to show you um and then the second part of your comment i think motivates an interesting testable hypothesis which is i think that people should be people's attention should be more elastic with the stakes when it comes to luxury goods on the non-luxury goods i think that could well be true i'm not sure i have the data to test that um but i think that would be very interesting to look at on whether there are um predictable um predictors of heterogeneity across products and heterogeneity is very important as i'll formalize um in an efficiency cost framework in about five minutes um so i think your question is especially interesting for that reason any other comments or questions think it would make yes to wonder whether in a sense people received the tax rate in levels in a sense meaning if it's not posted uh it's not included in the positive price the tax i kind of know that there is a three percent on our product and i i might perceive that as kind of equally distributed say across products or in levels in a sense whereas seeing the price that includes uh the tax actually shows me by how much this single price increases and so how price exposed tax price become comparable i think i have minor comparatively thinking where if you don't see the tax posted uh you would kind of treat it as a instantly they would apply yeah i mean i take so yeah um does it matter if we describe the taxes as three percent or we describe them as this is the absolute monetary amount of the tax that's your question right right and like behaviorally if you want it was like thinking perhaps you know you enter the store you kind of know that there's gonna be a ten percent applied full product please think okay whatever i buy you're gonna get ten percent it's gonna be so i don't really take into account enterprises okay well that that is a hypothesis that i can show you is doesn't hold up in the data so let me show let me show you some of the data um so to dig more um into heterogeneity what you need is a lot of within person variation um and so what we created is kind of an experimental panel data sets data set where people are making a bunch of different purchase decisions across different products across different prices um and in fact across different tax regimes as well okay so people sometimes enter um just experimentally it's just described as store a where there's no sales tax sometimes they show up in store b which is described here you pay the standard sales tax um that you pay in your city of residence on standard non-tax-exempt items and that's so and then there is a store see where there's a triple the standard sales tax rate that you pay in your city of residence on standard non-tax exempt items so all of the variation here is within person um and so one of the things we can construct then is the following figure so here we are i'm computing the y-axis as sigma okay so the same sigma that we were talking about in the k-lean craft paper um and the exercise here is as follows so first let's look at the store with the standard tax rate um what i'm showing you here is what we compute the average sigma to be okay when we restrict the product whose prices are seven dollars or lower okay this says products with prices eight dollars or lower um and so forth and the identification here is along the lines of basically both strategy one and strategy two actually in chatty we need prof because within person we have both the no tax store and the standard tax store so we know how people respond to prices and we also see how people go from a no tax door to a standard tax store okay but we also have all of this price variations so in chatty we mean prop you are limited to the price duration that you have here we have tons of different prices that consumers are facing so the first pattern that you see here is that in the center tax store people are more sensitive to taxes at higher prices okay so so i think this gets up to what you were talking about people realize that at higher prices the absolute value of the tax is higher and so they um do more to try to react to it correctly the second pattern that you see here is that when we make the sales taxes higher through a different source of variation so we say instead of standard you have to do triple by the way we never actually tell them what this text is this is how it's described because we want to make it otherwise as comparable as possible to their standard experience so this is just kind of a um there's a transparent wing which we're describing the increase to them without actually saying what the tax rate is but consistent with doug was saying in this exam we similarly see that around 70 of the people know their sales tax rate within half a percentage point so it's really not about knowledge okay it's something that has to do i think with cognitive effort um because when it's transparently described as a larger sales tax you also see a sigma that's on average higher it's still on average below one um but it's definitely higher they can do another exercise and you can ask these sources of variation kind of produce similar responses to sigma and so instead when i'm talking about here is the average tax owed so i'm bidding the products into bins of two prices each as long as you have two prices that's enough to estimate a sigma you just need a little bit of price variation um and so what i'm plotting here now is basically the x-axis is the average tax code across the different bins and we have um five bins from standard tax store and five minutes from the triple tax store um now there's not that much overlap um because overall the absolute value of the text is significantly higher but you don't see any kind of major trend break that you might expect if you thought there was something especially weird about tripling taxes that over sensitizes people um you know the confidence intervals are a little bit wide but there's nothing suspicious here it looks like mostly kind of a continuous trend people sigma on average is just higher and higher sticks um so that's result one now the other thing we do because we have multiple products per person and so multiple opportunities to estimate a sigma for each person we can study individual differences okay so here is what i'm showing you um in the first column here um the first column here what we compute is a lower bound on the variance of people's sigmas in the standard tax store and the lower bound on this theory is actually very high 0.83 so close to 1. from this if you make the assumption that sigma is not less than zero for anyone meaning that no one pretends that taxes are subsidies you can actually start making inferences about what the support of sigma looks like and this variance estimate tells you immediately that there have to be some people whose sigmas are greater than one non-parametrically we're not i'm not estimating any kind of parametric distribution of sigma there's a non-parametric approach to generating lower bounds on the variance and i'm just telling you immediately from this lower bound we can conclude that sigma has to be larger than one for some people um can anyone explain why how do we know that sigma has and in fact this is the lower bound on the supremum so we know that if you compare if you look at the support of sigma there have to be has to be a positive measure of people whose sigma is in fact at least 2.2 how do we know well let me ask you this question if you have a random variable with support on the unit interval what is the max variance of this random variable can the variance be in anything or is there an upper bound on the variance well let's let's think intuitively we have a random variable it's supported on the unit interval the best way to get to the highest variance is to make it maximally dispersed how do you make the variable maximally dispersed when you put all mass on either zero or one so we're talking about a bernoulli random variable okay then in fact um and we know how to compute various variances of bernoulli and random variables p times one minus p and that's maximized where at p equals a half so the maximum variance is a quarter that's the intuition but that's a it's a very easy to prove um result so maximum variance of a um random variable squared on the unit interval is a quarter so when you see this you know it's not supported on the unit interval um and in fact you can extend the intuition i gave you to generate lower bounds on the supremum so if you know something about the mean the mean and the variance together actually give you bounds on how expansive that support has to be okay so we know that it also can't just be supported from zero to one and a half that gives you you cannot attain a variance this high um given the mean if it's only support on zero to one and a half so that's how you can start making kind of very robust non-parametric bounds on the support of the random variable um similar results for sigma in the triple tax condition okay and then the third thing we can do is because this is within subject we can also look at how people adjust so for each person you can define an adjustment term which is how their sigma change which is difference between their sigma and the standard tax store and their sigma in the triple stack store a lot of heterogeneity adjustment as well and one of the things we can show is that some people adjust downward okay so it's not just all people adjust upward what we can also show is that people are just downward and by quite a bit okay so we can show that some people are just downward by as much as 0.94 and so this is consistent with this broader story that i was telling you where there's actually both under an overreaction probably because people just have very heterogeneous rules of thumb that they choose to apply when they are not generating any mental effort but when the stakes increase we put in more mental effort and so the rules of thumb become used less and our sigmas then converge closer to one so so that's that's my view of what's going on and then more broadly about attention you know one thing that um i you know now that i say that sounds kind of simple and obvious but one thing that i've kind of learned for myself from this is when we talk about an intention we shouldn't just mean that an intention means ignoring the thing that's in front of you hearing attention actually means using just some kind of automatic rule of thumb which is not the same thing as just ignoring the tax yes how do you account for measurement error so even if you come from a teenage stigma you will get a positive variance just because x oh okay good i wasn't gonna start complaining about this but you got me okay there's a thing that people who are focused on lab experiments do which drives me crazy um which is what you would basically do is for each person you just get a point estimate of sigma and then you plot that distribution and you say okay let's learn about heterogeneity from this distribution now as you pointed out that's of course completely wrong because when you plot that distribution of sigma hats what it is is actually convolution of true individual differences and a bunch of measurement error or noise and without having something else we have no idea how much of it is actually real individual differences as far as we're concerned about the noise what is the intuition then for how we can do robust inferences on individual differences well recall that there are multiple products per person so under your hypoth under the null hypothesis that sigma is in truth homogeneous roughly speaking what we would see is that there is no persistence across different products and the person's sigma right a person for whom we estimate a high sigma in one product is not going to have a higher sigma for a different set of products so it's actually the degree to which um people's sensitivity to taxes is correlated across different products that informs us about individual differences and one of the things that we develop in the paper is a formalization of this intuition that is actually quite general so for example if you just made the assumption that sigma hat is the true sigma plus a noise term epsilon that is independent of sigma then it's very easy to calculate the variance of true sigma because then as long as you have two sigma hats you take the covariance and then by assumption of independent noise the covariance actually just equals the variance of the true sigma you don't need to make an assumption that strong so what we show in the paper is a generalization of this intuition um that shows that roughly speaking of something like this covariance but when you take it when you have non-classical measurement error it actually gives you a lower bound rather than an exact point estimate of the variance um so great question um i will then just actually advertise if you want to do kind of individual differences in this kind of robust and non-parametric way as possible we have some tools um in this paper for doing it definitely do not do this thing where you just estimate something at the individual level and you plot that distribution of parameters definitely we usually have some information about how precisely we're estimating the sigmas and we do some shortage only distribution or estimated so that is a alternative way of approaching this so you have like you can estimate the same enough for each individual and you have a confidence interest i think the consistent estimator of the optimal shrinkage so what i was suggesting is a form of shrinkage factor estimation right because by how much do you shrink well it actually depends on the covariance between two different point estimates of sigma right if they're completely uncorrelated you have to shrink everything to the mean if they are very strongly correlated um you don't shrink everything to the mean um now you're suggesting that we could make inferences about the covariance just by looking at the standard error um which i'm done which i'm not sure is the case i think it depends on what goes into standard into the standard error um right because one way of getting the standard errors for low for example is just to have enormous variation um in both prices and taxes um and then so you're somehow saying our we learn a lot more about individual differences when we have this enormous variation which i'm not sure is true because i'm not sure that larger variation prices and taxes changes what would be the covariance um but let's talk more about this um yeah i don't mean to say that um so i should okay it should be there's it's not like there's no information because we can for example even just have priors on how much noise there is so we can be bayesian about looking at the distribution of point estimates um but we if our goal is to study individual differences we definitely should not feel satisfied um with that um and shrinkage estimators is something we should always have in mind you know and worst case scenario is you can try to think of what would be a plausible um trick estimator you know i think the most robust way of getting the optimal shrinkage is from exactly the intuition that i described where you have multiple measures per person um but i think this is useful to think more about okay um let's talk about implications for welfare um so um to do welfare um the literature has made um the following two assumptions um although one of them we're gonna i i should already preface we probably should be walking back um so um one is that utility depends only on the final consumption bundle two is consumers optimized perfectly um in the absence of taxes and then there's a third assumption that we normally make but that we're just going to um dispense with which is that consumers optimize perfectly in the presence of taxes reasonably like writing it this way is to make it transparent that this is a generalization of the standard approach in public finance to thinking about the welfare consequences of taxation we're not making new assumptions we're just eliminating one of the assumptions that we normally make now in the context of everything that doug talked about um yesterday um you should think of assumption one as defining the scope of consumers concerns and assumption two is defining the welfare relevant domain okay by not making assumption three we're just allowing for there to be a difference in how people choose between what the welfare relevant domain in a different frame um where sales taxes are not included in the posted prices now the reason so this is where chevy and looney and croft started this is the set of assumptions that i make in my paper um i actually now really do want to pick on assumption one though because it's inconsistent with everything i was just telling you about where people's attention might be deliberate um and responsive to changes in incentives i think what those results suggest um is that the scope of consumers concerns is broader than just the final consumption bundle it includes something like the cost of mental effort okay so actually that would be a violation of assumption one here but let's just roll with this for now and then we can talk about how we would modify um the formula by incorporating mental effort costs um meaning and thus broadening the scope of consumers concerns okay let's go back to the syntax formula from hunt it's a good thing we talked about that a lot yesterday because everything goes back to that um so um remember how we thought about the impact of on welfare of a change in the tax t okay there's and we're i'm setting aside um um redistributive concerns here so that mechanical effect um is just going to be zero um so with that redistributive concerns we have two effects the bias correction and the fiscal externality okay so we have by scam again gamma is the vertical difference between the two demand curves dx dt is just how the demand responds to the tax okay and we have this functionality people consume less of the good you get to collect less tax revenue so starting with this formula let's just plug in what gamma is actually this is a slight reinterpretation of gamma um because we're not talking about bias on the good itself but it's the same thing when people are under reacting or overreacting to taxes it's the same thing as over or underestimating the utility from the purchase um so with the tiny tiny reinterpretation of bias and the syntax formula we can say that in this framework gamma is one minus sigma times the tax if say if you have a sigma of a half what it means is that you are actually overestimating the utility from the purchase but by one half the tax so now you can plug this into the formula and a teeny bit of algebra gets you to this result which is the formula in chatty looney and cost okay the dead weight loss of taxation um is going to be sigma times the tax times the change in demand that's the impact on the dead weight loss of taxation now this is at the person level so if you assume that sigma is homogeneous and you change this to just the derivative of the mean that's the formula in chattanooga but we can modify this because we learned that sigma is actually heterogeneous um and um there's kind of a very mechanical and simple looking modification that occurs with heterogeneous sigma because um the change in demand with respect to the tax is itself also going to be proportional to sigma right the more you pay attention to the tax the more responsive you're going to be to the tax and so what you get then is actually the second moment of sigma and the formula because we already have a sigma once to modify the elasticity with respect to demand then we have a second sigma and how we translate from the elasticity with respect to the tax of the austerity with respect to the price um so in fact um the more general formula um looks like this and this is also possibly with um various rates of the pass-through parameter so there's two things that actually matter there's the average sigma and that modifies the total derivative of equilibrium demand with respect to the tax here i'm not necessarily assuming the prices are exogenous they might change with respect to the tax um and then there's a second term which is the variance of sigma which modifies the partial derivative of demand and then tuition for this formula goes back to what i was talking about yesterday actually when i was covering non-financial policy instruments which is that noise is bad okay so the higher is the variance the higher is the deadweight loss of taxation um and it just goes back to this intuition that um what we want is consumers to derive higher value from the good to be the ones purchasing it when you have heterogeneity and sensitivity to taxes you get into situations where you have low value consumers purchasing the good high value consumers not purchasing the good and it's bad and you have similar results to what i was talking about in the case of non-financial policy instruments where for example um even if you have like a vertical supply curve so the equilibrium quantity in the market is fixed that's a situation where if sigma was homogeneous um there would be no deadly loss of taxation because taxes don't change the equilibrium quantity at all but with heterogeneity and sigma all of a sudden taxes do generate that weight loss because it's now taxes combined with heterogeneous perceptions of taxes that generates noise in the market so with paternity attention to taxes higher taxes you should think of as generating more noise and that's an additional source of dead weight loss so in fact um you know one of the things that happens is if you take the kinds of bounds that we compute in the morrison town paper and plug into formulas like this one of the things you learn is that even though on average people under react to taxes which might lead you to want to think that that's good because it reduces these functionalities the variance is actually so high that all of the noise and these non sailing link poster prices actually makes them less efficient than salient taxes um that would just be included in posted prices into which people on average would actually be more sensitive any questions here okay let me i have five minutes left i'm going to try to quickly summarize um uh some of the work on how people misperceive um income taxes um and what we're studying in this paper let me show you a picture is um two kinds of heuristics for how people might perceive um an income tax so one and this is coming from leedman and zack hauser is that when you have a kind of complex number of your tax schedule you might engage in what they call ironing which as you say i don't want to think about the non-linear thing i like linear i know what to do with linear okay now when you say it's linear there's a question of what's the slope and there's a very natural candidate for the slope at least with respect to income taxes which is the average tax rate you know like when you file your taxes um around april 15 with turbotax it tells you what your effective tax rate was maybe makes you mad so it's very salient there's a lot of emotion tied into it so you remember your effective tax rate um and so that's a natural candidate for the slope of um how you approximate um the nonlinear thing with the linear thing okay so ironing is secant lines that go through this okay there's an alternative which i think maybe makes a little bit um intuitively less but we can still test for it in the context of income taxes might make more sense in other contexts which is spotlighting which is again i want to linearize because not only your things are complicated you know there's a perfectly fine approach to probably we as economists do it all the time physicists do it all the time linearization is great um it's just a question of the slope um and in some sense spotlighting is actually the better way to line your eyes because here we're considering tangent lines so for marginal decisions it doesn't really generate mistakes making non-marginal decisions like extensive margin decisions about employment then spotlighting is going to lead you to make mistakes um so those are the two things so ironing which is secant lines and spotlighting which is tangent lines and so to get to that we basically generated a data set where we created tax filers very similar to the survey respondents but we vary the tax filers gross income then we ask the survey respondents for these different levels of gross income what do you think would be the tax that they pay so that the outcome of this procedure is basically eliciting people's perception of the income tax rate okay so look at this panel here for example this is for mary filing jointly the dashed line is the true tax that they pay and this line here with a little bit of a shaded confidence interval is their perceptions you know overall you see is that on average people are not that far off but what happens is they overestimate the tax at the low end and they underestimate the tax at the high end what you also see is that as the respondent's own income changes the point at which overestimation changes to underestimation changes as well that point moves to the right so the higher you are the more likely you are to overestimate taxes on lower incomes and less likely you are to underestimate taxes on higher incomes so there are a bunch of patterns in the data um around how overestimation and general flattening of the tax schedule and all of these patterns are in reduced form totally consistent with ironing so you can see for example ironing predicts that the higher income you are the steeper is that tangent line resides secant line the more overestimation there is and the less underestimation there is so this is all very much consistent with ironing and using this kind of variation we can estimate a mixture model where we have some ironers um we have some spotlighters in the population and we have what we call kind of residual misperceptions which is any other kind of misperception of the income tax schedule that is independent of the survey respondent's income and the result is we find that almost half of the population irons and basically know what the spotlights and this is reasonably tightly estimated and here's just what it looks like in pictures um when you do an individual level of classification um here's what the irs look like they really do look like ironers you know their perceptions look pretty linear and they intersect the true tax schedule right around the respondent's income the people who don't look like buyers don't look like ironers they just have misperceptions that are not dependent on their own income there's a tiny bit of overestimation coming from not exactly clear what um maybe people just including state taxes into questions about federal taxes um you know but it's nothing interesting going on but you know this is ironers it really looks like ironing perceptions are on a flat line that moves with sorry respond on a straight line that moves with certain respondents incomes um this has welfare implications that i'm not going to go into um so i will just summarize so when incentives are complex or opaque people misreact to them um the welfare implications of this are subtle on the one hand we have this intuition that we've kind of um is very common especially if you're trying more for public finance which is anything that makes you react less than taxes is good because it reduces physical externalities but it's more subtle than that because heterogeneity in this misreaction can be quite inefficient um and also um i didn't touch on this but it's part of the welfare results when we're talking about income taxes how this misperception covariance with income matters and that again goes back to the kinds of things i was talking about with syntaxes matters whether the bias is concentrated on lower or higher income so it is definitely more subtle than just talking about an average physical externalities i'm going down what i want to think about and i think a lot of people kind of pick on this um very correctly and i think this is really a potentially very interesting set of research questions is around this notion of why do people dislike complexity so much a lot of i think a lot of people have an inherent dislike or complexity the spy complexity being potentially um beneficial and another question to think about is even if we identify situations where complexity is beneficial from a standard cost benefit analysis is that really the right welfare function is it really right does it sound palpable to say let's make the taxes more opaque and complex to re optimally reduce fiscal externalities a lot of our intuitions is that doesn't seem um quite right i think that's a really interesting research question that might get into a nice agenda that's around the intersection of social preferences and cognitive biases as they relate to questions about welfare and policy design i'll end here
