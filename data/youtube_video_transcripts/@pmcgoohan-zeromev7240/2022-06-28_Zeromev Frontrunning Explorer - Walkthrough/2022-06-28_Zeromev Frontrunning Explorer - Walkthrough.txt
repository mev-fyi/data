hi everybody it's pima gooen from xero mev here i want to give you a very quick walk through more of a run through really of the main features of the xero mev ethereum front running explorer you're going to see some nasty examples of front running and censorship in ethereum and some colorful heat maps to balance things out a bit so go to www.xeromev.org and you'll find something like this showing recent mev categorized by how harmful it is to users so mev is unique in differentiating harmful or toxic mev involving front running and censorship from neutral and as yet unclassified mev and that's shown quite clearly here you can see here we have toxic muv and here we have other so you can scroll up and down here and see the last hour or so and just click on any block you'd like to drill down into it you can also search by block number transaction hash or account just as you would with any blockchain explorer so for now i'm going to enter one four nine five nine five two two for this example if you want to follow along and bang so straight away we can see two sandwich attacks at the top of the block so sandwich is the victim transaction and front run and back run are the attacking transactions which lost the user thirteen thousand dollars in the first case so what's going on here is that the front run pushes up the price okay so that the victim overpays and the back run allows the attacker to profit from doing this so if we hover over sandwich the sandwich badge we can see the details of the swaps involved so something to notice is that the user loss is higher than the attacker's profit and this is quite typical now at zero mev we are interested in harm to users we're not interested in profits to miners so that's what we focus on user losses the delay column shows that the victim had to wait one minute 58 seconds to be included only to be attacked when they were hover over it and we can see the delay as measured by each zero mev node you can see they're they're all pretty similar and similarly we can hover over the arrival time for any transaction and we can see the first the first time that each zero mev node saw this transaction when it was pending so now let's take a look at the heat map so the heat maps over here this is the summary of it yeah and this is the same thing by transaction yeah they're both the same yeah that's the sort of detail if you like and this is the summary now the colors are all mixed up because the time order of transactions in the block is mixed up too and this is bad news because toxic mev happens when miners order transactions by self-interest and not by time so click on fair order and we can see this the heat map is now showing that the transactions have been sorted in time order here we've got the oldest first in light yellow and we've got the most recent last in dark black so notice that the earliest transaction in the block is delayed by 17 minutes 24 seconds before being included and also that the sandwich attacks have disappeared so what's happened to them click on info and we get to see only the transactions of interest so transactions with swaps and mev and we can see then that the victim sandwich transactions are still near the top yeah because they're kind of old transactions they deserve to be early in the block scroll down and you'll see the attacking front run and background transactions now out of harm's way at the bottom yeah that's where they would be if they ordered by time so had the block been ordered by time neither of these sandwich attacks would have been possible and these two users would not have lost a combined 14 000 odd dollars so how were these sandwich attacks performed with such precision yeah we'll scroll up again click on block order and then on all so flashbots provide a service allowing people to bribe miners to include bundles of their own and other people's transactions in whatever order they choose the column with the robot icon shows that the first sandwich attack was sent in flashbots bundle 2 so you can see 2.1 2.2 2.3 and the second in bundle three so that's 3.1 3.2 3.3 and this service makes sandwich attacks trivial to perform and riskless for the attacker because if they fail it costs them nothing they don't have to pay anything unsurprisingly toxic mev increased as a ratio of all mev after flashbots released this service we can see then that time ordering solves the problem of toxic mev but how accurately can we no time order in a distributed network like ethereum well we can get a bit of a window onto that as well so see this delay box at the top of the page it tells us that transactions were delayed by an average of 59 seconds in this block before being included it also it also tells us that the oldest transaction in the block had to wait 17 minutes 24 seconds before being included which we already know so if we hover over it we get details as we often do and you can see individual block arrival times there now let's look at the network box right this shows us the actual performance of the ethereum p2p peer-to-peer network and that it had a delay of only 62 milliseconds at this time so that is far far far less than our victim transactions were delayed by which was around two minutes so have a play around you know have a click around as a next step you could try putting your wallet address into the search box at the top and seeing if you have been the victim of toxic mev i do hope you haven't we've got a lot more coming on this topic a lot of information so please follow us on the links below i'll see you next time
