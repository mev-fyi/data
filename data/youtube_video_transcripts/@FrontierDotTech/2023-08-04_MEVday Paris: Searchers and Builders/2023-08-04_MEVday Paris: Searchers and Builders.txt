um I wanna I wanna introduce our our moderator for uh for this panel uh this is Rajiv he recently joined the uh the frontier team and uh I mean this is gonna be a really packed panel I think we'll have a lot of spicy debate um about the future of block building uh so without further Ado yeah I'll just hand it over to you Reggie yeah it's nice to see everyone today thanks for coming out um I want to talk content so we'll just do really quick intros uh starting with Matt uh good afternoon everyone I'm Matt Cutler I'm founder and CEO of block native we're a ethereum relay block Builder gas estimator mempool specialist and hopefully many of you here have used our tools I'm Nathan bit of a background as a Searcher but I'm currently uh leading the adventure at Frontier the Builder hey um the team that operates the Titan block Builder uh I'm Tom I work on async Builder hi everyone Ori from Blackstrap we're an infrastructure provider a block Builder a relay if you're doing anything in D5 and Mev probably use us or know us um also for everyone could you each say if you're a Searcher Builder or not like for the audience so block native operates Builders not searchers yeah we are not a such a builder at the moment completely neutral we're also neutral Builder uh no comment where we run a builder but in general because we're a service provider we don't do actual searching maybe we work with other partners who do it but we ourselves don't do it cool um when I think about block building there's like three key ways to kind of differentiate to like win blocks you can have uh better access to order flow you can be better at bundle merging uh you can have better infrastructure um I'd love for everyone to like stack rank what you think is like more important for winning more blocks I think autoflow is King at the moment I mean we would hope that in the future merging with matter more but just right now it doesn't matter anywhere near as much as as autoflow does pretty much agree um I think there's a threshold of a certain out of flow that is not exclusive today that most builders um can have access to um so in the short term they'll um technology and being better at merging in infrastructure will give you an advantage but without the Overflow in general you don't have the building blocks to build blocks uh yeah I think like the same thing autoflow is like most important um I guess if you have like really uh like a really Pipeline and then like you're not going to win any blocks but you still need like the autoflow right okay spicy take to the different direction and I'm not sure I believe everybody's sitting in a panel here um lock building is in the domain of those who can do C5 defy Arbitrage as Frontiers showed um 60 of all Mev comes from C5 D5 Arbitrage and the amount that's being paid to the validator is not the 95 percent but somewhere between 37 and 77 so average 50 so maybe you do need order flow because like without it then you're at a disadvantage but it's done by the c5d5 arbitr if maybe they're all very good so it's not a big differentiator between them but between them and everybody else what makes them the Kings not the king among them but really at the top is C5 defy Arbitrage a lot of capital and the ability to do that willing to get pushed back against it you just said order flow in a different way it's just order for that certain people might be generating themselves right that's not ex that's exclusive okay I took order flow as okay the transaction on chain out there Etc well well in real okay these are counter trades to C5 trades I want you to say it Tom I mean it's just like it's the same right it's just all the fluid it's like bundle flow whatever you just have if you don't have these transactions to include in your blog like you can't build a block right like it's the same thing I think you also have to make a distinction here between like the amount of blocks that you have and the value of those blocks like yes if you're talking about block space value consume then probably C5 Defy is kind of King but if you're just talking about raw inclusion then I think that like just general order flow matters a lot more at the C5 defy training alone won't get you all of the smaller blocks whether it's not the large MAV opportunities I feel as if it's the case in which it's more so when you're referring to a hft trading I think it's like you can sort of group it into uh let's see I would call it exclusivity of order flow so more so both external overflow but also the autofload that you create internally from hft Trading as well yeah I'm gonna build the spicy take on top of URI spice you take which in the supply chain that we have you can abstract it down to three classes of actors there's a Trader class actor there's a validator class actor and there's a sucker class actor so you can go through and you can say user which one of the three are they oh really right uh what about like like I don't know relay operators suck oh right so it's like literally just go through and you can say well either you're a Trader different type of Trader various types or you're a validator or you're a sucker and this I think is super dangerous for the long-term health of the network and we should be talking about that yeah yeah I think that's a good point do we want to build systems where the customer is a sucker yeah or do they all evolve into trees like either you trade or you're a sucker that's it so going to the trading side it seems like the only people really making money on building are the people who are also trading so how do people think about like just making money and building generally considering that you know for any of us to continue at this long term presumably have to make money at some point um so I I think in the short term um there is a non-significant amount of Revenue that can be made if you are a top Builder without trading just by having Edge on like the things that we already discussed um just so the nature of the auction is such that um over time and it's already happening the margins on those are going to be compressed and so then there are two parts for it so one are you gonna be an integrated Searcher Builder so trade make more Revenue that way or do you create additional value and generate Revenue that way and so I think and that's also part of our thesis that is significant amount of Revenue that you can unlock as a neutral Builder and that's what we're going for do you have some examples of things that might unlock additional value as a neutral Builder sure so um in the short term um if you think specifically about services that are targeted at the most sophisticated consumers of blogspace today which are Traders and so services that facilitate or almost put traders that are not vertically integrated on par with vertically integrated builders that is value add and you can charge for that yeah I think I take the same view that the building in general you're operating an inclusion service for searches primarily it's like what can you do for them as a customer do you feel you can give it to all like you could either in vertically integrate or you're saying well you could offer this as a service but there's a lot of trust in Nuance there is do you consider these well Builders could offer it to their users in general or this okay I can pick one or two or three customers and give them access to like is it very exclusive yeah I think it's not exclusive it's very similar to let's say box route offering mempool streaming services um low latency distribution so it's almost about commoditizing the The Edge that the integrated Builder has today and then giving everyone the same access so why don't we have more builders um so block building itself is a very hard job and so I think in order to be relevant as a builder you first need to control enough block space so you're interesting enough for other players to take you serious which is a hard problem to solve so a high barrier to entry and once you are there and start innovating and using the leverage you have so so okay I'll I disagree but I'm going to push it about it in a second so it is interesting to contemplate sort of how much of the ethereum network is on the stage right now I mean just between the relays and urian and block native it's like 40 or so give or take and then among the builders I would guess it's about the same is that fair yes I hope it's stable there's well over 80 percent in the room if you know if gonna count it's probably 95 99 in in the room as well and I think one of the interesting opportunities around the space while the the building May ultimately be some flavor of trading or some latency games um there are a lot of opportunities potentially surrounding it like around observability as we think about the complexity of the ethereum roadmap one of the general vectors is more mempools mempools have really poor observability properties and that is the the why of why everything happens and so if you think about mempools as the root of Mev then observability becomes really important and entities like us and obviously like block start as well add a lot of value to the ecosystem and so we're looking for opportunities sort of on the edges and surrounding to to add economic value and to receive the key is adding economic value and receiving economic rewards as a result because today this current structure is that receipt of economic rewards is highly uh asymmetric pushing against what Titan from Titan said our block Builders entrenched because as is you all agreed order flow is King and if somebody is a big block Builder if I can if I'm building 30 of the blocks then all everybody who has a bundle all the Searchers will send me bundles they can't decide well I don't trust Titan so I don't no you will trust because otherwise you give up on 30 of your Revenue opportunities so if you're a big ball if you're a big block Builder are you entrenched to remain a big blocker yeah or if it gets order flow to a large degree it's like you have a position in the market you become more trusted it's sort of like a self-reinforcing cycle and there's barriers to entry like most of the builders have to pay you for a subscription right it's like quite expensive so there's these like fixed costs that you have to incur to even be in the game but that's a good thing though it's also like um you know we've seen this with like new builders in the market some Searchers find that their bundle inclusion rate with certain Builders just isn't up to par and as a result they either consider building or potentially send their order flow to other places um so order flow is important clearly does anyone pay for order flow today would you be willing to pay for order flow uh today if you could and uh do you think you will end up paying for order flow in the future I think everyone pays for order flow like if you set up nodes you're paying for order flow like no matter how you get it you're basically paying paying for order flow exclusive order flow I guess the question is like mechanisms around that and like I guess does it always need to be exclusive like sometimes you might just want it faster so I think the design space for this is like is complicated but yeah exclusive order flow is really important and it's it could end up being a king maker for for Builders do you pay for it well I pay we pay blocks throughout right I don't buy order flow I sell order quick question I guess not everybody here was necessarily uh building sort of right around the merge or just shortly after the merge some people were there much faster than others like why did everybody start building it's just fun it's like a med strategy that combines oh sorry uh I just had a quick question for QB on like essentially having a neutral Builder and kind of making that profitable right like you can effectively create an intent layer and allow people to communicate their intent and optimally execute on that but how would you then incentivize and monetize that by like taking a portion of the profit if rsync or I mean more concerningly Beaver Builder could do the exact same thing not monetize it because they have the advantage of getting that additional order flow but on top of that they can then pick off the 20 univ3l peoples and profit off that so they don't really have to monetize that side right how do you then compete in that world because they don't depend on the sub-optimal execution of transactions like sandwich Searchers do they don't really care like how how do you solve that um well good question um I think in general um they don't control 100 of a block space um even though there are few players that dominate certain short tail strategies like beaver and others um there is still an interesting enough amount of block space that is open for neutral Builders um and even um and also the reason why we are we are building out these services for other trading firms to actually compete with these larger trading firms but don't are not vertically integrated they still generate valuable enough flow and so that is the position or the value out of a new I think you also said something really interesting earlier about like identifying what are the benefits that other builders are getting for this vertical integration how can we turn that into a product and how can we offer it to searches is Max Resnick still here where's Max oh there he is so talk to Max So Max has some great research that says the sex arbitragers wind blocks when there's High degrees of volatility on binance right so they don't need to win every block they just need to win the blocks that they need to win right and again this is this sort of these negative cycles that you know you you can have these external forces that exert pressure on the network because of the monolithic block auction right and and my my view of this is steady state we need to move to partial block building so that the guys at Beaver who are doing sex sex Arbitrage hypothetically can win that piece of the block and then others who have other applications because again I think we want to build an ethereum for everyone and everything but it's increasingly an ethereum for a very elite group of Traders and that's not great so I I know those sex decks arbitragers are looking for low latency with the node operators to get it in last possible second before the block is proposed I'm wondering if relays uh like pay for co-location with node operators to get lower latency I don't think anybody pays for co-location with nodes I like we don't and I don't know of others that do we invest heavily in propagating information at the speed of light around the world so it's kind of it's because nodes could be anywhere it's not like well you have eight centralized exchanges around the world right which next to which you can load co-locate if you're in Trad fi but here it's much bigger it could be in all sorts of like data centers around the world so for us it is it's a big investment in infrastructure and speed of light propagation and you know Justin came up with the idea of like okay optimistic relaying that like okay reducing shaving off milliseconds and whatnot Etc in order to be ready at the last possible moment but using that as an opportunity to say latency game is still very much exists whether you like it or not they're just a lot really at the last moment so you could imagine that C5 D5 arbitrages who are the strongest like actors out there would want will have the lowest risk the closest they are to the execution like what's the chances of that happening I know exactly what the prices are they make the act and really wait till the last possible moment when you can shave a millisecond then it's slightly less risky and you make slightly more money so these games still very much exist at the last moment off like building blocks and trying to improve them but no if any of the builders here have something to add I don't think latency game isn't necessarily a bad thing because they are primary value drivers to end users it's just a question of can you encourage the benefits of latency with appropriate guard rails for users like can you give them guarantees around decentralization censorship or whatever I think that's a better approach than saying like decentralization at all costs and will solve like customer problems later I I strongly agree with that I would also say we actually like arbitragers like if you're here definitely like yourself but Arbitrage are doing a good thing and we want arbitrages to correct the price at the fastest like possibility at that like it is a good thing a lot of people say well latency games that's stratify that's bad that I strongly disagree with that there's a lot of good things about latency there are bad stuff there are people getting sandwich which is a bad thing like there are users bleeding money in that that's what we should try to solve for but latency by itself is a good thing we want D5 to compete with C5 we want it fast we want it effective we want it good and valuable on the subject of co-location to uri's point you know the validator proposal can be anywhere in the world so it's hard to co-locate but there's a pretty small number of relays like seven that matter and co-location from Builders to relays is a big deal it's not I think a big money deal like but everybody asks where you are because I want to have lowest latency and one of the areas that we have blocked native are working very hard on is basically distributed relaying so we cannot have one relay and one geography but many relays all over the world the great thing about this is it's really expensive and the other great thing about this is we don't get paid anything for it so you know it's awesome that we get to finance the operations of Lido and other folks because that's super sustainable and we're excited about it [Applause] like why do you say it it subsidizes Lido like why Lido validators in general sorry sorry sorry so lydo is just the biggest so if you look at there's many dashboards out here on on what we do and if you look at rated Network it says quite clearly that the value of an Mev boost block on average is between 300 and 400 percent of vanilla block so the primary beneficiaries of the supply chain are the validators who get a higher return for Block validated and therefore offer a better apy which is great we all know that right um the challenge of course is that there's a whole bunch of layers in the stack that have nice names but ultimately are suckers because the economics for the the value flows downhill in the supply chain and that therefore you have many actors who who don't have great economic incentives and therefore you don't have high degrees of participation and therefore you have counter incentives and therefore you have centralization so anyone who's in the relay world knows or tired of me hearing about this but today we have seven relays that matter it's not a stable equilibrium and so tomorrow we're either going to have two relays that matter or we're going to have 25 relays that matter right and which version of that future do we think is better for the health of the network and what incentives are we putting in place to encourage that version and the current incentives today are no incentives and therefore why would anyone stand up a new relay because they're just going to lose money I guess there's some benefits of synergy with vertical integration right you'd expect there to be lower latency between Builders and relays and that would benefit the relay but that doesn't seem like a good business model to encourage yeah I mean if it's not profitable right like everybody could just stop running relays and people will find the right incentives to potentially don't say it out loud don't give us relay is it but no um the entire point of the relay is to sit between the block Builder and the proposer if we remove that relay if we say well you know we can vertical integrate with the builder we like our Builders then okay then there's nobody in between them it's just like we like that's part of the flashbot Mev boost design is to have an entity so one doesn't screw the other and a wise man who's in this room called that Mev dystopia the whole point was to avoid this vertically integrated stack to recreating the existing C5 model and yet we have incentive schemes which seem to be trending in that direction and so my argument as many have heard is let's start to introduce some changes to the incentive schemes to try to increase participation at more layers of the stack ah did you miss my presentation earlier out with the old the movie supply chain doesn't exist anymore I was gonna say my vision for a relay would be they get paid for providing guarantees on Builder Behavior oh oh the optimistic relay is a good example right like you if I'm with the relay and they'll slash you if you do something and you I want to throw a question out there do you feel that in the current setup there is still a strong vertical integration pressure between Searchers and Builders and really across the stack like not even like really we just talked about but like elsewhere as well yeah there's a very strong vertical integration pressure between Builders and searches like building is a searching strategy to some degree and like they're just using searches for the things where they can't fill the gaps in the in the in-house trading like in in if you're a vertically integrated Builder so there's very strong pressure there as you can see from Beaver build and how much of the market they control so should we expect all Builders to be to become Builder Searchers in your opinion it's a difficult question just because like you would think if you're an order flow provider then like ultimately you'll probably want to go with a more neutral Builder but that's not playing out in practice today but I think some of this is a question of like things like Dex design and like things on the app layer which will like control more of what the future of this looks like I would hope that that neutral Builders are more the future my thinking and I'm curious to hear the builders thinking is that if you are the Builder and you have you created two bundles or there are two opportunities and each one of them is worth a dollar then if you are a Searcher then you can say okay this one could pay anywhere between zero and one and this one could pay anywhere between zero and one but if you're the Builder you can take both of them and decide between zero and two so we have a lot more flexibility it's not like one or the other so I would expect Builders to be more profitable sergers and for that to be the reason for vertical integration because they have more flexibility not just within a bundle but across everything so I I know you like really curious to hear your take on on the counter person yeah I think in general [Music] um in practice uh it's not realistic for one entity to be super competitive in terms of all the different kinds of strategies that exist and so even in terms of Beaver specifically like not on the stage but but they're killing it like say on the CX Dex front um there are a lot of other value extracting strategies that you can run with in a lock right and so if you were to say I would generate all of that in-house you wouldn't be able to compete with the aggregated value overall in the ecosystem that's like this do you think Jared from Subway should run a builder um I think if you are sandwicher it is much harder to have um have a value value that is unique uh to the to the entire block itself I guess he's competitive on block space consumption with even c5d5 Traders like theoretically he could run a profitable Builder yeah oh to kuby's point though like you don't need to be good at everything all the time you just need to be good at one thing and then certain times that becomes the most important thing so during periods of high degrees of asset volatility on certain centralized exchanges certain strategies basically dominate everything else and so if you happen to want to do something like an nft trade at the same time the universe of potential Avenues to get on chain shrinks to potentially just one and so that one may cycle around but but there's still only one or two actors in many situations that effectively control inclusion exclusion and ordering and that's not great so asking a question about like is this a good outcome I was just speaking yesterday at the PBS salon and somebody was presenting don't remember his name about like okay how good is it how decentralized is it what's the risk here and I was thinking that the existence of Builders and especially a small group of them is potentially dangerous because if I'm a very big and strong Builder what's the cost for me to dominate everything he's kind of like well I don't always build the best block but what would be the cost for me the marginal cost I built a good block not the best block if I wanted to win 90 can I like how costly would that be definitely less than like 100 a day and low volatile times and can I pay less than 100 years can you be profitable so if I know I'm going to win this next book I'm going to I'm going to outpay anybody else like I know can I make better C5 defy trade or something with a lower risk like could it actually be a potential profit to as a builder subsidize and capitalize how costly or even profitable would it be I I don't know the answer I'm curious for takes um my take would be that the total value that you can extract like being very good at let's say a very short term short tail strategy um in aggregates would would not be high enough to control 100 of the block space and so we see subsidies today right like yes it's a good point because most subsidies actually are very tactical in nature exactly and so it is not so it's you you're not actually bleeding large most Spillers at least don't bleed a large amount of their profits into subsidies and um that's just the Dynamics today and if you if you use all the profits that you make from let's say CX trading to then get 100 of the block space what's the point of CX Trading I'm actually more worried about like censorship resistance like like I'm not doing it to make a profit but like does it make ethereum more fragile that I could take that route and it won't cost me a gazillion eth to stake and capture it by by holding a lot of it can I capture it by controlling block building what do you think the motivation is to do this I am very evil I want to censor all transactions who are sent by people whose address start with one right sure but if I'm if I'm doing this I just like bleed money and like and then I just get bankrupt right like what's the point not really not thinking as a Trader thinking as like a state actor like resistance and anti-fragility off ethereum does block building make it worse because because of the difference it's kind of like yes like it pays a lot of money but the marginal difference between blocks might not be that big so the cost yeah there's but I just don't think it's a sustainable long-run strategy like you're just going to burn your eighth you're not going to like make any profit from it blockchains align rational economic actors I think that's a highly irrational thing to do I just don't see it playing out maybe it's a good marketing spend for an altar one Maybe I had a question uh before it's been mentioned monolithic block building and you know the idea of getting away from it so what our ideas to do so would like a system of recursive auction work could you be able to import part of the technical research from PBS and adapt it down in the map food chain for like Builder Searcher relations um one of the areas I think of interesting research would be sort of Searcher Builder communication before blocks to basically allow negotiation between various actors and you know move stuff around a buddy of mine is doing a business called primav that's basically trying to build exactly this and one of the things we hear from Talking other Searchers is the lack of information that they have to deal with creates a lot of inefficiency so theoretically with a better information sharing which again has its own risks associated with it you could get more efficient use of block space do you think Searchers would be happy for you to sell their data to other searches that's the that's the trick though isn't it is the uh is the sharing of what information you have what block you have but like a very simple example would be we have a block that's worth one each uh in our relay and uh or in our Builder and URI has a block that's worth 1.5 each we know we're going to lose the block but we have transactions that we want to make sure get in so we say hey URI can you include these for us right and there could be a negotiation about that relatively rapidly so he still wins the block that he was going to win and we can still offer certain guarantees for instance right and I'm not saying this is something we are likely to do I'm just saying that that seems like a useful model where the sort of pre-consensus the network can agree on well they're probably going to win the block so then that's all worked together to make sure it's the most efficient use of block space do you think I would like Drive Builders towards order flow parity where I guess you compete on merging as the the next Edge why wouldn't search results just do this themselves like I think I don't care who executes between these people because anyone Searcher doesn't know again this is not me I'm just something I'm aware of um uh any one Searcher doesn't have sufficient information to decision appropriately right it's a collective information problem and so the problem is by participating you reveal some information but in return you can be much more efficient and so there's a frontier here that you could go through so net net is this feels to me at least like partial block building is a pretty interesting Avenue to go down and Max has something to say about I just wanted to jump in on this subsidization point I think it's a it's really a question of degree so I'd actually like to ask everybody on the panel could you guys put your hand up if your Builder has ever subsidized blocks or plants to subsize blocks in the future if what I have you ever subsidized a block so like you guys are all doing it just question of whether you will do it to a degree that's uh potentially really harmful to the network and I think just to touch on Yuri's Point censorship resistance is not just about you know a state actor coming in it's not about you know keeping Al Qaeda from trading on chain it's it can be about like stopping an option from being executed or something like that so it can really be about stopping bids from coming in an auction as well and so if you had a lot of control 60 or even 100 for like a one hour period you could use that to really manipulate certain financial markets and make a lot of money from it in practice most subsidization occurs in an environment where the order flow is like relatively equal so like all the builders have the same order flow and they're just like competing to to pay the most to get the block essentially uh if you were to like do something malicious and profit from it why would you call that a subsidy and not like the like the gas you are willing to pay for this transaction oh through my phone I would say like for for like you might just subsidize right just so that you can kind of control that marginal transaction getting in and then you know because you're subsidizing already it's like not an additional cost that you're paying yeah and also I mean I think subsidization the reason you guys probably do it is because it helps you get order flow right so if you were the only block builder for a day that would give you a lot of order flow like say you're some random Builder doesn't build any blocks then all of a sudden you want to do a marketing stunt build every block for the whole day all of a sudden you're on the radar you're going to get a lot of order flow if we were building the the all the blocks for one day though I imagine that we would still be including all the transactions that we get we'd just be like paying over the top to to get all the blocks I mean otherwise it's going to cost hundreds of eighth so I'm not I guess I'd argue that we still wouldn't be censoring anyone so right now most sex decks Arbitrage on chain is simple Arbitrage right not not complex but like say Citadel search trading on chain a lot right Citadel has proprietary Alphas they spend a ton of money on them like closely guarded they don't even want people seeing them right because that might influence sex trading as well is is there any reason Citadel would use neutral block Builders instead of is using Citadel Builder yeah my thinking would be it is much harder to bootstrap like a block Builder and is getting much harder as the market materials so it's not simply just whipping up some infrastructure even if you have the highest performing like technology hft whatever um you you actually need to bootstrap a Marketplace and with the the way that the market is developing and the additional things that Builders are going to have to do in order to stay relevant that's just becoming a harder and harder so it's becoming more of a platform than just like a technology and piece that you just run if I were Citadel I'd just buy somebody are you offering we had this conversation yesterday at PBS Salon um but I think this is a risk we should consider it's like you have outside people who have Deep Pockets and no expertise you have poor economics but a whole bunch of folks here and you know these entities are not just going to roll under a rock and go away they're going to try to sell their assets and so again I think this at the end of the day like the the nature of the incentives should be healthy or it creates negative outcomes and so I think we have work to do here building has changed a lot since the merge um where do you guys think it'll be a year from now my prediction and hope is that merging will become a more important edge and a lot of these games around order flow and exclusivity will become less relevant we can compete on things that are actually driving efficiency yeah my take would also be like I've said already that Builders will have to do a lot more things than just block building especially if you're neutral also with things like intense account abstraction running a bundler solving like lots of other things that Builders are well positioned for and I think most builders that are going to survive long term will have to do that I think additional pieces in the landscape will shape out um thing I'm working on and like I've totally random just heard that somebody else is working on something similar like additional Services pre-confirmation instant free confirmation these are stuff that don't exist in the Mev auction but it's gonna okay comes with it if you think about like partial block building you could imagine a block a proposer like selling instant confirmation or something like that also censorship resistance but I think more than anything things will also shape around block not only new services from block Builder but also different pieces being added to the system around it I think build a reputation will matter a lot I mean we had the survey before about what percentage of transactions will be private and I think the room sort of said approaching 50 percent well private transactions you got to select who you send to it's an area that we are working actually quite hard on is simplifying all of this but at the end of the day those entities that have access to private transactions will be more competitive and you have increasing complexity and increase increasing privacy it gets it's technically gnarly is I think the proper term uh I kind of think that would be more like maybe not like everyone will be a search available I think there would be a lot more actors in the space who have like Leverage who have some like economy of scale and they'll kind of try to do more things themselves I think it'll probably be like a little bit more diverse than just searches but um I think it's like the trend it would also be professionalized where if you don't have a deep if you don't have Deep Pockets you can't build and that's again another thing to consider I think we have one more question from the audience and we'll have to move to the next panel um thank you for the extremely interesting conversation um I wonder how do you guys see the Builder Discovery process evolving in the next one and five years compared to today's ad hoc Discovery based on reputation or dashboards and so on I don't think it's going to change I think reputation is going to matter even more and so it's branding almost we talk a lot about the relevancy bar if you're above relevant you get order flow and then you can be competitive and if you're below relevant then you can't be I think the question is where is that bar and how hard is that bar to achieve I agree nothing to have done that maybe a bonus question make it good and so as Builders you are incentivized let's say two two Builders each have an edge or incentivized to collaborate right so how do you think a collaboration between Builders could work what's keeping the system decentralized and like keeping your profit to each other yeah I think it'd be good to have like an approach like that where people have a comparative advantage in one thing and they work together I think that's a great approach have you guys considered like paying less in base fee just for fun I think it's also but now that you say it I I think it's also like kind of a risky thing to think about because like at the end of the day this is probably some form of Market manipulation and you don't really want to like step in that direction like you like in the market you can't like collude with your with with other people in the market as as somebody who doesn't do C5 Arbitrage when people ask me about that about specifically about like well manipulating the base we think that a good way to make money I think that because C5 D5 Arbitrage keep a lot of the money to themselves and it doesn't reach to the validator the current business is good enough let's not check the boat kind of thing it's kind of like like do we want to if they weren't making money C55 Arbitrage in general then we would see more of that they probably have a good enough business so it's kind of like okay it's let's not change anything it's working right now similar to how like validators make a lot of money okay let's not like this works it pays a lot of money let's keep it as is how do you think the Builder landscape changes once profits from c5d for are internalized to LPS are they I'm sorry in the future if they are yeah if they are how does that change the the Builder landscape so that goes through the question of kind of cooking there's money on the table then Mev came around okay that obviously validator take all the money and I was like well no now users auction okay we're going to try to capture some of the money how many so now it's this like tug of war being pulled in all directions I don't even know what it's gonna like as I'd rather not be in the sucker group I've got a all of a sudden yes all the pieces try to figure out where they extract value and it will be summer depending on their power I I think all right unfortunately we gotta wrap up the panel here so thank you so much to the panelists [Applause]
