all right all right all right so we have the order flow panel now starting I don't wanna you know share too much information or get two people too excited so for this panel I think we have a really exciting set of individuals on here I think last time I wrote a dashboard that I looked at a dashboard that said okay where do all the transactions on ethereum look like you know there was about a good chunk of it came from uniswap another good chunk of it came from metamask and a good chunk of it came from cow swap and I think all-encompassing including including one inch we covered about like 95 percent of all the transaction flow that hits ethereum and so I'm really excited that today we have all of the uh culprits for uh for that uh that order flow here on the panel together and we can Grill them a little bit so I'll hand out this mic everyone can grab a mic and then we can we can get started we're just doing intros uh no I'll do the intro for you okay so I think it'll be faster that way so we have Robert um who's had a product over at uh at flashbot Didier who's working over at the consensus looking at across all the different product Suites that they have um we have Anton from uh from one inch Felix from uh Cal Swap and Med blocker and Teo from uh from uniswap um so I sort of primed this by saying you know these guys have a lot of the activity that ends up hitting um that ends up hitting ethereum I think one of the questions that we've been asking and talking about regarding order flow over the course of the last year has been sort of ringing the drum or or hitting the drum about the the dangers of uh of exclusive order flow and I think one of the things that I want to bring up and sort of have as a starting point for conversation is the fact that basically every single participant on this panel now has some kind of private order flow solution where they're exclusively routing order flow to a subset of of Market participants as opposed to routing it to the the public transaction pool and I think a lot of this is often done under the guise of you know protecting the users so what I want to start with is the question of how much of this is protecting the users versus creating some systemic risk to the ecosystem how do you make the decision of do you should you route privately or should it be routed uh publicly let's start that as a discussion point I will say I really want the entire group to be involved here I want to move sort of directly into uh q a questions and so I will let the conversation flow fluidly I'll only jump in and add additional conversation when uh it dies down so yeah without further Ado how would you tackle that question I think so you you friend the question as how much of it is protecting the users versus creating systemic risk and it's sort of a or uh A or B but I think it's a and b to be frank I think it it is clear that there are reasons why you would route your transaction flow your intent flow or whatever you know form it takes to a private mempool you know culprit number one here with flashbots protect uh you don't want to be front run in the public mempool maybe you get an Mev Kickback something like this or best execution and at the same time I think the the nuances is that we need to provide these Solutions with a clear path to how we can make them more permissionless and not rely on any set of entrenched actors like you're saying and I think if we can get to that place the risk that is systemic uh becomes much less and that's why for all of flashbots products we try to make them permissionless for all Market actors and I think that that was a small other Nuance as a part of the intro that you gave so users can choose where they send their order flow when they use flashpot to protect what Builders you send to and any of the order flow that goes through our Mev shared node is permissionless to search on for anyone in the world as well so I think it's a and b you know we do want to protect users we want to give them these benefits I think private private mempools are going to come up and we still want to address that long-term systemic risk as well I I think the systemic risk more so than the private mempool is is actually the um Mev prone application design that we you know developed and used on chain today um and you know uni swap you know is just you know one of the the biggest examples here where um yeah x times y equals K is a great mechanism for Price Discovery for long tail tokens um has a bunch of really really cool advantages but also comes with a drawback that it's um substantially prone to front running and ordering attacks and basically well we think that the the benefits outweigh the the drawbacks but but these drawbacks need to be addressed on some level as well right and so that's where the private mempool comes in it's not a solution that we see as the long-term you know way to handle Mev on ethereum we think we need better Dex designs we need better swap mechanisms that are not substantially prone to these type of attacks but until we get there and until we can convince all the people not just in this room but in the community that they shouldn't be using the private the public man pool with uh kind of Mev Floor Designs we need easy to use easy to understand easy to adopt Solutions and I think that's where math blocker that's where I'm also now with unisopex one in Fusion Cloud swap of course comes comes in as a as an attempt to you know well cover up some of the the the the mechanism flaws that we've developed over the last years yeah I think there's a there's a massive timing question in all of this uh the way you are protecting users over the past year is not the way you're gonna protect user um this coming year or even three years or five years from now so I think we you know it's about being practical there's an end state that we all wish for um but on the path from here to the Sun State there will be different iterations today actually we can say the space even the med supply chain space is very early right like there's so many Innovations in all sorts of directions and I think as a wallet for example you would want to leverage all those Innovations um while being quite practical about it in the short term so that you get the best outcome for the user but we also work towards the the end state uh I would say that it's very interesting how we saw that since Arbitrage opportunities uh like really uh created in 2016-2017 we saw like a huge evolution of order flow and initially we thought that protocols should protect users Traders from this Mev but from what we can see now that it's not uh it's not possible to be solved on protocol level I mean there's no any way that all those dexes protocols would uh include kind of protection from this we should wait until uh ethereum or any other chain layer 1 consensus will change and process mempool differently protected somehow from from trans backgrounds and anything or we also can see that Evolution ended up that three major platforms like one inch cow swap uni swap they changed their mind recently they changed the order flow so all those platforms decided that it's not it's not possible that every user will protect itself because users use different software different wallets different apps and it's so hard for them to protect themselves and it's much easier to put this order flow on a professional fillers as uni swap call them resolvers as one inch call them or solvers as a cow swap call them so it's much less participants like tens or hundreds of participants who who are professional and can protect users from all these risks and now we're here but I believe that we will probably see any kind of protection on consensus on layer one layer I'll just add to that that I I think it's important to have a degree of perspective here as well right um you know ultimately all these systems are still uh non-custodial all trades saffron chain it's not that much that can really go wrong um by hosting sort of order dissemination uh infrastructure of chain sure I think it's important to have a roadmap to a slightly more um decentralized uh state but of all the mechanisms within the uh order stack to have slightly more centralized I think yeah order dissemination is is um probably okay for now maybe a a question for the room so I think a lot of the trends that we're seeing is pulling some of this execution logic from onchang to being off chain relying on some counterparties to do this execution do the validation and sort of have like pre-inclusion guarantees um the struggle there is that it involves some level of trust you need to have some relationship with this counterparty is to make sure that they're operating in a way that um that's in line with sort of your expectations and I think a lot of the you know the questions that you guys are spending time on is how do we make sure that these counterparties are behaving in the way that we expect them to behave um so I have maybe like a two-sided question on the one hand I want to I want to hear sort of from the room when when you hear about this like design problem what do you think are the key concerns in both having uh uh sort of these you know these Aggregates aggregators of order flow be policing who the um who the the counterparties are allowed to participate in their game are like what sort of comes to mind as as some issues in in designing systems in this way um and then also for you guys the question and I want to lead into is how do you go about identifying these counterparties and making sure that they're sort of Behaving within the parameters of your protocol um I saw one hand over there uh let's see if uh if we can toss the mic down so the first concern that comes to my mind because I'm a lawyer is that when you have those centralized or semi-centralized intermediaries they look like intermediaries also under for example yumika and they may be classified as so for example service providers who provide reception transmission of orders or service providers that provide execution of orders and there is a lot of requirements uh basically you have to become a financial institution almost to be to provide that right and you may hope oh yeah we'll do reverse solicitation to you no you won't it's an exception it's not going to work so so that's so I think this is an underappreciated problem um for for going this way right so if you go away from decentralization so so but of course there are concerns there that can be addressed and there are conversations with Regulators that can be had successfully I think but for that you need answers to how do I Benchmark best execution for example right if you want to compare yourself I'm better than Trad fire or I'm safe I'm I'm trusted so you need to have answers okay so best execution now and then the question is so is best execution can it be best execution Cal swap best execution on one inch or best execution across all D5 or do you Benchmark yourself against binance right so I don't think anyone has an has like a legal answer to that but uh these are the sort of questions that you will need answers for and quite quickly any response to that the regulatory friendly concerns that introduces any regulator is in the room put your hand up to defer to our legal team so I mean one one question that that this does bring up is the idea of like best execution and how do you guarantee that um you know one way to constrain what the counterparties can do is to say you need to beat a certain threshold um so what's the right way to sort of Define actually what's the best execution that you need to be able to beat everyone has sort of this problem when they're initiating transactions I believe uni swap X would agree that Dutch auctions probably one of the key solutions to the best execution because it's like um Arbitrage Traders competition would make it better for the user yeah I would I would agree then is that true is that true when even in highly volatile conditions or for long tail tokens or yeah I think it's all relative right but the important part is creating this competitive environment on an autobio order basis uh but I agree with the the member of the audience here which is that defining best execution in crypto markets is really this non-trivial problem right um because you do have these synchronicity issues between uh blockchain-based markets and centralized exchanges um not everybody has access to the same flow um the way that we sort of think about best execution in the context of uniswap X or execution that um we're happy with is using um a combination of unisol V2 and unusual V3 as as a benchmark right and we try and give swappers users some price improvement over that Benchmark and then we we guarantee that sort of the the lowest price that they're going to get the the ending price of the auction uh will um be the unisol b2v3 aggregate price you talked about giving users the best value for the transactions it's not a thousand transactions transactions that is sold by I mean it's one of the problems that ofas are meant to be solving if you direct you know further flow to them but obviously it's an early it's early and not everyone is able to capture that value but you can expect that that would be a natural evolution of the system to capture that quality value of transactions I mean I think actually this is part of the answer to Stefan's question of that that sparked this discussion is how do you ensure trust and I think the repetitive nature of your interactions as a protocol like cow swap or math blocker or one Android uni swap is that you have these repetitive interactions and for example on map Blocker we can talk about how we you know build trust with the block builders that that we route our traffic towards and it's by you know assuming good intent monitoring them observing them and then when they misbehave they get cut off from the order flow and will have to you know pay a penalty to get relisted and the demand from builders that get cut off from that order flow is huge like the value of the you know five percent of transaction volume that that math blocker is processing is is very very large and so that repetitive value to me can be used to assume or ensure some of the trust that we talked about I first responded perspective I want to just also talk about best price here because I think we take quite a different approach to one inch fusion and uni swap X in that we don't want to Upper bound the value or the best price that a user can get basically if there's a price swing block to block that goes beyond your unit swap as or your your one inch Fusion Dutch curve we still want solvers to bid that price and there's no kind of ABS limited upside for the user what the best price can be on the downside what we enforce is what we call ebbo ethereum best bit and offer it's similar to the nbbo on on lit exchanges we basically look at the well-known Baseline liquidity accounting uni swap balancer Sushi swap we should probably also add curve but at this stage but basically what is the price that you would have been getting on like the lit amms that is kind of the the Baseline but then you know the sky is the limit if prices if a solver can improved prices by more than you know the curve dictates then by all means they should get priority to access your flow and and all that value should flow back to the user are we like sort of shooting ourselves in the foot with this concept of ebbo right like on the previous panel we talked about how LPS are just losing a ton of money to lvr and toxic flow and they always have sort of outdated prices but then we're also benchmarking you know what good quality price execution is based off of all of these LPS in these pools so we're almost saying okay here are market makers you know you can come in and like join the system and provide some uh some some liquidity The Benchmark that you have to beat is all these uninformed Traders are providing liquidity in this open market they're sending toxic flow towards already how does this sort of make sure that the users have the best price if you know you're relying both on the market maker for setting the price and for improving it upon that that set price right so it's it's a lower bound right it's like actually the second line of defense that the user has when they trade on cost of the first line of defense which is always guaranteed is the limit price that you put in your order second line of defense is ebbo getting the best price that is visible on chain which of course is maybe not you know the the the the absolute best price that can be achieved but um looking at you know traditional Finance nbbo is also not the greatest Price you can achieve Dark Woods usually give you a better price on and like in wholesalers can give you better price execution than what you can find on the lead exchanges yet it is you know what defines price Improvement what defines kind of you know if you do better if you do worse than that then it's a pretty clear sign something is off um and the the real the Holy Grail of you know what is the best price is the off chain competition and and basically I'm sure there's like centralized aspects of to it now but at the end of the day how I see the centralized or this this decentralized competition is just a consensus for data availability what were the bids in the auction that were proposed by a certain point in time that was you know enough to be considered valid for the competition and if there's consensus around that it's very clear which solver in a way um had the right to execute and if they misbehave then well in Kelso's case there's uh there's a bond that can be slashed um I think there's different yeah different different Protocols of different models on how to enforce that trust but to me that is the um you know unlimited upside for the user best price um off chain guarantee with some um you know more layers of Defense on chain seems like a you know given the current status quo a good uh good solution I I would agree on that but there is one thing which is really hard to compare since uh more than one orders are being budget together with each other it's hard to compare uh which of proposals of solvers is better for example if we have two or three users orders which uh so they're gonna feel in one transaction we can compare them directly because it's not one number it's three number it's three different prices which each of the user would get and I'm not sure if if there is like any kind of truly sustainable and decentralized solution to find which offer is better like it could give a better rate for one user or for other user and we can be sure that one of these users is not related to this uh solver also so it's it's hard problem right I think I'm not an economist actual Economist was on the panel before but um like just in economic theory there's this concept of a equilibrium prices in like a perfect economy where demand and Supply matches um and what we are talking about in calsup with multi-dimensional batch auctions we're looking at a barter economy and so the the Holy Grail of of you know what a Optimist solution would look like is is a competitive equilibrium or I think where Raj and equilibrium how it's called sometimes as well the you know the the reality of the mechanism today is that we're trying to approximate this by maximizing Surplus which has the drawbacks that you mentioned and we're you know actively working on uh finding ways to to approximate these equilibriums in more in more exact ways um but yeah I mean that is uh that is an ongoing challenge so I think in general I agree that all of the sort of metrics that we've talked about are flawed in some way and the best that we can do is try to have a maximally competitive market and I think what what stance that we've taken the approach that we've taken with flashbot to protect with Mev share has been having permissionless execution against users flow so anyone in the world can go to mav.share.flashpots.net go and look at the transactions that are coming through flashbots protect see them try to search behind them and we think that this permissionless kind of execution on users transactions is going to maximize competition in the long run and give users the best price what we're really trying to build towards also is and what I think the Holy Grail here is is having some sort of crypto and economic guarantee for any given trade that you can point to that says the user here got the absolute best price possible I think that kind of guarantee is what is going to make crypto stand out from traditional finance and that kind of guarantee is I think how we win in the long term so you need to have a proof of best execution or proof of best price something like that what does that look like uh I don't know why don't you help me find it Stefan um on uh the proof of best execution I feel like that isn't possible on chain insofar as the Builder is the only position uh the only one positioned in the supply chain to be able to provide that guarantee because a lot of the problem of providing optimal execution is looking at incoming mental transactions and accounting for the private flow on top of that right and so if you're bound by the access to Purina mempo which a lot of them aren't already you can't even guarantee that so you could only give that guarantee after the execution is finished and you've seen all of the other transactions that have been included yeah but I think this assumes that there isn't some way to define a strategy that executes at the time of building a block also that has access to both mempool transactions and private transactions and I think if you get into a more expressive way of searching on transactions and building blocks like we're trying to do with Suave then I think you can absolutely do that and like take in all that information at block billing time and provide Kickbacks to user with that but we're not there today to your point what role does payment for order flow have to play on top of this it's something that there's rumors that exists and people are paying for it or flow and approaching people and making deals is this something we've seen in practice is it a mechanism I should be in trying if so why not you know or is order by order basis really the only way to look at things I think it is something that's happening in practice I think all of us have heard either some of some rumors or some concrete instances of exclusive order flow deals that exist out there in the market I think what we should be aiming for in the broadest terms or the lowest barriers of entry with the maximum amount of competition possible you know I'm open-minded whether that happens on an order per order basis or some other like time frame uh I haven't seen super compelling models for how you have a longer time frame that you know keep barriers to entry as low as possible but if people have those kind of designs that I'm open-minded I think paying for high quality access to mempool transactions is very different than going to a wallet and saying hey you're going to exclusively send to Nathan and only Nathan I didn't hear the question who should decide where the flow goes so should the user decide where your transactions go or should it be down to the wallet on the IFA or somebody else yeah good question I think it depends um you're gonna have very sophisticated users will know exactly how to execute their transaction the best possible way we might want to make their decision themselves with their own user preferences and then you can have people who need a curated experience something a little bit more abstracted and where the the wallet hopefully can help them make the the best choices and direct the transaction in the best way to optimize outcomes have we seen an experience where like the user really picks where the order flow goes yet were you picking your RPC endpoint is in a way so yes it does exist I suppose people who use Mev blocker some of them have do it from a wallet right so yeah and but I would actually say that we with MF blocker followed a slightly different philosophy that you know we we believe users should have complete control and and you know offer a variety of different flavors of the endpoint there's a no revert endpoint there's a fully private endpoint where none of your flow gets shared and then there's the default endpoint which shares backgrounding opportunity without the signature and but we believe that really the importance is to give users sensible defaults that are protecting them and that are secure and I think in that sense that would say that's one of the design philosophies that math blocker differentiates from math share for example where um I understand that you know it's really up to the user to fully specify their preference of um you know Builder selection of information leakage and and all these things which we see in practice not happening and and we think giving the the user sensible defaults and then running with that has has has been working um quite well and so I would love for every user to decide what they what they do with their order flow but the reality we see it with cow soup as well the reality is you know wallets have the control and I think also the responsibility to act in the best interest of their users and give them sensible defaults I think one of the challenges with that is that we're still iterating towards what I think makes sense as sensible defaults and I think you know all of us agree that we should do that but uh taking a data-driven approach and iterating towards that I think is what makes most sense at this time and we might be a little bit more conservative with where we share our order flow as an example but a user should be empowered to choose to send to you know our friends the hft builders if they would like and I would love to see you know Med blocker allow users that range of preferences on where they send their order flow right now let me raise one more issue here that I'm not sure what would happen and how much is sustainable is this way but what if everyone will start using math blockers flash boards for preventing from trans backgrounds on their transactions it seems like problem will not disappear problem will move to another slice you know it will be solved differently it's I'm not sure but there is a chance that these systems will start working on top of own mempools at some point in time just imagine no one is using ethereum mempool everyone is using like private mempo so we can't solve this problem this way I mean it solves this problem for those who use it but if everyone is going to use it we need another solution I believe well then you sell access to the private member to the top bidders right and then probably so I cannot follow up on the sensible defaults very quickly you talked about sensible defaults uh surely that you know implies an opinion about what you think something sensible is too sensible defaults opening up to regulatory risk you were asking for examples of sensible default sorry identity yeah so so if you're putting forward sensible defaults uh you're having an opinion about what something sensible is so at that point right are you opening yourself up to regulatory risk oh I mean I can't comment on the regular on the regulatory risk did you want to have an example of a sensible default or or just there was just a comment on we should look into the regulatory risks yeah so a sensible D4 would be no from thinking right so we say you can't front run on you know on this endpoint and that's like a sensible default so if all of a sudden you're saying okay no front running on our default uh endpoint and you do allow front running on another endpoint does that open you up to like you know a problem from you know opening up to regulators okay I don't I don't know I think I think the problem is sensible default you need to educate them by data but I wanted to come back on the payment for order question because there's maybe one area where it sort of makes sense maybe as a short-term uh tactical solution it's the access to to an OFA for example you might have Searchers who participate in RFA exploit the information in the malicious way of system for example and um if you you know and you could have permissioning system and gatekeeping but one other way of doing it gatekeeping is maybe to allow people to um participate for set set number of blocks or set period of time and pay for it right and that's a way to that could be a tactical way to to solve some of those problems sorry I just want to add that I feel like um again we can't really let perfect be the enemy of the good here I think um there's there's some degree of consensus that auctions are just a good way of getting better execution what best execution is I think um frankly most users don't actually care about all that much they otherwise they wouldn't be trading on uh decentralized exchanges to begin with uh and and it's a problem that we can we can like we we should um you know spend time thinking about and and try and solve over time but uh but again it's not sort of um overwhelmingly important to solve today I think one of the more interesting um design questions in The Opening space right now is is this one around um order privacy and um I think flash routes are taking a really interesting and perhaps um conservative approach here um you know it's something that we spend a lot of time thinking about in the context of you know swap X orders so right now we don't reveal um users addresses but we do reveal uh the uh pair and Order size um these are also uh you know the more information that uh these RFA participants these fillers have available uh the more potential they have to uh front room front run those orders so there's there's a degree of information leakage there at the same time information leakage is uh important in order to understand whether you're being adversely selected or not to um continuing to sort of monitor uh this uh privacy versus price Improvement trade-off which I do think is a bit of a binary one um is is going to be quite interesting over time and while we're at this topic I just want to I'm curious to see a show off hands because uh while we were talking about the mechanism for unisoft X we did think a lot about should we do more batched uh way of routing or should we just do one by one I think uh dog I don't know if a dog is still here but if you mentioned this potential Dynamic of uh kind of winners curse in in a order by order auction scenario so um I do want to see if if you think you know like uh sort of payment order flow or auction on a batch basis is better than order by order auction raise your hand you'd think it's worse raise your hand so most people just don't have a do you think both are necessary raise your hand how do you do both I think uh I mean I won't leak all the secret sauce but um I think it has something to do with the way that dizzier was talking about permissioning access to an auction um and so it's not just that you have anyone that's able to participate in the auction you know you can have an auction that's be permissionless to uh to access while still requiring sort of payment for seat at the table to bid on it and then you have a mix of both in that scenario auction on auctions I think one philosophical belief that I have is that we should be trying to do net new things net new mechanisms that have a potential to be better than what exists already and I think we've seen payment for order flow in the traditional Financial system I think there's a possibility that we can do better and I think we should strive towards that I think there's a large unexplored design space particularly with privacy here so we're talking about privacy in the context of people having information or not but as an example I think we have not yet explored what it looks like for a search or to co-locate their bot inside of a private environment where you have access to the user's transaction there but not outside of it and you restrict what the Searcher can do inside of that private environment so you can't front run you can't you know trade outside of certain parameters and something like that so I think there's a large space for us to iterate and to try to do better than payment for order flow to try to do better than traditional finance and you know maybe we'll fail and we'll fall back to the status quo and traditional finance and that's fine but I sort of my philosophical bent is that we have to drive to do more and strive to try to iterate and have better mechanisms I was actually interested in the uni stock decision to hide some of the information I think it's it's somewhere aligned with the fundamental difference also of a map blocker and math share around information sharing I think we um we generally take a more um open approach and then try to use um you know artificial um order flow and other things to like you know basically confuse the what is what is right and what is what is what is real and what is not real order Flow versus I'm trying to limit very much the amount of information we do share I think you know the flashbots dashboard doesn't contain um much of the the the bundle like which bundles are actually being background but I would assume that um because of this approach MAV blocker actually has it's a given significantly more search Integrations and and and at least today um refunds than than refshare and I were just wondering for for uni swap if you guys had done you know analyzes actually looking at you know for market makers that of course if they see who is the counterparty like vitalik is trading then you know of course you want to be on the other side of the trade it's like the least toxic feeling could get versus if you don't know this information yeah you you might you know you might be more reluctant so I wonder like if have you have you actually Quantified this trade-off and is this something that's more like a gut feeling Intuition or like uh found on research and yeah I think we were basically guessing um and uh and again I like um the problem is that this this information leakage uh especially so if you think about like uh the uniform Labs web interface the median trade size there is you know on the order of three to five hundred dollars at a time right so if um those orders are being um front run uh it's going to be very difficult to identify them in um you know the data right like really it just looks like noise um so yeah we we frankly you know there's various different parameters that you can decide to obfuscate one then being addressed one then being order size um pair Direction those kinds of things uh we started with address and we're very open to parameterizing this over time um as like more research comes to the table um but uh yeah we're also conscious of the fact that um these fillers that we're working with do need a degree of uh order information in order to provide uh price Improvement right I think for a little bit of color on our design decisions around privacy and an interesting place of uh touch off for discussion with Felix in particular is that you know when flashbots was operating a relay in the proof of work days we were sending bundles and clear text to Miners and what we found was is that miners wouldn't always treat those the way that we expected them to there's all sorts of misbehavior that happened and it in general just takes a lot of time and investment and resources to identify when someone actually misbehaving the system and sometimes you don't know because these are you know systems you make assumptions in synchrony and you don't know if someone saw a bundle and you're like not exactly sure why a transaction went ahead of someone and in thinking about how we designed our order flow auction we didn't want to have a system where we were playing a cat and mouse game with Searchers where you know we actually considered the same exact design from a blocker as an example where you kind of randomize transactions throw it out into the world you kind of try to confuse people but we thought it ended up resolving down into us trying to randomize parameters someone figuring it out they're not iterating on it going investigating okay is anyone has anyone figured out this system or not iterating on again and we're trying to build a game where we don't need to do that kind of policing where we don't need to constantly have the human resources in the system to know that it is working correctly um that's like one reason why we are further on the Privacy end of the spectrum as opposed to randomization or something like that yeah and I mean in a way I see this as the value add of math blocker right like we um take on the kind of you know the the this you know curation this investigation like basically we make sure that sensible defaults are set for the user and you have the best experience you have all the Searchers integrated you have um most of the block Builders um online and so basically you know looking forward to you know the research that's what's doing is amazing and very interesting on that front as well and you know right now we think that uh by offering this service in this value add uh we can give a better experience to to to the user in today's reality but yeah I mean this is where the two products differ in you know real it's good to also compete my personal belief here is that um again if you think about the the median uniform Labs interface user they just don't have and and this is why um uh you know fillers want to participate in the Universe X ecosystem um they just don't actually have that much um valuable information uh to the point where it's even worse sort of um you know front running or um uh yeah training basically trading ahead of that orders um which is why I I sort of again personally defer more on the side of uh sharing as much information as possible because I think that's going to translate to um optimized price Improvement and just maybe just one word here because um we've actually at cow so I've also been looking um you know working very closely together with Taos or other decentralized institutions just that for which is just very difficult to be private even if we had perfect trusted enclaves just because they have a voting process their their thought process is kind of public and we believe that if there's any doubt of your intent being absolutely private then probably the best thing you can do is to make it as public as possible and create kind of this you know tomorrow at 12 a.m I'm going to make this trade and please solvers resolvers fillers line up and and and try to give me the best price possible and so yeah if we cannot guarantee full privacy then maybe you know opting in for like extreme publicity and making sure that we have this visibility for everyone and and try to make competition as frictionless and easy to access as possible is probably the the best approach so so I think having it as much data as possible so that you can analyze and identify problems after all the facts and you know identify outcomes behaviors um and iterate over time really all right sorry I just find that I do think the equation does change materially when you're dealing with you know 50 million orders versus 300 orders but um yeah so I'll make uh I'll make a prediction I unfortunately we're at time but I think we're sitting in somewhere today on ethereum where like I don't know how much what percentage of transactions are are private but and never hit the mempool would you guys say 10 about 10 percent 15 percent um is it Matt in the back that says 15 . so uh show of hands a year from now and I want the room to be engaged in this again um will there be less than 20 percent of transactions uh that are uh that are private uh if you believe that there's less than 20 put your hand up if you believe that there's 20 to 50 percent of the transactions are going to be uh private put your hand up if you present if you believe that there's going to be 50 to 80 percent put your hand up and then if you believe that there's gonna be 80 plus you can put your hand up are you gonna fund the prediction market for this all right let's uh let's find out a year from now which one uh which one is right thank you panelists
