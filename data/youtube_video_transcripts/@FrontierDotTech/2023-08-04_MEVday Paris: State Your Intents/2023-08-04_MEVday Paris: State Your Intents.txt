uh hello hello everybody uh welcome to the last panel of this session about intense every week There's a new Twitter Thread about intents still there's one in my drafts as well still we do not know what intents are and what they're used for so let's kind of explore in this panel uh I would like from the panel to basically go by order introduce themselves and just Define or explain to the audience what do they mean by intense uh yeah Chris Christopher if you can go forward thanks I'm Chris I work on anoma which is sort of an intense Centric architecture as we understand it uh to us or I mean I think the sense in which like language of course is this decentralized coordination system and no one gets to pick the one true definition of intent I think the sense in which we've seen intent is a like coordinating concept so far is uh as something like an intent is a credible commitment to a preference function over the state of a particular system and the system in question is can be defined very differently so when you define the system is like the ethereum main chain then you could have intense referencing State on the ethereum main chain when you define the system as like the whole sort of roll-up ecosystem that your intent could reference any state on a roll-up when you define the system is like you know I don't know what Google has indexed then your intent can uh you know is something you type in Google search bar and searches over whatever is indexed uh you know to us intents also include uh information about who knows what so information flow control this is what we've spent a lot of time working on um and you know we hope to be able to kind of to provide that to the ecosystem at Large yeah so I'm Simon a CTO at Central so when we think about intents I guess um a user sits down to interact with the blockchain with an idea of what it is that they want to accomplish and they're then expected to approximate the execution Trace that that is going to lead to what they want and the reason that Mev exists and that you're all here is that there is a gap between those two things so it just makes good sense if there's a mechanism for the user to express what it is they want to achieve directly and then repurpose the the Searcher Network as a solver Network to to to achieve that so yeah um yeah we at essential I guess we we are we want to accelerate that transition from sort of value extraction to intent satisfaction testing testing hi I'm Vlad zamfir I'm a troll but everything I say usually take as a serious test um however um I I think like what intents are and what your intents are is like Forbidden Knowledge that's like forbidden for very good reason it's been to your subconscious you can't even know about it and that's for your own safety because if you did other people would use it in disputes against you to wreck you so you're intense you don't know them no one knows what intents are they're secret they're forbidden to know for everyone's safety then when you say about a tense what you're talking about is your conscious intent and those are the things that you willingly let up for the purposes of disputes for other people to use against you in this dance that is the law and so intents are what we call conscious what what we call Intense or conscious intents that we're willingly putting up in order to make a fair game for people to extract as much value from us as they can out of our insecurity and that's just fair that's just just so you know will I tell you my intents no that would be insecure and I wouldn't make mind security your insecurity and that's like my basic Duty thank you okay um uh I'm Philip um I work with 20 squares we are doing economic auditing and for that purpose we have developed internal tooling that together now with the ethereum foundation we are basically developing a modeling framework that you can use intense fit in because that framework the main purpose of it is actually looking at the intersection and the kind of the connections between the mechanisms and different models and intense when they come as an as an input basically will affect the value chain and the question is how does it you know how does it spread through what are the economics of intents coming about what tendency of centralization will come about through them and what will be possible higher order effects thanks I'm Marcus founder of propellerheads and we're solvers and we solve intents and intents are a simple way to think about it the way I think about it is that they are partial transactions where I might not know all the things that need to know to be able to form a transaction like I don't know the best path for my swap I don't know the best time to execute I don't know when price or gas will be low enough so I still want to though execute that intent and publish it so that someone else who might know this information can help me out and that is really what enables intents to allow me to express a lot more than I can do today because at the moment I'm limited to the things that I can fully Express but with intents I can express things partially and anybody can help me and now or in the future to find that missing part and I agree with um a lot that there is a differentiation between conscious and unconscious intents and expressed that non-expressed intents and I think we can explore that further later yeah I I want to also explore like how are intents different from the current set of transaction types we already have so we have the normal transaction type we have side messages we have these type of off-chain trusted transaction types such as bundles uh how are intents different than what we already have and what new feature sets do they bring to the picture so you can go yeah I mean I think intense in a certain sense are purposefully less specific than transactions so they Define what it would count for uh what it would count for in order for a state transition to be correct without defining exactly how to get there right so on purpose they leave freedom to if we if we think about the data flow of everything right users have intents and users are at the edge of the system right they set the boundary conditions then the information flows Inward and intents allow you to describe exactly how much choice you want to give up and to whom and what choices they can make because that information flows inward you know potentially to optimize things and kind of the landscape of Mev often when you have entities with with different preferences they're using that to extract from you because they have more information at the time they make the decision right so intents kind of allow you to program exactly how much you want to specify about what can you know build on top of your message consume your intent and in that sense I mean you can like you can see these things sort of converging towards one another like smart transactions or partial transactions or these are sort of modifications to the concept or transactions that I think converge towards intents on the other hand I think it's helpful to think about like just the term intent to me conveys this very intuitive thing to people like about oh well someone starts with an intent and then they write down their intent right it's it's explicit or sort of consciously articulated then it's sent to the system and discrete then it's sent to the system and the system along with the Intensive other participants determines like what exactly happens but the intent sets the boundary constraints yeah I think the extent to which a user is sophisticated the sort of intent they would Express resembles more and more the sort of transaction they're capable of expressing so I think the kind uh of user for example that is perfectly capable of setting an appropriate slippage on Unison not getting not getting sandwiched um is probably the kind of user who has well the the extent to which their sophisticated in that respect they um the intent will be close enough an approximation to the transaction as I mentioned before sort of the the less sophisticated the user or the greater the gap between um the what they actually wanted and what they actually stated whether that's just through ignorance of how you know the particular protocol they're working with functions um that's really where the difference arises uh I think it's also uh super interesting and that it sort of enshrines you know what's today we're calling Mev uh like within like as a fundamental kind of first-class actor of a protocol so rather than it being this sort of like weird emergent property um which you sort of then forever are kind of trying to patch or trying to work out exactly what's the appropriate or Fair uh level of value that can be extracted by kind of enshrining it right uh from the get-go you kind of um it becomes a just a part of the the market well thankfully this is like sort of Applied crypto economics so like the market will see who's the more sophisticated based on who makes the most map am I right um and in my opinion the most sophisticated strategy is that you should have zero knowledge about the intents of a transaction it's invariance and the invariance that it validates that have nothing to do with its intents if it has if it's actually if it actually has a non-deterministic strategy that's secure if you have like a secure strategy it's not going to be deterministic it's going to be like a test that like no one can tell what your intentions are and then um you know if they can tell your intentions then sort of you're going to be their breakfast uh and so it's not like your transaction gets closer to your attention it gets closer to the invariance you need to insist so you can make the test that you can do to test the faith and the performance and the security of your adversaries you can we're going to pen test each other it's not like you're going to know my intents when I'm pen testing you you don't know my intent I promise you that like I don't know my intent and like you accept this as zero honest proof that you will never know my intent um because like I like because like this is sort of like how in my opinion like actually secure transacting Game Theory you know response works like you're never gonna have a deterministic invariant of the outcome you have a deterministic and variance they're not your intent they're just how the test works and then you know it's a test you know like what is the intent of a test when I sit on the bridge bridge all day and I throw bait on the bridge to see who eats my troll bait you know you must imagine is happy and you must imagine me happy while I do that but don't you already have this like your intent I mean your real world intent is out in the world it's not you know who cares away Spanish for my conscious mind it's banished from the hive mind it's not there at all it's  banished from the world it's too unsafe is your opinion Vlad that the best way to express an intent essentially is like provide a proof that like your intent has been met so you're like no one knows your intent but they just have like the best way to express an intent is repenting in front of the Lord at Judgment Day like that's the that's the best way and and the only way like everything else is laughs so so do you think that intents are a Wrong Way Forward is that is that what you think no they're there for us to extract mehv out of you got it I mean okay let me so that I think there is a point where we can actually agree um even if the language might be different but there's the question of what is the what is the language you know average users normal users not knowing much will actually face um intents um and at the moment we're talking when we see examples of that they're typically relatively low level I'm not sure users will care about this so there's a question of what will be basically the stack of translations in between not only the stacks there will also be the question of what services need to be provided to make it useful there's the question also you know does this lead to centralization and obviously also that I think ties back to what flood said um do you lose actually total control about what happens to what you state and how do you make sure that this is actually coming back at some level how do we how is this in any kind transparent um these things have to be solved and I'm not sure how they will actually be you know there are some ideas out there but it needs you know a lot of modeling a lot of details are super relevant here basically coming back sort of the original question like what can intend what will intents allow us to do that we can't do today um you know I mean don't let me get me wrong I love lazy evaluation like lazy evaluation is great like partial specifications lazy evaluation is the best don't get me wrong yeah go ahead Marcos um so I think there's a lot of spaces that you can go into having starting with a simple example of what intents allow us to do already today I think council is a really good example where you submit an intent for transaction but there's a lot of unseen information there might be others trading in the other direction and you can have a coincidence want there might be many others trading same direction can batch and can benefit from that all of that would be impossible for you to know ahead of time and also intents allow for much more complex coordination that is very difficult to express in current uis so you have a massive bottleneck blockchains are these wonderful programmable systems where you could actually settle on any agreement and they're limited by the uis that you can build and how fast you can build certain uis with certain use cases but intense I think it can move much faster than the uis will be able to to move and that will allow you to express much more complex transaction types for example multi-party coordination where you have different level actors that agree together to make a particular transaction happen that only is valid when five different parties actually agree on that and it's very difficult to design uis with this kind of thing but on an intent layer it's much more realistic but why not invariance like if you just said invariant you would have no problem with me and you wouldn't be in you know you wouldn't have put yourself in this position where I'm gonna like extract Med from your intents bro you know just call them in variants if you call limit intents and agreements like legally you're gonna get yourself in lawsuits and torts and you'll be liable just call them invariant invalidation use computer science terms don't don't get yourself liable pay attention when the law professor collapse you know I mean are there any audience questions till now I mean is is language Bound by law or is law about by language which expresses which I mean language is the medium of legal argument exactly which means that if we change the definitions of the concepts the laws say different things I mean I'm going to dispute your definitions bro like good luck Let's uh let's revert back to yeah let's revert back maybe Fabrizio has a question uh okay so it's clear to me that up to now given what we heard basically no one has any clue what your tests are I just want to okay I just wanted to know at least do you have any idea about what mathematical instruments would you like to use to study them or to even attempt to give a decent definition or it's just like magic maybe Philip maybe Philip yeah so I mean you know I'm old enough maybe it sounds stupid but these problems of intense you can call it differently they happen also in other domains so the question is for instance if you think about combinatorial auctions same problem comp very complex bidding language needed so you need interfaces to actually specify what exactly you want to do the main question or the main approach there basically is to definitely Define what is needed from the allocation perspective here it would be basically what happens as a transaction on the higher level is the question of what attributes do the user actually care about and honestly um I think in the end this is a thing that has to be experimented about there are some ideas that we you know we saw um but the the idea that the same domain that is relevant for what is the way you created down Downstream is the same that users care about is obviously not I mean there is no I don't think they're really much overlap I guess so we need that language first from a user perspective and see what what demand actually is there for that I'm not sure what people are willing to share for instance right with current proposals do they share information right away it's like 90 10 care I don't know if you don't mind I have a quick thing to add about that um you know in mechanism design there's this idea of a truthful mechanism where you have a the the incentive to reveal your type to the mechanism in some ins or something like that roughly and then and then in like the sort of version that I'm thinking about is like you don't you would never tell anyone your type like that's the most private information that you're going to get Merced for right away what instead you do is you provide like a encrypted blob and then the mechanism does it without knowing anything about your type the point is a classical mechanism design you have typical results that means you can just you know there's a sample mechanism which acquires your private information and you can provide the optimal allocation under certain conditions obviously in many cases like if you're bidding in an auction you will be very unwilling to pit your full Vector of information right I mean because you don't know whether the auctioneer says basically you I'm you know I'm turning the mechanism around and similar problems are here there's also the algorithmic perspective if you're again complex options if you try to you know bid on everything that space is far too complex you need user interfaces that are simple enough people can understand and can be done translated into the actual allocation layer that matters there's an audience audience question as well yeah so um reflecting back on some of the learnings we have from the account as traction space um basically a a bigger like one of the biggest challenges of account extraction standard in ethereum was that fees are like fees of user operations are like um they are conditional upon user operations settling on chain and so you always like have to deal with the situation where um there are some intents these like third-party solvers process them like they they spend resources computational resources to solve them but they only get paid if they can like um actually eventually settle them on chain and so that kind of brings a lot of the OS vectors which is um like this which is how like this um 4337 standard becomes very complex because of this so I kind of Wonder uh your opinions on that like um yeah just just your general opinions on that do you see that as a threat to perhaps like um the the the goal of like simplifying user experience uh our users are now required to like have some sort of reputation for their intents to be processed do you see that as a as a significant challenge I mean I mentioned initially that what one thing that is very interesting is that is basically the whole value chain right and what you're mentioning is that if there's a change of behavior at the bottom how does this affect basically how um you know which Builders do we approach for instance you know do we approach all Builders do you basic do you basically create redundancy because you might be in danger of not matching demand that you already created Downstream I think this is all of these things will you know there are these interlinkages and I'm pretty sure that will happen the main problem again is we can talk about it but ultimately you need to some form of modeling to think about reason in isolate factors and think about what will happen I mean I can talk and talk but it's you need models in the end we don't have them yet I would say whether maybe the solution is to simplify the expression language rather make it more complicated to simplify the solving so I guess um perhaps the correct answer is to do both to some degree um one of the things we quickly came across was that you know in this whole idea intent expression there needs to be like there needs to be some specified language for intent expression so that is one of the first things that we're thinking about building um to kind of tie into I think with the first question that was asked about um you know what's the mathematical formalization of this this all sounds very vague very fair question it's convex optimization basically so you are dealing with a very complex State machine which basically is your constraints so everything that everything that you can do is bound by an awfully complex by now take the UVM machine the user is going to express some objective function of some final State they would like to achieve and so that is sort of the formulation for formalization of how you're saying now this is this is the state I would like to achieve this is the gradient in N Dimensions over which I would like it to be evaluated please do your best so to tie that back into this question so you you really if we're going to be speaking in such terms you need something you need the appropriate tool for the job so essentially our answer to that question is that it's a DSL for intent expression which is essentially a it's a constraint based programming language I have a sort of radical alternative which is basically don't ever encode your intent ever anywhere sorry just invariance and things you can prove which are nothing to do with intense and then those you prove in a proof assistant and you do that like sort of off chain you know to anyone or you like keep that as if it's like what do you mean by ingredients sorry like what do you mean by invariance invariance oh it's like a it's like a like traditional computer science word for what we are trying to call intense like is it invariant it's something that just like is guaranteed to be true about the program at this point no matter got to that point um it's a something that doesn't vary it's a it's like a computer science term it's sort of like something you can prove about the program at all states or if you know if it's invariant across the whole Trace um invariants are sort of the traditional way to talk about uh things we can prove about programs yeah but like if I specify if I have a geometric variety of some sort and I give you a start point an end point or a start region and an end region and I say give me one curve that connects the two regions the start and end points are invariance so how is that not connected so it is sort of connected but if you're doing a good strategy your opponents you will basically have like sort of like this sort of invariance curve and you will not know what outcome you get and you will not invariant your outcome with a secure strategy a secure test you know it's like a hypothesis you don't know your outcome how could you do a hypothesis validating for your outcome ahead of time it's like not a test then if it's not a test then your base basically having like actually like an order or an intent and then you're just making it fair game for me to extract as much Med from you as I can since we we I guess touched on the the acceptability or not of the terminology of intents and without all to be invariance I mean I guess my point is that the average what I'm going to call A first order user so not not somebody looking to extract Mev it's not reasonable that they should be conceptualizing these systems in terms of strategy and adversaries like that's that's are you kidding me you're you're going to the Dark Forest it's like the desert of the real you don't want to think about strategy or artificial you're gonna die in the desert man no and then you're gonna make everyone else die with you and you're making your security you're in security anyone else you go to the desert with no water and then you expect me to give you my water and make me die with you too bro no it's that's not the way this works you know this is like the desert of the real man you have to think about security you have to think about your own security you have to you don't go out into the desert without thinking about your security or your strategy or your adversaries are you going to get sniped in the dark force the only way fair and it'll be fair like they will pick up your loot and they will be right to now I I I agree with you that that is the state of things but I think that's why we're proposing this is like most lawfully in what you deserve if you go out there not thinking about your strategy and your security I mean I think the only way to escape the desert of the real is trust right to come back to your original question you know currently we live in this like economically abstract model and in an economically abstract model you know solvers or whoever's processing intents needs to be always concerned about dos right um and that relationship you know it's going to converge to something that looks like transactions if the only way you can prevent dos is by charging proportional to the amount of computation right because transactions charge gas proportional to the amount of computation and intends to like magically escape this restriction because this restriction is economic it's not like about the expression language although constrained expression languages can help you bound the computational costs But ultimately I think we'll just see the pipeline converge towards more of like a trust graph or a web of trust where solvers who are interacting with your intentions your friends how do you trust someone who has a billion dollars if they're insecure I mean you need at least one secure person in the web of trust or the whole you know the whole thing is obviously not secure I mean you know you don't have like you can't like have trust without Security First like you're going to go out into the desert of the real everyone's insecure and make a web of trust with a bunch of insecure people we're going to turn you in and wreck you no no you you can trust people who are secure like I'm not going to trust people who aren't secure if you're secure damn right I trust how do you know how do you know you test them you test them how do you ever get access to the information on whether or not they're sorry if you see their intents then obviously they're not secure and you test them until they get wrecked enough to fix it it's a statistical security though it's not it's not statistical it's adversario it's like like literally like a Byzantine uncertainty that gets you when you're insecure you can never know no no no you will know I will get you if you're insecure I will Smite you [Laughter] oh you know that whatever what about it I will keep it in mind I agree the state of state today um what about reducing that forest for the user by actually building these trusted Pockets or trusted building blocks that are designed to execute certain sub intents that I then can then use so can you give examples you have to start with security and then you throw it away by letting them Express their intents no no you you don't let them make this mistake that will make them insecure you provide security by not letting them fall into this trap you think perhaps uh another way to put it would be like yeah so you're going to go out you're going to get wrecked and somebody's going to extract you know X from your transaction well it's just bringing that out into the open and allowing a second to the Searcher to say hey like you can express your intent in such a way that sure like he's gonna let me demonstrate that he is going to extract n from you and I propose to extract n minus Epsilon and as soon as that discourse is public you have essentially an auction that takes place until it's kind of it's it's it's the rest of the bottom that you see with all kinds of searching and that eventually competition reaches a point where you know hey I can if I try and extract more than one cent from this someone else is going to take it you're just making that auction um approach optimality from point of view of what the user intends sure but you don't you don't want to be assuming perfect competition bro you want to assume oligar holistic competition and that like oligopoly is going to wreck you you know I mean but then you need bottom-up compositionality you know split your tribes in the desert of the real and reform out of some basis of trust you're not going to escape that's right an oligopoly if you start from it no you you you you just want your oligopolis to be secure otherwise you're going to be down with their ship why does it matter if they're secure if you rely on the oligopolis an insecure person with your life and they can't even secure themselves how are they going to secure your life bro can you define what you mean by secure over here so in this case let's talk about pen we're talking about like security and crypto economic terms like pen testing of someone's transactions right so for every transaction for every test you perform you gain some additional additional confidence that your hypothesis of the security right but he's right that it's statistical is statistical no it's adversarial because because if you're insecure I will find out and I will get it like it's not statistical I will find it what if I'm bluffing 100 times in a row and then but then you're not going to be insecure bro I told you it's not deterministic you shouldn't be in it's not gonna be secure if you have a deterministic outcome that you're validating for it sounds like that you know this Falls This falls to the Chinese room argument of Consciousness testing right how do you know you're trying to do some internal state of being secure right but there's no no no no no no I I know uh actually right I don't know and that's actually the beautiful thing I just I'm just extracting Mev I don't know whether it's coming from insecure people or secure people and that's actually great because I don't need to know and for you to make me find out if you're insecure or not is an unduly imposing a duty on me for my business and my operations I don't need to know if you're secure or not I just extract them I have not knowing whether you're secure or not yeah is it actually are you talking about the market for hypothesis testing that you basically and won't incentivize that someone rejects the hypothesis well that's just sort of where it's going because if you don't if it's not a test then you're gonna and I can get some kind of intent out of it then I'm going to exploit it I have a question well I mean I let the audience have a question so Vlad you've spent some time talking about intents I'm curious um what are smart transactions and why are they better than intense yeah so smart transactions are just a way to use the ethereum virtual machine to validate outside of the scope of a normal internal or like normal ethereum transaction it sort of imagine if like your smart your transaction can validate into like the future or the past no different code just evm just running evm no no special language it's just VM no no no new languages and especially no um you know uh uh sort of uh huge uh uh uh legal exposure to fiduciary obligation requirements because as if sort of I'm solving your transaction therefore I'm your fiduciary no no way bro if I'm solving yours to transaction I don't know if you're insecure or not I'm just taking my Mev I don't follow the fiduciary responsibility argument because the user defines the conditions essentially the validity conditions is that the intent is satisfied that that defines essentially the surface of the Imagine they think of this in order and they think of themselves as telling you their intent of how to execute their order they're making you their fiduciary bro if the user defines the space like the space of all end States they Define the space in which they consider the solution to be satisfactory or valid um but if you if you're parsing their intents and you're in any way aware of what their intents are you certainly now are notified of what they want and now you're in Trust of their in their will then we are fiduciaries in virtue of sitting on this panel and talking to one another no that's you guys advising people to disclose their intents I would never want to know your intensity if you tell me I won't believe you I will never know your intention you'll never know mine you'll never make me your trustee by virtue of telling me your intents I will extract value from you if you tell me your intents consider yourself warrant Okay I uh I sort of agree to what Vlad is saying is basically if you release your intents in the public mempool then the only way that it will get filled is by someone maximizing Mev and basically giving that value back to the proposal uh so basically the way intents get filled on chain is basically maximizing Mev are there other types of mechanisms where you can maximize some other objective objective function so for example cow swap is one example where you maximize best price for the user are there other how do you how do you make these systems where there are other objective functions other than the Mev maximization objective function which gets encoded through your system basically I think a a trivial example is something like a Dutch auction you're expressing an intent to sell ideally at a price X and you express an objective function that's going to evolve over time that as time goes by you'll express you'll accept a less competitive price now if you assume at least two competent Market maker I mean One content Market maker can hold you out and just let the price drop to zero or to wherever the the uh the limit is that if you assume two competent competing um parties then then one of them will jump in as soon as it's profitable to now assuming that that isomorphism to intense is correct I don't see how um being the first one to jump in and take that price in an auction it could be considered um something along the lines of being responsible in a fiduciary sense for its execution sorry I was talking about the Searcher solver not the other transactors like the person who's actually choosing how they're searched how they're solved I'm talking about them being a fiduciary because they're sort of looking at your intent and and then executing on it um and instead the way I would say is no no there is no other objective function it's just Mev and it's up to you the transactor to be secure and it's not my responsibility and if you're trying to make me figure out whether you're secure or not um uh in order to do my business and you should like you know like like prepare me to use the full force a lot of the family rights bro We have basically seen systems like cow swap which are trusted which do achieve this other type of objective function which is not any maximization but are there any option or are there any decentralized or public mempool style you just just revert your transaction I mean I think a lot of Mev and perhaps a lot of this concern arises out of trying to design a system where we send everything to one place and then we try and craft some like abstract incentive scheme to make that one place you know do something like return Mev to users but this is very difficult because people have different objective functions and if we choose one place we have to choose one objective function we have to choose one way to rank all solutions we have to choose one asset to rule them all right basically it's the same thing so I think you know the direction I would move in at least is to push things out to the edges to like stay as local as possible and use kind of as high trust or high locality links as possible to settle intents that can be settled there to kind of move compositionally up and keep information you know Intense or like information coming into the system right and Mev arises from information flow and choice so what we want to do is choose where as a user choose where you send information and align it with your trust graph and restrict the choices of parties especially those later in the trust graph to ones that you deem acceptable I'll take one audience question so I just wanted to give some boost to what Vlad said about legal liability issues and also this language of intents may not be maybe unhelpful but even beyond the language so like to explain what I think Simon was puzzled about imagine you have a market order just because you have a market order it doesn't mean that it's legal for your broker to to execute it at any price the question whether what user kind of consents formally to is entirely separate to the question whether how the transaction is executed whether that there was some breach of fiduciary duty Market manipulation and so on right so this argument of user consent that doesn't fly but uh but yes but so things like plausible deniability or when you don't have information or when you can only execute that within the test that maybe bring you closer to something well or further away from liability but uh yeah no legal advice I think there's even there's more to that because as we discussed before if you split up the language that users use to express and what happens Downstream there is even more of a gap that what the user agrees on might not be something that the others see along the chain in a transparent way and there is well I'm not sure I'm not sure that's a good starting point assume that no one is thinking about it maybe some some parts of it are not think about it but again the user interface will influence what people will do right um so I would just disagree that there's a you know generally forget about what the users are thinking I think also if if you apply the same standards as are applied to Conventional uh traditional markets to blockchain then I think searches have probably got themselves already into much more trouble than they possibly could do by engaging in intent satisfaction I'm not all searchers would do that no offense all right we'll uh do one last question and then that will be the last of the day yeah so I think take away from the debate is probably that defining intents is very difficult yes but in particular it's very difficult independently of the mechanism to which those intents are like targeted and I mean again we go back to the example of car swap for which I work but is a good example because it allows to run the mechanism of chain but where if you want the input into the mechanism which is the intent is visible off on chain the output of the mechanism is also visible on chain execution itself is done off chain but anything so this gives any way the visibility of of what is going on so in some sense you can detect uh deviation from the state the mechanism to from what it is supposed to do okay so I think that is the advantage the mechanism there are mechanisms that one can run fully on chain but obviously those have problems the advantage of this is that the mechanism is off chain but input and output are on chain so everything is detectable so I will summarize this way this is the example of cow Swap and I think this can be extended to other situations smart transactions does this for all transactions really it's a sort of the smart transactions model basically like the the execution is in the search you know the the on chain is just sort of the search result which is a Trace yeah I mean I'm not I don't think the on-chain off-chain dichotomy Will Survive intense I think it will collapse I mean history you know you start with an intent and then you do things to that intent and currently we're like not tracking that history maybe or a lot of it is happening in ways that are not easily verifiable later on but this is just a property search on chain or off chain um I mean everything is on chain in a certain sense and everything is off chain it depends on what the one true chain is for me but isn't the search the choice of block that you make to add to the chain insofar as that there is free choice you can't you know you can prove that may be available to the information subject to the information you have your church your choice at some property but I guess there's a fundamentally I guess like free Block is already in the Block in the future so I kind of agree with you on that note uh thank you everyone for the wonderful day [Applause]
