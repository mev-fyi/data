all right hey everyone here we get to the real content of the day um this will be a quick presentation uh 50 minutes I uh I wrote a blog post um oh actually I have a mic I don't know I'm holding this one [Music] all right I uh can you hear me okay yeah perfect so I wrote a uh I wrote a blog post last week about infinite games and it sort of reflects a lot of my thinking over the last year I think we um we had a beautiful event where I know quite a few of you here today were attending last year in uh in Amsterdam and it was sort of the initial place where we got to meet everyone who's building in uh in the space I think at the time there was very few other sort of companies aside from flashbots that were really building infrastructure um and uh and it was mostly a place where we saw a lot of a lot of Searchers come together and discussed some of the the ideas and and uh and trading strategies or our insights about the space it feels absolutely mind-blowing how far the space has come from a year ago to uh to today I sort of mentioned it earlier uh in in the day but you know we had uh we had a huge amount we had thousands of applications for uh for the event today and we had to hand pick uh from these and we made sure that basically every single person this room is touching uh Mev in their day-to-day job in some way so I think it's really exciting to have seen such an industry flourish um it's something that that uh that was really excited to be able to help put together um and I want to talk a little bit about how my thinking has evolved uh since uh since then so a bit of a year of learnings um so this is a graphic that had put together last year that and to be a bit of a prediction of how the space would evolved um you know I think it introduced and hit on a few new ideas one of them was the builder role which didn't exist at the time when uh when this was produced another one is you know the idea of uh of intents um and that's been sort of something that's blown up in the past few months in terms of uh of of attention I want to um because the exciting thing and the exciting prediction that I had was that we'd have a diversity of different approaches to implementing these things I want to have a bit of a of a show of hands uh in terms of the crowd that we have today which part of this stack would you say that you are uh you're sort of working on so maybe we'll just start at the very beginning of it with the intent layer um show of hands who in the room is sort of working on the intent layer and uh and the sort of expression of user preferences all right so we have a handful five six people um who is at the wallet application layer and actually building sort of interfaces for users to help them interact with the chain for w High put your hands up okay well we actually only have a couple application layer people in the room right now um who is working at the Searcher level uh actually doing uh searching Market making any of these games all right we've got quite a few actually where were you guys when I was asking for people to come on the Searcher panel no one messaged me what happened um all right who's doing block building you want to put your hand up we have quite a few block builders in the room right now nice um and then finally who's at the validator layer actually helping provide custody and services perfect who's at the protocol design for base layer beautiful all right cool so we still have a good range of the the supply chain that's that's represented today the framing that I have put on this on my on my previous talk was the idea of sort of this dichotomy between Utopia and dystopia and the direction in which uh monetary flows would would go in this uh in the supply chain um I think this ended up being the wrong framing I think in as much as we did spark a lot of innovation over the course of the last year new teams that entered the space I think a lot of the conversation didn't go in the direction that um that I wish it did it was a lot more focused on how do we sort of distribute the value that's created who gets to capture the amount of value our user is getting you know a good deal or a bad deal our validator is getting a good deal or a bad deal rather than I think the more important question which is are the systems that we're building actually useful for the world are they things that are improving upon the status quo are there things are going to actually be able to drive meaningful people uh value to the the crypto ecosystem as a whole and deliver on this promise that we had uh you know that we have as a space to do things better to build better mechanisms um and I don't think that that's been really the emphasis that the Mev space and the Mev infrastructure has has had to date uh and so part of the event today is to get everyone in the room together have discussions about what they're building and realize that really instead of looking more like a supply chain what we're building is a lot more complex it's a lot more convoluted there's a lot more back relationships between all the different items and this is a great thing um what this really is is it shows that you can have a diversity of different experiments and different mechanisms that compose with each other and compete with each other in in the creation of uh of of better systems um we've seen a lot of these just emerge in the last year and so I have no doubt that a year from now this diagram will be outdated and a lot more complex but I do think that this represents much better what we're actually trying to achieve here which is not just a single way of getting transactions included on chain but rather a way to fulfill different needs that different counterparties have and specialized in the production of those uh of those in the in the servicing of those needs I think framing the um the transaction supply network as being an optimization not just of who gets the value is it users it validators is it middlemen in the middle but rather framing it as how does the entire ecosystem as a whole become useful in a way that maximizes the value across all of it should really be the optimization function that uh that we aim for and so what does this actually end up looking like I think it ends up looking like we have a bunch of different teams that are building different games that are composing with each other in a way that aims to provide more value and they're competing with each other the games are competing with each other for uh for players and for users to submit either transaction flow liquidity uh information preferences into their system whichever is the game that's able to better service those preferences is likely the game that's going to win it's also likely the game that's able to generate the most value for uh for the ecosystem as a whole and so I really want us to think about okay how do we optimize the entire system in the value of the entire system creates as as an ecosystem rather than linearly who gets to capture the bigger slice of the pile and thinking about okay what what do these games look like and how do they compose with each other I think one simple abstraction that we we can bring to mind is the fact that all of these structured games are composed of two very simple things um their interfaces their standard interfaces for messages um that are being communicated between different parties and they're an optimization function that these parties are competing against each other on to find sort of an optimal solution so whether we're talking about an order flow auction whether we're talking about sort of a protocol layer uh a system like nav boost or or like an intense system they're all sort of instantiation of a similar game that are that are being played between these uh these parties um one of the things that I've come to realize is while there's some sort of similarities between a lot of these games there's also a lot of benefit from specialization so it's likely that the games that end up uh being the most useful are the ones that are the more locally uh tailored to the users that's trying to service the goal is not necessarily to just generate and and deploy a single game that captures all of the um all of the the benefits or or all of the you know preferences of the end users but rather developed games are specifically tailored for the narrow use cases that um that a subset of users want the upside of this is I think twofold one of them is you better service a user and you create more value for them the second one is that it's actually much easier to achieve decentralization I think one of the sort of underbelly and and dark truths about the design of these uh these sort of games is a lot of them devolve into uh political games so I'm going to talk a little bit about these these difficult topics and difficult Lessons Learned I think from uh from being in a position of of having designed some of these uh these games in the past um I think basically all consensus games are uh our political game by by definition um so consensus game are you know and the most abstract a collaboration of people that come to agreement on something and the tools that they have for doing this are basically sharing information whether that's through language or through ethereum transactions or through protocol consensus rules um these are informations and like bits that are being shared from one uh party to another and uh those uh information sharing also expresses contention these uh these contentions end up being resolved through mostly political games now I have some uh some abstraction of what political gains actually means here which is a game that benefits from information access and information access I sort of Define in in two ways one of them is uh is through um I should say information advantages information advantages get expressed in 2A one of them is through access so if you are part of a closed source of order flow and you're able to benefit from that to be able to have some preferred access to doing an Arbitrage opportunity or you have some preferred access to a validator set that others aren't able to access and you're therefore able to sort of win the political contentious game of who gets to define the next state update access is is one of them and it's a it's a trust game it's an elitist game that that is all about uh sort of connections and relationship the second one is speed so not only the access information matters but the speed at which you get it whether it you are just you know five milliseconds before someone else on the access to an Arbitrage opportunity or in a more slow political game sort of can see way ahead of time you know what are the next protocol changes are going to happen on ethereum and be able to start investing in your business to be able to be ready for those protocol changes um the latency at which uh information gets propagated does Define the winners and losers in political games and that huge that is sort of a cause of of a centralization at the end of the day um and so I do want to emphasize that these games happen at many different scales right both time skills and uh and sort of information size scales so every single block every single transaction in a block is a game that's being played with an auction or something else but then also every single changes that gets introduced to ethereum as a protocol or a new company that sort of spins up and creates a game are also changes to uh to the game and the the information access doesn't stop at the transaction level the information access and the the advantages that certain parties have exists at these much more metal layers I think one of the lessons that I've also learned is the idea that um the more Global a game is the more uh political albeit and the more centralized they'll end up the more information the more contention that you have in a game the more you're trying to represent the state of the world within a single abstraction with a single price Discovery layer the more competition that you'll have for being able to to win that game and the more people are going to be willing to invest in uh developing those advantages so this is sort of a blessing and a curse right ethereum as a protocol has amassed a huge amount of value and it's sort of the the home of defy but also by proxy is sort of the the biggest place where all the players are sort of competing on latency and being able to to uh to control parts of uh of uh of the stack if we're able to fragment these games into smaller games um we're able to sort of isolate the amount of of centralization pressure and uh and political pressure that there is on on those systems and ultimately create redundancy in a place where they're otherwise would not naturally be redundancy so instead of thinking big maybe the solution is actually to think smaller and try to think about okay what are the more Niche uh Niche games that we can design that are not great for everyone but are protected from uh from being influenced by uh by the outside world I think as a part of this is also the question of of Monolithic and uh non-monolithic game design um this is not necessarily something or like language or terminology that's that's uh being used a lot these days um but if you have a monolithic system to me that means a system that benefits from Network effects typically to the form of price Discovery so if you have a system that Aggregates a bunch of different orders and benefits from the fact that you have to go and trade on this venue or you have to send your your transactions to this venue to be able to benefit from the best price Discovery you're encouraging and sort of developing a more monolithic system that makes it harder for external parties to spin up and uh and sort of transfer over their um their you their usage to to a different system the bootstrapping cost in developing a new game increases the more that these systems are Divine this designed in a monolithic way relative to not monolithic system design in which it really doesn't matter where uh where you send the flow so maybe like one example here is a non-molotic system design would be something like um like nav boost right so boost or PBS as a system the price Discovery doesn't happen at the Block Builder level it happens at the at the validator level which means that although it's like non-trivial for a new Bob gelder to get set up and get going and aggregate the flow it's still trivial for them to actually start participating in the the meth boost system and submit uh openly to uh to new validators just like it sort of um open Friendly new a new relay to come in and plug into the system or a new new validator to come and plug into the the Mev Booth architecture there isn't sort of the shared Global state of price discovery that uh that you need to tap into to be able to uh to participate in the game and so part of what I want to encourage is also the development of more of these non-monolithic system design and when we're evaluating the games that we decide to play it's a lens through which we should consider what are what are positive some games and what are our negative some games I'm going to end up with talking a little bit about Frontier and uh and and you know the reason why we put this event together the reason why uh I decided to start a new company in the space and and continue working here um I think the reason why I join the space the reason why I got excited about crypto as a whole when I when I started back in 2017 was the design of of games it was creating games that create more value for um for the end users that we're developing for um and the goal for for us is to help um you know the vast majority of the people here who are either designing or playing these games uh think about the design that they're making um and so on the frontier research side we publish articles and mental models I'm sure quite a few of you in this room have have read that I think are useful for uh for being custodians and designers of these games and we also take advisory engagements with a lot of the teams here and work with them on how to think about you know are these games good are these games useful are these games going to get adoption how do we build a business around these uh kind of game design um and I'm super excited to be able to continue doing that um at the same time we're also developing a uh Adventures uh portfolio which is sort of a set of of efforts and incubated projects that aim to support various different teams in the the transaction supply network and so the the initial project that we we're book shopping is called the the faith Builder or the f1b Builder and it's a it's a generalized uh sort of solver that aims to plug into all these different games and help them uh get boot shop and and provide better experiences so right now we're uh we're participating in a block building game um and uh and it's been sort of fascinating to be able to meet people and and get to understand the uh the the side of the player uh in in the games that are being designed here and so a lot of really interesting lessons that we will be Keen to share with uh with anyone who's interested in learning about it um so that's that's it for me that's all I want to I have to share for for today I'm really excited for everyone here to to get to chat with each other and uh and Foster in the next year of uh of Mev [Applause]
