[Music] what's up everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we have Jeff Morris Jr who's the managing partner at the Venture fund chapter one I'm extremely excited to have Jeff on I've been following him for a long time uh right now he's investing I'm doing a lot in the crypto space and also just Tech in general um but before that he was the VP of product and revenue at Tinder and that's when Tinder didn't really have their premium tiers yet and he led that effort and he led zinder to become the number one grossing app in the app store going from 20 million in ARR annual recurring Revenue to 1.2 billion um so pretty absolutely incredible Jeff welcome to the show yeah excited to be here I've I've seen mert and you launched the show and really uh a big fan so this will be fun amazing well I'm glad to have you I think it's impossible for me to have this conversation with you and not talk about Tinder and some of the learnings you have from there I think what's really awesome about having you here is that one thing crypto doesn't focus on much is products it's all about infrastructure which is important that you come from that product background right and you actually understand um like what users want but before we get into that you're pretty you're prolific writer and your last essay that you did was called Venture narrative Whiplash um and you said that's uh it's a term that I think you coined but you said it's something that's shaped our industry more than anything else you've seen the last 10 years so I was hoping you could just introduce that concept to the audience and and how it applies to the market today yeah it's new uh idea I've been thinking about but it's basically this idea um so the entire industry lives on Twitter crypto and venture capital and so um in an era of trying to build audiences the best way to do so is through mostly like negativity and um because that gets most engagement and so you see this cycle every couple months of like a new Venture narrative as to what's popular hit the mainstream and the implications of that are um I kind of mapped it through limited partners who invest in Venture funds obviously Venture puns and then Founders who are building companies and it has a really profound impact on what gets built and I think it's actually a new phenomenon because like I entered Tech in 2010 and we were all on Twitter but it wasn't as Cutthroat in terms of trying to um flex online and be right about um what's next in your thesis and it was a lot more collaborative and so I've seen this with with crypto if you think about a year and a half ago um which isn't that long ago in like building time the entire industry was very excited about blockchain technology is digital assets um and the conversations were more excitement around the technology and now if you go to any venture capital dinner or conference outside of crypto they kind of treat you like you're like you're like doing something wrong by being excited about crypto still like it's like oh you're still doing crypto or you're still excited about digital assets and you got the most like defend yourself which I think is a very weird place to be in a 500-day cycle with an ad early stage technology market and um so the point was like everybody's being pushed to specialize um uh Founders and investors in given markets in the reality of trying to survive any multi-year period within any sector so it could be crypto could be I'm seeing the same thing in AI now where everybody's now gone to Ai and suddenly like the early there's there's new narratives emerging that that whole Space is going to be a disaster for VCS which it very well might be the case but it ends up being um a negative that's a negative impact on what could what gets built it's kind of a bummer um and so I'm trying to trying to to communicate like we um should all give ourselves more time to build the products that we hope to bring to Market and um I wish that the ecosystem as a whole took a more patient view as to what um the outcome of Any Given sector might be and so I feel bad for Founders in in the crypto space right now because the impact of all this this Venture native whiplashes it's nearly impossible to raise the series a right now up here doing anything crypto related um and most of these Founders have really great intentions and so um anyways that's it that's the idea and it's it's a new idea and um the last part is I think it's almost like applying cancel culture to entire sectors which is very um crazy to me that you can just like the industry as a whole can just cancel an entire sector together and we're all in agreement um when that happens and I think um again it's kind of the idea there that's very interesting to cancel culture part about uh entire Industries you did mention something interesting there which is that you know even if you're a really well-intentioned crypto founder today and you have a you know good product and maybe good good traction you it's still going to be very difficult for you to raise a series a and maybe continue the business and you know grow grow the market what do you think will help us overcome that like will it just take you know a few breakout products will it take a new ball cycle um like what was your advice to crypto Founders be yeah I think there's never like one Silver Bullet but I think your instincts are right that that any bull market overnight changes the narrative within the Venture ecosystem and makes people excited again which is unfortunate because the bull market often isn't related to the underlying principles of what what are being built or um kind of like the ground level truth of what's being built really it is uh I would say to get to the next Milestone as as a Founder a big very much depends on what you're building so if you're building a protocol the go to market in the fundraising sequencing is much different than something that resembles B2B SAS where you're selling to web3 startups or Enterprises and I find the teams that are most impacted right now tend to be the more like the B2B business models because the web 3 Market is just very um small as of today so if you get to a millionaire or whatever it might be it's very hard to go from like one to five to twenty and to keep hitting those Milestones we've seen some examples of that with you know like quick note or um other folks like that who've been able to kind of like cross over to the um more like mainstream Enterprise buyers but it's a small subset of companies and so um my advice is always to do as much as you can to control your own destiny by um having real end user adoption and trying to to find what I I call crypto Market fit has been what I've called in the past but like really challenging yourself to get traction which is always the easiest way to get investment interest and I I see a lot of Founders right now who um unfortunately don't realize that having like 10 10 000 ARR it just isn't enough um and you have I think you have like Founders who haven't seen kind of like what a series a a tough series a market looks like um unfortunately you you just mentioned protocols um given your background and like product and Revenue protocol developments and maybe products based on protocols so like I think you mentioned forecasting when you're writings before they're kind of a new Beast that isn't really familiar in the web 2 World um so I'm curious like what is your um like mental framework for understanding protocols and how protocols can monetize um like how do you think about them yeah I think conceptually Protocols are most similar in web 2 to open source software where you allow the community to build on top of whatever it is your your core project is in the case of forecaster I um spent a lot of time thinking about the web to business model being so Focus primarily on ad based business models where your entire goal is to capture as much scale as you can and control that user base through wall Gardens and it ends up leading to I think subpar product experiences because you um you make a lot of decisions along the way that don't benefit the user which if you've been in those rooms like it's a very different way of building products and so and I did that for a long time and and and know kind of how those those product teams think what got me excited about forecaster as an example was just the idea that Dan could build the core broadcaster protocol and you could have um many different iterations of whatever that end user experience might look like based on different subsets of audiences that might have very different tastes and so you could have a forecaster India that functioned and looked a lot different than forecaster us for crypto native audiences you you can really build I think better products for users if you take the product the protocol approach the challenges we're seeing is just it's hard to get people to care about new social apps and especially in a bear Market to get them to care about um you know the decentralized version of whatever it is they're used to in the web 2 world it's just hard to kind of like capture mainstream interest but we're seeing I think probably the I've said to a lot of limited partners who invest in Venture funds that there is a world where Twitter no longer exists in a couple years and I was seeing that like a year or two ago and people looked at me like I was crazy and now you you can you can imagine Twitter as a business actually no longer being a product in a few years um if they're not able to to build a business like the odd that revenue is is falling off dramatically right now and they're not converting subscribers and so um anyways I think I think I think there's interesting um reasons why protocol might emerge that would replace a Twitter over the next couple years Yeah you mentioned subscriptions there I'm curious It's a bit tangential to crypto probably because there's not a lot of subscription products that are you might call native to crypto like Protocols are like you pay as you use it one thing you said about about Twitter as well is that if you were in charge of the product today you might make that completely for subscribers like a complete subscription product so maybe maybe you could just explain that because I'm curious like what that why why you say that in the subscription business model in general yeah so when when Tinder was really um like popping off the a lot of the attention for better or worse like I was one of the people who was who was getting a lot of the like public kudos for it and actually flew up to Twitter in 2000 18 and met with their uh a member of their product team a senior member and he said they would never do anything subscriptions related because Jack Dorsey just like fundamentally didn't believe in subscriptions because you believe in open information and um if you ought to pay well to any product obviously it's no longer completely open the um truth and subscriptions I think are a great way to hold yourself accountable to your subscribers to keep adding consistent value if you if your product gets worse you don't innovate you'll see churn and so there's this binding relationship between you and land user that you hopped it continuously add a value I think that's um a really great relationship to have with an audience and so I've always thought that subscriptions were just a very um one it's a it's a great business model because you can predict your revenue and you can really have um a consumer business that feels like a SAS business which is nice like that helps you sleep at night and then two I think um the opportunity to continue to provide value for users and having them uh recommit on a monthly or annual basis to whatever your your product is I think that's a really great relationship to build community um obviously I think there's there's been new business models which are interesting I think one of the challenges with crypto is you have you don't really have recurring payments and you don't have so you see a lot of like front loaded value and um projects that don't continuously deliver value to their communities and when they do um I think the expectations are just a lot different so you have maybe like the web three version like token holders by holding your token or subscribing to your product every day when they wake up in the morning choose to hold on to that asset but um there's a fun web through communities are a lot and Mer probably has things here they're just like a lot more aggressive than web 2 end users and so when you don't deliver in web 3 you really um you you really face a lot of public scrutiny and I think for anyone launching a token um the moment you launch a token you're beholden to a community that all have very different goals for what um kind of what what your product should should look like and a lot of it's directly related to the price of the token unfortunately and so I've talked to Founders who've watched tokens and um like they've had like really dark moments after lunch they took him because it's just like a very hard life as a Founder to um to wake up to every day so two questions one is do you differentiate when you talk about like tokens as Maybe as a web three parallel to subscriptions do differentiate between like fungible tokens and nfts because obviously they have interestingly different Dynamics based on the jpeg that's attached but um so that's number one and number two is it do you think there's like a right way to do tokens like maybe for incentivizing early users or um using it as a way to like start like flywheel effects what are your thoughts on that yeah I think what I was one of the reasons why I found crypto to be exciting originally was from a growth a growth background bootstrapping Network when you have tokens is such a powerful go to market like it makes Uber famously bootstrap on like the give five get five idea where you for every friend you refer you earn five dollars that you can use for a Future ride tokens make that feel like Antiquated almost like like it's like a color TV compared to black and white TV like you get you know five dollars to ask your friend to join an Uber and that's kind of all you get as an end user that feels um pretty underwhelming compared to some of the rewards I've seen in web3 that said I think the par which obviously we haven't fully figured out is just the sustainability of a that kind of like bootstrapping mechanism has been hard to figure out and so we have these waves of excitement where you see just like crazy Top Line growth and um a project falls off a couple weeks later I think we're seeing that data with with with friendtech probably recently um but yeah I think I do think of um of nfts as being a we've seen good examples of this um particularly with um you know like the early 2001 vintage of nfts I think that was an interesting time where you did have this like real community element where people felt like they're subscribing to community and it really felt um an affinity towards this community so I don't know now if people those communities really care I mean if you look at a lot of the data unfortunately I think um again people probably did very different goals but it seems like a lot of the um 2021 nft communities have have fallen off um over the past year yeah and that has to do with retention right which I know in like web 2 is something that you look at probably every day aulate your customer churn how do you what what metrics do you look at when you're investing in protocols when you look at the health of an ecosystem um yeah in crypto because I know it's it's much more difficult than in web 2 because one you don't have a unique identity you can track like you have wallets and identities that might be you know spread out across like 10 different um IDs so I'm curious yeah what what metrics are you tracking to look for the health of an ecosystem or a token yeah it's a little bit of a cop-out but we we invested like mostly pre-products of pre-seed and Seed investing and we don't have a liquid fund that we um so most of the projects we invest in are pre-launch the um this like web3 identity problem I think is something that um we've tried to invest in projects you can help solve that so one example would be spindle who's focusing on unifying wallet IDs and providing a clear view of um of kind of what the customer Journey looks like from acquisition through any on-chain trading activity we don't use that in our underwriting so it's um it'll be disingenuous to say that we do but we do spend a lot of time on um doing analytics we have a full-time data center our team Jameson Seidel who also tries to to kind of identify um worker the monthly we look at unique wallets and try and try and make sense of it um she'll look at kind of like the distribution of Wales versus non-wills and trying to figure out one big thing is now just like how dependent are you on a small subset of users because I think that's very scary as an investor if you have a project that has like 50 people who control the entire fate of the community and so we try to look for some distribution that gives us confidence that there's a real community and not just like you know a small subset of people who can flip on the project and kill it overnight um so but it's tough I think then there it is about took the adventure narrative Whiplash you could probably apply that within crypto and say it's like 100x harder because the crypto Community has their own um like the Whiplash is just way more violent in crypto and happens overnight in some cases and so we want to get to know the founders too and really understand their intentions for building a project because we find um it's really easy for people to uh to take a shorter term view on on company building within crypto as well and so um but we we haven't seen back to the nft projects like we haven't seen a lot of people build products posts um launch show I always thought like I was in a group term we talked about loot the other day as an example um like I always expected lewd or board apes or any of these projects to have like real products like mobile experiences or web experiences that you could like actually log into and I know a lot of them had like metaverse or gaming pitches within those um releases but we haven't seen like there isn't like an NFP project we like wake up in a day and you log into your idea and you like do something um in that community and that's pretty surprising to me with all the dollars that have flown in or have gone into nft projects that we haven't like I kind of Wonder like what are these teams doing um like is anyone building software um and if they're not like what's the roadmap because I would I would hope that some um people do things as being like true social platforms that they could build really cool experiences on top of Garrett after the show we can add the uh we don't do that here meme when uh one um one thing that actually that reminds me of is so you you actually talked about before before um Garrett's question about the unsustainability of the token so far and you know presumably some of that is due to no teams other than like a very small handful finding pmf um and you actually just mentioned that you know most of the NFC teams actually been building products [Music] everyone we'll get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that is the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech roll ups account abstraction Mev app chains and more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blindspeed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show you talked about this before in in a sub stack post you you think that there might be a different way of thinking about this which is crypto Market fit instead of product Market fit can you talk a bit about what that means for people who are unfamiliar and um why you know um you you proposed it yeah sure so I think we get a lot of questions around from our investors but also peers around like does anything in crypto have product Market fit and so I wanted to answer that question in a way that um looked at web 3 a little bit differently and I think in any use case that it is financialized the barrier to entry is greater to having like large populations join Europe product but the um RP that we're driving per user or the ability to monetize that smaller base of users is much greater and so the idea was you know in web 2 like the goal was always to build the biggest Network possible and then figure out how to monetize them later the benefit of web 3 is everything is very monetizable it's one of the reasons why I actually think the Space is really interesting as an investor um being it to you if you have a small subset of users that are active Traders like there's very easy ways to build a business and so I looked at um in the specific instance just looked at uniswap trading volume which this was in q22 and the monthly trading volume was was over 100 170 billion dollars with 400 000 monthly Traders and so you can see then I compare that to coinbase which had a little over 200 billion dollars of volume with 9 million monthly Traders and so 9 million versus for the centralized version versus 400 000 for the decent centralized version with almost equal trading volume and so maybe you could argue that those both have product Market fit but if you were to show this um if you're like go on a public Road Show and try and take uniswap public as a company which you you would ever do it and explain the fact that you had 400 000 users to a bunch of people in the public markets they'd be like this isn't an interesting business but it isn't it's clearly an interesting business and so um trying to reorient teams around the fact that you don't need like I think the common threw up in crypto is like you know bringing a billion users on chain or whatever it is and maybe that's actually the wrong goal I think maybe if we had 30 million people who are really passionate about Krypton Town value and the ecosystem that would be enough to build a multi-trillion dollar asset class that um was great for Founders and investors in LPS and so but I think some people responded to the article and said um like you're it was basically you're giving like what three Builders like an easy top to claim at the product Market fit or like stop giving people an excuse to not um be ambitious enough to compete with web too and I kind of um uh don't think I personally one I don't like like web 2 versus web 3 debates but I also think that um we hopped always like look at the positives in web3 because it's um if you don't take time to look at the data and find optimism you'll frankly like get so depressed you'd want to leave the space probably so I spent a lot of my time like looking for like signals of positivity or hope because I think it's really important to Bear Market to say like things aren't as bad as everybody thinks um and I don't know if you guys know Jeff Lewis he's a investor at Bedrock but he he's famous for like these narrative violations which is um his whole thing and he had a tweet recently I was like like there's a narrative Village for now which is crypto in less than 10 years became a trillion dollar asset class and so like clearly this is a valuable space and like it's not just like a complete zero um but it's almost an area violation to see that that you believe in crypto right now which is it's yeah it's pretty pretty well to think 100 agree it is interesting that's kind of a blessing a curse that encrypted you can have fewer users but like I like that you were comparing you to stop the coinbase but they had like 70 of the transaction volume but you're also talking about earlier how when you have a few users who are contributing to that volume you can also lose those you're dependent on a small subset of users um so this is kind of scary in some sense um I'm curious just obviously you're you you're staying in the space your fun doesn't only invest in crypto I think maybe the first one did but I know you're in crypto and also outside of it what are some small things crypto could do or products you're looking for that are just missing from the space um and maybe we don't get into this yet but I do want people I again I just don't think there's a lot of product people on crypto and they're missing some potentially really small things like curve used to get praised for its website and how complicated it looked which was great for engineers but like if you really want to get more people in the space like that's not true so like going through your writing some of the things I've noticed for like time to utility like knowing who your customer was you talked about on Tinder how you we're only looking at New York and L.A at first when you're thinking about customers but then you went beyond that um you talked about the importance of notifications and almost becoming a habit in people's lives so I'm curious what are some little small things that crypto could do uh to improve and actually become maybe more retail friendly yeah so we you're right we invest across different Industries including crypto and we've taken a obviously a huge interest in the space the benefit there is we get to see and I've seen a lot of um non-crypto products and what they do well and again I I always believe that there's learnings you can take from any um any part of the industry so it's helpful but the like the basic fundamental platforms and um and products we need to make crypto accessible I would say one is obviously mobile and so I think front Tech was interesting the progressive web app idea was I thought done very well um for what is available that said if you put any non-crypto user in front of that onboarding experience I would say I'd love to look at the completion rate because most people just aren't going to go through this kind of janky web experience again I'm I give credit for the like that's the best you can do with the App Store in Play Store um not I would say the Play Store is pro Crypt and now we're getting more crypto friendly the App Store clearly doesn't like crypto um communication I think is is obviously a huge part of what we need and so xmtp or different communication protocols like being able to have a conversation within a web 3 experience with another user and the reason I say that is these things are all related so you need mobile to facilitate push notifications push notifications are famously the best retention lever you can have as a any product um far better than email and so you need you need mobile you need push notifications and communication has the highest open rate for any push application you can send there's actually two two Community two push notification types that are the highest engagement one is finance and one is communication and so crypto has both of those covered and so I would think once we have mobile communication with push applications you can actually build fairly interesting products will people care like I don't know the answer to that that's the on the builders to figure out but um we're I feel like we're playing from like like crypto right now still feels like it's in the 2000s seven or right relative to where the rest of um consumer experiences are and so um so yeah we have a long way to go I am pretty excited I do want to talk about um I'll give Solana kind of a plug because I do think that helium launched last week was as close to what I think [ __ ] like a crypto go to market message should look like um being if you looked at the any of the media placements advertising it it's the headline was five dollars unlimited phone plans right there was no mention of anything crypto related or deep in like all these words we use it's just five dollars for a phone plan and I I have a feeling if you were in living in Miami and you saw that on a billboard you would stop and and try and figure out what what the catch was or what they were selling um and and take an interesting I think that's what if gets me excited oh is it we were I was an early investor in Dapper labs and I remember at the time people gave me a lot of [ __ ] and like crypto telegram groups and they're like how can you invest in a project that allows credit cards and um doesn't allow self-custody wallets and I was kind of like how um stubborn are you to not want people to experience nfts for the first time right like if my dad wants to buy an nft and use his credit card why would we say to him like we don't want you because you want to use your credit card um yeah I think the space is just for me that's where things have really fallen short um is this like view that we can't learn from web 2 and take people down the path of decentralization if they choose like if if my dad wants to buy a Top Shot and open up a metamask wallet and like really like embrace the deeper parts of the crypto experience and that would be amazing but I have a view it's more more of like a progressive onboarding for most people yeah I feel like that uh five dollars unlimited data by helium is kind of like a thousand songs in your pocket you know with Steve Jobs is just like something that hits you without getting into the technicalities of it um it's gonna sell I wanted to ask you not specifically about Dapper Labs because I know that was something that was like a lot of people said it was more centralized and there's debates about decentralization how much that matters constantly on Twitter curious like when you're looking at these different ecosystems is that something that that comes up like when you have projects come to you like how are they choosing where to build and are you uh basing how decentralized something is like Solana versus ethereum versus an app chain how much do you think of that um we do that's as we think about it and we we obviously bu decentralization is being not positive for future applications but I I personally care way more about the user experience today and um how we can meet people kind of where they are in their lives today and not force our personal ideologies or preferences on those people and so when I look at Solana when I first used phantom for the first time two years ago I'm sure you guys were doing the same thing and you compare that to your experience using anything built on ethereum it was pretty clear what the better experience was and this isn't it this is not me um like there's no ideology here just let's just like take two people and put them in a room and have them transact on Solana and have them transact on ethereum at that moment in time and the one was a very better user experience and that's kind of where I start and then try to figure out is there a risk with an experience being quote unquote centralized which again like mer can probably explain better than anybody why Solana is like sufficiently decentralized but um to me people start with their religion and then try and build the user experience that fits there preference of the world where most people just want things that are cheaper faster or better and if you step out of your little world view and think about how a user experience is Crypt up for the first time that's probably what they care about would be my take um but again I think it's I wouldn't go to like a I'm going to the Stanford blockchain conference today and like I'm not gonna get on a microphone and say that at that venue but it's just kind of how I think the world works and I'll give you one more example we um we noticed we were having some like weird retention issues in India at Tinder and it was because our onboarding flow was taken two to three seconds faster because we had a bug that had been introduced and people two a two to three second um lag in our onboarding flow cause major retention issues within a entire country because people weren't willing to wait an extra two to three seconds and so if you look at at a lot of the products in web 3 today I mean how many like what is the if we just look at it from like a purely performance and time spent on you know onboarding flow you can start to figure out what users might prefer and um again I I think merit's probably been the loudest person online so I I don't have to uh to convince you guys I don't think you said something that I think is really interesting that when you you know when you when you back stack for labs early on and it's actually how most of my friends on board the crypto by the way so clearly at least worked somewhat um that people were like kind of against it or like in in the TG chats they were not very uh supportive um one thing I'm you know something I ask myself all the time is is the lack of product success in crypto so far due to kind of the ideology around crypto and maybe like the academic nature of earlier proponents or is it that maybe there's just not that much utility and I asked this pretty frequently and I'm not too sure what the answer is um what are your thoughts on this do you think like maybe the inherent ideology of crypto leads to kind of worse products kind of almost by Design ironically or is it that there's maybe not that much use for it at the moment um yeah it depends on where you are in the world of kind of who um I was with a woman yesterday from Brazil and 50 of people in Brazil own the digital asset mostly Bitcoin and so she was talking about their um monetary policy on the issues they have there and why crypto is important for people on a daily basis in Latin America and it just reminded me like I was at site class in San Francisco um and if you were living in San Francisco today like crypto probably doesn't have a ton of utility other than you know maybe you have some interest in in more of the financial nature of investing crypto but there's not like a a need in your everyday life I do think the um probably some of the things happening in G Pen to me are interesting because you start to take on like really large Everyday Use cases Transportation Telecom food delivery energy um I think those can be a back door into um into mainstream adoption without forcing people to to answer the question like do you care about crypto or does crypto help you in any way um but yeah I think I think one of the things that um culturally was interesting to me in 2020 about crypto is like this is a lot more interesting becoming a part of the financial world mostly As investors like the Robin Hood um came out obviously like 2015 or so but there's just a lot more interest in in combining Financial products with social experiences that I think could be really interesting and probably more um to me like more fun than a lot of web 2 social products but um yeah the jury's out on U.S crypto and whether there's an everyday utility um so we'll see I know there's a lot of interest in the real world assets um I know you mentioned Nick Carter was on the show I saw an interesting tweet yesterday where he said stable coins are product Market fit encrypted like that was his take was we have product marketer with stable coins um my limit test I lived in Kansas City when I started my Tech Career in kind of like when you go to non-tech hubs do do people care to talk about crypto and um the answer is no they don't the most part and so I think it's early to say that crypto has any mainstream utility um but that's okay because again it's still like relatively early in the experiment though right I've seen your so your tweets talk about how like the experiment's been running for quite a while um so you'd hope that we see that at some point foreign yeah I actually um so I'm in a hotel in Istanbul right now and saw one of the people with a board API Club shirt so uh you know great utility there so you just said you're quite like interested in deepen and uh same I think it's a really interesting idea are there like um so let's maybe talk about verticals and crypto are there any verticals you think are underrated in crypto um I know like some people like are super either bearish on gaming or like bullish but like what do you what do you think about the different verticals like payment C5 Etc yeah I think um I personally like haven't given up on the idea of um nfts being a great primitive for community formation and in kind of alignment around something together like probably the most interesting experience experiments in the last full Market where um and if you've seen like archive they're building you can co-own a museum together and choose what part you purchase and um you own a physical product in the real world um obviously you probably selling style et cetera like I haven't given up on this idea um of like groups of people owning co-owning physical Assets in the real world I think that's pretty interesting to me tougher in a in a bear Market where everybody's feeling a bit poor to um to convince field to participate in these crazy ideas um we are spending a lot of time in deepen we also we were investors in ondo finance which um is kind of leading parts of the rwa um at least by volume they become one of the emerging startups in that ecosystem but yeah we're um I wouldn't say we have any specific vertical right now that's interesting to us but we are way more interested in applications than infrastructure would be one piece because I think our view is that the infrastructure is like sufficient at this point to um to run most of these experiments and see if people care because again like one of the things I've I've seen in my career is like if people really want something they see value they will um like they will they will work pretty hard to get through some of the the it's a little Connor was saying earlier but at least with the early adopters like they'll go through some crap to to try a product if the reward's great enough and so um yeah the infrastructure is the infrastructure investing right now I think is um kind of a retreat to like safety and um I don't think that's what's needed right now for crypto to succeed and you mentioned Dapper labs and Top Shot I know I remember you know at that time that was like the hottest thing in the space like to this day I think it's still reached like normally it's probably more than any other project is there anything that you think like if a project came to you similar to topshot today like would you invest is there anything that maybe you think they did wrong or something that we've learned since then that would make that sustainable yeah I think probably what they did right was recognize that intellectual property is a great shortcut to adoption with any um products it could be technology products I'm sure I don't know if you guys have seen the Barbie movie yet but uh like the Barbie franchise has been around for I don't know 50 plus years and did over a billion dollars and box office revenue um already and I know people at Mattel and they've been sitting on that IP for 30 years trying to think about how they can make a movie um and so I think top charts really understood that leveraging existing interest in in this case Sports primarily was a great shortcut to bring in normies into crypto I think I don't know we haven't we've obviously seen like a ton of uh different pitches that have that mindset but it feels like we always try and create new things in crypto um with generative art or um especially with like the pfp world and maybe like going back to that shortcut could be interesting in saying hey it gives a really interesting known IP we can leverage should bring people back into the space and um I don't know the I don't know if we'd invest in another like Dapper type of project right now because frankly like we feel like we made that bet a couple years ago and we're so waiting to see how um how it plays out but we are we are interested broadly and the utility that nfts can provide to community formation and um view it as being a uh as merch said like a pretty good way to bootstrap a early community so while we're on the topic of products this is going to be not related to crypto but I'm really curious on your thoughts here Jeff I was listening to a talk by Chief from Founders fund um and he he said something like the advice that you should talk to your users as a product manager is actually like backwards like he thinks of Building Products as almost like um creating a movie right like you don't ask a lot of people on the street like hey what movie do you want to see you instead you know just build uh or you know create the movie and then obviously the common wisdom is to talk your users iterate and whatnot how do you like obviously you're a big product like what are your thoughts on that how should people think about building products um yeah it's probably like a very it's Steve Jobs mindset your users don't know what they want type of um which I think is is largely true in consumer it's hard to imagine what the next great consumer experience would look like for the best product people and so to ask a user what that might be I think in B2B SAS or Enterprise Products you normally can go to a customer be like hey if we added like I don't know if we're like stuck too compliant like would you buy this product and they'd tell you yes or no or um kind of like the that's why I don't actually build Sasser Enterprise Products myself because it's often it's often like very um it can be like a lip formulaic as to what that path looks like but for Consumer I I would largely agree I would say anyone who has like really strong takes on how to build consumer products it's kind of like self-help books like everybody has like a different um idea on what it takes and nobody nobody really knows um as like I I've worked with I think some of the best product people in consumer software and you know Sean ride at Tinder Jonathan padine like all these guys like it is hard to know what is going to work in the way Tinder phonics its success was they ran a bunch of experiments and stumbled upon dating as being the original Tinder product was a networking app that that swipes the cards were supposed to be business cards and then they're like this isn't working for business so let's try dating now overnight like they're like holy [ __ ] this is like this definitely is working um but it wasn't like it wasn't something you could read in a book or users could tell you is just a lot of experiments in um so yeah I see I see a lot of consumer Founders who come in and Pitch ideas like they know they know what the outcome's going to be and the truth is nobody ever knows and the best people I've invested in just take a very um they're very low ego but High like hide Builder energy but low ego is what we look for so people who uh we invest in this company called captions it's not a web 3 product but it's basically when you watch like any video on Tick Tock or Twitter now and there's captions on the short form video they're probably providing those captions and they were the experiments team at snap that built they built over 100 consumer experiences at snap and captions which is now really taken off was like their sixth idea they tried at this company and but their mindset just like ship things move on like another thing consumer Founders do a lot is they're like they're like call you and they're like do I have product Market fit and you're like come on like you'll you will know when your product Market did because like you'll just look at your data in the morning you'll be like this is growing faster than we can keep up with and there was no explanation as to why that's happening often it's just like it catches the right cultural moment and takes off in a really it's it's something you just can't explain and so um anyways that's probably one of my favorite questions it's like if you call me if you call me and ask you about if you're a product market like the answers no so don't don't call yeah I like your point on experimentation too I know you I maybe you had a tweet on this you're talking about like how you found like what the charge at Tinder and obviously you guys found something people wanted going from business cards to dating everyone wants to go on dates everyone wants to make money which is like crypto why speculation is so good and I saw you were experimenting with like what do we charge here and you started with 9.99 for some subscription tier and people are like you're crazy No One's Gonna Pay that well it did and then you charge like 39.99 a month for Twitter gold and and that was like your highest grossing product ever so just like experimentation trying it out and if you find something people like they'll pay for it um something that you talk about often is like finding uh when you're looking at Founders is their earned secret um I'm curious if maybe explain that but I'm what do you think your earned secret is that puts you as you know you're in you're investing in crypto and web three but like you could quit any day and be the head of product to any company so I'm just curious like what puts you what is an earned secret and like what puts you in this position to want to be here and invest in this space yeah so uh the earned secret idea is actually something a guy named Mike Maples tummy who's a plug gape it's like if you were to like let's start with like Garrett and mert when you're like five years old and look at your entire life story where you what were you interested in as a kid kind of what were your hobbies what do you study in high school what do you sit in college what were your jobs that didn't work what were the jobs that did work and like success and heartbreak along the way that I've informed your point of view on the world let all lead to this idea that you have discovered through a lot of um combined life experiences that make you the one-of-one person to solve any given problem in the world and so it's kind of a an exercise of trying to really be introspective and self-aware around kind of like what your unique gift is in the world that allows you to see some problem and solution differently than everybody else um and so that's pretty it's a pretty like heavy um way of looking at at kind of like your life Arc and trying to identify what your uniquely suited to do in other Tech or anything else to create value in the world it's a pretty drawn out process it's actually very hard in the crypto like bull markets ever even have this conversation with anybody because you had 20 minutes to be on a zoom call with somebody and if I was to take like 20 minutes and ask mert about the person who broke his heart in high school or whatever like it probably you're probably like hang up like call um but yeah it's and so I think for uh me I'm I I don't know if I have like that answer today I think who knows it Tinder that um I was pretty good at building dating products because I um had like along journey to I'm not married but um like I went through the craziest ups and downs in relationships I was single for a long time I used Okay Cupid I used every dating product unmatchable like I knew that product very well um I don't think that's like my my purpose in the world but I think I was uniquely suited as the the peer product there to build some pretty great products within that category because I had just been a customer for so long of of different dating products and so when we meet Founders I want to figure out like how we always call the idea maybe like have you gone through the idea amazed of like every Twist and Turn of an idea to try and figure out what the right entry point to market news and um trying to figure out like how the depth of the founder on what they're trying to build um so yeah and then in terms of my life Journey like I actually had a pretty non-traditional potent adventure and um after I was an English major I went to film school after USC film school when I was 22. tried to be a screenwriter like know how hard the creative process is and took those learnings and applied it to building software um but anything like that involves creators or like that group of people like I've experienced the ups and downs of of That World um and tried to make it and have and failed pretty pretty bad um and so I think I just have like a point of view on like what the life of a struggling artist feels like and have applied that to investing um yeah yeah no I love the answer I love the answer I love that you went to film school too you went from that to getting into product well I think you went from you were living in San Francisco and you moved all the way to Kansas City um I'm from Arkansas so I can like relate to that area of the world you know one thing that I actually think this outside of crypto is like it would help Founders if they actually like get out and um maybe speak to people and see other people and part of the world because like when I go from like I'm in New York if I go from New York to Arkansas like you you learn that there's a whole other world out there and sometimes maybe like the people you're building for you realize like that's such a small contingent of your future users um and you I think that probably benefited you a lot seeing like people in California to go into Kansas City um maybe on one thing that I saw you tweet and I think this is like really um positive for builders in the space you said that right now until I was in 23 with all the platform shifts that we're seeing that this is maybe the best spinach of I think it's a platform shifts or products that that you're seeing as an investor and Builder right now talks about like AR and VR um so I'm curious if you can just expand on that because I think that's like a really powerful message for people that right now are like kind of Doom and Gloom you know bear Market yeah so I think we um you 've been your career hope that you can be a part of maybe like two to three platform shifts as a founder and if you're lucky you'll get to build a product that catches that wave at the right moment in time and I think the um at least like 2000 2016 to 2020 especially the application layer we're pretty yeah crypto is exciting but um it's like a pretty boring set of problems to solve and I think we we reach on the mobile still still going it's not going anywhere but like I feel like the big categories were like salt war and then we we looked at crypto as being maybe like the next um platform shift and suddenly I think while crypto is still um one of those places to build you have the Apple Vision Pro coming out which you know I would think face and Apple's track record that that will have some level of success I'm not sure what it'll look like but you have AR VR you have crypto you have ai which is an incredible place to build kinsu applications right now because people are so eager to try anything AI related um and then on the other side of the spectrum you have I think a lot of really interesting products Within defense Tech space like there's just like a huge spectrum of categories that you can build in whereas I feel like maybe like five years ago it's like okay are you building a mobile app or a B2B product and it was kind of like the the the range of companies so yeah I think like one thing I would say to people in crypto and it's probably not like the um the message everybody says is it's okay to experiment with ideas outside of crypto too for a period of time or it's okay to take your interest in crypto and combine that with another category and see like what the petri dish of of of like ideas like what what you can create with that um I think there's a mentality in crypto if somebody were to like go try something that wasn't squarely within crypto they're almost like it's like they're like pushed out of the community um but maybe it's maybe like building something within another sector and then combining your your background in crypto like maybe that creates the next best product that creates the new bull market if that makes sense um and so I think right now you know bear market like the stakes are pretty low in a getaway where you can go like try some crazy ideas and see what um what you create and I would encourage people to take a very broad view of what that might be what are your thoughts on let's say you're a you know a company building on chain X and you go multi-chain to get more users um or maybe go cross chain what are your thoughts on that do you think like because there's two schools of thoughts on this or thought on this which is like well maybe one you actually want to get users outside of crypto that should be the main goal yeah or you know you get users that are power users on the other chains first like what what are your thoughts on that yeah um I know probably like the best example I have seen and obviously has had different reactions would be D gods and um their view is that every chain has a unique user base and to really expand your project like you should be thinking of ways to go across chain so you can reach as many people as possible um I think where the I don't have um as much religion towards any channels as I think um other people in the space and so from a business strategy perspective I think that is an interesting idea um which is like hey again maybe maybe we'll like go back to web 2 would you release a mobile app on iOS and you have International users on Android devices and not buildable as people like um You probably like the business strategy would probably be like hey let's let's think about how we can build an Android application too and so um I don't know if that if like that if you guys agree with that but I think from a um I think there are business reasons why that makes sense and um I think the The Narrative is what is more challenging is like if you build on Solana first and you go to the theory ecosystem and like are you is that you saying hey Solana is not a great place to build an nft project um yeah I don't think that should be the takeaway of the message but often that's what is the like that's what I see on Twitter and um but I don't have strong views on what's right which is wrong other than I think from a like addressable Market perspective that does end up um for some projects being a reality like what happens when you saturate any given chain and you need to grow your audience like where do you go to find new users and um I think different ecosystems have different types of users and you know The View on some changes is that they're harder to monetize than others and so that's another part of the the kind of the conversation too yeah and related to that I think it's difficult now with with ethereum you just have like ethereum L1 like if you're watching ethereum you know where everybody's going um and now you have you know Roll-Ups and they're all Frameworks and l1's l2s l3s um and then distribution in some ways becomes a problem um obviously right now crypto is all about liquidity and I I to me at least it's something that like Solana for example has in its favor obviously some other ecosystems do too and that like if you're a builder and you want to go to an ecosystem it's like you build there on Solana on L1 whereas today like merch talking about going cross-chain but like where do you go and eventually like you're only going to be able to support so many places it'd be like if you had to build for like 20 different operating systems not just IOS and Android um yeah how do you think maybe this is almost the same answer how do you think about the importance of distribution and like maybe owning that customer touch point and and by that I mean like you're the front end and the customer knows who you are like they know uniswap and unit swap is building a wallet versus you know depend I don't know where distribution even goes because we don't have an app store in crypto right now you have you know backpack and Solana and so forth but how do you think about distribution and the importance of maybe owning that customer you know relationship um yeah I think there's two parts of one is distribution from like uh top lip funnel go to market it's like do you have the ability to successfully onboard people into your application get them to set up and then the second part of it is do you have some like do you have the communication channels or retention hooks maybe it's through some identity that you own to um kids seeing that relationship and I've learned in my career that distribution um I've been like very stubborn to reach this conclusion but distribution is more important than product in most cases um and you can build the best product ever but if nobody is aware of it or sees it um it's just never gonna succeed and so I think there's ways to build virality Within products that maybe can can earn more distribution um but that's why you see incumbents um most often win in consumer social because they have distribution advantages that are very high for a startup to overcome the um within crypto I don't think anybody has like a real distribution event outside of coinbase um and maybe maybe like metamask because they have what 26 million active wallets or whatever it is um and so I don't know if uniswap has a distribution Advantage but they have a brand awareness Advantage which is very hard to um to beat and so when I looked at at like brand awareness there market share of um their market share is comparable to Pepsi or Coke um with which which is pretty amazing to me and so without owning the user like I don't think uniswap knows that I use uniswap or if they do they've never communicated with me like I just think to go to uniswap one um when I want to execute a swap or or kind of like everyday trading um so yeah it's it's something that's that that I think is is hard to do in crypto right now and um it's almost like the more decentralize you want your project to become like at the core of that is trying to level the playing field up within distribution um and um like own users less than more centralized products and so it's it is I think this is all part of like the larger question around like um like is it possible to build a huge sustainable business well um while you know being a more decentralized as a um as a go to market so one thing or two things I'm super curious about uh Jeff you're you're a really good writer uh I for this show I read literally every single one of your posts all these like a good amount of them and um I'm you know as for people who want to be better writers like I'm curious on like maybe uh some writing tips that you might have and two um obviously you are a great product mind and I am curious with the lack of crypto products uh out there what is one thing that you hope people take away from you know maybe products thinking from web 2 that they can apply to web3 products yeah um I'll start with number one I I started my career in screenwriting which I mentioned earlier and if you read a screenplay it's like ever every word is there for a reason there's like no wasted um ribbage or words it's very Punchy and so I try to write um like a screenplay and really the um you need to come up with a hook that people care about and really within screenplays you have people who read screenplays for a living and you need to grab their attention on the first page um otherwise they literally like throw your script in a garbage can and move on to the next one because the the kind of the filter of what they need to do is um reading does like I've been this person who reads scripts and so I kind of view writings being like coming up with a hook and then um really like grabbing people's attention Within the first paragraph or two and and trying to convince them that spend more time with whatever you're trying to to communicate um writing tips with that they'd just be like whatever the voice in your head is try to write like that voice and try to make it as conversational as possible and to not think about having the perfect um sentence like just like try to write like your writing to your best friend or in a journal and people will prefer that to like fancy stylistic writing at least from what I've seen um in terms of consumer products in web 2 I think uh I always like love thinking about Madison's hierarchy of needs and you know like what do people actually need or want in the lives they want love to shelter security um and Trend like really take it back to the core of what people are trying to do to achieve whatever they're trying to achieve in this world so self-actualization I think is is a huge part of what makes products succeed um some of it's pretty vain but you know like this is a world we live in and so um I would try for crypto products to really think about like what are web 2 products that have worked in um what like why did they actually work not because they were built on some Technology stock it was like the visceral reaction of downloading Tinder for the first time like really got people excited like it was like holy [ __ ] like I have hundreds of people who I can now connect with and um it's like a I'm not like that like moment or like you guys probably remember when you used Uber for the first time it's like these magic moments where you're providing people with a shortcut in the world to enable them to live a better easier popular life um and if crypto can't do that then it's probably not going to be more than these Financial use cases which are also interesting but these aren't like I don't think like world changing um applications it we can't bring that out yeah that's a great answer I remember reading this book called um well it's by Rory Sutherland um and it's about like behavioral um economics and it talked about Uber and I think one thing that's interesting and I don't know where the supplies in crypto yet but you eventually see it coming in even though Uber by and far is a better product than just having a taxi he's like in some sense it's the it's the little things that are more psychological that actually make a big difference in a product and for example it's like calling your Uber you can see how far away it is and it might be 15 minutes away when you call a cab it might be 10 but just by giving that like screen where you can see where it is you have that certainty and that's a 10 times Improvement so it's like sometimes we're probably trying to improve like a quantitative measure when there are these qualitative Community aspects of products that we could we could build in crypto as well but um dude Jeff this was this was amazing um for this conversation this is uh kind of nerdy but you should definitely go back and read his tweets as well uh just pack to the information I think everybody in crypto needs it including myself need to know more about product because that will be the only reason we'll ever get out of uh this bear market so yeah thanks thanks so much for joining today yeah of course and we will get out of the bear market so everybody like uh like there's there there's light at the end of the road so I I would be excited to have this conversation in a couple years when things look uh look more positive and thanks for providing this for the community yeah amazing thanks for coming on and we'll see you next time all right [Music] [Music] [Music] bye
