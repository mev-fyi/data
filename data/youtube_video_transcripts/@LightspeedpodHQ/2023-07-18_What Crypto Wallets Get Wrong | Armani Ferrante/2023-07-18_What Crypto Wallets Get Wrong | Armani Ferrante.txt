I think when we saw a bunch of the salon ecosystem leaders move to other chains The Narrative was always I'm going to ethereum or I'm going to polygons I'm moving and in some cases it was like I'm removing all of my Solana Association and replacing it with ethereum Association whatever and to me that's like totally the wrong way to think about it it's like you don't want to like replace one pie for another pie you want to have both pies at the same time right especially if you're you know a startup trying to grow it's less about me going to other chains and it's more about like well bringing other chains to us [Music] hey everybody Welcome to the first episode of Lightspeed today we are joined by Armani Ferrante the founder behind backpack xnfts mad Lads coral and anchor development framework guys Beast Armani welcome to the show yeah thanks so much for having me I want to get right into it with The Gatekeepers of the crypto ecosystem with your wallets um today when you think about wallets often people relate to metamask Phantom Kepler there's a few others all competing to win the end user relationship what do people misunderstand about wallets oh great question what if you will misunderstand about wallets I think I don't know if people misunderstand anything in particular but I do think there are some maybe unfulfilled responsibilities of most wallets I think a wallet is basically the Gateway it's the entry point to any L1 ecosystem and so an l1's only as good as its best wallet right and so I think I mean we you bring up metamask as an example not to be like too harsh on them but I think it's important for for wallets to evolve at the same Pace that the ecosystem evolves at and I think you know in the Solana ecosystem you know anatoly's constantly talking about Solana in the context of like I know some constantly evolving open source software not something that like ossifies right um and so there's constantly new protocols uh that are being created new things like you know priority fees new things like you know nft protocols um interfaces um you know Das standards um all these things right and I think that it's a wallet's responsibility to keep up and I think that's one of the most not misunderstood things but one of the least talked about things uh about the growth potential of Any Given L1 ecosystem so it seems like you're you know basically saying that l1's kind of move fast right and it's on the wall to kind of keep up with those features to really showcase the chain otherwise you're kind of falling behind and I think we've seen this um on Solana and I think probably one thing that helps a lot with that is the fact that backpack is actually open source uh and so people can actually make contributions was that was that the main kind of driver behind that decision or like what do you think because there has been some successful loss without open source sport on Solana as well what do you think the reason there is I think a lot of people misunderstand my view or take on open source I actually don't really care if things are open source or not I care a lot about honesty and consistency and so you have to keep in mind that well the wallet is the central touch point it's a central piece of point of trust in a crypto ecosystem it's like okay sure like the core protocol has to be safe and secure smart contracts have to be safe and secure but really the wallet is the thing that's managing the private keys and when you sign something right you're putting all of your eggs into that basket and so if we're going to go out and like promote these permissionless systems well it's pretty important to know what the wallet is doing and so from that point of view it's quite valuable for a wallet to be open source and that's or not even open source source available um and and that is the reason why we started with backpack being kind of having a source available if it wasn't in crypto if if we were like building a wallet for I don't know Apple uh or Visa or Mastercard or whatever uh it probably wouldn't be um open source but it really is just about this point of like intellectual honesty and like consistency with what we're building and that's really where it's coming from yeah Armani on that I want to get into backpack and I I really like how you describe how being a wallet as they are today is almost table sakes and you relate that to the iPhone I'm wondering if you can describe that analogy that you have for the audience then give us a high level of what backpack is yeah so I mean the story I like to give is when the iPhone first came out how like how is Steve Jobs talking about it right um he called it as like I don't know it's like this internet Computing advice it's like okay well what does that mean right um you know you had phones at the time you had like blackberries you know there that was like probably the closest thing to a smartphone and it's like okay you can call and text people it's like but that's not exactly right because an iPhone can do so much more than just call and text people you have this like Rich developer ecosystem you have an app store you have browsers uh you have the ability to access rich on device capabilities and like any one of those things can describe an iPhone but none of them are necessarily correct like internet Computing device what's that mean it's like a router is it a switch it's not a browser but there's a browser in it it's like all these different things right and so you ask the question like what's an iPhone well it's like I don't know you put all these things together and what comes out it's like I don't know the iPhone comes out and I think that is kind of the orientation when thinking about kind of a wallet right it's like it's not like an asset manager even though like you know the majority of the value today comes from getting access to your private keys and managing your tokens in your nfts but really what it is it's like a blockchain Computing device if you want to call it that put in those terms it's like the central point of potential touch point that gives you access to all of the data and the blockchain right and so with backpack we've taken the approach where is starting goal is like thinking about how do we get every protocol and every blockchain inside of a single user interface and take this kind of iphone-esque approach where you can build an awesome flagship consumer kind of product and do it in a way that positions it more as a platform and as an open ecosystem that anybody can build on um while we're on this topic actually I do have because you're obviously a pretty well known and uh you know let's say let's say a Founder I align myself with a lot I look up to you in in most of your takes um one thing that's interesting and the fact that you mentioned Apple kind of brings me back because I was actually at blackberry and blackberry was trying to compete with apple and obviously that didn't work out so well um obviously wallets are super competitive right now um or maybe I don't know if I bet it was right where but there's a lot of wallets out there how do you as a Founder think about competition broadly but also specifically in hasn't released the wallets I think the name of the game is demand generation it doesn't matter what you're building like block space is a pundit I think there's a lot of incredible infrastructure out there nowadays especially you know on Solana but I think demand is from my point of view the thing that I've prioritized it's like how do you generate demand and whoever can generate demand can operate in Greenfield and there's a ton of wallets out there there's ton of nft marketplaces out there this is kind of like the two products that I would point to as like the single most competitive knife fights in crypto that's because the barrier entries both of them are low there's not really any any moat in either of them you know there's some distribution effects that's maybe hard to like transfer your private Keys over from like metamaster Phantom or from Phantom to backpack or whatever but you don't have to be competing like that right I think it's pretty well understood that the number of users in crypto is relatively low when looking at you know the big Flagship consumer applications in web 2. and so as a Founder it's always kind of maybe it hasn't always been it is my view as of today that you know P or teal is right and that competitions for losers and that we should be focusing all of our energy not on trying to kill our competitors on on growing the pie so to speak if you want to put it in those terms but that's very much how I'm oriented I don't know as of right now yeah that makes sense and you were talking about how wallets and talking about the iPhone and phone is the table Stakes but there's so much more to it you talk about what you're doing at backpack um to build that Network similar to what the iPhone is where it's not just a wallet but it goes beyond that and I think while you answer that I will probably answer the question like why why would I choose backpack as a user yeah totally I mean there's the the the starting impetus of the entire project was really this concept of xnfts where the idea is really simple honestly in my opinion pretty unimaginative where instead of just like tokenizing an image we can tokenize code right on-chain you know applications or on-chain WeChat midi programs if you want to put in those terms wechats like the analogy everybody loves CU and web3 but let's just tokenize code and have a plug-in system where you can have some nice set of apis and build an application ecosystem around it it's as simple as that and you have some nice Primitives right you have Key Management as a primitive the ability to sign transactions not just on Solana but anywhere you have user identity right you have some addresses that are associated with you you have your username you have maybe a nice profile picture maybe you have a social graph right you have friends the ability to look up you know mert and Garrett on a blockchain see their address see what their address is maybe go look at their nfts maybe like go propose to barter with them maybe bid on one of their nfts or something like that right we could start building out this application ecosystem and make our web3 experiences you know as rich or richer than where you know that we're used to in web 2 right where we're all kind of on this we're all in the same database right but none of the applications are built in a way that kind of leverages it and so with backpack and with the wallet it's really taking the point of view that like there should be much more UI level composability with heterogeneous protocols and apps on a blockchain than currently exists today so you are a very big proponent of distribution um so in the conversation of you know is a product was a distribution you know which one as a Founder do you focus on so you have this tweet you know distribution wins Facebook was just a MySpace clone which was just a Francis clone with novel distribution through universities and iteration along the way is that can you maybe talk to us about how you think about product and distribution especially as it how it relates to crypto and wallets I think there's many different ways to achieve distribution and I think where that quote is coming from is I think a lot of there's a saying that I didn't make this up some some thought leader VC and Silicon Valley made this up where first-time Founders focus on product and second time Founders focus on distribution and I think uh that's very much how I feel but I think also good product can lead to good distribution particularly when you're operating when you're first mover operating in Greenfield right so like you know Bitcoin got distribution because it was the first blockchain and now it's the most powerful Meme and it doesn't matter what you think about the tech it doesn't matter if you think it's slow it doesn't matter if you think it has any real world use case it's not going to go anywhere it's probably never going to go anywhere it's the strongest brand in crypto and that's because it has Distribution on on the meme and that's that's Zero Sum there can't be another Bitcoin um some will try there are some like meme coins maybe Dogecoin is the closest thing where it was able to carve out its own meme where it's like you know it's not necessarily the decentralized censorship resistance or value but it's like the cute dog or whatever we all kind of laugh and play and and it moves but I think both of those things are are good examples of distribution winning and it was and it was you know it happened that distribution happened because it was Innovative right it was their first movers Bitcoin just first proof of a work chain and and and Dogecoin was the first meme coin so yeah so yeah I think product is important but with that said you know I think very rarely does the first mover always win right you I think in the context we're talking about that tweet in the context of threads where a lot of people were looking at threads that I doing what I did as you know a teenager when I saw Myspace and when I saw Facebook come up I was like all my friends were going to Facebook I'm like why are all my friends going to Facebook like Myspace is great like it's a better product like we're all here you know you can play music Facebook again and play music right it's like why are we like doing the exact same thing but on another platform um you know in a way that's like maybe less compelling and and you know I don't can't think of any good example any good reason other than well that's what like all the cool kids were doing right because I don't know all the colleges were doing it um and so everybody moved over like almost overnight honestly that was like probably like that that's burned into my head I don't know why it is but it like maybe I love the Myspace so much I like love music and then I was like really wanted my my top eight profile uh and my carefully curated CSS uh to not go away but um I think that's I I think it's super important it's like why is the Reds useful or why is threads interesting I think a lot of people are mid-curbing it there's like oh yeah the network effects on Twitter all the smart people are on Twitter all of our followers on Twitter let's just stay on Twitter but it's like no that's missing the point the reason why threads is really important is because you get this entirely new set of people that weren't otherwise using Twitter now exposed to this form factor I think it's kind of safe to say that like the set of people at least in my network the set of people that are using Twitter is mostly disjoint from the set of people using Instagram and Facebook it's like very self-selected group of weirdos that are in the Twitter sphere that I think we can all relate to um Instagram sorry flashy right you want to show photos you want to you know it's look how awesome my life is Twitter is like a war zone right we're all gonna debate and and get into fights with people um that are you know Anonymous on the internet yeah yeah exactly exactly you know mert but when threats came around when I looked at it I I saw an opportunity to grow my own personal following and network right where I'm like oh like all the people that use Instagram they have no idea who I am they have no idea what my tweets are uh and we've sharpened our knives and and and trained with this interesting form factor and now it's being applied to this new you know Network right everybody on Facebook and Instagram and so I saw that as like an opportunity to not kill Twitter but to bootstrap off that existing Network effect and apply the form factor to it and to me that's why it was exciting it's like distribution in the new level especially because Instagram and Facebook have I don't know at least an order of magnitude more users than Twitter does um when you when you think about threads like I just got it thrives a few days ago and you know it's connected to your Instagram which you see some people don't really like it like doesn't matter or not how do you think about that in crypto because um people talk about like do you want to have one identity that's used across different apps and it is true like I'm a different person on Instagram than I am on Snapchat and on Twitter and Linkedin is that something that you can do on backpack or how do you think that can work in crypto I think with backpack we took a very restrictive small First Step where we said let's just be pseudo-anonymous and use nfts only as profile pics so it's very it's very twitter-esque um because that's a one-way door as soon as you start introducing real identity you don't go back and so that was kind of I wouldn't say I have like a super comprehensive view on what the correct answer is but we very much are trying to keep our options open there and nfts and pseudo-anonymity is what makes crypto special I feel so it makes the subculture um unique it might not always be that way but it's certainly what makes it special today so while we're on the topic of maybe threads versus Twitter I think maybe an interesting parallel is kind of multi-chain versus picking a single chain and while we're also on the topic of distribution how do you think about you know as a wallet you're obviously you're actually multi-chain uh you are on Solana and ethereum what do you think is the right thing to do in terms of distribution do you should should the products go to different chains to increase their distribution or should their main goal be attracting people to come onto that chain because most people aren't in crypto to begin with I think neither I think I think I mean not to throw too much shade at anybody in particular but I think when we saw a bunch of the salon ecosystem leaders move to other chains The Narrative was always I'm going to ethereum or I'm going to polygon right I'm moving and in some cases it was like I'm I'm I'm removing all of my Solana Association and replacing it with ethereum Association whatever and to me that's like totally the wrong way to think about it it's like you don't want to like replace one pie for another pie you want to you want to have both pies at the same time right especially if you're you know a startup trying to grow um and so from my point of view it's less about me going to other chains and it's more about like well bringing other chains to us right and you saw this with like the Mad Lads drop where you know we got a bunch of folks from ethereum just because you know we started in ethereum we know a lot of folks in ethereum and we had them come to backpack get some soul download the app admit um and that's because you know they thought mad Labs was cool backpack but was an interesting experiment and we we want to bring them to us right um and so I I think that is like the moral orientation and maybe the best product that you see this in is it just exchanges right nobody views coinbase as like an ethereum or a Bitcoin or a Solana project right it's just coinbase and I think that's the positioning that people should take especially with nft projects I feel like nfts in particular like that world I mean I guess there is a a lot of tribalism but I I feel like the biggest nft projects won't be associated with any given chain it's like if Disney wanted to create an nft project it'd be the biggest nft project in the world and nobody would view it as like an ethereum thing or a Solana thing they would just view it as Disney and I think that's the scale that you need to get to if you're like a venture-backed startup and that's not really a way that a lot of people are oriented today on that thought on distribution what do you think backpacks like key feature is to win I don't know if it only if it'd be users from metamask or the new users that come into the ecosystem and to me I think maybe part of that is I've heard you say that mobile is like the most important uh Computing Paradigm that exists right now and then that's something that it seems that backpacks focus on that other wallets like metamask or maybe missing out yeah I think getting distribute there's a bunch of Novel ways to get distribution but it basically boils down to how do you get people into crypto that aren't currently in crypto that's basically what you want to do and I think there's a bunch of different ways we've been thinking about it the first way it was like all right let's just experiment with whacking new ideas so like accent it's useful it's like the first wacky new idea um mad Lads was like the second big component to that where we thought to ourselves all right let's just like try to build a native web3 kind of brand but then let's throw out the whole web 3 part and let's just like build a normal brand let's like build our own version of Red Bull and then like if that's dope and cool and we have cool content and we have a bunch of like people that like I don't know big wave surfing and jackass content and Motocross and snowboarding and stuff like this then like they'll probably also like crypto as well and like let's introduce them to the crypto part later but let's like separate the brand separate the brand from backpack and spin off mad Lads it's in the same company same set of people but we very intentionally separated those two things so that we can get Distribution on a non-crypto level um and then and then use that as like a top of funnel to bring down into crypto and that was like a very intentional thing uh nfts it's kind of its own world and its own kind of strategic considerations in its own storytelling and its own form of marketing and building products and stuff like that of that but I think that was one small example like something that we started to do um and so that's kind of like running as its own kind of life form at this point and then there's a bunch of kind of other new product things like you know you got new things that have never been done before that's basically what it comes down to if you're building things that have been done before you're wasting your time um and the wallet is very much just like the table Stakes starting point for a lot of this stuff so things like Soul abstraction are like new ideas right where it's like all right well we have all these things we have smart contracts we have a wallet we have xnfts what happens when you put all three of those things together and then out of that you you need all three of those things to get Soul abstract I can talk about that later but um so so yeah these are kind of like what were some of the first early ideas um and we certainly haven't succeeded we haven't gotten to the point that we want to get to yet but this is certainly how we're thinking about it and there's a bunch of other miscellaneous kind of experiments that we're trying to kind of do to like kind of figure out how we can build new things right things like the social graph on backpack things like messaging things like nft gated group chats all these kind of basic things that that are valuable from the point of view of like less of I'm trying to beat Telegram and more of coming at it from the perspective of like oh I'm already on a blockchain I'm already have a wallet How can I make use of that to do things like I don't know peer-to-peer nft barter right um and so it's like these kind of new like products that a lot not a lot of people have really done before surprisingly and so yeah I mean there's a bunch of stuff that's coming out like in the next year that we're working on like new product experiments a couple there's a couple no-brainer things I think yeah that if you think about it really hard in the context of a wallet it will pop out of your head [Music] hey everyone we get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that is the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech Roll-Ups account abstraction Mev app chains and more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener of live speed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show so yeah Saga and you have an app store and you can develop apps there for for crypto projects and then you have X and FTS and I think I've heard you say that xnfts could show up in that App Store as well like it just wouldn't be on backpack um why I guess if you have an X nft of a project or a protocol and then you also have like a native app to say something like an iOS or Android like why would you use the xnft like why would you use the backpack scenario because I've heard the I think the I don't know if he's the founder or one of the people that worked on the Saga phone he talks about how Native apps can take advantage of like the iPhone capabilities and so forth that xnfcs can't so I'm just curious how you think about that on how a native app versus an xnft would win and why you would pick one or the other yeah I think I mean they're definitely not mutually exclusive I mean all the next nft is it's a special file format that's it um an NFC just a file um and what's in that file and what it points to is more or less up to you I think it can be a native app it can be a website it can be your Oculus goggle binary it can be your you know Apple carplay kind of system it's up to you um I think the main difference at the product level is that X nfts as they're currently built auto connect to wallets so you remove that point of friction uh but beyond that maybe the best analogy is thinking about Native iOS Android apps versus WeChat mini programs that's basically what it is right where you have apps that hook into something an existing ecosystem or Facebook games or Facebook plugins messaging plugins iMessage plugins those are those are all xcmts um and that's more or less how I think about the difference between the two other more or less isomorphic if you want them to be nice big word nice and working yeah we need to drop a few more of those um well it's okay you just mentioned or not just mentioned but you just talked about how you you guys actually start in ethereum and then kind of came over to Solana so let's let's kind of dig into that why Solana I think okay so contacts came into crypto I think 2017 started on ethereum started working on l2s was really interested in scaling Solutions right at the time ethereum the whole concept of world computers like the coolest idea ever just like brought in like every kind of engineer into the space I was interested in like making computers go fast um and at the time a bunch of l1s got funded solanos was one of those because the Prospect and idea of a world computer was like the most exciting thing at the time but it was very much an unfulfilled dream and so the ethereum community started thinking about all this stuff um namely started thinking in two directions the first Direction was sharding um in the section Direction was l2's um I pretty quickly like didn't like the idea of sharding um for various reasons not to go into them um but I thought um l2s are pretty cool so I started exploring and learning about l2s um and started you know looking into State channels looking into plasma these are kind of things that were like kind of their early ideas that were the precursors into what became Roll-Ups which is now like the dominant kind of ethereum scaling narrative at this point and I thought to myself well like there's I don't know got to be other more traditional ways of doing this I felt like in hindsight I think a lot of the ideas at the time were thinking about all of this crazy like new like language like crypto economics and fraud proofs and and all this like crazy stuff at the times but nobody was thinking oh how do we just like build a parallel transactions and transaction processing system like every other database in the world uses um and so started looking for kind of like new L ones about that time the first one that I found was uh Oasis uh Oasis well it's a company that spun out of a research group at Berkeley um and the whole idea there was well sharding has like fixed scaling um throughput right because you can't Shard A Shard eventually you if you have a fixed number of shards it's a constant uh you know a content sized uh performance input and then that's the upper bound and you don't go beyond that right and so they thought okay well instead of scaling with sharding what if you scale with like multiple different tender committees and then you have linear sharding with or excuse me linear scaling with respect to these groups um and as long as the rewrite sets don't conflict then you get like infinite scaling um and that was that was the first kind of idea it's like oh yeah that's that's a pretty cool idea that sounds like morally speaking the right way to think about it right scaling in every other sense of the term is linear it's not like some constant increase um and so that was the first kind of company I I joined that was like outside of the ethereum ecosystem where we were exploring these kind of like new ideas that didn't work out for a bunch of reasons turns out building L1 is really hard and building startups really hard um and then Solano was the next one that I saw that had this same property except it was linear with respect to Hardware um and and you know using kind of these kind of more traditional kind of systems techniques um and that was basically what drew me to it at the beginning and so you you obviously like when you joined it was it was the early days right like there was nobody there just everything was pretty awful and and you were kind of like I remember we got a tweet about like um if if you're at the stage where the docs are already there you're too late like this is kind of the opportunity like why did you stick around why did you why were you like okay I'm gonna build anchor for this network I believe in it um is it just because like totally is very handsome like what is the rationale for for uh why'd you stick around that is a great question Okay so people seem to forget how extraordinary the initial conditions for Solana are they're like truly incredible like very hard to recreate might be impossible to recreate so the historical context is about I think when I started paying attention it was summer 2020. D5 summer this was the start of like the last major bull market where we were riding off of the extreme moral lows of the bear Market you know 2017 2018 to work great times 2019 started to get scary and basically everybody started leaving crypto and that bear Market I don't know if you're guys remember this it felt morally so much worse than this spare Market it felt like we weren't sure if this thing is actually going to actually stay around um now it's like we all kind of know crypto's not going anywhere there's people that like to you know saving things online but you know it's too big at this point to where the cat's out of the bag but it really felt like we were it really felt like no this isn't going anywhere um and then defy summer happened and everyone and seemingly their mother were yield farming vegetables um and you know and SBF in particular had this incredible Saga with the sushi swap vampire attack and then Chef Nomi and maki's kind of Chef Nomi I guess Fall From Grace right where they vampire they successfully vampire attack uniswap Sushi swap goes to the moon everybody loves it and then all of a sudden the founder seemingly rugs and then you know SPF is like the prince of crypto at the time it's crazy to say this out loud it's absolutely insane to say this out loud but but this is what people were thinking it's like at the time he was the god everybody loved him everybody was talking about him as like the the savior of defy summer and crypto right I use this like genius kind of um traitor that was eel farming to Valhalla and making all this money um and I was work I before FDX started I was actually at Alameda uh for three months so um between my time leaving apple and going into ethereum land I had this like three month stint where when Alameda was very first getting started trading in crypto um I I was working on the trading systems there I left because you know I was more interested in working on ethereum than I was in doing um you know building a market maker but I digress anyway so um but but people were or I I particularly saw this at the time and you know it was it was like this incredible thing where you know we're back the bull market seems to be coming back um and and this thing called Solano was created right and the promise at the time was that on-chain decentralized censorship resistant immutable NASDAQ and that was just like the coolest thing ever it's like okay uniswap was the big thing at the time Sushi swap came around it showed how much excitement and passion there was for defy everybody was yield farming but we can bring this up a whole another level by using order books like amms or capital and efficient order books is like what the regular World uses like everybody that was interested in trading um and was taking a look at kind of D5 I was like well why don't these things exist and it turned out well you need a fast blockchain and that blockchain now exists um and so this was the narrative at the time that was just super exciting it brought in so many people from tradfi people not only from from defile and ethereum but also people from you know jump came in um folks from Citadel came in like all these more traditional trading firms just started kind of looking at the space and people a lot of really smart Engineers started looking at Solana for this reason it's very different now than it was back then but now it's like Salon is very much an nft chain but back then it was very much like we're people who identified as Traders went to Solana to explore defy and you had this Inc you know incredibly well capitalized um backer right that invested heavily into the chain SPF was on Twitter saying you know buy all your soul at three dollars like give it to me or off or whatever you know he was you know The Golden Child of the industry pumping all this Capital into and time into Solana it was just like I don't know it it was just like a really special point in time for a new network I mean in hindsight again it's crazy to say that with everything that we know today but you know at the time if you put yourselves in the shoes of your regular person in crypto this was a a really magical kind of six month period where everything kind of started you talked about how when Anatolia was first building Solana it was a position of the NASDAQ on chain and you just said that now it's an nft chain in a way is that how you think Solana should position itself or what do you think the branding is for Solano because it seemed to change over the last year I kind of like fundamentally believe that you don't choose product Market fit product Market fit chooses you and that very much is what happened with nfts especially given the network downtime like D5 just doesn't work if the Network's down I mean that's been changing significantly over the past year it's been a ton of really incredible improvements to the core Network where D5 2.0 is people are are calling it on Twitter these days is coming back on Solana and I think we'll see a rebirth I mean I'm optimistic who knows what will happen but I would love to see a rebirth and Resurgence and energy being put into it because I do think that recreating all of the very very flawed you know economic engines of the world on something like a blockchain just makes a ton of sense and so I do think we'll see that change over time but nfts were just so exciting and it was such a great way to get people into crypto that it chose Solana because it was fast right and and and I think it's hard to say what will happen in the future but I think there's a lot of desire to bring D5 back you said product Market fit chooses you right it's like maybe the the wand in Harry Potter um what do you think about metaplex just for some context to the read or listeners metaplex I'm just going to do a quick uh crash course here on ethereum you have standards and interfaces and um the nft standard is is is is uh shared interface that anybody can kind of inherit from but on Salon um um you have kind of these centralization risks with one program kind of controlling the entire landscape until interfaces go live and to date um all nfts on Solana have went through the Megaplex program um so that's kind of metaplexible on this so what do you think about them do you think um they've done a good job so far would you like to see this on the nfcu system evolve going forward I think that they built something that became so popular that it outgrew them that's basically how I feel about it um and it and it exposed not a problem with them it exposed a problem with Solana which is that Solana does not have either the tooling or the social processes to create robust interfaces which is a super important piece of social technology as much as it is a piece of developer technology to be able to solve a lot of these messy human level problems I don't think any of us on the network think that it's a good idea that a single for-profit entity can control the asset standard for the entire ecosystem of you know of players right just creates so many problems especially when you're trying to build a competitive business that might be competing with the owner of that like you can't that this is maybe a a point that is often overlooked but a lot of people think that like open source happens because people want to feel warm and fuzzy inside open source often happens there's some people that are passionate about it and there's you know incredible folks like I don't know free software Foundation that fundamentally believe that that it's important but it really comes down to incentives I feel where if you want a bunch of competitive disparate businesses like let's say Google Apple Mozilla uh Etc Brave you know you need neutral standards so that they can put the future of their business on it right they can bet on it right they know it's not going to get pulled out from under them in an anti-competitive way and only with that can you have buy-in and I think that's super important and that is the piece that is that was missing and that metaplex or all of the associated metaplex problems Exposed on Solana and I think the solutions are there I think we just need to execute on them as an ecosystem and I don't think it was anything specific to them other than they just ended up being so freaking successful or at least nfts ended up being so freaking successful yeah is it is it right just for people that don't understand interfaces and we'll go into it too much but like without an interface that's adopted throughout the ecosystem right now if you launch an ft and you don't do it through metaplex it just won't even show up on Magic Eden for example is that right yeah yeah that's right I think one thing that would be interesting to me is you were working on ethereum or in ethereum ecosystem I think that'd be back in like 2018-19 and that was on the state channels and l2s were really just a theory right and l2s today are launched and they have a high tvl but they're still on training wheels how do you feel differently about ethereum now like if you were building in that ecosystem today do you still think that you would go over to Solana because I've heard you mention uh you think AB chains could be like the future of a mini like scaled applications and Cosmos Embraces that idea do you think ethereum has that right now and it just didn't at the time yeah I think so I think I think so I don't think I mean I I'm very far removed from the state of the art thinking over there but from my point of view they very much have pivoted into this very cosmos-esque view of the world where you have this global settlement layer and then a bunch of disparate Roll-Ups um on top that all checkpoint and use the settlement layer for things like data availability and fraud proofs and all that stuff and I it's funny people a lot of everybody in Solana thinks I'm a multi-j Masky everybody on other chains they come Asana Maxi but I I really love the cosmos this view of the world I've I I very much view the end state for all of the biggest applications to be their own I don't know what you call it app chain or roll-up or whatever like I feel I feel like that's just a very nice thing to do it's like if I have you know something brand new maybe it's like an MMORPG maybe it's a big social network maybe it's an exchange right there's going to be a lot of unique idiosyncrasies that I'm going to need out of either the runtime or the consensus mechanism or just like the properties of the underlying blockchain where it makes a lot of sense sometimes to have your own infrastructure layer that optimizes for it right like blockchains there's databases right it's like Kafka but like you know uh instead of being fault tolerant it's like Byzantine fault tolerant right and like you don't choose a database when building an app based on like what it's not like a branding question right it's a what is the set of trade-offs in the design space that I need question and different things will give you different trade-offs and this is like so try at this point especially for a lot of us in the salon ecosystem because like there's not a lot of maximalism but I think this is why I really love the cosmos view of the world it's like yeah if I need to customize something I'm gonna go do it and I'm gonna do it with my own chain and I think it makes a ton of sense so I don't know it's pretty simple as that not particularly creative though yeah I guess when you say that though then what do you think about the future of Solana in that and I know I know that's like a long time away but like there it's a global state it doesn't have to do with app chains there is the svm on things like eclipse and so forth so yeah I'm just curious I think there will be a couple huge l1's with huge Network effects thing with very with very specific use cases I think I don't think you're gonna have a big MMO on Solana I think if there's a big MMO like World of Warcraft it'll probably be a separate chain um maybe you put the economy on there or something maybe you do like gold or you put the auction house there um but I digress I do think that the I said this when I was talking with Austin federa the other day I do think one interesting way to think about it is in the context of the programming model so the reason why something like Solana is so compelling as a developer like it's so compelling if I just have to have a smart contract and a Helios subscription that's it that's all I need and I can build applications that you know transfer billions of dollars all around the world permissionlessly verifiably like that is incredible like that really is like a superpower it's like maybe one good mental model for thinking about technology is thinking about how it leverages a single developer and like if you look at the progression of of all the tools that have been built over the past I don't know 30 to 50 years I'm going to say 30 years because I'm 31 years old take a look at it it's like every year a single developer can do more and more and more all by himself and grow faster and faster and faster right you probably used to have to have you know millions of dollars to be able to build something like a Facebook or a Google or whatever right Facebook had to literally have their build their own databases and you know manage Hardware in their own data centers and do all this crazy stuff right now you just literally ship a rust binary put it onto a blockchain and it just works it doesn't go down you don't have to worry about fault tolerance you don't have to worry about I mean you have to worry about the smart contract and make sure that there's no exploits and that's hard and that's its own set of challenges but you don't have to think about all the infrastructure and that serverless model is so empowering for a developer especially if you're building anything remotely related to asset ownership or you know economic value transfer that I don't think that's going to go away in a single Global State machine is super compelling from that point of view and I think you know we'll have I mean it's it's I think it's pretty obvious that we'll have both and I think systems like Roll-Ups and app chains are just super compelling but for different reasons to me they're not compelling for scaling reasons they're compelling from the point of view of I want to iterate and build new things that have never been done before how do I like tweak this to have a customize the VM or have my own State logic um in a way that like I don't have to go to the base layer and like have a you know Lobby you know the fire dancer and Solana and Mingo team to like all implement this the way I want right if I want to have every single smart contract on my network be open source and verifiable I can do that right and I just like Fork uh Cosmos or whatever and make that happen but um that is much more of a I don't know business product selling point it's like then it is a scaling selling point like I think coinbase is L2 is like a great example that's basically my view of the world that just wraps it up right there I don't view l2s it's going to be like platforms or ecosystems by themselves I mean there are some like arbitrum and and optimism I think they do an incredible job especially at the social level of getting people excited and stuff like that but as a developer I very what coinbase is doing very much resonates with me so you're referring to just just for people who don't have context our minds referring to base coinbase's new um L2 um you know it is weird how bad of a job we've done marketing to developers right you can write a few lines of code and you can move money at the speed of light um with no permission and compose with anybody else and and so I do wonder what we've gotten wrong there but uh maybe on that train of thought what is something that we should be talking about more in Solana that's just completely under the radar I wouldn't say I have a good answer to that what about in crypto and Armani just is still one of your tweets he said I've if I've learned anything from the past six years in this industry it's that when people scoff at something you should probably pay attention to it what's something that people are scoffing at in crypto that they should pay attention to foreign these are all the hard questions um I think yeah I think that tweet was coming from a place where I've personally I mean I feel like most developers can rest this will resonate with them where I see a lot of stuff and I'm I'm so I'm so smart and experienced as a as a new developer that I I know the entirety of of of of Mankind's knowledge and I know what the future and stuff like that right but I personally have seen a lot of things I saw it with nft so I look at it I'm like oh this is dumb I'm not getting involved with this this is this is so dumb um and you see these toys right whether it's something like you know seeing an amm for the first time or seeing an nft for the first time or seeing something like uh you know Bitcoin ordinals for the first time where it's very easy to like have a knee-jerk reaction I personally have had my own share of knee-jerk reactions I will continue to have my own set set new jerk reactions but he's easy to write it off but it turns out there's like a lot of these things that are just imperfect at the time end up being like really good ideas and I've just seen it time and time again with ideas in crypto Solana was like maybe a great example of this like when we're when I became dishonor for the first time like it was just a constant battle on Twitter where people were just like making fun of us it still is it's still a constant battle on Twitter um where people are like it's dumb it's decentralized it goes down and nobody's gonna use rust um you know anatoly's hair looks funny I don't know what people want to say um but whether it's nfts or l1s or you know money at the speed of light if people are using stuff there's tend to be something interesting and I think it's worth spending the time to explore what those interesting things are so anyway well put um okay I'm gonna completely pivot off of crypto and this is a question I've been meaning to ask because uh there's no I found that the best way to piss people off on Twitter is to say working hard is good um what are your thoughts on work-life balance I feel the problem with these conversations is two things the first thing is people tend to be prescriptive where they think of it in terms of what's right and what's wrong and what I should be doing versus what others should be doing and the simple answer to that is like there's no right answer right everybody is different and it's all about context and like what is your goal like what are you trying to do and if your goal is to build a billion dollar startup that's very different than if your goal is to just like be happy those are two very different things like you know and I think that's people just aren't really easily like they people don't people don't put it in those terms right and that's like kind of how Twitter's design they just want to maximize chaos um but once you start putting it in that context and you can have these like conversations that are much more objective so you know for us we're a venture back startup our goal is to build kind of you know fundamental kind of improvements that change the world right um and if that's your goal and if you are competing against a bunch of other people that also have that same goal that are also really smart well the fact of the matter is some people are just gonna like work harder than you and they might be smarter than you um and they they're gonna do everything they're power to beat you like some people are just wired like that I'm charging my computer right now so I apologize um so it doesn't go up and I think people have this thank you I don't know what if it's like what it is I don't know if it's like insecurity or what but like they hear these things and they're like well if I'm not working really hard like the problem is not with me the problem's with you and I I think that's kind of where it comes from um I don't have work-life balance I'm not going to pretend like I do I don't tell other people to not have work-life balance but I definitely don't um I work all day every day seven days a week every waking moment of the day but I don't think that's like the right thing for everybody to do it's kind of just like how I've always been and how I'm wired and it's funny because like people will tell you like oh yeah you'll burn out or whatever and I was like no I I've been like this my entire life and I've haven't burnt out it just like you know and it's like I don't know what's worse like you telling people to work too much or other people telling you to not work and the fact of the matter is like you know if you're happy you're happy and and you should just nobody has the answer right and it's really as simple as that yeah I think that question is probably asked a lot out of insecurity either way you either a lot of people feel they work too much or too less um and so yeah it's an insecurity question if you weren't working in crypto um you obviously like the buildings all the time 24 7. what else would you be working in oh it's the answer is so ridiculous it's just so obvious right it's like a AI obviously yeah fair enough do you think Ai and crypto actually have like you think that's gonna come to fruition or do you think it's way over overblown right now I feel like it's overblowned but I mean they solve different problems right I think yeah um yeah I know AI is like the other obviously most I mean in 2017 it was the most exciting thing in addition to crypto and in 2023 whatever date we year it is I lose track of time it continues to be the most exciting thing um next or alongside crypto what are your thoughts on working in remote or in person versus remote my thoughts on this have significantly updated since running a company um I think for Developers being remote is totally fine um especially if you've worked on a lot of Open Source but part of running a company is figuring out things along the way it's like you almost never know the problem that you're solving until you actually start solving it and opportunity is like inherently temporal I I like the story I like to tell to my team is like opportunities like these windows of time that open up it's like an ephemeral Pokemon if you want to use that analogy where it pops up out of nowhere and you have like you know some fixed period of time to capture it if you don't capture the Pokemon before it disappears you'll never capture it again and it doesn't matter how hard you work it doesn't matter how good the product is if you do it a second after the Pokemon disappears you're not catching that Pokemon and so time is everything um and not only time but also all of the micro decisions that you make all day every day you do like make a million different decisions right should I be talking to the person next to me should I be reviewing code should I just be Force pushing the master should I be reverting this PR what should I be working on should I be focusing on iOS should I be focusing on making the system go fast should I be you know sitting at Discord getting people hyped um should I be thinking about the new mints you know should I be trying to get BD Partnerships um and getting people excited like you don't know what to work on right and in order for you to actually make good decisions you need to have all that business context and so if if you know what you're doing I'll priori and you can have a nice like year-long road map where you are figuring where you know everything and you just need to execute and I think for some things like I think you know building an L1 blockchain um that's 100x faster than the next thing which probably fit in that category but for other things where you know you're trying to find product Marketplace that's a lot less objective and a lot more escapable I think being in person is just a huge huge Advantage it's to me it's like not even close and I think there are some of our best Engineers are remote um no doubt about it and they would be less productive if they were in person for sure but I think for a lot of folks particularly non-engineers being in person is just such a huge advantage that makes that makes a lot of sense so I mean you obviously see your backpack um and you you just said your views on this topic have changed since before starting and after what are what are some Leadership Lessons you've learned along the way since starting backpack I mean I think there's a lot of like boring things like mechanically on like how to like motivate people and and get productivity out of people um that are maybe less interesting I think the main like big thing is that you actually don't know what you're building until you just start building and this the starting point is just like an excuse um like we built backpack as like an excuse to start building stuff right um and it's not about where you start it's about the million decisions and pivots that you make along the way to like end up in a good spot and I think that is the main thing so like yeah there's a million wallets out there but if you want to build a wall you should just build a wallet because like the pulling is not going to be the wallet the point is what comes as you build the wallet and all the things that you learn along that way I think that's probably the biggest thing which is like maybe counter-intuitive um but it's definitely I think um been a big lesson the the big factor is when you raise money that's the big thing um the challenge is when a lot of people when you raise money without having that big kind of compelling idea that you have high conviction on um and at that point then that's when The Ordering of operations matters a bunch there but yeah yeah yeah sorry to cut you off there um I was gonna say we felt the same way about this podcast like you can you can plan what the description is going to be what the show is going to be about who you're going to have on it's like you need to just go do it you know after a certain point and start executing um I think one interesting story that I heard you talk about was your internship at Apple and you know you thought you'd go in and just be coding all day but I think they made you dedicate like two days or three days to just building presentations and that probably taught you how important the ux and presenting things is which I think goes into your conversation about distribution so I'm just curious is that something that like changed your outlook on everything and how you go about backpack and distribution was that kind of transformative because it sounded like it would be yeah it was crazier than that it was two weeks it was two weeks of of hammering a presentation every day um it was it wasn't two days it was it was way gnarlier than that um no it definitely did it definitely did like storytelling is super important to me because it doesn't I mean these are all just the Classic Steve Jobs lessons right where you know it's very it was very much like a parent in the company culture that like that's what they cared about right they cared about not just what you built and how you built it but also how you presented it to the world and you know little things like you know the packaging matter right um in the context of software it's maybe not physical packaging but it's how you talk about it publicly and so I think small things like Twitter and Twitter spaces and even those podcasts are really important when telling your story and inspiring people to use kind of the technology right because the technology is ultimately like a means to an end like you don't build tech for the sake of building Tech I mean some people do but people use Tech because they care about like the human level of improvements in their life right whether they make something you know that you can connect with your friends uh you know and be happier or you know you can find information quick um or you can like call your mom you know when you're you know at school or something like that that's what people care about it's like that connect it's a human level property and the Technologies like facilitates that and so it's important to communicate that and I think that's that's the takeaway yeah it's really cool Bert um we're coming up on an hour do you want to do your fire round segment yeah all right so uh Armani I I um we're gonna do a rapid fire uh I don't prepare these questions beforehand I just think of random on the spot so um are you are you ready for that just basically I'm just gonna ask some questions and then you're just gonna answer as quickly as you can let's do it all right um all right let's let's let's get started all right um board ape yacht club or D gods D gods Altus or Cosmos really putting me in the fire there good one I I want to say l2s because that's where I started but I also want to say Cosmos because they're the relative Underdog so I'm gonna vote for Cosmos who was the one person you look up to in crypto metallic what is one thing the salonian system needs to do less less fight with her each other other existence both obviously yeah and both infighting just focus on your customers focus on shipping focus on creating value don't focus on what people are saying on Twitter don't focus on you know trying to win by killing your competitors focus on winning by delighting and inspiring your users because there's not that many of them and we need more if you could steal one personality trait from anybody in history what would it be or who would it be from so for example Steve Jobs storytelling Etc I think it would be Steve Jobs's ruthless commitment to building great product Above All Else even at the sacrifice of I don't know being perceived as kind I think yeah I I think just it's not necessarily the most admirable thing but in terms of my personal composition of like personality traits I think that would be the most complimentary that would make me improve the most Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos oh Elon Musk yeah no doubt do you have a thing against both CEOs um uh I was gonna say who are your favorite Three Twitter follows Twitter follow us uh uh you're you're a pretty good one I mean not just saying that I think you're pretty yeah I think you you say a lot of things that are thought but not otherwise said and people are afraid to say um so that definitely definitely think you're you're pretty close to the top of the list um mad Lads and backpack accounts those are the three [Laughter] awesome what is one tip you would give to Founders about forming a community like backpack in Madlibs oh if it's on the topic of community building I would say two things first is focus on purpose and bringing value to the community it's like what is it that you're building and why are you building it is it to make friends on the Internet is it to make a compelling product is it just you know just have a reason for existence it's not about like making Vibes I mean there's there's some there's some communities around Vibes and there's some that pull it off but that's like saying you know being a meme coin is a good idea it's like yeah the Doge exists but you're probably not Doge so I think this is where most people go wrong with building communities is it's really all about incentives and you need to have that fundamental incentive there where you can inspire people with your mission right it could be Tesla and you know accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy source um you know it can be peer branding like Nike but you gotta have a purpose and a story to Rally people behind it and then the second thing is you have to like internally actually believe what that story is you can't just like write it on a piece of paper and then like say it on Twitter and hire some marketing of people and say oh yeah I think this is a good idea this is what people like irrespective of whether I like it itself I think humans are really good BS detectors people can tell if you're being internally inconsistent or if you're being externally inconsistent with your internal views that really I don't know what it is but I feel like humans are incredible at detecting that and so if you're gonna say things and build a community around this purpose you really need to believe it and be consistent with that view um it all comes it's like going back to like why open source right it's all about consistency and honesty and like you know eating your own cooking so to speak and I think that is those two things together are a good combination for you know aspiring Community Builders well so cats are dogs cats or dogs I gotta go with dogs coffee or tea coffee no doubt if there's one lever you could pull to improve the state of crypto what would that labor be one lover I guess yeah regulation regulation what about tech in general clear regulation like I need to know we need to know the rule sets um yeah and what about what does one leader you would pull to improve the state of tech in general foreign immigration law oh that's a good one all right last question what is one piece of advice you would give to aspiring founders  it beautiful I love it hey everybody before we close up what would you tell the audience like what should they check out obviously we'll put your links in the show notes but what would you uh tell them to do to learn a little bit more about your projects yeah all the basic stuff Twitter is probably the best place go to xnmt underscore backpack on Twitter Mad Lads nft I think for the for the matlabs accounts um those are probably the two best places to get started and then there's all the other stuff you know Tick Tock and scram YouTube Chrome Store get gab repos um you can find all that stuff from the Twitter's amazing oh thank you so much for joining this was amazing first episode of Lightspeed I'm on a year absolutely killing in the ecosystem so I'm so glad you joined this was a lot of fun yeah thanks so much for having me guys appreciate it all right we'll talk to you later
