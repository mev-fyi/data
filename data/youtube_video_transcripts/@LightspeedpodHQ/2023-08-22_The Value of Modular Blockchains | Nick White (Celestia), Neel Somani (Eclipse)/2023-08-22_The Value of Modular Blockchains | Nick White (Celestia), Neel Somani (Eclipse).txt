like why deploy to eclipse or in particular or svm l21 ethereum I think that the number one reason is to access ethereum users who in general are less price sensitive so if you want the cheapest absolutely cheapest transactions then you'd probably want to be on the salon L1 but you get this free bridge and ethereum users are really going to like the idea of immediately benefiting from this highly paralyzed virtual machine which is the same as Solana we need to borrow a lot of those great innovations that totally and the team have made but then they also get to be within the ecosystem that they're comfortable with this episode is brought to you by Gino Gino is the easiest way to start earning Meb rewards on Solana through liquid staking get your soul stake it with Judo and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token Judo Soul get started today at Judo dot Network slash taking thank you [Music] what's up everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we are joined by Neil simani the founder of eclipse and Nick white the CEO at Celestia Neil and Nick welcome to the show thanks for having me thanks for having me yeah I'm pumped to have you here um you probably know a lot of our listeners are from the Solana community so they probably have heard the debate modular versus monolithic um which we now call Integrated and we're gonna get into why uh but let's start on what a modular blockchain is and by doing that let's break down what a blockchain is into the four main functions and Nick do you uh do you mind starting there sure yeah and uh I think integrated is a good Rebrand I think brands are really important so credit to you guys for for making that pivot um so the the the main like difference between a modular blockchain and a monolithic or integrated blockchain is that in a modular blockchain oh in a monolithic blockchain you have coupled all the different functions that the blockchain has to perform into one single protocol and all the nodes in that protocol have to perform all those functions and uh in a modular blockchain actually you kind of like boil it down into what those you distill it into those separate functions and then you say okay which ones need to be bundled together and run in a given Pro like a separate protocol and then you can actually stack those protocols on top of each other and you can build and have the same uh you know functionality of a fully complete blockchain but with in my opinion lots and lots of benefits um so the three layers are the most important are data availability consensus and execution and so data availability is often misunderstood concept is not data storage it's about publishing data it's making sure that everyone in the network can actually see you know the transactions that are taking place consensus is about ordering all those transactions and then execution is about like okay now we have these transactions that have been published so everyone knows what they are they're ordered now we need to interpret those transactions and execute them and compute like what is the actual State like the final state of the chain given that all these transactions have taken place and in our world Celestia is a consensus and data availability layer on which people can launch their own custom execution layers as Roll-Ups um and so like the advantage there is that you can customize the execution layer you don't have to bootstrap an entirely new consensus Network every time you want to launch a new chain and you get this inherent sort of like parallelism between these Roll-Ups they don't end up sharing the same uh sort of like state with each other so like you can actually sort of like uh fragment things in a way that is like beneficial and also another part of this is that's really important like kind of like a corollary is that um modular blockchains use data availability sampling to scale block space in a trust minimized way and they also use um fraud proofs and ZK proofs which makes it possible to prove execution in a really scalable trust minimized way so modular blockchains also inherently have this very powerful like scaling property that um you can achieve in a monitor blockchain but you have to implement those things in a monolithic way um so that's kind of like the TL ER of a modular versus monolithic integrated yeah and to add on to what they're saying like he was saying at the end there's nothing that's inherently not possible to build into Solana as an L1 but the difference when you break all these pieces apart is now one you get to share infrastructure maybe I have an execution layer I don't have to worry about building the remaining parts of the blockchain that I want to see so I can use Celestia as a module I can use ethereum as some other module and I can share some of the security properties of these blockchains and the second part is just for developers as a whole this is good because when you have separate modules that are forced to compete with each other then these teams that are working on just sequencing or just data availability can focus on that one part and they can produce the best part for for all developers to consume that that'll make sense uh thanks for the explanations there one thing that I think people get confused about which Nick alluded to as well is what exactly is data availability right I think consensus and execution are relatively well understood data availability seems to be not so well understood right like um you you'll often hear tolly or or Solana or integrated proponents say it will say da is the ultimate bottleneck right the bandwidth is the ultimate bottleneck can you guys explain from first principles like what exactly data availability is how data availability sampling comes into that um and just for people who are completely unfamiliar with the concept so data availability a lot of people think like oh well our weave or filecoin are data availability Solutions because it sounds like the same thing as data storage but they're very very different things um data availability is uh the point of it is that it protects from a specific kind of attack that validators of a blockchain can uh that can execute which is called a data withholding attack which is that they can basically say hey I produce this new block and this is the new state of the chain but I'm actually not going to tell you what transactions took place and so you're just going to have to like believe me basically in a normal monolithic blockchain the way that you solve data availability is that every full node downloads all the data in the chain and that works because now you know like okay the data has been published it's there I'm not just trusting the validators that they produce this block um but the problem with that is that it doesn't scale because now uh if you know if you want to increase the size of the block every node in the network has to download that much more data and so they need that much more bandwidth and so the resource requirements in that scheme just don't scale well so you'll end up Max maxing out on like the total number of transactions like the data throughput of of the chain very quickly and um the the approach that uh is was like a revolution is this thing called Data availability sampling where you can actually verify that all the data behind um a block was published without having to download all of it so instead you erase your code to block because actually like Solana does some similar things in the way that they do shredding of the block but that's more for gossiping at least the way that it's currently designed and you sample you would take a bunch of different samples of that Erasure coded data and then you get this very very high probabilistic guarantee that all the data has been published so all of a sudden now you can increase the size of the block without um forcing people to increase the node requirements um and so it's like it's a really like powerful thing the first thing to note about data withholding attacks is that it's really hard to prove so if someone's asking me to give them a block and I don't give it they can't show like hey I asked Neil and he didn't send it they could be lying or I could be lying so either person can be dishonest and that's what makes it so tricky so like why would someone want to do a data withholding attack and Nick mentioned optimistic Roll-Ups so just to put it a little more concretely In One blockchain Construction you might have this would be a really efficient construction where you have one node that receives transactions it produces the state route or produces the result of executing all those and it writes that result somewhere and they say okay if anyone can prove that that's invalid and then I next week then we'll wipe it otherwise that's that State Route is going to be finalized in one week and the critical assumption there is how do you prove that something was invalid and it's exactly what Nick was saying which is you actually need access to those transactions to say see like Neil ran this transaction and the result is not what he said so that's the key idea behind data withholding attacks and that's why data availability is necessary yeah that's a really good explanation you may have hit on this a little bit but I think it's really important to frame it as like light clients um as well in this conversation because like you said in a regular blockchain the full validators are going to download all of the blocks and all the transactions so this data availability is not really a factor it's just when you want to have end users be able to verify that those transactions have been made available and I think it's probably also good to know this took me a while to figure out that just because the data has been made available it doesn't mean it's going to always be there retrievable like those are two different things right like you want to make sure that's been published and that's what something like Celestia does but then some people are like well why don't you just do it with file coin file coin is where data can be stored there and you know it's going to be there later but the whole point is without Celestia or data availability solution you don't know that it's been published at all so you never know that's actually even made it to something like filecoin um so maybe if you nick just describe like like clients really quickly and the minority trust assumption absolutely um I just want to quickly give an analogy I think analogies are really really useful in explaining all this stuff because it's very easy to get lost in all the terminology and just it's nuanced and very confusing but like one way to understand data storage versus data availability is that data storage is like canning food and like packing it away on shelves or like putting it in a freezer and it's like okay well I know it's there and I can get it later I'm not going to eat it right now data availability is like a buffet it's like hey all the food is out here and it's fresh and like you can go and Sample and take anything and you know verify that like this dish is is there available to be eaten by everyone that's here but they're not going to then like you know uh store that that food necessarily like that food can get stored by a different function um and like data availability is important for the safety of the chain like the like the security of the validity of the state transitions where storage is is sort of different it is relevant more to liveness but anyway to a question about like like clients right this goes back to the root of what blockchains are about right and what blockchains are is a tool for for scaling trust among people right and you know there's different ways of scaling trust we have like written law and we have you know police force and things that uh we like these these rules that we agree to so that we can all like cooperate um and what makes a blockchain unique is that like you don't actually have to have a court system or a government or something or like a like a trusted third party in the middle intermediating your your sort of like cooperation with other people and the way that blockchains do that is they make it so that everyone that's participating in a blockchain network knows what the rules of the blockchain are and they actually enforce it directly themselves so it's like a peer-to-peer like cooperation technology where people directly like the users directly enforce the rules and they do that by running a node so a node basically has a copy of the blockchain's rules you know like in Bitcoin it's like hey we can't spend coins you don't own and you know you can't have more than 21 Bitcoin put on a million Bitcoin and if anyone tries to break those rules everyone's going to see it everyone that's running a full node will see it and reject it so that's that's like kind of how rules get enforced now um and and the whole concept the whole goal right is to remove these intermediaries and this like these trusted third parties now uh there's kind of been a trend where people have kind of like lost sight of that as sort of like the north star or the like the core value prop of blockchains and we've kind of moved towards this world where users uh actually kind of like delegate trust to validators or people who run RPC services like users were always meant to run full nodes and verify the blockchain themselves and now we've kind of like shifted away from that because it's it's kind of Impractical because like monolithic blockchains the way that we've been building blockchains just inherently doesn't scale and like it's too technically complex for an average user to do like very few people only the most hardcore people run an ethereum full node for example and um and and I'm sure it's the same with with swaniful nodes right and the issue with that is then people reintroducing trust back into the system that's supposed to be sort of like a peer-to-peer like trust minimized thing because now you're trusting the validators to the right thing or you're trusting the full node and the person who's verifying the chain on behalf of you not to lie to you so core to the Celestia's vision and the vision of the modular movement is this idea that users should be first-class citizens of the network and users should be able to verify the network directly themselves and the way they do that is not instead of running a full node because no matter what there's no like if you have to download every transaction and verify every transaction yourself like that's just never gonna scale so instead there's a new node type so then there's like clients by the way and like clients assume that validators are are being honest they just verify the signatures and they're like oh okay you know this is safe I trusted the validators aren't lying to me um but that's not trust minimized so that what modular blockchains do is they introduce a new node type called a light node that's why I've been like tweeting and trying to meme light nodes so hard and uh is because of the light node gives you almost the same security guarantees as a full node but it has the same almost the same uh resource requirements of a light client so it's like this amazing sort of like optimization and it reaches a highly new point on the trade-off curve between sort of like social scalability like how much can people verify and Technical scalability which is how much work and how expensive is it to run this type of node and so the vision is basically that ever in the world you know using their phone can actually verify the chain directly and that's going to make the change so much more decentralized and like a last point I know this has been a long rant is that uh in a data availability sampling Network running a light note is not just you know covering and protecting yourself it actually contributes to the scalability and security of the overall protocol because uh in a data availability sampling Network the more nodes that are sampling the data the more the the bigger the block size can be safely and so like you like users aren't just like this passive recipients uh in a modular Network they actually become like active participants verifying and contributing to the scale and security of the network so it's like a really powerful shift into like a new way to think about what blockchains can be and I think it's like really important that we we make this shift if we're going to deliver the full value and potential of this technology yeah it's kind of like if we lived in a country where the government makes a bunch of decisions but people ordinary citizens have no visibility into the political processes that are happening or the laws that are being passed that's the current state of blockchains whereas with like nodes now the citizens can directly verify and see oh this was the voting process that went into this decision this is why this law exists and they can directly see what's going on so it introduces this concept of verifiability I do think if the word light node is a little bit confusing because like clients and light node sound really similar and also an ethereum land it's like when you run a client then you get a node whereas that's not the same relationship with like clients and lightnodes but maybe we can think about the naming a little bit yeah so a few interesting points there I think the the shift towards light nodes in the modular framework um is an interesting one that you know obviously makes a lot of sense um I'll also say that even integrated chains like Solana are trying to come up with their own versions of this there's new client types being worked on and so I think it is um you know it's definitely a worthwhile goal one one thing I'll push back on and this is I'll put on my tolly hat um so we we've talked about how you know maybe the point of blockchains in in Nick's point of view is users should be able to run these nodes and validate everything and and whatnot um I I guess maybe we're all pushback is I'm not too sure if it matters if the incentives are not enough right so like what totally would probably say is okay you can run a node but why would I want to run a node what's my incentive here uh and maybe you can kind of see this with things like Solana full no account versus ethereum full note challenge ethereum is much more um light on the Node requirement aspect right you can run a node on you know pretty much any laptop I would say where Solano you're not going to do that right depending on if you're running an RPC you might require maybe even a terabyte of ram um yet it seems that Solana has about 3 000-ish nodes versus ethereums you know ethereum has about two to three times more um but the trade-off is that Solana is about 200x cheaper on average in terms of fees and obviously um scale does more TPS which kind of is a misleading metric because it's capacity it's not it's capacity on ethereum but it's Demand on Solana right now so I guess all that being said like would you agree or disagree with like how much do the incentives matter for running these nodes for the users the way that I see it like a light node shouldn't be incentivized and the reason why is because the user as they exist right now is already paying an exhaustionist cost and that's sort of cost that is not explicitly modeled within the system and the cost that they're playing that they're paying is a risk of not verifying so instead they're trading that cost that they're already paying in exchange for the explicit explicit cost of running a lifetime so to me the user should probably run the life out and I think in most people if they were choosing between running a really lightweight light node in their browser and making sure that everything is functioning properly on the blockchain they're using versus not running that and it said saving like a penny per Mega say like nothing um I think they probably choose to run it assuming the light node is light enough basically my point here is that it seems that ethereum nodes are obviously much lighter to run for any regular users I think should be big in my opinion if as long as everyone's running a light note so Neil at Eclipse you you've taken essentially the svm I know you've gone beyond that and made it where you can basically spin up a rollout pretty easily can you say how like what eclipse is and how it plays into this whole modular framework yeah right now Eclipse I'd say our primary Flagship product is an svm roll-up and we're actually going to be launching one on ethereum pretty soon and historically that was difficult because the way that we were doing or approaching subtlemen required doing some stuff that wasn't really possible on the ethal one but now uh the approach is that we're doing that part of the compute in a zero knowledge way and then we'll settle that's the only Elitch proof directly on ethereum uh and that's what we're going to be launching over the next few months so we're pretty excited about that and actually we have Helios running some of the nodes for clubs nice get get murdered in there yeah I think it's really exciting because people um obviously the svm is one of the like most optimized paralyzable um virtual machines and now you're making it where you can do that in Roll-Ups right now and you'll hear this from calismani it's not that he's maybe negative against uh l2s it's the evm itself um just lacking you know parallel transactions Etc so I think it's really exciting you're doing that now eclipse is a settlement layer as well um how I think about settlement might be different than you so I'm curious just to hear your thoughts on this so a lot of people talk about l2s as extending ethereum it's like this is how we scale ethereum is we have l2s um to me that's not really true l2s what they do is with settlement right you have this bridge on the L1 that's trust minimized with the L2 and what it does right now for the most part is people just have L1 assets they put it on the bridge they took it to the L2 and they play around there's a whole lot more assets on L1 than the L2 um the L1 I think Roll-Ups really only scale ethereum in the sense that they scale eth they don't scale ethereum so you get trust minimize access to liquidity which is eth which is right now what most people want to use other than usdc so I'm curious with eclipse what is the what's the reasoning for having this settlement layer that doesn't really have a base asset potentially that people are going to get access to because I see that as the main benefit of using ethereum as a settlement layer yeah so to me there's a few reasons why you need to settle one is that for Bridges you need to have some canonical root that everyone agrees on so that's the main reason why you would need to settle somewhere our reason for having a separate settlement there was just because it just seemed very cumbersome to settle on ethereum but we'll actually likely be getting rid of our settlement later just for context so that's a little bit of alpha not that anyone was like heavily using the settlement layer to begin with but uh but yeah that's something to keep in mind and yeah I agree that you get to scale ethereum liquidity in some sense but I think to me what a Roll-Ups doing is it's scaling some of the security properties ethereum so and depending on what the modular architecture is that you're using you might be scaling some of those properties and not others so you might be scaling just the reorg resistance but not the liveness or something like that and uh and that just depends on the construction but curious to get Nick's thoughts on that as chip as well well so settlement is an overloaded term because it can be used to mean a lot of different things um and it it it it can or sometimes it's not it's not always a universally necessary when building a role to have like a settlement layer right so there's certain constructions like interactive verification games where it's it's helpful to have like in in a blockchain to sort of like actually conduct this uh sort of fraud proof game um but there's a lot of chains like if it's a ZK roll-up for example like they don't need to post their proofs anywhere they can actually just send their proofs over the peer-to-peer Network to all the light nodes or full nodes and people can verify it directly so it doesn't actually have to be posted on ethereum to be to be verified for people to know what what's real um but then settlement also has another sort of association with it which is bridging right and so like why would you settle to ethereum it's because basically what you're doing is you're having a bridge to ethereum so that like people can put put assets into your roll up and also have some level of security that they can withdraw those assets when they want to um and and their their assets are safe so settlement is kind of like a a very uh an overloaded term and I personally I think what's really exciting in in the modular like blockchain movement is this idea of sovereign Roll-Ups where um you know the idea is that if you have to settle to another blockchain you kind of give up some degree of control um to that other chain um by enshrining that bridge in your in your protocol and in a sovereign case uh you actually make the choice to uh sort of retain sovereignty within your community and not enshrine a bridge contract into like the way that your canonical chain is determined and that gives you it's no more like a like a like a Cosmos app chain where like you have control and you can fork and upgrade and do what you want obviously unless this whole can of worms as a whole like debate around this and there's a lot of different ways to like to slice it but that's my take on settlement and Celestia made a very conscious decision not to enshrine a settlement layer into the L1 because doing so would add edit execution and State into Celestia and our goal is to be as minimal as possible have like no execution as minimal State as possible so that we can be as light and modular and flexible as possible and so um and like a lot of people that would say complaint is like oh well you know unlike ethereum Celestia doesn't have settlements built in and the actually the upside is that people can then settle wherever so we have people now building their own settlement layers we will be you know uh you know osmosis just announced that they will be running Celestial like clients and people might you know because of that we'll be able to settle their Roll-Ups to osmosis you know uh people can also settle to ethereum we have a quantum gravity Bridge so it's like I know that's the nice thing about modularity is it's so pluralistic and people can build whatever they want um even even in regards to settlement uh one reason why I like the fact that settlement is overloaded for both like clients and verifying the state of the chain and bridges is because they're inherently doing the same thing so it's kind of nice to point that out and say okay actually what a bridge is really doing is the same exact work that a Lifeline is doing so a sovereign roll-up really isn't so different than a smart contract roll-off other than you've ridden that like client as a smart contract it's receiving the same information and verifying the same information uh and then on that Sovereign Roll-Ups versus smart contract bullet point my only concern is just that when you have a bridge that has a ton of assets in it then that ultimately does have some say in your sovereignty as a rollout like you don't want to Fork away and make all those Bridge assets useless or something so so that's the one last consideration hey everyone quick break to tell you about Cheeto Cheeto is the number one liquid staking provider in Salon Gino's been known for the Meb software and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem Solana D5 summer is heating up and what asset do you want to use in D5 liquid safety tokens why because Vegito you can take your soul stake it and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token cheetosol you can then use Judo solo throughout the Solana D5 ecosystem while earning yells through Mev rewards and staking rewards with Cheeto and Jito makes staking super simple you can take your soul stake it get instant liquidity and start earning rewards all within three clicks and not only do they make it simple they make it secure Cheeto has seven audits they have more than a million Souls stayed and they're one of the most respected teams in all of D5 Geo is for whales who need deep liquidity it's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid sticky you have your soul why not stake it earn some yield and start dabbling in Solana D5 so go get started eh check them out at Judo dot Network staking that's Judo dot Network taking I'll put a link in the show notes use the link so they know that I sent you and go get started today [Music] everyone we'll get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that is the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech roll up so count abstraction Mev app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blindspeed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show I've got uh one more question I was gonna bring in later but on Celestia's decision to be incredibly neutral when it comes to not having an enshrined settlement layer like ethereum has um and you do that one reason to be incredibly neutral it's also like State Management um Etc how do you think about that decision though because I've seen a proposal for example to support ZK snark verification on Celestia so that you can have this two-way trust minimized bridge but to do that you have to like support certain ZK schemes which means you're kind of picking a favorite whether that's like starkware ZK sync or someone else so you start getting to these decisions where it's like well maybe for the adoption especially it's best for us to actually start it's almost like Cosmos hub for example did the credibly neutral we're not going to really support one you know Chain versus the other we're not going to have a decks on the Hub but then they launch to decks and then they took it back and now it seems again they're actually being less critically neutral by picking like 10 chains that they're going to support they're almost like crowning at Dex for example doing that so I'm just curious what are your thoughts on on staying incredibly neutral like do you think that was the right path and do you I don't know do you how do you see that going forward one thousand percent the right path um I think you know blockchains are especially like a base layer the main thing I think one of the most important things aside from all the actual like technical features and everything is this deep commitment and Alignment to be incredibly neutral because if I were building a roll-up right and I was thinking about okay what's which stack am I going to build on if I felt there was any kind of favoritism or you know unfair competition or you know whatever is like I'm I would be like okay well you know screw that like I'm gonna build somewhere else where I know it's going to be fair and open and so Celestia is deeply deeply committed to this idea of credible neutrality um in regard to the the ZK op code thing um I think the so what's important to clarify is that the reason that we want to have some form of very very minimal settlement uh is so that we can actually Bridge the Celestia token up in a trust minimized way to roll ups we don't want to be used as like a settlement layer like oh you know people should start posting all their proofs there just to like get get final security it's more about that feature of like you know we want to be able to take the token and and Bridge it up in a trust minimized way and so we're gonna keep that very minimal and be very clear that that's our goal and we're not trying to compete in in like the settlement domain necessarily and you're right that like choosing whichever like proof system we choose to support could like sort of crown a winner or whatever but also there's another way of looking at it which is that um a lot of these proofs can be proven within each other so like let's say you're using a different kind of proving system you can wrap it in that other proof uh and then post it to Celestia um but I think it's going to be a huge upgrade and like kind of the idea somewhat stems from Bitcoin actually where people have been talking about like adding an OP code into Bitcoin to do the same thing and you could have ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin so one thing I want to touch up on is while we're on the topic of maybe credible neutrality L2 is on ethereum um have been sort of interesting lately and what I mean by that is you have the launch of bass and you know the bald coin or token um but then base itself you know doesn't necessarily have it's it's that like a stage Zero from l2b.com right and then you have like actually uh much more further along role that's like arbitrim um and then you have optimism so the world ZK sync stock Nets there's a and then polygon of force you have all these kind of different options some of them are further along than others um what do you like what is your mental framework for um looking at these Roll-Ups in the state of the ethereum L2 kind of road map do you think it's executing well um do you think they've gone right so far like what is your um General thoughts Neil and then Nick yeah my personal view is that op stack pushed adoption a little bit too fast too early just because I don't think at the state of their attack is in a position to be trying to convince people to use it at the scale that that they're pushing at and then the other thing that I think is a little bit misleading is just that a lot of the apps that I think they're pushing people to use on op stack don't actually economically make sense to run on op stack at least as it exists right now so but I also recognize that opt op Labs has been working toward fall proofs and I think if they've been doing some really good work in that direction uh but I think it's also important to recognize like the great work that arbitrum has done they recently enabled flaw proofs or fuel Labs who has had fault proofs where God knows how long so I don't want to Discount that yeah yeah my perspective on it is that look um you know one one thing about modular blockchains is that they are technically extremely ambitious because data availability sampling super hard to build in practice and scale um Roll-Ups and like fraud and DK Bruce uh are really really hard to build and so um and there's just so much work that has still has to be done and so um you know yeah roll up Tech is still very early that the whole modular stack is very early and um you know I think I think we have to be careful of not uh obfuscating the risks and being very upfront and transparent about the actual security of the system so I think that's that's what's really important I think that's part of what people are kind of like you know getting up in arms about is like feeling like hey you're not being intellectually honest about your Tech and I think that's actually a very healthy thing and we need to keep each other honest uh because like otherwise uh you know like we have a responsibility because the users like are in some ways uh trusting us to to do our homework and and to like secure these systems in the way that we say and uh overall I think one of the surprising things is that um either the speed at which um you know ZK roll ups have come onto the scene like the like polygons EK evm uh what what uh you know stockware has done and even um TK sync are all like super impressive and like way ahead of schedule in my opinion and I would have I would like the kind of the selling point of optimistic roles was like oh well problem proofs are going to be so much easier to to build and um you know Arboretum obviously has really great Tech the stuff that uh optimism is doing around Bedrock like and making like the the proof system super modular so they can even actually adopt ZK uh proofs is really inspiring it's like it's not zero-sum and I think people should just like give it time and just be intellectually honest um and and we'll we'll be fine in the long run it's a really good answer Nick I've listened to a number of your podcasts you're way too nice all the time but but also insightful so so you're honest for a long time so um I appreciate it I think a good analogy for me which you see probably on Twitter is how um crypto is like building software but with like Hardware responsibilities um I've worked at like two different Tech startups and if people are using our products saw what was going on every day there's no way that they should or would pick to use it um but with crypto it's kind of the same thing it's just there's actual like money on the line in smart contract so it feels different um I do want to touch on Kyle samani's piece on just a few of the critiques of modular blockchains and maybe things that are looked over but before I get to that I just want to give you like the opportunity of maybe say like why would a developer go with modular approach it's obviously very difficult to build I've heard about Celestia for a long time now and I've been really pumped up about it but I don't think we're on mainnet yet so um it's almost like all this work up front but there's a reason you're doing it so from a developer's perspective like why is it exciting that you could you know have access to these module modular Parts well first I want to start by acknowledging the merits of Kyle's piece because I think maybe some I think there was like there were some uncharitable interpretations of it I like that so it looks like you did his homework and I I think that's really cool and modular blockchains don't really make things faster that's true they don't necessarily make things cheaper and these are some of the points that he raised uh in his post I think the parts that he misses is he talks about what's theoretically possible on an L1 if a developer Works around the constraints of it but to me it really comes back down to ownership and it's like when you own the blockchain yourself self you don't need to jump through hoops or you don't need to work with the core developers you can just push a change to your execution layer and now and it's because because it's yours you're the one who now gets that functionality and you don't have to worry about um about convincing other stakeholders other than your community or another example he talks a lot about Meb as being a new monetization opportunity and how that's not really true one is that it some of the approaches he mentioned seemed a little bit cumbersome to implemented practice but two it seems to miss a really obvious point which is that and I think Kyle himself would have to admit that all ones have some business model outside of Mev whatever that business model is if you're an app and you have your own app chain now you also get that business model so unless it's really true that like apps can capture all the value from the L1 or L2 at which point like any any L1 or L2 investment would be very bearish um and I don't think it's true a great example that is if you just look at Bass for example uh they launched officially just earlier this month they've already earned millions in Revenue base if they deploy to ethereum or to polygon they would not have accrued that value they wouldn't have been able to capture that and the reason why they did is because they're a big enough organization that they were able to draw developers around them and it's like the ability for an app to actually turn itself into more than just an app but also an infrastructure and an ecosystem where they can accrue the value that they're actually driving so that's the way that I would probably reframe the piece and I I think that there's someone on my team who's actually writing something up more more thoughtful but but yeah that's that's the synopsis yeah I'll jump in and say that um I felt like like you know said Kyle definitely did his his homework and when I read through the piece I was like you know these are these are solid points and solid arguments um I felt you know I wrote a thread kind of as a response and some of the things that I like want to push back on is first like he claims that like modular makes it way more complex for developers and that's just not true um and in fact and like the long term one of the things that we believed in Celestia since the very beginning is we want to make it as easy to deploy your own blockchain or your own rollup as it is to deploy a smart contract and like At first that really seemed like a pie in the sky like Vision frankly because it was everything was so raw uh but we're actually really close like like approaching that very very quickly and that like you can even go online try like conduit or Caldera or vistara that there's all these roll up as a service companies where it literally is like one click and like a minute and you have your own roll up and so like the point is in the modular stack it doesn't inherently increase complexity but it gives developers sort of the ability to go into more layers of the stack and customize and that becomes more complex so you can actually write your own uh you know virtual machine or you can you know customize the evm with with specific pre-compiles or whatever so you have the ability to customize if you that that's what you want to do but if you don't want to you can literally just deploy you know an evm roll over svm roll up out of the box and it's really not much harder than deploying a smart contract and so uh like it really doesn't increase complexity unless you want complexity gives you the choice and that's why we always say Associated like build whatever because we we really one of the our core beliefs is like thing developers will be able to build better apps if they have more freedom more freedom to choose from different components more freedom to go and customize and so I think that's like a really major one and um he also tried to claim that like Mev is something that um you know apps like smart contracts like you don't need to build your own app chain or you know to to capture Mev uh I I I'm not saying that it's not possible to do that I think there's ways of clever like clever ways of building a smart contract so you can capture Mev but like inherently the way like Mev arises from like validators or sequencers right which are kind of like outside of the protocol but and so you like the deeper into the stack you can go to customize things the the more you're going to be able to actually design the system to capture Meb so like a really great example of this is what skip is doing in the causal ecosystem where they've developed this thing called protocol and building which is more for like app chains but can be modeled very well to actually application specific rollups and what that is is basically that there's like validity rules within the chain State transition itself that enforce what kind of Mev can be captured and then how the Mev profits are distributed and or even there's things like okay well we're going to choose a entirely new execution model where like the transactions let's say I'm a DEX instead of having all the transactions be uh processed like in serial they're batched together and it's all done at once but like you need to go deeper to customize to get there so like an Mev being one of the biggest like value capture uh sort of like avenues for uh applications at least as of now it like I think that's really really important to like give Builders and communities access to that yeah though Kyle's response would be like give me a specific application an Mev example and I will give you a specific smart contract construction that captures that so like in the case of like one of the auction situations you mentioned that you could impose like a sealed bed auction and then you do like a Dutch auction off of that and then you return the value back to the application technically you could still capture it if you internalize like of course it has like longer block times if you do it that way but uh but like theoretically you can still capture it I I just think it's very cumbersome too and and I I just also think it misses the fact that there's more monetization opportunities than just Mev again it's just like too narrow with you mm-hmm that's that's what I'll put um what one thing that I'll say is like I think she's also like specifically referring to app developers as well just people who want to like you know deploy maybe a consumer or payments app on top of the blockchain as opposed to me like a pure blockchain developer but um it actually brings up a point that I want to touch on which is kind of towards the end of the piece he talks about the fact that you know this stuff like this is possible but he hasn't seen many examples of it so far um and then he references Cosmos the cosmos ecosystem um what are your guys's thoughts on kind of the cosmos ecosystem modularity versus kind of l2s and Roll-Ups as a service and like how do you guys how should people who are not familiar with this think about it is that for an L1 you have you need to have a bunch of validators those validators must all run full nodes so you're burning some amount of money every month and this can often be like millions of dollars per year whereas for a roll-up you just don't have that same fixed cost but the trade-off you're making is that when you had your own L1 then there is no marginal cost you're not paying rent for each of those transactions that's processed on your app Channel whereas when your own when you're a roll up and someone runs a transaction you do have to write that to a layer one whether that's to Celestia or whether that's to ethereum or somewhere else so that's a marginal cost that you have to pay but you have way lower fixed costs so what this means is that apps that were previously on economic culture monitors are on app chain can now run as their own app roll up so to me that's the fundamental difference yeah Neil Neil hit the nail on the head well first of all I just want to say that Cosmos uh has been extremely influential in the entire sort of like modular vision of Celestia and and Beyond and you know we use the cosmos SDK we use tender Mint or announce Comet um to to build our chain and uh you know Cosmos was the first people who realized actually you can decouple consensus from execution but they did that at the software level right so they kind of modularized the software stack for building blockchain and that made it really easy to customize the state machine of your chain and build an app chain for example and then Celestia kind of took that a step further and said that hey actually we can modulize not just at the software level but at the protocol level itself so now instead of having to like you you know you take tender mints or comment and like get a bunch of validators and launch your chain it's like actually Celestia can act as your shared tenderment network and like what Neil said that so there's a couple big advantages the first one is like if you just get to share by sharing resources uh you can save like dramatically save on costs like running an app chain is extremely expensive for a lot of different reasons just like the actual infrastructure the social like you know cost of like actually coordinating everything and maintaining everything and like all of a sudden you can just remove all that and just pay transaction fees to run your chain and so that's like a massive massive uh leg up on the economics and also it removes the need for you to issue your own token when you when you want to launch a new blockchain and so I think that that's really huge and then another part of it is that um when you share a common consensus and da protocol under the hood your app chains get a superpower which is they can interoperate in a more secure way um because like they can actually verify each other's data availability and they can like actually reason about the ordering of the other chains blocks and so you get this like fundamentally new level of security when it comes to interoperabilities they're almost more like even though they're separate chains they're almost more like they're kind of between like smart contracts on a shared uh blockchain like ethereum or Solana and like fully separate chains they're kind of like they're separate but then they're they're sharing this underlying security that they can like actually talk to each other not atomically but they can interoperate um like super securely why would you build on Eclipse versus the slana you know L1 um and that might be because you have something that'll motivate a specific use case so here's your thoughts as far as like why deploy to eclipse or in particular our svm L2 on ethereum I think that the number one reason is to access ethereum users who in general are less price sensitive so if you want the cheapest absolute cheapest transactions then you'd probably want to be on the Solana L1 but you get this free bridge and ethereum users I think are really going to like the idea once we launcher I mean that I've just like immediately benefiting from this highly paralyzed virtual machine which is the same as Solana and we get to borrow a lot of those great innovations that totally on the team have made but then they also get to be within the ecosystem that they're comfortable with they can use ease to pay for gas they get a lot of the stuff that ethereum users are used to so then we you have some collaboration with a major soul on a wallet where we're building a made a mass snap so this is like a made a mask it's kind of like an extension to meet a mask where you can use your meta mask Wallets on the eclipse chain or on svm chains so that's going to be a really been a big unlock for the ethereum community awesome um yeah I agree I'm I'm super polished on the svm and Eclipse um not Financial advice um one thing that I'm curious about which is kind of unrelated in a sense but I thought it was an interesting take on Twitter Fubar recently tweeted that uh decentralizing sequences isn't really the point of Altus and maybe it's maybe not even worth the effort uh what really matters is getting rid of multi-sig control and and improves yeah there's some cases where so what are you really giving up when you have a centralized sequencer you don't give up safety or aliveness in the formal sense of course you give up aliveness guarantees in a short term because usually the way that you regain liveness theoretically is through some sort of forced inclusion through the L1 which probably has longer block times and blah blah so you don't really give up anything from a security perspective is my point but what you do give up is that that single sequencer has a freedom to reorder things as they see fit and they can continue doing that indefinitely so that's the way that I see it and for some D5 applications I think that'll prove to be really difficult because you don't want the sequencer to be trusted in doing that and it'll it'll end up being like a really profitable Avenue assuming that one sequencer has a lot of really high value order flow but I think it's true that for a lot of apps like games for example they'd probably just want the lowest latency or the shortest confirmation time at which point a centralized sequencer makes a lot of sense so but I wanted to hear the next take to uh I think Neil um did a good job of explaining it like the way that I roll up basically what football is saying is that um Roll-Ups are supposed to be press minimized and ensure the the like the state validity or like the that the the rules of the Rope are followed and until you have fraud proofs and ZK proofs and all that stuff uh like they're just not they're fundamentally not secure like that roll-up operator could actually just steal all your money right and uh I do think that that is actually far more important than what decentralized the sequencer gets you uh in the sense of what decentralizing sequencer does is it makes it so you have better censorship resistance and and liveness depending on the construction of the of how the roll-up is sequenced and uh because like that that sequencer could just decide like hey I don't like you I'm not accepting your transactions all of a sudden you're kind of screwed or like they could just decide hey I'm just gonna or they maybe they they they're wherever they're running their node like to the power outage or something and all of a sudden the whole chain just halts right so you censorship resistance and liveness are really important like features of blockchains but I don't think I don't put them in the same level of priority as like just straight up validity uh and verifiability of of the of the underlying like execution now for a long time that was kind of an issue an open issue is like okay well one of the benefits of running a roll up is that you don't have to bootstrap a new consensus Network or sequencer Network right uh because like that's a lot of overhead socially and then you have to run all these nodes it's kind of like oh man that's a lot of work and I get to do that for every single roll up it's like we're not really getting the full benefit of these systems and that was like a problem that was constantly bothering me for a really long time up through last year and then um Evan one of the engineers on our team had this idea for and we had this concept of like okay how can we have a shared sequencer right so you can actually deploy a roll up that has all these benefits uh without having to actually bootstrap the sequencer yourself and he came up with this really cool construction of actually how to do it and now there's a few teams uh Austria and espresso building out and also like Fair block there's a few radius a bunch of teams building out these systems so that you can actually um yeah have a decentralized sequence server without having to add more overhead because that's also so one of fubar's points is like well why would you even decentralize a sequencer if it's going to just compromise on the value prop of a roll-up which is that like you only need one node basically like there's less overhead uh and so like that's the cool thing about a shared sequencers you get the best of both worlds where like you get decentralization censorship resistance liveness guarantees while not needing to run new infrastructure for yourself yeah and what's really cool is that I think there's a place for Solana the L1 to play in the sequencing space with neon now it could be the one to order evm transactions across many Roll-Ups and maybe multiple neon deployments could represent multiple Roll-Ups that neither sequencing done then you just need something to relay those transactions to the L1 that the roll up ultimately ends up wanting to publish their data to but there's some nuances there like neon uses a specific version of the evm which is likely not the same as many of the more recent Roll-Ups that were built and we're still thinking through the details of what that would even look like but uh but I think if there's some place for us Solana to play there and we were just talking about it with totally a few days ago so that's that's one thing to note one other thing to keep in mind is that I think that people get obsessed with the words central centralized and decentralized because that's a Remnant from l1s where that was a critical property in order for the system to operate in a trustless way to whatever degree trustlessness actually makes sense as a concept because you're always kind of trusting something but uh for a roll-up you don't necessarily there's possible for a system to exist where a component or multiple components are centralized meaning there is one logical entity that represents them yet the whole system is still fully verifiable and it's still permissionless to enter and it's still uh I hate using over trustless but it's still trustless to some degree I have actually two questions uh so so bear with me here uh one is I just want both your takes on neon evm and and kind of you know ebm compatibility on Solana which is an interesting concept that I don't think people have talked about that much uh and two this is kind of unrelated but I've seen kind of in the modular World multiple Futures proposed there is there are some Futures where people think maybe one two or maybe even three l2s will kind of just dominate everything and all valuable or execution will uh flow through them and then there are some who say like there'll actually be many different in in diverse kind of l2s and out reason what not and fractal scaling which approach resonates more with you which do you think is more likely to happen which do you prefer I could see the largest K apps and I'm reluctant to say what K is but maybe the largest 20 or 30 apps having their own chains so I certainly don't see a world where it's just two or three altitudes and I also feel like there are a few benefits of the world where there are only two or three attitudes versus the one where we have a diversity of execution layers all with different social norms and different types of pre-compiles because like I was mentioning before to me one of the chief benefits of modularity is ownership meaning that you can pass governance proposals and you can modify that execution layer as you see fed and that's just not possible if you're sharing the chain with many other people so that's my view on uh on the number of chance it's hard for me to put a real number on it though yeah my that's a really really good question mark and uh frankly like the jury is still very much out and actually this kind of also relates to Kyle's Post in the sense of like you know he thinks that composability is so important that literally every app should just live on the same thing and actually that's not incompatible with a modular uh World either like the modular world could end up being that there's literally just one massive execution layer that takes up all of Celestia's block space so like if that's actually the way that things play out then like it's it's like it's that would also work in a modular framework um where I see things going is that um I think there's gonna be a spectrum and I think there's definitely going to be a general purpose execution uh l2s you know in the ecosystem and what people might do right and and this is another thing it's like in order to build in the modular stack you don't have to roll your own and like deploy your own blockchain you can build on one of these general purpose l2s too so people will probably start building apps there maybe apps that really need a lot of composability like certain D5 things will be like some D5 Hub where all those things are there and they get Atomic imposibility um but then if people like they might try out their app as a smart contract on a shared uh execution L2 and then they like get some traction they get some product Market fit and then they're like hey you know what in order to take our product to the next level in order to capture more value or whatever you know we're gonna actually have to deploy our own roll up and then they kind of like make that transition and actually build themselves into their own chain and I think that that's I think the incentives to building your own chain if you have a successful application are going to be so massive that like what Neil is saying like I think that all the top apps like breakout apps are going to do that and there even could be a world where if you become like the Google of decentralized applications you might even go off of Celestia as a DA layer and actually just maybe build your own Standalone chain for example like maybe you maybe you need that level of customization and it's worth it like the trade-offs are worth it I don't know but I think like there are huge incentives for a successful app to to roll their own chain but like a lot of people might just experiment as a smart contract because like it's just it will be easier you'll be able to like tap into more like an existing Community Etc that's such a good point raised by Nick that that's also my personal view that apps should start as small contracts and start by deploying to a shared chain and if there's some reason why whether it's because you want to capture more value or you're hitting the constraints or you're really trying to push the limits of what's possible on chain then you build your own roll up and like Nick mentioned there's some amount of transaction volume where that fixed cost of an L1 now makes sense for you to incur because you've sufficiently amortized it if you're running hundreds of millions of transactions per year on your chain it probably does make sense for you to be an L1 so that's one thing to keep in mind I want to get into like Network effects and value accrual and Neil you had a speech that I think the title was Roll-Ups as a service are going to zero um so yeah I'm just curious in this this world where you have like eth has this settlement layer then you have like Solana which is This Global State machine then you have celestio just da you have shared sequence here is like where does value accrue in this world because I have this like smiling curve which you can just think of a smile going up and down that I more or less made up but is from Finn Thompson on like the left I'm saying there's definitely going to be or at least in my mind there's gonna be demand for a global State L1 like there's just some use cases for that um probably not number two through 100 but there will be a number one um you're gonna have something that's like a settlement layer store value which would be like ethereum or Bitcoin today you're gonna have these top apps which should be like the five percent type of apps which would be like Fang that you see in um equities and then at the bottom of the smiling curve where it's like the lowest value is where all the competition happens and like things are commoditized which in my head was like the modular infrastructure and then just the majority of apps so I'm curious like across this whole spectrum because now we have this giant supply chain it was so easy went from Bitcoin to ethereum and now it's like this giant thing with all these tokens where does value accrue and like where are the network effects I was trying to make sense of The Smiling curve but unfortunately I didn't have enough time to think about it but I was trying to think about what are the economic first principles that led to that smiling curve construction and I can see why the top of the stack should have some pricing power or should be able to maintain some value accrual because assuming that there's some stickiness there then the bottom components should be able to be swapped out that was my thinking but I wasn't sure about the rest of the I it depends on the application too like I'd argue that uniswap is an amm on the ethyl one to some degree is kind of stuck there like they can't just fork and deploy to their own roll up and bring the community with them and necessarily get that same amount of volume I think that's a bit of a misconception and the reason why is because the liquidity is on the ethyl one and they're the winner there whereas if you look at some of these other chains like Arbitron GMX is a winner It's Not Unusual yeah uniswap is deployed there and Arboretum wants them there they've given them millions of dollars of incentives so that's like one one thing it's like depends on the type of app and I think it's something such as an order book or a purpose exchange or something is much better suited to switch the pieces under the hood and just swap their UI I think their users are going to be much more receptive to that than trying to convince your LPS you've already put their money into a specific blockchain uh to now move to some other chain which which you control I think that's that's less likely to get traction so it depends on the app it depends on the stickiness of the given part of the stack and it also depends on how much that part of the stack is worth so in that post roll up to the service are going to zero the reasoning that I went through was basically going through the functions of a blockchain that Nick was talking about execution consensus da and then I also threw installment because it's proper it's popularly cited as a function of a blockchain and I point out that at least for optimistic Roll-Ups settlement gives very little money back to ethereum and to me that's not really the advantage of ethereum or the advantage to ethereum of being a settlement layer the advantage to ethereum is that now they've increased the moneyness of Eve and everyone's using it as the lingua Franca and they're using it to pay fees and therefore everyone's sitting on you I think that's what a lot of people do because there's no reason to convert to usdc and then to eat every time you need to do something it's just impractical because it's the denomination for so many items that we buy so I guess that's the store of value value point that you were getting at accurate when you put that on the far right side of the curve and I don't know if that's really value capture so much as uh like yeah value calling that value capture I think I have to think about a little bit more like what does it even mean to capture value and to me it means when a user pays a fee how is that fee split across all parties and ironically ethereum itself makes a very little of that fee assuming you're using Celestia for da and you're using a roll-up on ethereum but the whole fee is paid in ethereum and therefore ethereum still benefits so yes we're interested to hear Nick's thoughts but it's something that it might be something that we just need to see in practice what users have the most sensitivity to and where they have the most Demian elasticity okay yeah well I was a very surprised when Neil uh he tweeted and shared the the thing that like ethereum makes something like five dollars a day or something in settlement fees or whatever I was actually completely blown away I was like I mean I knew I've had a feeling it would be like pretty low because like you know you just post some data to ethereum that's all you do especially if you're this is for optimistic Roll-Ups but like five dollars a day I was like wow that is like such so minuscule yeah C4 bytes posted fairly infrequently because like if it's two weeks challenge period anyway what what difference does it make if you're off by one hour uh I'm sorry to cut you off yeah yeah but anyway um you know for the way that I see I guess value accrual and some of the economics of all these these changes to work out is that um you know I actually in some ways blogspace is a commodity but in a lot of ways it's not um and you know I think yeah so what block space is to me is like this it's like a consumable good where you know it gets produced by a protocol and then people decide like hey we want to run our application uh on that block space and they'll make that choice for a variety of different reasons some of it is just like the raw cost you know the security and the centralization of like how verifiable it is it's like all these like dimensions of of like why they're choosing to consume certain block space and others and uh the question you have to ask is like well are any of those dimensions of choosing to to use a given box face uh do they have any network effects around them and I think um when you when you go down that path you realize that there are there are a few but I think the most important one is that kind of what I was uh getting to earlier which is that um when by by like using a shared da layer and consensus Network like Celestia you're now kind of tapping into like a broader ecosystem so there's actually like this you you become close more closely aligned and close like easier and more secure to interoperate with the whole universe of Roll-Ups that are built on top of that same shared DNA layer so um you start having like as as the ecosystem grows you start having a larger incentive to deploy there um and also there's there's like Network effects around the amount of scale versus costs to verify the block space so uh the way that um light nodes work sort of in a DA sampling Network like Celestia is that um the cost to verify the block scales as the square root of the block size so as you get into bigger and bigger block sizes your chain can support more and more throughput for less and less additional marginal costs on users to verify it so then like once you kind of get to scale if someone else is trying to build a new DA Network like those users that want to verify it actually end up having to pay more to verify it per unit of block space and so I think you end up kind of getting these like economies of scale and so I think for for those two reasons and a few more um like that there will be strong Network effects and like block space is not commoditized like I can't I'm not just going to have like you know some random dude like hey I made a DA chain like why don't you use my blog space like you know we've also seen that not play out uh practically even in like the monolithic realm where people like you can make a copycat evm team but people aren't going to want to use it uh for for similar reasons you have this trade-off or like these two opposing views one is like the fat protocol thesis and the other is the sort of like fat app thesis and the fat protocol thesis is like well the underlying L1 is going to be able to capture all the value because that's like kind of they get they have the ultimate power over all the the the Mev or you know whatever like they kind of are like the the last buck um and then the app thesis is like well actually the applications are the ones that are going to be able to capture those value because they're closest to users and I actually see the modular world is sort of like a synthesis of those two um worlds where like there will be value that accrues to um you know the infrastructure layer for providing like block selling block space but rather than trying to limit the scarcity of the log space to extract more value from users and applications it's about actually providing extremely scalable and abundant block space uh so that people don't have to pay exorbitant amounts but there's so like a you know a healthy margin for for for selling that block space and meanwhile then the rest of the value capture can go into the applications and I think um long term it's kind of like you know we have all these web 2 apps who run AWS or Azure or whatever on the background back end and they're paying some of the profit of the entire stack goes into the infrastructure layer but then a lot of it also gets captured by the apps themselves and I think that's kind of like a good analogy for how to think about how it would play out in the at least in the modular stack that's the way I see it yeah I guess we've never seen an L2 switch da layers maybe we have maybe Nick would know better but if you just look at the way that these l2s calculate the gas fee for the user they have some Oracle for the L1 and they take that gas fee or the blood the price for Block space that estimate as an input into their price calculation so that tells you that they also at least in the short term is not elastic in its demand it pretty much pays what the L1 tells it to we'll close up here in a moment I uh I have one more question that I wanted to ask both of you and one of Kyle samani's paper is actually about through two to three years ago when he was first talking about salon and he talks about like how if you're an Enterprise it's a big deal to pick the right Tech stack because if you pick the wrong one it's very hard to switch et cetera and you need that consistency and you also know that it's going to going to be able to scale in the future to support your business when you think about institutions both from your experience today and also just how you see it over the next 10 years do you see them like coinbase today is talking about payments on ethereum which is extremely expensive and rather slow and they could be on Solana and using like Solana pay you have like one dependency layer whereas if you go this modular route like do they just spin up their own blockchain their own data availability committee where it's like okay we need to control everything ourselves or do they actually use like we're going to use the shared sequencer and then we're going to use uh Celestia for data availability and you have all of these different dependencies I'm just wondering from a practical perspective and what you're seeing today where do you think these institutions which we will need eventually what do you think they'll use largest players that we've talked to particularly game studios have I've had the same exact experience where they say we're going to build our game on ethereum and in my head I'm like what are you doing like that game's not even gonna No One's Gonna use it because it's gonna be so expensive uh but they're very risk-averse and then another value add and this is kind of a benefit of modularity for games but it's that they don't have to pick a specific vendor if they're on their own roll up now they see themselves as de-risked because even if the L1 implodes or something similar to what happened to me when I was building on Terra if you're on your own roll up then that's a little bit less of a risk for you since theoretically your chain is still running you can move elsewhere my uh my view in this is uh and I've been saying this for a while uh and I felt kind of we didn't feel like this thesis has been increasingly validated especially with like the launch launch of Base um and some of the the newer like op stack uh launches is that uh Enterprise users are actually the perfect uh or are the perfect like sort of customers for Roll-Ups and for for modular blockchains because um they want the things that Roll-Ups provide specifically they want more control and they want more customizability uh and they they have the resources and they have the user base but they don't have to worry about being fragmented from an existing ecosystem like they're like bass doesn't need ethereum you know doesn't actually really need to be part of ethereum to like get users or like you know other like PayPal let's say if they were to do their own roll-up like it's the same thing like they have a user's existing like they don't worry about that stuff they they can spend the money to do the development work to build their role up and in in return what they get is this like dedicated like instance that is customized for their app providing a really good product experience and they get more control too like they can you know bacon kyc or they can uh make it you know free or like have some kind of pay Master thing so they they pay fees on behalf of users or there's all these different like customizations they can do and so I think personally I I think that like uh and another another really important part but although this is not a differentiator with like um uh building a smart contract version of the app but like why wouldn't they build their own L1 is that like if they built their own like L1 like a like an app chain like Cosmos they'd have to issue a token like they would have to run more of the infrastructure themselves and then that's all kind of like this legal gray area so it's kind of like they'd rather just avoid that and that's the beauty of doing a roll-up is like you don't actually have to issue a token you have to run an L1 uh it's much I think well in some ways they're still like risks obviously but like I think it's it's less risky um so to me I think we're gonna increasingly see more and more Enterprises going the route of Roll-Ups all right so we've done uh some some solid thinking this this episode thanks for your perspectives now we're going to get a little bit more lizard brain I'm just gonna ask brief questions uh brief answers in Rapid Fire section obviously feel free to expand uh and then we'll just go Neil and then Nick and Order every single time okay um how do you explain what you do to your parents I don't my parents have never understood what I do even when I was upset it all they asked me what are you doing and they were so interested in electricity and commodities they weren't really interested but at a high level they were just curious what I was spending all day doing so I wrote a blog post called explaining to my parents what I do and I explained the power market and I got so many uh positive responses to that post it was top of Hacker News people loved it and then I found out months later my mom didn't even read it she read like the first sentence and then she came off Neil you should send that to me and I'll put in the show notes oh thank you yeah I'll send it right now okay Nick yeah I on my end uh I remember when I first uh actually read the lazy Adventure white paper and was just like totally just consumed with passion and I try to explain it to my my parents and I I must have to them been like the meme of the guy with the Whiteboard you know and like all the pins and like you know because they were just like okay we can tell you really into this but it makes no sense and so I just I kind of like fall back on this idea of like you know I'm I'm what we're building is a way for like to scale trust for for humans uh using cryptography and that'll kind of like form a new Fabric and a new way for for people to interact and and sort of cooperate on a global scale so that's kind of what I say and that's also very vague but it seems to at least make a little bit more sense what are your favorite three apps in all of crypto I think that uniswap is King to me for its Simplicity because there were other amm constructions before it and I thought that uh that it's partly the reason part of the reason for its adoption is because it's so easy to understand what's going on and obviously they've gone beyond that and it's inspired so many things I think helium's a great idea and it essentially created an industry of decentralized physical infrastructure networks which I personally am very bullish on I recognize it's a bit of a bad and if you look at the economics of it today maybe it's not super sustainable but that's the whole idea and I think if people miss the concept of depends which is you allow for a wild speculation on the token and you can use that speculation to make the network real and it makes it a thing and it's like a weird type of company where you release the stock on day one and let people buy it and then they pay for your services in the form of the stock it's it's just hard to make sense of and people keep comping it to web 2 stuff and I think it's a completely broken way of assessing crypto protocols and it's not the right way of modeling it uh and then the last thing is probably this is like a controversial one but I think at the concept of axi reached so many people and it did more for mainstream like crypto awareness and probably the vast majority of like what what a crypto Maxie would call is like oh this is like a good app it's doing good things for the world I thought actually overall actually did do good things for the world and what they did was they raised awareness they're trying something different whether it's economically sustainable or not they hit the limits of scalability and they were forced onto their own roll up side chain these are all are all very bullish indicators to me yeah I I'd say I saw my first two are a little cosmocentric and D5 Centric but um I'm a big fan of Osmosis um just because I I really love they're they're sort of like to me validating the app chain thesis in the sense of like they have really kind of integrated all these pieces in our building the equivalent of like a a sex experience Central exchange experience on a decentralized exchange and like there's like you know deposit and withdrawal and I I really like that as an idea and I think someone needs to build something like that long term where like you know people aren't using binance they're not using these centralized exchanges instead like they're they're using a decentralized exchange but that gives the same thing because we can't have another FTX again right like we need to learn like evolve and that's if we can't do that as like a baseline then we've kind of failed in my opinion the next one is sommelier because they're I think just it's so clever um what what they've done is they've built sort of like it's sort of like a you know yield sort of like uh earn Vault platform but instead of building it natively on ethereum and most of the strategies aren't deployed on ethereum but it's like a dedicated chain and by by being its own app chain it's able to execute strategies and have another layer of like security and sophistication that you couldn't do so I really love that uh and like people should check that out um and the last one I would say I was I would have maybe said something like actually but I'll uh I'll just like say D5 kingdoms partly because uh you know I used to be part of the harmony team and that was a really big breakout app for the harmony chain um but T5 kingdoms it's just really cool like gaming in general I'm very like bullish on like sort of the intersection of blockchains and gaming and I think D5 kingdoms with like explore like a new dimension of that uh that was like kind of like D5 plus uh gaming Dynamics and I think there's there's something there you know what I mean like like in-game economies and D5 I don't know some someone's going to crack that code at some point so you mentioned gaming is this actually your bullish on and Neil you also mentioned deep in what is the vertical that you're most bullish on in crypto and what is the vertical your most bearish on in crypto hmm bear shot in the short term or long term because I I think that in the short term I'm just a little bit bearish on crypto gaming just because the economics of it at least fully on chain gaming let me clarify I think there's versions of crypto gaming that make a lot of sense but fully on chain gaming the value of the transactions is just too small so I don't see that ever existing in any version of an actually decentralized blockchain but that might be okay if you want to use the blockchain as this read-only API and you want to interoperate with all the rest of crypto and you get to have assets that can be you know ported out of the game and stuff like that and to some degree that exists in web 2 like with steam items API and there are AP uh Eve online has something like that so I I guess my point is that it depends on on how you view the purpose of the blockchain for that but I'd say decentralized fully Unchained gaming I'm not super bullish on and I'm very bullish on the deep end category just as a whole and I like that stuff just partly given my background in Commodities a lot of those guys come from a Commodities background so we can nerd out on Power and oil rigs and stuff like that and they often don't come from a crypto background so that's our opportunity at Eclipse to be those infrastructure experts and tell them what's really not needed or what's the right construction given what they're building so most bearish uh I might say something like real world assets not because I actually think that it will I think it's like a very good use case um I guess what I worry about is like it just seems like it's going to have a lot of like regulatory sort of like headwinds and like that's you know in D5 in general like the regulatory side of it is going to be I think really challenging until we get like Clarity and we can like be above board and like then we'll be able to actually onboard people and scale it up but it's like gonna be a challenge and I think real world assets are really good like within D5 or like specifically really challenging uh for that for that exact reason um and most bullish on um I don't know kind of like either either social or gaming I feel like there's there's something there there's like a virality in social apps and and gaming apps that um you know if someone can crack the code I think it could blow up overnight and like you know things like friend.tech which is kind of trending right now is a good example of how like there's that built in a virality I mean like most of those apps so far like kind of like Blossom and then fade but like someone might actually get it to the point where it like blossoms and is able to like sustain and continue growing and um and so that's that's where I feel like Mass adoption is most likely to come from right now that's a really good point on rwas sometimes I feel like it's kind of like the idea of putting an encyclopedia like when the Internet Was Made taking a meat space encyclopedia and just putting it on the Internet it's not leaning into what makes the internet great and similarly taking real world assets and putting them on chain it's like there's so many other things you can do on chain that are interesting you should maybe lean into that and I feel like people in Bear markets always come back to the same Concepts whether it's real world assets or formerly known as Securities tokens which was a horrible name uh or whether it's like assessing web three companies as if they're web 2 companies and trying to model out their AR when it's like that's that's not the right way to be thinking about it uh and in that same vein I'm very bearish on social applications that don't lean into financialization that's why I mean I love that French hack was so polarizing people are like oh it's the worst parts of crypto Counterpoint is that it's actually the best parts it's taking financialization and applying it into this game gamified social experience that has built-in morality as makes sense so I think leaning into those aspects of crypto is going to be much more fruitful than trying to reject them okay that's a that's a great answer um last question what is something you've completely changed your mind on since starting in crypto the settlement piece is one thing I used to think because people cited so often there everyone's like everyone wants to be a settlement layer settlement's so important just over the last six months just everything that I've looked into and even John Travis piece all this was very damaging to my concept of subtlemen and I'm just anything that describes itself as a settlement there I'm very suspicious of at this point so that's probably the biggest thing and then I mean I started in crypto during like Peak bull market my first project was on the Terra blockchain so honestly it's just my views completely changed I I it's hard to even come up with things that were the same from when I first started for me um you know this is particularly embarrassing but like when I was building Harmony and in general when I was like first learning about blockchains I didn't actually go deep enough into fundamentals and uh frankly I didn't really even realize that verifiability was actually the the source of of the security of a chain like I didn't understand the role and importance of full notes like uh and I think this is a really widespread misconception and some people even when they I think when they understand the role of full nodes they still somehow like cling on to this other idea of what blockchains are for uh and like that it's okay to trust the validators like because I was that was kind of my mental model was like and then if you think about it like sharding itself uh never solves that problem it's like you still you're just trusting the validators on The Shard you're you're making this root assumption that all the validators are participating in the chain are honest and like that is just fundamentally not what blockchains are for and if they were then uh you know we would just why not just have consortiums and like why would we need a blockchain like we just have a like a bunch of web 2 companies run all these decentralized Services right so I didn't understand that for a really long time and it wasn't until like really getting deep in the weeds into Celestia and lazy Ledger and roll up and everything that I was like oh wow my eyes sort of open to it and I was like oh my God okay wow like I've been just like totally misunderstood what's really going on here and I think we need to do a lot more work to educate people and like kind of like reconnect to the the core principles of crypto from the very beginning um and there's there's a lot of work to be done in that that's a really good point like if you ask a like a random person on the street or when I started crypto certainly before really like reading up on the stuff if you ask them if most of bitcoin's overpowered can Bitcoin steal your funds they'd probably answer yes they'd probably assume oh that's what the honest majority assumption means 51 attack that's not possible like that's that's just not how the blockchain works yeah it's it's really funny I I can feel so dumb in this space but then I can feel like everyone else is so dumb even though we're so smart because we're like oh we discovered Intense or like are Roll-Ups real like we just got like we talk about these things that seem so obvious and like you know fifth grade level when you're looking back at it um but obviously it's extremely complicated and um last point on the settlement issue we just had uh Anatolian and he's probably one of the few people that probably even you know two years ago was talking about how settlements not an afterthought but how it's not near as valuable is what people talk about um he's like that's not the fun part um but guys thanks so much for coming on I think it's really exciting Nick what you're doing with Celestia and also nil building out the svm and I think together it's fun how you can work together but also like not only does ethereum benefit from this but Solana can and then obviously all these app chains in the future so thanks so much for coming on it was a lot of fun well thank you guys so much I have a lot of respect for the Solana community and what you guys are building and I'm looking forward to you know this this modularism not maximism thing where we all can benefit from each other like you're just saying so yeah and we're going to be working hard to push adoption of the svm to the ethereum community uh we're really excited to be partnering with a bunch of a lot of projects on this launch that we're uh pushing pretty soon a bunch of infrastructure projects and wallets and stuff like that so if you're a project in Solana Community I appreciate you reaching out uh for anyone in the audience sweet guys all right we'll talk to you next time [Music] [Music] [Music]
