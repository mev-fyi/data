one thing I've been surprised by is relatively few people can understand and speak multiple narratives in crypto that say to understand and speak the Bitcoin maximalist narrative is one whole school of thought and then to discuss the web 3 narrative is another and then maybe the Privacy narrative there's certainly overlap among these eventually I realized that they're as different as at least dialects if not languages this episode is brought to you by Judo Judo is the easiest way to start earning Mev Awards on Solana through liquid staking get your soul stake it with Judo and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token Judo Soul get started today at Judo dot Network [Music] thank you hey everyone welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we have a special one with Balaji and Akshay BD guys welcome to the show good to be here thank you very much I wanted to start today with uh something a little special I know you guys are friends I thought maybe give a background on each other um actually if you want to start that'd be great all right meet Balaji srinivasan uh former CTO of coinbase former GP of Henderson Horowitz um you know investor in some of uh the most prolific crypto breakout startups as well as Tech Two startups he also you know makes company and sold that but you know invest in things like epns forecaster Bitcoin Instagram Lambda School basically anything you think of that's had a hockey stick he probably has has had a role in playing uh has role play in that whether it's naming superhuman uh or helping name superhero in the early days or you know running uh a company like 21.com eventually selling that to coinbase so uh welcome biology it's incredible to have you on the podcast and uh more than anything I think he's one of the most principal thinkers and operators that I know and he has uh the most predictable uh style of working with any other person which makes it a place to work with him because he's incredibly principal I learned a lot about uh how to do business from him every day great well um good to be here thanks uh Akshay uh so I you know akshay's background uh he's um the one person in India who didn't major in engineering um uh but uh it's very talented person and uh made his way up through Uber India and uh you know that that got built into a very large business unit for Uber made his way out to the US from that which was actually relatively unusual getting transferred from Uber India to the main HQ um and uh did a lot of stuff at Uber during its hockey stick growth phase and then uh more recently has become very senior at the Solana Foundation um and has done a bunch of other things you know besides that but those are two things that are kind of legible to the to the outside world uh and uh it's a great guy thank you for the intros that was fun uh there's so much we can talk about today we definitely want to talk about crypto ecosystem as a whole um Network sex communities but to start off I want to go with when you dedicate your time um and your money to crypto what are you taking a bet on are you are you taking a bet on that we're going to be able to build 10 times better products you're betting on D dollarization and financial collapse or is it something else and apology you want to start yeah well um it's it's a it's a bet on several things at the same time because it's uh uh so any any individual protocol for example digital gold uh you know what what Bitcoin represents is a bet on essentially a return to hard money um and you're seeing that's become a U.S presidential issue you're seeing central banks buying gold um you're seeing a lot of shakiness around the dollar that's definitely you know that's a whole topic we can go to then there's you know uh something like ethereum which is like a parallel Wall Street right decentralized Finance is just in many ways better than traditional Finance just just for example in terms of uptime you go from you know us nine to five hours during the weekday for trading so like you know eight hours a day for five days so 40 hours to 24 7 uptime which is 168 hours a week so that is already like a massive increase uh you're going from um sub 90 uptime to 9 99 Point whatever percent uptime that completely transforms what you can do when it's 24 7. and that's just one aspect of there's the international aspect in fact you can do Capital formation across borders there's the transparency all of that kind of stuff right um and then you have you know something like Solana which uh which I think of as um like another gear on the bicycle where uh you can just blast lots of events on chain like the new compressed nfts thing just blast a million rather than a one nft for a million dollars a million nfts for a few dollars just blast some unchain and that's convenient in a lot of ways there's ways of doing that on ethereum too with the l2s but um there's Solana then there's Z cash was a bet on privacy and all the zero knowledge stuff that's come out of that um Z cash itself may not have captured all the value it's created in terms of the ubiquity of I think where zero knowledge is going to get and so it's sort of like saying what is the internet a bet on well Google and Facebook and so they're all different kinds of things you know Google is your short libraries basically right you know long Google your short libraries Facebook uh your long online interaction um and you know Twitter your short traditional news media in a sense and so it's multiple bets it's not just one yeah for me um uh it's just much more about uh the stuff I understand which is how do you which is mostly what I've experienced which is like how do you turn labor into Capital without a barrier to doing that right if there's a group of people that can uh come together to do some work and own a piece of their fruits of their labor without having to go through some elaborate process that includes skipping through regulatory hoops and lawyers and accountants and things like this uh that I think allows us to live in a world where there is much more uh equitable distribution of capital um and I know I sound like uh you know some of the folks who in the early days talked about the labor movement but I really think that that's just how the that's that's a much more that's a fair way of Distributing Capital while you still stick to a roughly capitalist economy you know the thing is I think if crypto uh certainly there's a technological element to it there's also the ideological element to it and I I posted this a while back but I think that uh one thing I've been surprised by is relatively few people can understand and speak multiple narratives in crypto that say to understand and speak the Bitcoin maximalist narrative is one whole school of thought and then to discuss the web 3 narrative is another and then maybe the Privacy narrative there's certainly overlap among these but eventually I realized that they're as different as at least dialects if not languages because for example Bitcoin maximism brings in all of this history and culture of fiat currency and so on and so forth if you're a hacker or a programmer and you just want to I don't know maybe move money around the world you don't you don't think you care about that maybe you don't care about or you don't think you care you will eventually care but you don't think you care and uh so um so you know I actually look at it as first and foremost actually ideological and the technology is actually Downstream of the ideology that say you are essentially saying okay this is a system we'd like to build Satoshi started with the system that he wanted to build then he coded something that reflected that as opposed to this is just a way to make things better faster cheaper that's that's important but it's actually Downstream of the ideological assumptions I really want to talk about kind of the the part of like maybe earning crypto versus being bought uh a little later on the show but while we're here biology you're obviously very technical you're performing C2 at coinbase and I've heard a lot of your takes on you know Bitcoin ethereum crypto in general um what are your thoughts like what is your mental model when you think about crypto infrastructure and there are Altos in modular L2 ideologies there's the monolithic Solana and al-1 ideology and then there's kind of the cosmos app chain ideology where you have full vertical ownership of your stack how do you think about those things um and which do you have a preference for one over the other uh I think that uh it's certainly conceptually easier to put everything in one place it's a little bit like um like when you're coding an app do you do a monolith or do you do microservices in general you kind of want to do a monolith because once you've got other services things get complicated you don't want to factor things out until you have to that's like with web 2 development but I do think that all three of the things all through those architectures both blasting old events on chain like Solana or having dedicated app chains or having ethereum and then l2s all them are the right approach for different things for example if you have a huge scaled ethereum application you may not want to Port it or may not be able to fully Port it just given the huge ecosystem that's being built over there but you can get some excess capacity some relief for transaction costs potentially by taking the cognitive hit of moving some transactions over to an L2 and you know doing that bridge and you have to manage that and uh but but that may be doable if you can't extricate yourself if you're dependent upon a lot of other contracts or or if you just can't move for cultural reasons you know social reasons um the app chain model also frankly has a lot to say for it as well because uh you know it's um it's actually something where you can imagine an app being built which just has a postgres database and that's just mirrored publicly and you know people can see the events or some subs of it at the The crucial event log and then that eventually becomes its own chain or it is something which is just a full app chain from the beginning and the downside of that is of course you're a Galapagos Island you know you're totally separate from the rest of the ecosystem and so on the upside is that you can optimize that for those kinds of events and uh you know arguably that's what BNB You could argue BNB is more General than that but BNB started on ethereum and then it became its own chain right kind of a dedicated chain to back what binance is doing and you can also have an app chain that's tokenless sort of like what coinbase is doing with bass and why is that interesting well because that's an app chain that's really an API chain meaning it is a better way of doing a centralized API so normally you just hit the coinbase API and you're just hitting code but now with bass coinbase is opening not just its uh code but it's state it's mirroring more of its state publicly right so that is just a new way of thinking about API design you're just taking some of the internal coinbase data and rather than hitting a rest API 50 times to rebuild you know what coinbase knows about the state of this object that you care about you just inspect the public base you know chain right and and that's better for a variety of reasons as we'll see because you can you know if everybody is going and hitting a rest API and they're pulling and mirroring a data set locally that's incredibly inefficient you're sucking the thing through a straw whereas if the state is actually public like it is with base that's way more efficient everybody can just view that synchronize that and so on and so forth so then there's actually like a fifth or a sixth which would be um the thing that neither Bitcoin or ethereum people like uh and other people don't like it as well but it's probably better for both and what that is is um taking for example some contract on ethereum and uh you know because you want to backup every 10 minutes you hash the the chain State or the chain tip to the Bitcoin blockchain maybe using ordinals or maybe something else and why would you want to do that well that's you know you could call that a sub Gene you know where you're basically uh for the cost of one transaction every 10 minutes 144 transactions a day um times 365 so like you know a few tens of thousand transactions a year at a dollar transaction a few tens of thousands of dollars it could be more if it goes up you're getting the security of Bitcoin and in the event that anybody disputes and says oh you know like I thought this transaction didn't happen you can rewind to that chain tip you can point to the Bitcoin blockchain you can say that this happened at this time and so the point is all of those different infrastructures and architectures I think will be useful in different contexts um and we'll see basically see what happens yeah that makes sense to me it's with the app chain with Cosmos it's it's all about sovereignty and it's almost a trade-off between sovereignty and network effects that seems at this time like you're talking about if you build on something like bass you almost have a built-in Network effect and then you can lean on ethereum and you have that liquidity uh actually I know when you came into crypto did you go straight to Solano like what Drew you in uh what was it about Solana did you did you start somewhere else well I have to create biology with this because uh he got me a crypto because he was working on this uh thing called 1729 at the time and um he was sort of exploring what the you know early stages of what we now know to be the network state is and wanted some uh he's like hey do you have some time to come help with this I don't know what this is going to be and if you want to spend a few hours a week I should come do that so I did that for a few months that was like my Fast Track uh MBA I guess into uh understanding what crypto is like and then I eventually got you know started making on-chain transactions I used a lot of I remember it was the solid wallet and I was mind blown by sort of like the user experience at the time and I was like okay this is really interesting because I remember I uh texted Raj which he tweeted at some point saying you know felt like taking my first Uber ride or like using like the iPhone for the first time so I was just drawn to it and I was I figured okay well is there anything I could do to you make my skills uh valuable here and then so that's eventually how I got involved in Islamic customer help uh with International expansion which at the time they were looking to do and you know sort of helped launch various communities around the world that we it's sort of called the super team program as uh folks who in the Islamic system may know about it but we're in many countries it's fully local bilingual teams building out uh communities of people who contribute to the salon Network hey everyone quick break to tell you about Gino Gino's the number one liquid staking provider in Salon Gino's been known for the Meb software and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem Solana D5 summer is

show notes use the link so they know that I sent you and go get started today foreign coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech roll up to count extraction Mev app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blind speed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show so it seems like you got essentially Network State filled by biology and then it kind of took off from there uh so I I did uh this is actually one of my favorite books I did read it twice um I am curious about you what is the origin there like how did you first come up with the network State idea was it something that develops gradually or you just had like a moment uh you know your Archimedes moment well you can go and you can see a talk from uh 20 2015 with the title Network state in Estonia so I've been thinking about these concepts for a long time uh in 2013 I had a speech at Y combinator and this uh article that wrote wired that I think have held up fairly well um controversial at the time but I think it was it has proven I think reasonably reasonably good you know before I actually even had my Twitter account that was actually I only said my Twitter I think December 2013. it was a very late as early as it was to crypto I was late to social media for a variety of reasons because in the 2000s and you guys might be too young to remember this but in the 2000s you know Facebook started out in colleges and Twitter started out as just you know basically narcissists in San Francisco talking about what they ate for breakfast right to eating their breakfast and um it just seemed completely uninteresting to me in a total waste of time to to do that to like you know it's like the animals that pet each other's fur and just do that all day right that that's what like social media was in the 2000s right and then actually what made me get into it was um I remember I saw there was a genomics conference where a in a friendly acquaintance of mine had live tweeted it and I could attend the conference remotely and drink in all of the information including all the really technical details about bam files and fastq and what are all the stuff that's technical in that area that no journalist would ever have been able to write up but a specialist in the area would have and I was able to do that and I didn't have to do a plane flight or anything like they could just drink and just like crack the marrow just get the get the information right out of that conference right and I was like okay now I get Twitter and but you turn out to scale to such an extent before it was useful for something as seemingly narrow as that right now of course you can do that with any interesting thing that you're interested in in the world if you want to find out I don't know what's going on in Kurdistan or whatever there's probably some people tweeting about that and it's not everything but it's a whole Specialist Group there's probably 15 people who have a lot of coverage on whatever topic you care about anyway thing is that uh where Network save come in so um the short answer is that I realized in the 2000s and the early 2010s that all the Innovation that I wanted to do in biomedicine was blocked by the FDA and uh you know genomics wasn't simply a technical problem it wasn't simply a logistical problem it was a regulatory problem which meant it was a political problem which meant it was a sovereignty problem okay so you know you come back to how you know what technologies are actually going to be allowed to be legal why don't we have life extension right why don't we have limb regeneration and stuff like that what things are prioritized by the state what kinds of things are thought of as morally good or bad to pursue right why don't we think of death as bad why don't we actively pathologize it why are we you know for example you give a lot more coverage to um many unimportant things than you do to cancer or heart disease or things like that covet's actually the exception that proves the rule in the sense that there were Public Health dashboards and people could look at those and I think that actually did make people more health conscious in some ways a lot of the Quantified Self Fitness tracker stuff is kind of taken off after that but really you know people talk about a stock market as a measure you know people say oh this country is doing well it's GDP is up okay what's its life expectancy is that up what what are its death rates what are what's the muscle mass of those people like what's your body fat like why aren't we looking at those things we have all of these economic indicators and frankly even those economic indicators are very macro because the stock market okay it's fine but it's only for the shareholders what about the median net worth of that country is everybody going into massive debt oh well that might actually be feeling you know you might be looking at the wrong metrics right so so things like that um not you know the biomedical things what got me started on it but eventually I realized that we just need very deep-seated political reform and in a sense that's what that's what you know startups and Tech are they're a vehicle for reform you know Blockbusters failing so you do Netflix Microsoft is failing so you do Google the post office is failing so you do email uh SpaceX is failing or NASA is failing so you do SpaceX and so on and so forth right uh General Motors is failing so you do Tesla and essentially you can think of tech as a vehicle for reform of a particular kind which is it's not about um going and taking over an existing institution and trying to do a turnaround what Elon is doing at Twitter is very exceptional actually in that respect right uh it is I'm not saying it can't be done you know like Steve Jobs did it at Apple and Sophia did a Microsoft it can be done but that's not our base case those are actually relatively uh you know very difficult and important cases but the relatively unusual relative to most startups which are you start from a clean slate you have empowered management you know Venture returns if you have all three of those you have a shot at building something amazing when you go and try and reform San Francisco or the FDA for example you don't have those things you don't have a clean slate because you have all this Legacy code you don't have empowered management because power is being fractured it's like airplane Legend of Zelda I have back in the day yep back in the day okay what's the whole point of the game to reunite the Triforce right Triforce piece of being smashed and scattered all over the world that is basically what all divided government is the entire thing you have to do the entire Legend of Zelda Quest before you can make a decision you have to reunify the Triforce and get to you know 51 consensus or whatever before you can make any decision so you have to play the whole game through before you can do the most basic thing okay so once you realize think of it that way every single vote that has to happen is is reunifying the Triforce which is uh which is this whole complicated thing right and uh so you don't have empowered management and the third thing you definitely don't have Venture returns if you're reforming San Francisco you're forming FDA uh it might require a lot of capital to hire new people to turn it around to do all the stuff but you can't have private investment come in and do that but you could do uh you could do a startup City I think it's going to be easier to do a startup city than to reform San Francisco just as easier to do Bitcoin than to form the fed and with Bitcoin you did have empowered Management in the form of Satoshi you had um a clean slate in the sense of you know no no Legacy code you didn't have fed wire and ACH none of that stuff had to be grandfathered into Bitcoin and of course you had Venture returns right and so once you kind of see that that combination of Clean Slate empowered management Venture returns that is where our sweet spot is and then the metagame is how do you create those clean slates because um you know you had to actually like defeat the Soviet Union and uh ding Xiaoping had to win in a coup against Mao in 1978 for capitalism to be legalized in Russia and China like basically before then entrepreneurs uh were that entrepreneurship was punishable by death did you know that no yeah in China oh you see that's what communism is communism is entrepreneurship is punishable by death yeah okay there's uh just to give some color on this um this is you know there's a good article on this this is one I cite sometimes just to give you some color the secret document the transformed China we'll pull all these up and include them in the show notes as well sure but basically like just let me poke on that for a second from let's say 1917 to 1989 the exits were blocked right in 1979 anyone in Russia if you were a Founder you're an entrepreneur if you're a small businessman they call them cool locks in the early 20th century you know what they did to the gulags no I sound like Tim Ferriss to all the nose yeah yeah they killed sorry sorry well yeah they killed the cool locks right Lenin gave something called a hanging order right that killed the kulox uh I mean that's actually that was just the thing which shows evidence for for what he did yeah but basically what communism was was guys with guns coming to your house killing the husband raping the wife taking the kids off to the gulag stealing the farm for the state multiply that by a million people that's what that was this insanely bloody message then when they call it by euphemisms like Land Reform or collectivization right it basically meant they had a list of all the people who had positive net worth and they went and stole everything for the government right and then the government itself was totally corrupt right so uh you know it was basically just one gang of of mercenaries that uh let's say let's call them religious zealots a better way of thinking about it because they did actually believe in their crazy ideology um they believe in an ideology that said let's kill that rich guy and take his money and not call it theft right that was essentially what communism was and so the thing is that uh The Minority Report was squelched in Russia like you couldn't go and start a company you couldn't reform things all exits were closed you couldn't even leave the country right you know in countries that they took over like the Berlin you know like uh like East Germany they built a Berlin Wall so you couldn't exit you couldn't you can't get out of North Korea today unless you're you know you smuggle away on a boat you can't get out of Cuba they'll shoot you in the back for trying to leave right that's literally why the wet foot tri-foot policy was established basically uh if you made it to the U.S then you could say in the US if you didn't make it to us well you get to drown the ocean or get thrown into a Cuban Gulag right so uh you know all of these Communist States were like this where they blocked the exits they blocked the ability to certainly to create new corporations they block any form of dissidence whatsoever any form of constructive criticism because that's what starting a company is it is a constructive criticism it says I think you're wrong I'm going to prove I'm right I'm going to do so by starting a new business that shows that I'm going to take away your customers from them right so point is that it was an enormous ideological and political battle to just be able to click on stripe Atlas and set up a new company okay just that I mean and now 20 years later we 30 years later we take that totally for granted you see an entrepreneur like vitalik or you see we call it let's say a Founder like vitalik a Founder like CZ you know who's of Russian or Chinese ancestry and literally 40 years ago that same person might have been executed in China or Russia maybe 40 years ago in China maybe 60 years seven years ago in Russia because stalinism had moderated by you know the the 60s and 70s it might not have been actually it might have just been uh like canceled you know but you know they call it in the Soviet Union in China Purge Purge Purge right that's what it called there okay all right so what's the point point is um it was this huge battle to be able to start new companies massive political ideological battle it's something we totally take for granted today but quote Freedom isn't free all right and so now what is the battle we're in today okay today we're in the battle not to start new companies but what to start new currencies we're in this huge battle with the SEC and with the cfcc and with all these governments around the world right uh and with the you know the U.S uh regulatory system they're basically in a sense trying to kill their air kill their success or kill their competition because the U.S financial system actually is uh teetering if hundreds or even thousands of banks are insolvent if there are trillions of dollars in unrealized losses at Stanford reports if the safest asset in the world meaning U.S treasuries is the riskiest ass in the world if we're on the verge of something that's bigger than 2008 not just a uh real estate crisis which it is not just a you know financial crisis which it is but a bond crisis a Central Banking crisis a currency crisis well then Defy is a successor to Trad Phi in much the same way that like when the world went to lockdown people went remote but even more fundamentally than that because this one might not come back from lockdown right this one might be you know going down for the count right rather than you know just going down for a a period of time so the thing is we're actually in this enormous fight which we're probably going to win uh the reason we're going to win is because there's more Theory I could talk about but history is running in reverse the centralized state was Rising into the 1950s and it's been losing power since then um anyway the point is it was a huge political ideological battle to be able to start new companies we're in the middle of the one to start new currencies and then what comes next I believe and what's kind of already ongoing is starting new cities and then new countries one way of just you know expressing that by the way is uh for example in 1945 1950 Germany countries were in the U.N here I'll show you a graph this is not what people expect to see the number of countries has increased over the last uh 70 years from about 45 50 something in 1950 to almost 200 today 193 U.N member countries and that's because the British Empire and the French Empire and the later the Soviet Empire broke down okay if uh if I'm right about what is coming if we actually and whether it comes in months or years or a decade I don't know it's really hard to say but if this series of cascading insolvencies the Western Financial system is as serious as I think it might be and I'm not the only one who thinks this by the way dalio thinks we have 18 months or something like that trucker Miller is like you know it's 200 trillion in outstanding debts that can't be paid uh Larry Fink thinks now Bitcoin is digital goal it's a hedge against the dollar people have said they've gone for saying to dollarization isn't going to happen to uh we need to fight for it and there's a whole hearing on Congressional um The crucial hearing on the dot all this kind of stuff the overtime is moving pretty quickly on this and you know people are in denial about the mortgage crisis as well in 06 and 07 and even early 2008 until it was finally acknowledged September 2008. point is if something like that is coming and I think I think it might be um then the ability to form new political units in the aftermath of that it'll be like the metabolism of the Soviet Empire you know it just broke down into a lot of different things yeah apology on that you had this I think this is on Tim Ferriss two years ago you compared the Overton window and Market depth and how those two things shift and how they correlate could you give that because I think it's a really cool analogy sure sure so it's actually it's actually a very powerful analogy so Market depth let me start with that because most of yours will be familiar with that right Market depth it's like the v in an order book basically it's like you know children will ask where do babies come from well adults will ask where do prices come from where do prices come from they come from order books that is say normally you think of uh so I give an example of orange juice okay you say what's the price of orange as well the store is selling it for I don't know a dollar a gallon okay I'm just making up a round number it's probably cheap but fine it's a dollar a gallon of orange juice and most people are price takers they don't even think about the price being set because it's they're buying it from the store if I were you went to the store and you emptied out uh the grocery store and you bought 100 gallons of orange juice for a dollar and you took it all off well then you go to the next grocery store and it's a a dollar ten they're all quoting you at a dollar ten for that orange juice you go the next one and it's a dollar fifty and eventually all the grocery stores get wind that this crazy guy is coming and buying all the oranges they start jacking up the price in you know advance of you coming that gives you a sense of how prices are actually Dynamic and how the price responds to your massively increased demand you know and that's basically what's happening on coinbase and binance and so on every day is people are saying I want you know 100 units of orange juice at a dollar except they're saying I want 100 units of this coin at a dollar and they'll buy it out and then the remaining Supply I will be at higher and higher price so that V of all of the uh guys who are selling and all the guys who are buying is called order book right and it's typically a v it can be you know have weird shapes and so on it's typically a v the reason it's a v is because uh most buyers want to buy for a really low price and most sellers want to sell for a really high price so as you get away from mid-market you have more buyers like a lot of buyers would like to buy Bitcoin at five thousand dollars and a lot of sellers like to sell Bitcoin a hundred thousand so as you go far away from the center of the market you have more buyers and more Sellers and at Mid Market eventually these people are agreeing on where the current market price is and if you have uh people who just have enough money and have enough energy they can just move the market one way or push the market another way with a huge amount of buying or selling pressure right and that's how Market depth works that's how the order book works now you can compare that actually to the so-called Overton window and the Overton window is a different concept from um from uh political science uh and it basically says that you have policies that are considered insane radical controversial you know possible right and uh and then there's the current policy and then you can go to the other side as well right um because you can go right or left or whatever Dimension you want and the concept of the overtime window is you know for example starting a business in 1977 China was insanely radical way outside the original window by 2017 China was totally routine you could do it all the time right by 1987 China 10 years later you could do it all the time okay so sometimes you can have the Overton window shift very rapidly and political positions and what is acceptable what the what the uh what the policy is changes very rapidly and the analogy between that versus the order book is with enough political pressure with a strong enough block of let's call it votes right with enough votes and enough concentrated votes you can have like buy or sell pressure to shift that midpoint of policy in One Direction or another just like you can on a price all right and it's actually a good analogy because you know price also has independent motion due to the crowd and just people who are outside but it can also be moved by pressure groups especially if it's like a thinly traded uh order book right if there isn't a lot of volume a pressure group can move and a price actually quite a lot and so a policy that not too many people care about can probably be moved by an activist group much more easily than one which has a lot of attention on a lot of buy and sell Demand on both sides right and once you kind of think about it this way well you realize that um you know often sometimes you want to shift things on the market axis and you want to need to move prices uh or you need buys and sells but sometimes you need to move things on the political access to uh to essentially move votes and policies in a different sense and that's why like you think of tech and politics as being fully integrated where to achieve your objective you might need to use the right hand you might need to select hand you might need to use both together as we're seeing in crypto itself yeah that's that's very well put and one thing I'm super curious about is so obviously crypto is maybe this new movement that sort of combines politics and Tech you know actually I know you tweeted the other day like cryptos is much much a political movement as much as it is a technological movement one one problem I've seen so far especially within Dao's and and you know when you're looking to form these communities that want to make change in the world is alignment and incentive mechanisms um currently there's a lot of noise out there because people maybe get you know uh blinded by coin price and they get aligned or incentivized by the wrong things so I guess I'm curious this is a question for both of you like what are how do you think about aligning communities to achieve a common goal like how do you structure people such that they are actually driving towards a single Mission and not getting blinded by the price of coin X we should sort of be specific about what a community is you know when uh when we started super team we were very clear that we're not going to have some treasury that everybody's going to work on and like you can't get 10 people in a room and have them agree on what color the pen should be for the office that they're about to like inhabit and so there's just no way you're going to get people to make decisions of that have large stakes in fact um uh I used to work at Uber and we used to have this thing where it's like make the decision with the least number of people required to make the decision in the room and then communicate it effectively outwards right so uh I've always just been a fan of like uh sort of like effective decision making I think a community has roughly three properties one is they're ideologically aligned to their financially incentivized three that are operationally capable right and those are uh I guess that's like a trilemma that I like it sort of internally referred to and I know we don't think the trailer Master also you know this might not be as well and I might just be bsing but you know the I think if if you you have to manage the financial incentives with the operational capability right and I think ID in an Ideal World or at least one my answer to this is you have ideological alignment and and sort of like uh alignment toward a mission and everyone's crowdsourcing labor and capital to achieve that mission but that is done in two Pizza teams so you can have a community which is sort of a base layer of people who are aligned towards achieving a mission but they and they spin off in roll-ups like maybe they're private entities their private companies maybe they're llc's maybe they're sub-dials whatever they are they spin off in into Roll-Ups with their own cap tables or coin tables to achieve a submission that maps to the major mission and as each one of those sub-dials or private companies or LLCs achieve those missions that incentivizes other people do also crowdsource labor and capital to be as effective right that's basically what super team is where there is no token or treasury that for anybody to fight or or speculate on but once they get in after like Pro you know anybody can get into super team but not everybody can right because it's gated by proof of work once you contribute enough to the to building the network you sort of get let in and then you can work your way up to learn learn and build as we like to say right and so um to me that's what a community is it's a group of people who are aligned around uh sort of like a specific mission that they want to achieve and everyone's trying to crowd search label our Capital into different entities that may spin out of this and they want to achieve that I think the most rudimentary version of that was last uh cycle Dows where everyone's trying to vote on everything I think that's sort of like disastrous because most people don't end up voting and very few people end up controlling the outcome of the you know sort of common funds or worse you have everybody voting on a situation which means it's basically a financial mob at that point and we saw this with uh what is uh like sushi swap I guess where they were unwilling to vote on approving payments to Engineers who didn't own any sushi which was insane so it's either of those are like bad outcomes and so I think the decision making should be bounded to the smallest possible group and you use nfts and sort of this cultural identity um to bind the larger group and this is sort of where I think some of the things that biology says around Network States sort of coincides with how you can have a relatively with a broad purpose but you can have infinite number of uh or you can have many units or private companies or llc's or whatever the correct structure is for that um group to achieve its purpose right because then you the community also works well by the way when you have when you're limited by the dunbar's number which is the number of people you can know in your lifetime by name and face so since we started super team membership has been capped at 150. so we something called The Purge party where we very sort of like eliminate the members who join and then maybe they got jobs and did other things with their lives and they became inactive we've been doing this for two years right and that's held Us in good steady those 150 people are like I like to say members or numbers right we don't need to go and get like a 100 000 followers yeah we need to make those 150 people very successful and once they do that they achieve escape velocity bespokespeople for the community you don't need like a marketing arm so yeah on that I was going to say do you think you can scale above the Dunbar number and is that something that crypto allows you to do maybe with tokens like is that where tokens come in is that a can coordinate a group that's bigger than 150. and I think part of that is to like really have a group that has a cohesive Mission you almost need to go through trials and tribulations and I'm not saying price is the way to do that but I think that's really helped the ethereum community and probably Solana as well because they've gotten punched in the face like multiple times over the last year you saw that price go up to 200 and then back to I don't know what it was eight dollars and that almost binds the community even more so I don't know if the do you think a token is necessary to scale beyond that 150 or are you better off um apology even when you talk about the network States how do you get above that 150 number because I know you've talked about like a I think it was like a million people in a network say it would be a very successful model to you so what do you think binds that group together there's at least three different ways of aligning people um inheritance incentives ideology meaning genetics um economics politics right and uh those are respectively you know inheritance is like Hamilton's rule you know it's basically like Inclusive fitness if you um it's like an ant colony for example they coordinate because they have essentially shared genetics um economics is you know you can think of in terms of Game Theory or positive some outcomes that's like you know or prisoners element studies coordination in that context and then politics uh there's different ways to think about that but like uh spatial theory of voting is one way of quantifying that each of those are terms if you just go and Google those you know um Hamilton's rule positive sum in in Game Theory and uh and spatial Theory voting you'll see there's some there's some math and quantification pretty robust quantification on that and why is that important because you can take a group and you can actually quantify whether they are genetically economically or politically aligned ideally you want all three now Tech thinks a lot about economics and in fact alignment typically is thought of as purely economic alignment but um if you look at what gets people to fight in Wars like you know for example Ukrainian nationalism that is in part genetics they're all genetically Ukrainian or they're related to each other right so uh so that's definitely a factor a major factor in indeed through history it predates economics certainly because you know we have we've only had economies for whatever thousand years we've had genetics going way longer than that and certainly animals have that and there's politics and ideology more generally and that's important as well because uh that's like an Ever burning fire okay for example I funded various startup societies like like cul-de-sac.com it's car free Society or kiff.com it's van life and people aren't there for the token you know they're they're there for the moral social ethical political belief that creates a new community which says you know what uh in in their view cars are the biggest problem in society if they're going to spend years of their life building something new they're going to build a car free Society why because what do cars do cars mean that we have these streets that divide each other we have uh people sort of put into solitary confinement in these houses or these apartments um and that's not how people are meant to live they're supposed to live in communities and now you could have swimming pools and grass and Greenery and so on and they're not like totally they're not you know dumb there are cars but on the outskirts of the city however people get better exercise they meet a community and so on and so forth right so you can take that car free ideology you propagate all the way out and you get actually a society that is there for something other than money now the money also has to be there because the car free Society is built for remote work right so the money comes in through the cloud and it's coming in through starlink and technology is certainly important of course they've got to eat right scarcity does matter but it's kind of like thinking about something not just from the x-axis of Economics as crucial as that is as neglected as that often is but also from the y-axis and the z-axis at the same time to start having sort of different engines and if one of those engines conks out and the price is down well the ideology is still there still enough for the Cause right and if that is getting you know oh there's some political well you know what the money is there we kind of stick with it because I need the job and so on right so you have sort of backups you know rather than it's like multiple engines on a plane rather than any one engine being determinative of the whole thing and what's interesting is when um you know you mentioned there's actually a good way of putting it that when the price collapses 80 90 percent a lot of the Front Runners and short-term people do leave and there's like it's kind of like crypto has had these ongoing waves of natural selection and I think my friend Nick Carter made this remark he's like if you can just hang on and make it through and stick through the whole thing right and not rage quit when it seems like it's time to quit you do great right in the in the long run that may not always be so but I think it is I think basically we're all in a secular uptrend as the Legacy State metabolizes and breaks into a thousand pieces all the wealth and power that it stole redecentralizes the thing that people you know you really have to have a model of what the 1800s was like it was a time of Rockefeller and Carnegie and all of these Founders who could build these amazing things and you the centralized government was Rising like you know like uh but it wasn't as overbearing as it became in the 20th century the century totalitarianism and whatnot right and so now that that's running in Reverse you have more opportunity to make your name more opportunity to build something on your own it's more chaos as well I'm not saying it's all there's reasons that people want decentralization once you know it's like the is that proverb the Empire long divided must unite long United must divide such as always being the way of things but the point is that uh the way you align people is not just economics the others also matter so you know let me put it like that last thing I'll say is Tech has uh Tech has really become a community well it's becoming an ethnic group just like many political parties are essentially becoming ethnic groups like you know I put up some stats a while back showing that uh 96 of Democrats are not married to Republicans okay so that's where ideology becomes biology in one generation the political becomes a genetic and of course the economic as well because the laws influence what trade happens with near bars for example like California passed some laws against trading with Republican states or something like that a while back right like they it was like a small thing but it was like uh but it'll become larger over time um whereas like restricting the travel of uh members to Red States that had certain laws right So eventually when you have enough political differences um I mean what's the political difference between North and South Korea is also a big economic difference is also now a big genetic difference because bigger and bigger genetic difference because they've uh you know basically not intermarried for now two or three generations right it's only two or three but if it's 20 or 30 that starts to become quite a Divergence all right let me pause here so since I'm on the Bird app quite a bit I have some ptsc from tribalism between these communities uh one thing I want to touch on is like so when you said you know you can imagine maybe a startups or a network state where there's people who just don't believe in cars and they think cars are like um you know a waste of space Etc now I could imagine there's actually the complete opposite of that in in that same universe where there's people who only believe in cars and they live out of their cars and whatnot and maybe a parallel to this is more like you know Bitcoin people wanting ethereum to get regulated and for Gensler to kind of regulate all these other points um so it seems like there's this inherent tribalism aspects when you kind of organize communities in such a way how do you you know how do you combat that what do you what do you do against the face of such tribalism that we've seen so much in crypto well uh so I I think first is to realize that um it doesn't make rational sense but it does from a meta-rational standpoint so like you know I talked about this before on the ferris podcast but like if you are an orthodox libertarian why would you want the you know basically illegitimate sec I mean you you have to comply with it when it has a gun to your head but it's just obviously this captured corrupt agency that has been you know like in cahoots with Sam bankman freed of FTX and meeting with him and totally fine with him but attacking all the good actors in the space you know you have you have the head of the sea genzler is talking about when he was at MIT how Bitcoin ethereum Litecoin and uh Bitcoin cash are not Securities and then he turns around and says they are right it's completely corrupt uh thing why would you want that to have more power well oh because your enemy's enemy is your friend okay why is ethereum your enemy well because they think it's a zero-sum competition for every dollar that goes into crypto it could go into either Bitcoin or ethereum or something else that's one aspect the other aspect is many of them and people have said it's like my friend Peter McCormack has admitted and I I don't think he'll think this is a diss or anything that a lot of it is like a dry drunk where you know somebody who has a problem with alcohol might rage against alcohol a lot because they just don't want it near them since they can't hold their liquor and so some fraction of people have lost a lot of money on making bets on other digital assets and they didn't lose their own Bitcoins they're like you know nobody should ever bet on anything other than Bitcoin and so on so that's another aspect but I think the most fundamental is that we're tapping into really fundamental human um drives where you talk about you know atheism monotheism polytheism except you extend that from God to the state of the network let me talk about that for a second explain what I mean with that so basically um God State Network I talked about that in the network safe book but it's essentially about what do you think is the most powerful force in the world is it almighty God is it the U.S military and the centralized state or is it encryption and the decentralized network the reason that's so important is you know like a kid will stay on a playground you know my dad can beat up your debt and that like silly kind of kid remark actually has a lot of um a lot of weight behind because the question is whose God can beat up who's God right basically what happened in the 20th century is uh in the 1800s a lot of people actually believed in the traditional God by the lady generous Nietzsche wrote quote God is dead what he meant was that enough intellectuals no longer believed that you couldn't have you couldn't assume that the church and belief in the church would help maintain order so instead you had the boys in blue the state stepped in right the centralized state in both its nasty varieties like the Communists and the Nazis and it's reasonable variety the state stepped in in the place of God and Egypt predicted that this would happen he said there's going to be Wars Beyond imagining as this as something comes to replace God and you know Carl Smith wrote a book called political theology people talked about how communism is The God That Failed and people have talked about American democracy as a Civic religion so all three of the major you know God replacement ideologies of the 20th century which were Democratic capitalism communism fascism all three of them had books that likened them to religions as replaced in religions right the state replace God God was replaced by gov okay and um so that's like the the 20th century and the state also crushed the network the network is like peer-to-peer interactions and so on what's interesting is I found this remark from um this guy named Jacob Burkhart okay and he actually called out the state the church and then what he called culture as the three forces and I saw this only after I'd written about God's Data Network and he identified those same forces like 170 years ago he didn't have the concept of the internet but you know what he called culture he said culture is like the set of all peer-to-peer interactions and by the way the reason I'm talking about this is to understand crypto tribalism it's like comparative religion having some unders it's sort of like you can use Solana but you're like actually understand Solana to actually understand ethereum to actually understand Bitcoin it helps have some knowledge of cryptography and distributed systems and Game Theory and networking like you can go deep in these areas right so the surface observation is just the wallet but the underlying technology is there and the surface observation is the tribalism but there's an underlying competitive religion aspect so here's this quote from Jacob Burkhart right he says our theme is the state religion and culture and their Mutual bearings we are fully aware of the arbitrariness of this division into three powers the division however is a mere device to enable us to cover the ground right the three powers are supremely heterogeneous to each other and cannot be coordinated the same religion the expressions of political and metaphysical need may claim Authority at least other particular peoples for our special purpose however culture is the sum of all that is spontaneously Arisen for the events of material life all social intercourse Technologies Arts literature it's a realm of the variable free not necessarily Universal of all that cannot lay claim to Compulsive Authority holy cow look like that is as close as you could get in 1850 to talking about consensual peer-to-peer Cooperative interactions over the Internet between people all over the world right what I call the network he was calling culture it's amazing right and he also identified the other two things that stayed in religion so right God State Network State religion culture right okay so that's like it's always cool when you can see somebody who's kind of come up with a similar view on the world from it totally told you know it's the 1850s Swiss guy way before obviously the internet point is that um once you think of like this God see network trilogy lots of things become apparent for you can now start classifying ideologies on the space it's almost like the the periodic table you know the elements you break things into elements and you're like oh carbon dioxide it's got one of this and two of these right carbon and monoxide one of this in one of these so let me do that right so first with God you have the atheist the monotheist and the polytheists atheist doesn't believe in God the monotheists like a Christian or a Muslim believes in one God the polytheists like a Hindu believes in multiple gods right okay now with the state the a statist is like an anarchist or an anarcho-capitalist they don't believe in the state the monostatist is like a Chinese communist or like uh America first or rules-based order person that could be both left and right varieties of it but they believe in one Empire to dominate the world okay and uh then the third is the poly status the policy is like the digital Nomad they're often grouped with the anarchist but they're not they do believe in the existing of a state they just want to be able to choose between Dubai and Switzerland and you know Monaco or whatever right they're not actually out there to tear it down they're like you know where can I get the best value for money the best you know civilization for my dollars worth the subscriber citizen okay and they're even though they're often equated they're very very different they're not about tearing it down like just like a Hindu is not an atheist they're even if they're both considered infidels by a very insistent monotheist right and then the third would be the network and you can have somebody who is a no coiner an acoiner who is against all coins right that's like the central Bankers the CBD seers uh that is uh you know Chinese Communist party and Elizabeth Warren's anti-crypto Army and uh and then those you know like Trump of fears goes like Oh the dollar must be the reserve currency there's left and right versions of this as well right so that's the no coiner eight coiner then you have the monocoiner that's a maximalist then you have the polycliner which is like the venture capitalist or the tech person you know switches between courts right and now you can start classifying ideologies for example the uh the American um establishment person is typically an atheist monostatist acorner right they don't believe in God they don't believe in a coin they do believe in one state okay the Bitcoin maximalist is an atheist sometimes a monotheist sometimes a Christian or what have you right but you know they're let's say tip that's not as important right it's like secondary atheist or monotheist usually in a statist uh because they're often very anarchistic in their leaning and they're an insistent monocoinist okay so they're like zero zero one and the American establishment is zero one zero okay whereas somebody like me I am like you know from a polytheist background at least uh polystatists and polyconist so I'm n n and n okay rather than zero one zero one zero so you see I come from a completely different philosophical tradition of choice on all three axes right and once you start laying it that way you're like oh that sounds simply just tribalism it's not like oh can't we all just get along that's like a fundamental difference in fundamental values right should there be choice on this axis should this axis not even exist or should there be no choice in you know like this and of course I can give an ethical justification of mine and in general usually the polytheist is okay with other guys worshiping their own God but not vice versa you know and the poly coiner is fine why don't you guys go and do your own coin why don't you let me do this and that's being something where it's like Mongoose and snake across history there's a logic to the monocoiner it's not a it's not a logic in the sense of um human to human logic but there's an evolutionary logic which is if you can have uh you know all of these Pagan groups that are worshiping all these different religions you can unify them under one God then you build a fighting force and you unify them right and in a sense Bitcoin is God's way of making Libertarians cooperate right all of these heavily armed you know Libertarians in the U.S who would otherwise be involved in countless different economic schemes whatever have now been slapped you know into becoming just devout Bitcoin maximalists under one coin right and uh you know you can make parallels through history of other examples of this but they've been snapped together into this fighting force right where they all know that it's taboo even the term shitcoiner like that has the sense of certainly uh heretic but it also has a sense of like obviously impurity right because right and then also actually weakness like you couldn't control yourself you gambler right you you you you couldn't hold the one true coin you went and you decided to go and day trade which at a minimum is shameful it shows you don't have self-control right and uh so so there's actually a lot of like the old school Old Testament religious Purity that has been kind of re-architected through this right and that's why I'm like while I'm not a maximalist I speak maximalist remember the thing about dialects yep right like I speak maximalist in the same that somebody might speak Vietnamese and Chinese and and Japanese you speak multiple languages you can speak in such a way that I understand their premises I totally understand where they're coming from uh I disagree with some of those premises but I think actually a lot of polycoiners don't understand where maximalism comes from at a deep level like the polycliners typically come from a higher trust environment in their in their headspace you know they are less likely to believe that the Western system is on its last legs you know and as such they don't need the same level of security guarantees in their code or they don't think they do and so they're more likely to cooperate and more likely to do crowdfunding of public goods and that's good I'm glad that that Community exists right um and you you know I'm glad that all the communities exist actually right because as squabbling as they are they're kind of going to be the mammals that inherit the earth after the meteor hit the spinosaurus in my view all right let me pause here that is uh that is very well put um I'm really going to steal some of those terminologies with that mental framework in mind actually I'll ask you this like how do you think about multichain obviously you've picked Solana so far over the other religions so to say or ideologies uh I guess one why and two what do you think the future looks like in this kind of inter ideology Battleground yeah look I think um I picked song because it works okay so that's just the simplest answer I have I think so if you you know uh let me reference some of balaji's writings here okay here uh he co-authored this thing about nakamotoko uh coefficient which sort of articulates what the decentralization network should be right so that's sort of on one end he also wrote a an article called um why uh the next you know open source open State and open execution is what the next version of databases are right it's basically this idea that um you can have where it's open source but anybody can read read from it um anybody can write to it for a fee and you can anybody can read it from it for free anybody can write to it for a fee right so this uh to me that that was the most interesting sort of um think about blockchains that they enable this composability where you don't have to like you can replace BD with just permissionless composability I think one of them is overrated and the other is underrated sorry biology uh I've said which is that the decentral or other communities emphasis on what decentralization should be and they obsess over the score and how you quantify decentralization and we've we've sort of built an entire industry of book products that just don't work because of this ideological over emphasis on decentralization which probably wasn't even the uh intention of that that um uh that paper while compromising what I think was the is the most underrated uh interesting part that Drew me to blockchains which is the fact that this is open State and open execution the fact that you can now coordinate with a group of other with a bunch of other people in your same group or groups that don't like each other can still coordinate in the same network is what I thought personally was most interesting to me and you know um if if it is true that decentralization means there's going to be an abundance of leadership not all those leaders are going to get along with each other that's sort of like the outcome of this right there the reason you have different leadership is because they all have views on the world that uh uh or they're all Forks they're all trying to build Forks of the future that don't necessarily align with each other and that's fine and at a network level you that you benefit from this sort of abundance of uh conflict I guess uh and or or you know the or abundance of leadership that leads to many many times abundance of conflict so I've just come to accept that it's a part of the thing um but so so I think the fact that it's composable the fact that you can go and work with applications that you didn't with teams you didn't that build applications on the same chain as you then you never have to talk to them to be able to compose with that is amazing like uxt for instance required a order book required you to be able to have some product that allows you to do go long and short on the same thing and you could build a stable coin on top of that right by taking a delta neutral position that would not have happened in in something in another chain in a meaningful way I think so that's one interesting part the other is sort of what I talked about earlier which I think biology referred to as well which is you know Andrew McCollum is okay great so Andrew McCullum designed the Facebook logo Naomi gleet was Facebook's longest serving employee why don't we know them well because they were all they were subsumed their identities were sort of subsumed by the larger company and uh they all got to be part of like the early days of Facebook and enjoy the fruits of the success and labor that they had built now I think that everybody can be allow me great and Andrew McCullough in the world if they find the thing that they uh can bring to life I think the only thing that's stopping you know like there's this meme that oh like we need more products to get to product Market fit I just think you can flip a regulatory switch and tomorrow you can distribute profits of collectives to its members and you'll have productive crypto projects just emerge out of nowhere right like because it's just a way of capital formation and this idea that you can come together as a group and and or like create create something and take value from it is why I am personally in it I just think that that's the it's a way for labor to own Capital with the least amount of friction and it's most interesting right now I think it's a dress rehearsal for when regulations change so everyone's like getting on the Internet like oh let's meme this like dog coin to 88 billion dollars at Peak value or whatever and that's how Deutsche Bank gets scared and so but but you could take the same thing and replace the door coin with something that's like hey let's go crowdfund the city or let's go build a um electricity or whatever the thing that it's set up for right or you could do you could that's a general purpose thing that you can replace it right now it's constrained by regulations but I think like regulations have um you know they they like um somebody I should not say all laws have the privilege of retiring right yeah and so uh once that happens I think that the it's going to be a camera and explosion of capital formation amongst groups that not necessarily have to be companies which today they have to be in the form of companies so that's why I'm excited and I think that um some of them are a cohort of them may go on to have Ambitions bigger than achieving just their mission and go on to be cities and maybe even countries and that's like to me the most ambitious version of this why which is why I'm super interested in Network State movement emerges and working with Biology to the extent I can to um you know sort of uh see where I can contribute that is a hot take on um uh pmf is being held back by regulation I mean well you can use all the infrastructure we have today you don't have to build another product you can change one law or like well this is in the US maybe there are countries by the way where these laws are already changing we're not looking to the US for direction on what the SEC does they're already making it easy to launch security tokens or pass on profits of the collective to the individual members that's already happening right so I think it's just a matter of we can get to a spot where that that just becomes the norm and people start to bootstrap new Ventures that don't necessarily look like companies but there may be a collection of just smart contracts I just addressed two things we said actually there basically uh so you know when something just works it's good that it just works and I completely understand why it attracts people to an ecosystem when it just works but when something like Singapore or apple or or you know a blockchain just works it's because usually there's an underlying ideology and a lot of work that went into I mean obviously right so it isn't uh something that is easy is hard to build right easy to use is hard to build and you know vice versa typically right it's easy to build something that's hard to use right um the other point you made on decentralization I agree there's a lot of decentralization theater where people just talk about it without actually measuring it which is why I kind of put out that article on quantifying decentralized decentralization away back but another way of talking about it is in terms of who has right who is CEO who has sovereignty is very important right um and the difference you know why Linux rather than Windows because Linux is decentralized or more so than Windows and that's why you use it because uh you can get a very operational definition if I use Windows on the server in the early 2000s then Google can never be a success because Microsoft could just increase the price of Windows and stolen all their revenue off the back end because it would just increase the Enterprise licenses Oracle did the same thing where just keeps charging more and more for its database right versus postgres you can't do the same thing it's decentralized anybody can use it right so um control sovereignty root that's really important and what they're really saying when people talk about decentralization is who has control over me and I want that to be a very limited list of people or people who I consent to and so on and so forth you can take it too far and you can basically be like these guys who are anarchists you know and they think they don't want anybody to have control over them but if you like the thing is uh you know Steve Jobs wrote about um how you know he's not growing his food he's not cleaning his water he's not building the pipes to his room and he depends we're we're like a social organism just like an ant colon you do depend upon other people until we have like Ai and Robotics to such an extent where you don't need that so in depending on other people there has to be some social contract there must be some sense in which you are submitting to the collective and giving up something to get something so total anarchistic decentralization doesn't really make sense as an end point but relative to the degree of centralization let's say the us or China or other countries might be trying to implement I can understand why people want it of course the way that they want it they want it in a verbal and articulate way and the last thing I'll just say on that is often the benefit of decentralization is it's like an insurance policy or a parachute or a Lifeboat and you see it only in the breach you know right so for example Venezuela you know if you had used just Venezuelan the Venezuelan National currency for years you'd have been fine you trusted the government you'd mean fine and then you wouldn't have been able to exit right so your daily transaction cost would have been low but your exit cost should have been very high because currency gets inflated away and you have nothing with with shakes conversely if you didn't trust the Venezuelan government anymore and you just held it borrow gold at your home your transaction cost is very very high you chip off a flick gold at Starbucks that doesn't really work but your exit cost is relatively low because you can take the gold with you and leave and so the answer is some portfolio strategy of some things within the system and some partial trust and some outside the system and uh then you can operate within the system but your exit cost is an infinite because you have some outside the system quick question on when you're talking about decentralization there and I've seen you write about this do you think crypto is going to push centralized companies to reposition to more open systems and and like with that do you think there's a polarity almost a smiling curve where it's the most centralized companies and then you have decentralized protocols over here and there's really not maybe a ton of value in the middle but it's going to be on the Polar ends how do you think about that I'm not sure if it's a it's a u-shape exactly I don't know know what shape it takes but certainly Facebook like Zuck I give a lot of credit because he will try something he'll fail he'll dust himself off he'll try again and so on and even after Libra or what have you he is the new threads is talking about doing um you know integration with uh with Mastodon and so on right it is going to be um a potentially more decentralized protocol we'll see one thing however that makes that very possible is he just open sourced llama too that's a huge deal if you guys follow you know that in AI uh that's that's massive basically an open source AI model um change the entire landscape and it's counter positioning versus um Google and and chat GPT and and others right uh so so you know open sourcing something can be and that's kind of what this is the next step in open sourcing Right decentralizing comes after open sourcing so if we think about how open sourcing was used by companies it was used strategically sometimes they open source this thing uh this piece because it was like um your stripe and you open source the python drivers because there's no point in keeping them closed sometimes like IBM back Linux as a way to weaken Microsoft early on okay so you commoditize your complement that say you try to commodize operating system take the value of the operating system by by making it open source sometimes you take something that was open source you make it closed kind of like what Apple did they took BSD and they added all of the stuff on top of it you know they got OS X OS X runs on top of BSD right so the the part of it that's open they comply with all the license stuff and they still distribute that but basically the reason that I use apple and the reason that the Mac laptop plus Linux server has become the canonical kind of thing for the last 20 years is because it's basically Unix on the client and Unix on the server which is unexceptional today but was really useful in the 2000s when that was first new so the point being sometimes you open source pieces sometimes you open source is a strategy to attack competitor sometimes you take something open source and you add closed Source functionality on top of it and sometimes you're just ideologically open source like GitHub which open source almost everything for a long time and I think you're going to see the same diversity of approaches where just substitute decentralization there coinbase doing its base API which is not an app chain but an API chain it's a good version of this if you had one piece of advice for aspiring Network State Founders crypto Founders startup Founders um what would it be both of you readthenetworkshade.com uh no I mean like mine would become today to have said conference yeah it's also good yes that's right you see that reason is that in Co Inc that has 500 pages of stuff in it so you know uh it's a B1 but I think it's useful aside from that um learn all the AI content creation stuff get good at that get good at either content creation or uh or coding in math um or maybe you know just operational execution one of those three things get good at something that's useful at a tech company because if you don't then you may not have a useful skill um we'll see hey maybe I'm wrong about that actually you know there's a lot of physical uh tasks that are also actually very helpful now you know obviously plumbing and and things like that those are actually rising in price um so we'll see what happens but but I think that if you are in Tech interested in Tech getting getting into the latest tools will will certainly help you out I mean AI content creation is going to be underpriced for a long time because it's a whole effort to go and explore these 50 different tools and most people aren't using them well and the existing establishment like Hollywood's own strike and so on on this um it's sort of like the thing about speaking multiple dialects if you can be on top of multiple Tech trends at the same time I know it's a full-time job just to see on top of crypto but if you can see on top of that and you can see on top of AI to some extent there's other stuff that's coming down the pike like transhumanism and obviously drones have become a bigger and bigger thing quietly um it's good to have like some peripheral vision on all those things and then maybe pick one of them to focus on so I mean it's maybe maybe that's very generic but read the networksave.com that's very specific I have something very specific actually I think uh you know in 2012 when social media came around people were like uh hiring marketing teams or hiring social media managers hoping to win whatever hack comes out of this new medium of distribution but actually the people who won were social media Founders not social media managers attached to big companies they were the influencers companies like Warby Parker away luggage all these people who realized holy this is a new distribution medium and they went all in on it at the exclusion of the other Legacy stuff I think the exact same thing is happening now with communities where people are trying to hire they're like oh Community is important let's hire a community manager except the folks who I think will win our community Founders who will Who do what looks like the job that is above their pay grade or whatever uh and I think of myself as a community founder you know like we internally we discuss whether it's with cash it's super DM or with other communities that I work with as Community Founders and uh I think if anybody has a shot at building valuable communities is that some of which may go on to become Network cities and network States it will be found or uh if it will be people who want to become Founders so I know some of them may be listening to this podcast and they have like a right brain uh heavy sort of skill set and if they do and they want to become Founders they should know that there is Venture scale opportunity available here because um for once you know in 2000 uh I think like Paul Graham wrote an essay in 28 2005 saying hackers and Painters and the only Artisans left in the world are engineers and all the Silicon Valley companies for the next 20 years are effectively built around the founding Engineers uh so maybe this time it'll these communities will be building will be built uh around founding influencers and if that is true then some of them have the opportunity to grow way bigger than companies ever did because the most ambitious version of that is the network state so uh you know if you're listening and have uh and are and run an nft Community or our community manager who thinks they know how to run Community but aren't really given that much responsibility you might have an opportunity here that's way bigger than um what you think is possible so yeah just read the book come out and hopefully apply for funding there's a lot of pools of capital to fund you all right everybody well I'll put all the links to the show notes everything we talked about Akshay Balaji thank you so much for coming on today that was amazing conversation yeah thank you so much thanks guys thanks for having us cheers [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] bye
