My Philosophy has always been that you as someone who grew up on the internet you as a user of the internet sort of no longer have a choice about whether or not you want to be on the internet like if you go on a date someone's gonna look you up before on Instagram and if you're not on Instagram that's going to be weird like you kind of just you need to be on these platforms you need to be on LinkedIn as cringe as it is if you want to have like a Trad job like all of these things feel very true and so I think if we don't have the ability to exit these systems we should at least have a voice in them if we need to if we want to get people to the point where they can actually have a voice and this becomes effective you need to use mechanisms that get people interested and engaged in digital spaces and the way that we know you can get people interested and engage in digital spaces is by making them addictive so I think there's like definitely uh again a dark pattern here that you want to be careful about but I think we need to start using some of these like horror questionable practices on the internet actually I think that we should explore what it might look like to ethically use some patterns that I think we've stayed very far away from as a matter of principle [Music] what's up everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we are joined by David Phelps and Chase Chapman David is the founder of Joker race and Chase is the host of a podcast called on the other side it's actually in the blockworks network and also contributor at Metropolis Dave and Chase welcome to the show thanks chaos [Laughter] if you guys heard the the beginning um before we hit record you would um be very excited about this conversation this one's gonna be a bit different than usual but I actually think it's not only going to be fun but it's gonna be super insightful Chase I'm gonna actually copy you on a question that I've heard you ask a lot of your guests and and you say what are assumptions that you're questioning or like should the crypto community be questioning um and I think a really good place to start would be in governance because you both have some really uh fun and insightful ideas on this so um maybe Chase let's start with you what is something that crypto gets wrong about governance yeah I mean I think starting out we we think about governance as this like design space that people give a about and I just think that's not really true for the most part um I think if we want to have like this user-owned and user-controlled internet that that seems to be sort of like the guide post for where we're going um I think we need to be thinking about governance a lot more as a feature than as a product itself I feel like last um bull market we we did a lot of building around governances like this thing that people are going to want to do and I think we need to move towards governance as this feature of consumer applications where it's kind of built into these experiences it's maybe native to Consumer um sort of like flows and interfaces and so I've been thinking a lot about that and how to make governance more fun which I know David has also been thinking about and building around for for joke race and and in general I know something you've been thinking about David yeah I mean it's interesting because it's like you say the word governance and everyone you know just like shoot themselves unless unless you're like a hacker or like an arbitrator and you're like governance is amazing because it's like I can go in and rug a treasury like covenants is this awesome thing for me um but unless unless you're that guy um like yeah I mean governance governance sucks uh and that's why we don't even use the term governance we use the term contests and I think like when you switch it to the word contest you realize like okay wait everything is contests right your your book you know things a contest your election for President is a contest but like even even every social media platform is a contest like when you're going on Twitter you're putting a proposal to the world and saying what do you think of this and then a bunch of people upvote it with this feature called like right and then if they uploaded enough then it gets more popularity to be seen by more people and so you are in a contest where you're competing against everyone else's content in order to gain visibility and that is the game that you're playing is like like you're in this constant contest to try to get votes by saying I have a proposal give me votes right and so it's like once you get into that that mindset of like oh wait Twitter is governance right like that's working you know okay maybe that's not working well it's working pretty shittily but like you know it works it works effectively like it at least as an addiction to get people like excited and and participating in this and then it's like okay there's a lot we have to learn from social media about how to build contests right and it's like it's an interesting thing because it's like I mean what is a blockchain a blockchain is a contest it is like a bunch of transactions all competing to get inclusion in a block right uh that is a contest too and so it's like you know all the way down you just see contest contests everywhere it's how our society functions is like we love to think about the contest between presidents and that fight as well and it's like you know and and then you get to the down space and it's like there's no way to submit you don't get out of your voice heard right um you only get to vote uh you usually vote negatively against things that makes you look bad right as well uh and then you know you're voting on boring decisions that you're not actually in any position to have an opinion on and then people are telling you we need more participation because we need more uninformed people making really boring decisions that are going to count against them in terms of their like reputation and it's like what the hell are you guys thinking this is a terrible system don't do this that's it so it seems like uh you guys definitely have some hot takes on this I am curious if you think anybody has gotten it right so far or even close to right oh that's interesting I mean I to me like the things that that come to mind as people who have gotten it right are mostly projects who have built either uh governance into applications and not even call the governance like I think uh in a way there are certainly things about friend Tech which I'm sure we'll get into that are like mechanisms that have been built natively into the application that I don't know that I would call it governance but they're like these these building blocks that um are done in a very subtle way I think the other application that comes to mind is FWB where they have like the FWB app and they they build in like a governance page on the app basically where you can look at all the proposals that are happening so I think one of the things for me is definitely um the the mechanic where you actually have these things built natively into applications as opposed to like thinking explicitly about governance um as this like thing that people need to go do uh well I would I mean you know my immediate temptation is to Shell some of the use cases that people have done on joke Ray so like Wi-Fi putting up 400 and being like give us a few tell us a future you want us to build and I think that's governance a bunch of people submitting options all prioritizing them voting on them seeing what their favorites are campaigning for it publicly performing actions to get allowed listed building on trade reputation you know marketing it Etc uh rehash also comes to mind there like just an amazing podcast that is like built on users deciding what you know speakers they want and then getting power when they win uh onward but but I I think the ultra the ultra great use case of this was the mirror right race two years ago um and the mirror right race if anyone remembers it uh was like this weekly recurring contest where um people would all buy to try to get a right token uh which would allow them to have a publication on on mirror and the really cool thing about this mechanism was if you won you not only got a right token but you got to become a voter as well and so you've got the status position as well and so what's really cool about the right race is it's actually an election in Disguise that's never marketed as an election it's marketed as a contest to win a publication but what you're doing is you're electing this Council that expands over time of legitimate users deciding who else is legitimate and who else they bring in and so it is this Progressive decentralization right where it includes more and more people over time and I will you know without giving too much away I will just say there's some really cool use cases coming up on Joe craze with some big protocols that are really looking towards that model um because it's a really effective one of like almost a status game of getting everyone excited to like have the publication the status and the votes but then this really cool Final thing that happens when you do that is everyone goes to social media right everyone campaigns every week to be like vote for me plea they're tagging each other and so you get tons of traction because it's recurring case at a set time and place you can adjust it if anything goes wrong but you're also building the status game over time and so I think the mirror right race is still like one of those like really cool phenomena that was really successful and I think we just still have a lot to learn from frankly I feel like the other call out on that in terms of almost all of those examples is like when things get interesting is when you move Beyond governance for governance sake and you get to the point where you're actually providing value to the people who are participating in governance in some way you're either making it really easy for them or you're providing some value optimally you're doing a combination of those things but I think the the big like Delta between what we've seen and and where we're going is really that function of like how can we make this interesting and fun as a game first and governance is just sort of the mechanism to do it rather than being like we need to govern this protocol and decentralize it like that is never going to end up in something that is interesting or really all that successful I agree with like 99 of that but but the one place with push back is like I don't think we should make it easier for people like I don't think it makes any sense to make it easier for people for a couple reasons and one is like if you're doing big decisions about like how do we diversify this treasury you do not just want any Rando participating you want a hybrid entry of people have thought about this consider that that really like poured their time and energy into understanding the implications of like the decision that they're making right but the other one is just like you know in terms of a game nobody wants to play an easy game like it is not fun to play a really easy game that is easy to win you want to play a hard game that is challenging that like raises your heart rate and it is like gives you anxiety that you don't know if you're gonna win or not like that is what a fun game is and so like raising you know it's always a challenge if you look at board games like how hard do they make it because the harder you make it the you know you get less of an audience but you get a much more passionate audience this is true across the Arts right the more experimental you get the harder it is for people to participate but the more passionate the people are who actually do it right and so there is a balance I think you know in terms of like where you want to go do you want to have Candy Land or do you want to have like a Twilight Struggle you know like a 12-hour like you know a World War II game like you know there's different types of games that people can create but I think having a challenge generally and making it hard and like you know that that is what is fun people people are not dude people all we all think we want complacency and none of us actually do we're all bored by it like we want challenges so this is where I think we get into an interesting Dynamic though which is that my gut feeling is that we're going to have two types of governance emerge one is passive and one is active where passive is to your point like Twitter the like right like Tick Tock has their own governance of your personalized feed I think that is a version that needs to be easy and optimally people don't even realize that they're actually governing something when I think about like a user-owned internet and what that might be able to look like I do think there's an opportunity to have like governance on the back end but these like interesting um very subtle Dynamics on the front end that are just kind of like gauging user sentiment and stuff like that I think on the flip side you have this more active type of governance which is what you're talking about um which is definitely like yeah you don't want to make it easy particularly if they're types of decisions that are like consequential and and have real impact and I think for something like that you you don't want to you know decide how you allocated treasury based on the number of bookmarks on a tick tock like that that seems dumb that David on that can you explain really quick what Joe Grace is because I think it plays into this whole conversation probably probably should have done that before I started you know talking about use cases yeah it's it's a unchain uh contest platform and so you uh deploy a contest anyone can deploy a contest on our site uh to any uh evm chain and the way it works is you put a prompt out to a community people can submit responses people can vote on their uh favorite responses and then if you want you can add a rewards pool as well uh to fund the winners uh as well and so what's cool is like we're token list which means you can actually decide you can create a lot list for who gets to submit and who gets to vote and so you can imagine right if you did like the traditional governance where you know that we've always done uh where it's like a core team just puts a proposal to a community lesson but then you have like a very small team putting the submission out and then a whole wider Community voting on it but you can imagine you can also do the reverse like a hackathon you have a bunch of people submitting and then just a small jury votes right and so we give you like total modularity to be able just to design this however you want so that you can run hackathons grants you know giveaways like prediction games bounties rfps like Etc whatever really any any sort of on-chain decision you want to make as a community uh developer that we're working with to do a bunch of on-chain hackathons um and so right you would actually have all the contributors dropping their project and there are jury votes on them and um you can imagine like you know even if you lose the hackathon you're getting this on chain attestation in the form of a vote right and so like where a lot of this gets really exciting is like the online reputation piece like you can imagine I never win a contest but I participated in so many that I've actually gotten more votes than anyone else has combined and like down the line when people are deciding they want to do air drops or they want to you know give access to builders or they just want to dig into data about who their users are like that on-chain reputation that you've built is really really valuable to you uh even if you didn't win that specific contest right so so so stuff like that those are those are good cases live Bureau I think is doing like a logo contest right now to design their logo that you can participate in coindesk is doing one right now to decide who the most influential people are of 2023. so submit to that one like yeah go shell that's a that's a great chilling opportunity okay so joke Grace is about making everything a contest you're talking about like one of the secrets to governance is to make it fun uh to make it where like people want to play the game and chase you mentioned friendtech um just a little bit ago and print Tech it's an app that's on base coinbase is Layer Two and bass had over 136 000 users last week because of friend Tech it's essentially like social media Network where you can trade shares based on like popular Twitter figures uh Chase how does friendtech play into this um this making governance fund or implicit in the app itself yeah I mean I think they're definitely playing with dynamics that are a lot more like on-chain assets than it is governance itself and the way that they designed it definitely makes it hard to build in governance um in like this interoperable way because of the the smart contracts but I think what frontec to me represents is a lot more of a broader Strokes um kind of attempt at making crypto in general fun and interesting um I think something that became very clear to me after playing around with it and seeing the the reaction on crypto Twitter is essentially that like and this sounds shitty but I do think it's kind of true we're not building like addictive enough applications if governance becomes addictive we win basically and and I think you know there's a lot of nuance there in terms of whether or not that's actually what's good for people and all that stuff but um applications are addictive anyway like consumer Tech is basically how addicted can you get your users and so we might as well give them power and and make those things addictive in the sense that at least you're governing a platform or or a you know dynamic or whatever it is that you're governing at least you have power and so to me that is is much more of what front Tech represents um Above All Else the problem with governance is we're not making people addicted to power and yeah it's like if there's one thing that it should be so easy to get humans addicted to it is power like the whole history of the world tells us you should be able to get people easily addicted to power and the fact that we haven't even managed to do that I mean that just speaks to like all of crypto's feelings today basically and I mean like to add some Nuance to it as well my philosophy has always been that you as someone who grew up on the internet you as a user of the internet sort of no longer or I guess even as a you know person who exists in the world sort of no longer have a choice about whether or not you want to be on the internet like if you go on a date someone's gonna look you up before on Instagram and if you're not on Instagram that's going to be weird like you kind of just you need to be on these platforms you need to be on LinkedIn as cringe as it is if you want to have like a Trad job like all of these things feel very true and so I think if we don't have the ability to exit these systems we should at least have a voice in them if we need to if we want to get people to the point where they can actually have a voice and this becomes effective you need to use mechanisms that get people interested and engaged in digital spaces and the way that we know you can get people interested in engaging digital spaces is by making them addictive so I think there's like definitely uh again a dark pattern here that you want to be careful about but I think we need to start using some of these like more questionable practices on the internet actually I think that we should be sure what it might look like to ethically use some patterns that I think we've stayed very far away from as a matter of principle um what would be an example like I think uh what would it look like I mean I think frontec is actually a great example which is like you're you're buying shares in your friends on the surface kind of up like really that's something that like shouldn't feel awesome but it's super fun and I've gone back to the app way more than I'd like to admit because it's interesting and I want to check and there's something fun to that like Dynamic I think we have not done a great job of experimenting with what those use cases outside of speculation might be and I'm not saying that frontec is going to save the world nor is it really like movement towards a user owned internet but I think that we need to be more willing to experiment with that stuff um and yeah I guess that kind of makes me a villain right now of being like we need to do all the dark things but I do kind of think that we need to be more open to playing around with like existing patterns on the internet that we know work to get users engaged and excited about apps chase a um I think you're getting something really interesting here which is like soft power in the 21st century is getting people addicted to you like say whatever you want about Elon this is something Elon understands really well like if you get people addicted to you and you have power right and like that's how social media works it's like and so there's this interesting question which is like what happens when you have communities and collectives because there's no longer that individual figure for people to get addicted to and like what friend Tech does well is like it brings back the individual figure uh as a character right and it's like you can oppose this on a lot of ethical lines and be like oh no we don't need to go back to great man history of like single people who like reign supreme and like have relative value over each other that we've actually Quantified and like that's super gross like we need to have like a collective movement but um I do think there's something like in the fact that like even Collective movements to succeed need to have characters and figures and like relatable um like like voices that people get really into um and are excited by and and you look you know that happened like we saw that happen with Bernie we saw that happen with Trump in some ways but it's like all the all the collective movements that we've had in crypto have not I don't think have have done that job of narrative and storytelling and voice and character that um actually gets people really excited and so friendtech is like kind of a shortcut to that which is like quantify your friends it's hot or not with money right it's just like you're just ranking your friends except this time with dollar signs uh you know in front of the number yeah and I mean like I guess the other thing to call out here is one of the reasons that I feel comfortable with us experimenting more with these like ethically gray area type of things is because if you build your contracts correctly and you actually are using web3 rails in a way that is ethical like you can build addictive front ends with back ends that support um user ownership and user empowerment and all those kinds of things so I think like the problem that you run into with web web 2 is when you build really addictive applications that exploit users I think that's the big difference here in my mind um in this ecosystem which is basically like how can you build a addictive experiences that Empower users in some ways as opposed to like exploiting them directly or bring them closer to a collective um and and help them explore Collective identity in a way that's really interesting and lightly addictive Chase I want to join you in your villain era I can't review you know alone thank you um you know something I think a lot about with games when you talk about gamification is like good games are safe spaces for chaos and violence um and so like when you play a game that's really enjoyable you want to kill your friends you want to destroy them you want them uh you want to beat them right like often in like you know depending on the video game it could be like a really violent way too right and it's like these are these are like you know safe spaces for us to enact a lot of our own our ID in some ways and it's like the irony of all this is like that action is what brings us together as long as it's within a safe space where we know it's a game and we know there's a framework for it at the end of that game we're closer to each other like we have bonded with each other through that act right and so I think it's like there's there's a lot to be said where it's like can we Embrace these kind of like ID like chaotic behaviors in a safe space that overall then actually brings us together and creates more of a collective Unity right um the way that like a good board game will do uh and I think it's like we are instead trying to live where the games we play are following our own ideals of collective you know like um joint support and it's not really that fun it's more fun when you're competing it's more fun when there's a challenge it's more fun when you want to beat your friends that you're standing up against each other right and so it's like I think I think there is a lot to be said for creating those kinds of Dynamics it gets a little scary to me when you're bringing money like once you're financializing that that's that's maybe an element that I'm not just so sure personally that's a safe space anymore but yeah um I'm otherwise Happy to happy to go full villain with you cheers yeah I think the money thing is a very good call out I mean like the the that is the the interesting thing about money in general which your piece uh that you that you published a while ago I think demonstrates really well which is that like money makes everything become real for people and so it no longer you know we can go and play Catan and that's all fine until the resources that I gather in Catan could be taken to coinbase and traded for real money and I can go buy my own house and that certainly changes the Dynamics which is why I think also like one of the most important things that we can be doing in terms of governance in consumer crypto is trying to experiment with what does it look like to not just play speculation games and can we use this technology for Consumer apps that are not solely based on the financialization of your friends which is definitely a big question mark I'm actually collateralizing my sheep and uh right now and using that to buy a bunch of friends so it's perfect I don't know what you're talking about incredible [Music] everyone we'll get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we've got a permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech roll ups account abstraction Mev app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blindspeed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show so um I mean you guys just kind of pointed out a bunch of things that we should be doing that we could be doing that you think might make more sense I guess I'm curious in an industry where I don't know I don't want to say the rules are blurry but I mean they are blurry um why haven't we gotten this right like what why what is the is it the hyper financialization aspect that slowed us down like it seems like it would be an obvious fit but it hasn't worked so far why not do building consumer apps in crypto is hard man it's like it it's it's really challenging like you know you are it's like a short long game it's like long-term on-chain reputation on-chain data totally beats any sort of web shoot Silo system like your ability to have an interoperable identity that when you access and rewards and opportunities and that you can control and attest to like that is a game changer for advertising that's a game changer for users monetizing that's a game changer for like job opportunities like you know it wins but the problem is there's still so much less data in web3 um especially because all the data to date has basically been financial and there's been no social data developed um compared to even just apis you can pull from web 2 platforms and so like that that transition is really hard and it's really hard to make that long-term case for data when web 2 Data is currently better than web3 data and and so I think like without that you know then you're stuck with well of the U sucks like you have to have these like terrible wallets you have to pay gas fees for everything um you have to like connect to a chain right uh and you have all these challenges um just on the ux side and the other thing is like until the past year it wasn't financially doable like you couldn't you couldn't pay to do any of this stuff you know like even now like on joke race if you set up a contest at mainnet ethereum which we let you do uh it's 200 to deploy it it's like forty dollars to submit right versus like on the Roll-Ups it's like two cents to submit you know and so it's like even now when we say oh there's gas people are like oh I don't know if anyone's gonna be able to afford that and it's like well no it's two cents it's not twenty dollars you know things have changed um but it's still a totally new paradigm to actually you know work within a system that is Affordable um never mind easy to use I'm curious to see what you think as well because you have a you have a tweet out there I thought was funny and you said that crypto conferences have better product Market fit than any crypto product out there um and you said one of the reasons which I tend to agree with and you said one of the reasons for that is also because our focus on like pure decentralization do do you really think that's what's holding us back or or what is it I I think a lot of this is kind of like a combination of two things one is a death by a Thousand Cuts which is what David I think is getting at in a lot of ways where it's like it's expensive onboarding people onto a wallet is a pain in the ass you need to decide if you want a custody their keys or if you want your users to custody their keys like there are all of these questions that I think um up until recently have been just huge pains in the ass I think we're finally getting to a point where um and and again I think front Tech is an interesting example of this just because it's a it's a recent thing where it's like it's not an application so it doesn't have to go through Apple um it's using bass so the fees are really low like all of these specific things I think enable this potentially like I'm not gonna say Cambrian explosion of consumer applications but I do think that we're going to see a lot more I think what that unlocks which is the other piece that I think we've been missing is the ability to just experiment and see what works like in the in the traditional consumer Tech world the whole name of the game is Just throwing at the wall and seeing what works and seeing how users engage with it that's really hard to do when you're dealing with all of these these random things that are just like going to cause friction including things like gas but also onboarding onto a wallet and so my hope is that as we start to to fix those like holes in the boat we could basically start to actually do a bunch of experiments and just see what works and the other thing I'll call out is like up until now it never made sense for users to spend a bunch of time or money setting up a wallet or paying gas unless they had a significant confidence in the ROI on that time and money meaning that speculative games have always been the thing that made sense to to invest user time and money into and so my hope is that the other side of this is not just experimenting on the project side with like applications but also that as as we reduce the the barriers to entry there we start to see new types of use cases that are not only centered around speculation it's one other thing that you know pointed towards making here too is technology comes in way you know waves right and you look at what are the major apps that have been developed in the past 10 years it's really Tick-Tock and maybe chat GPT and that's it like every major app that we know that's out there was basically built like over 10 years ago and and so I actually think that's a reason to be optimistic that there's going to be a whole new wave of kind of crypto apps that are enabled like I think this stuff comes in cycles and I I'm working on a piece right now on chat GPT and why I think it's kind of a game changer for what apps look like as well including the fact that it's web-based um as are you know the big apps that have now launched on crypto beam and friendtech as well and so I do think we're like we're looking at Paradigm shifts right now that are going to be huge I think we're at the very beginning of a new wave just of apps generally um as as technology is Shifting but yeah consumer preferences are pretty entrenched and it's like you know you you have be real and Clubhouse come along every two years and people get excited for four months and then they turn out to be novelty right like like the ability of anyone to develop a compelling app has been really really Limited in the past 10 years yeah it sounds like identity would be a big part of this um because you're talking about we wanna you had like this the next full cycle you have like three things that need to happen one of them is that you well maybe not the next Bull cycle but like a huge bull cycles they actually have more data on chain like you're talking about pre-advertisers um and chase you had something interesting when you were talking about wallets or not payment apps but they're identity apps um yeah how do you guys think about on-chain identity do you think that's something that needs to be decentralized do you think it's fine if like coinbase comes out with something and how that can enable new products like this identity really is that something that's holding us back I I mean I think it's it's a crucial unlock like you know let's take a contest like let's say you do a contest that's like what was your favorite you know song you listened to this week and Community comes together and they all of it and what their favorite song was that they listened to this week right you have some sort of AI bot you could actually like figure out what users preferences are overall mapped to their wallet address that then enables all sorts of Target targeting right Etc maybe give them you know new offers and opportunities but like forget that like say you know you're using data that has no idea what the actual content of this contest was you can still look and see okay people tend to vote on the same things over and over every week right and so now you have a social graph that these people's tastes are very aligned maybe they should know each other maybe they should date each other you know like that basis for like a social app is just so powerful once you have those kinds of tastes exposed you have the fact that it's like whatever's getting voted on this person wins every week they have really popular taste they really understand the Zeitgeist like they are popular within this community and like what they say is very important to listen to right you have that data because every vote is an attestation you have the whole transaction histories you take those two people that voted on the same thing over and over you know each week it's like you can dig into one of their profiles see all the nfts they hold now you know a lot about them that might also indicate the preferences of the other user as well and so then the challenge becomes okay well how do we put this on the user's side like how do does the user have right to protect this data monetize it sell it you know expose it when they want to and that's where you really get into probably ZK Tech stuff but like it's really exciting to think about all the social graphs that come out of just like one contest right and so that's all identity and it's like you know never mind the fact that oh yeah this this user you know we did this marketing campaign of what feature you know you want us to build and this person keeps winning every month it's like maybe we should hire them they're really good like they have great ideas maybe someone else should hire them maybe someone else should do an airdrop to them because they're a valuable Builder like developing this kind of like qualitative information about how the value you provide to communities is a total unlock from the very rote identity you know data analytics that we've had so far which has just been how much liquidity have you provided that's the only information we've had like all we've been able to determine an identity to date is are you rich or not because we've only had Financial use cases and so like it's just this incredible flywheel that the more social data you generate the more you can then feed that back in right be like okay now let's develop our next contest giving extra power allow list to those people who have provided a lot of value to and you can start to create these like really incredible flywheels where you know you develop power over time in these status games in these Financial games just in these social games right uh too and so it's it's really it's just trying to get that flywheel to unlock and once it does I think that's that's where we're going to see like the whole kind of ecosystem shift and I do feel like as much as I I'm really skeptical I have a lot of issues with friend Tech like it does feel like it's the beginning of something new there what are some of those issues that you're skeptical of uh financializing your friends yeah yeah just just the dark patterns yeah yeah I think I think again like our idea that there's a universal metric first of all it's not a relative local metric but a universal metric for reputation and value is really dangerous and then for that to be a financial value is pretty dark and it's just popular you know it's just popularity uh is what it comes down to and so yeah like I really believe value needs to be local and relative like my value to my closest friends is very different from my value to my enemies right um and or to the people who don't know who I am and it's like web 2 has just trained us over and over again to think that the more followers you have the more people you know the more bigger your numbers are the more popular you are and that's actually not true you look at the most popular people on Twitter they're not the ones with a hundred thousand followers they're the ones with 5 000 followers where all five thousand of them think that person is a God right it's like look at like serum from eigenlayer or something it doesn't have like hundreds of thousands of followers but everyone who follows through um like knows how valuable that guy is right it's like playing these quantity games of just like and then reducing that to money is just so I don't know I think it's just so simple-minded like um in in as a system of describing value and yeah I think it's a little dark too I think in general that also gets it like this idea of yeah having a a single metric for your identity or value or whatever is is certainly problematic and I think the idea that this points towards a more localized and contextualized identity and maybe even set of social um spaces makes a ton of sense I think to me the thing that I've been thinking about in the identity space is the whole thread situation where Instagram launched Facebook launched threads they also own Instagram and um so you your initial social network on threads was seated basically through Instagram the thing that that taught me was that I do not want the people who I follow and who follow me on Instagram to engage with me in a text-based app that looks like Twitter um and so I think like those your point David and that experience both Point towards this idea that identity needs to be contextual um and that like who I am on this podcast is not who I am and I'm joking with David about you know whatever and like that matters and so there's a lot more dick jokes going on when David and I are one on one of them and so like I think that type of thing really really matters in the context of how we design these systems because composability and interoperability of identity across different platforms is kind of a double-edged sword in that way I don't think that we have fully had experiences yet where we that that comes to like fruition um because we haven't had as many consumer apps take off and so much of these things has already been financialized so it's like the financial lens is the way that we primarily see users in crypto today and most applications have supported that thus far once we get into these use cases that are not so Financial I think that's where things start to become really strange and people will start to feel a lot more uncomfortable with the fact that their entire Financial history is also associated with these like much more intimate parts of their their digital lives and so um I think on the identity side I don't know what that will end up looking like I totally agree with you David in terms of of where you see things going with zero knowledge proofs and and all that stuff but yeah I think contextualizing identity and the ability for users to control what is shared in what contexts and in what applications and with who is something that people say all the time but that I think from a like purely human-centric perspective also feels like it matters a lot moving forward one interesting while we're on the topic of identity one interesting thing that crypto enables is kind of identity over owning a certain coin right um so maybe you are a Bitcoin maximalist ethereum Solana Cosmos whatever it might be um which which seems to be different um from kind of other Industries how do you guys think about kind of the tribalism between these different identities between the different blockchains or or what do you think we've gotten wrong there like how should we you know um improve our improve upon our tribalism and stop stop like on each other all the time wait can I can I ask your your take on it um my take on it is that I think each chain kind of has like different values that emanate from its history and Technical choices so like Bitcoin obviously you have Satoshi and the store of value um kind of meme on ethereum you kind of have credible neutrality um ultrasound money now and kind of scaling via we have Roll-Ups which um and being ethereum aligned as well um and then on Solana maybe you have something that's a bit more uh like we we share about products in ux and and speed um I don't think any of I think probably what everybody kind of Misses is like those things obviously have some overlap but they're fundamentally different goals to shoot for um like some of these things even if they're possible on all three chains just make much more sense on one of those chains but like I don't want to hold um high value nfts on something that's not ethereum personally I'm I'm just gonna prefer that better because I think it's a better settlement layer um on the other hand if I want fast execution sensitive resistance and like information uh propagation let's say which you know it's a very Niche thing but let's say I'm a Trader and I want that then I'm probably going to use Solano um and I think the problem arises when people try to um when the financialization aspect kind of occurs because they think that if chain X gets more stuff built on their chain then maybe the price of my coin will go down and that's where my identity um but I'm curious what you guys think I think I think it hurts the identity of the people who formed their identity around Shilling tokens so you know the loudest voices online are the people who are Shilling the loudest for their bags but those aren't necessarily the majority of bag holders right um and so I I do think there's a question of like yeah those people are engaged in a tribal war against each other to try to prove themselves because their entire identity is based on them being right about a token price but I don't know that that's true for the majority of Solana holders or ethereum holders uh or you know or or Bitcoin Bitcoin it probably is but but like for salon and ethereum right like this idea that your ideology is based on what you you know you bought like it's just an extension of 20th century consumerism to it's kind of like end point I think it's a pretty nihilistic endpoint which is like you are what you buy and you're no longer buying a thing you're just buying money itself and like the money that you buy is like now your identity this is very dark and very dumb um but I also don't think it's the majority holders I think people buy this because they actually think it's a good investment because they like the technology not because they believe that you know their own identity space and that so I think we skew a little bit because the social media voices that win are the ones that are most tribal and the chilliest often uh as well um but yeah I don't I I know a lot of people who hold both Ethan Solana and like both those projects as do I personally uh I hold both those tokens and I love them both um and uh so maybe I'm projecting I don't think there's a need to choose I think it's exactly what you said mer like these are different use cases and um for different purposes and yeah when doing really well creates a great opportunity for another do well the I mean the funniest place you see this is with the Roll-Ups where it's like now all the Roll-Ups are going through their own Wars with each other and it's like honestly if one of these roles does super well its gas prices are gonna Spike right it's going to get really expensive and it's going to create a great opportunity for everyone to go to another roll-up it's like uh you know all these Roll-Ups like the more that there are the cheaper they're making block space and the more opportunity they're creating for each other um and there's a lot of ways that I think like they all actually are working together and and um creating you know like a really great roll-up world but they're not positioning themselves that way you know they're positioning themselves in this tribal War because that's what gets attention yeah one thing I'll I'd say that's um so I have two questions one is um I kind of like the example you just gave actually just kind of thinking out loud if like a roll-up got really popular and then the gas fee spiked that would you know presumably mean that people might get to another roll up and it's an opportunity for that roll up um I'm gonna push back on a little bit just because I'm not sure I've seen it happen I'm not sure I've seen it happened that much in crypto yeah it seems like maybe once there's congestion on a network they'll kind of just keep wanted to use that Network because they kind of feel at home there um and it's maybe not as utilitarian as just going to another chain at least this is kind of speaking from experience like when eth Gatsby spikes people would still stay on eth and then would justify it in in some way like you know this just means there's a lot of value going to secure it as opposed to like maybe I'll just and like of course some people moved over but not everybody so I'm curious on like maybe the extreme Edge case there of like why aren't those people moving over or like in your words why do you think that is well I mean interoperability with Roll-Ups is just a lot easier than interoperability between Ethan Solano right like you know it's very easy to bridge from one roll up to the other uh it's not very easy to bridge from like ethereum to Solana so I I you know when I say very easy I mean relative bridging still sucks um but you know I I do think like because you're in the ethereum ecosystem there will be that opportunity to stay there but I honestly I do think like ethereum's gas prices spiking was great like for Solana like a lot of the salon and narrative is really based on the inefficiencies of ethereum you know in 2021 uh and just watching ethereum play out and being like this is there's no way this is gonna work like this cannot possibly be the future of what blockchains look like hundred dollars to buy an nft just for the gas fee alone like a salon looked really really great in that context too so I I do think it actually drove a lot of people there including me cool um and then the second part of the question which completely going to be uh offside or maybe not that related um which you guys kind of both mentioned the the um uh distinction between exit and voice so far uh in this podcast which kind of brings me to biology and maybe his some of his work on network States and communities how do you guys because you guys are obviously um you thought a lot about you know governance communities whatnot how do you guys think about kind of the network State uh framework such a loaded question um I had a very interesting podcast episode that I'll send you guys to link in the show notes that's basically like there are a lot of problems with the network State the blockchain Socialist was was who came on the show um to talk about it and he's done a ton of really great writing and podcast episodes on his own podcast about this I think that the I I'm very much aligned with with his approach on a lot of that stuff which is basically like the underlying um reasoning behind why the network State might be interesting I.E like nation states are failing us these things are not necessarily designed for like the digital spaces that we spend so much of our time in I I agree with um and and makes a ton of sense in terms of biologies like principles of like why we've gotten to the point where we need something new I think the actual implementation that the network State suggests and this is very much what the blockchain Socialist argues um is is problematic in a ton of different ways and probably doesn't work um and so I think the the general sentiment around the need for it is a yes the details on how we do these things needs a lot of reworking and I think that the problem that you run into around a lot of that narrative is just like kind of adopting what biology says at face value when it comes to how these things actually get built so I'm very skeptical of you know the acquisition of uh pieces of like physical land and of a bunch of people who are rich in Internet money deciding to kind of colonize different areas of the world also the the sort of one commandment type governance makes very little sense we know that like polycentric governance is a much better way to run especially highly complex human systems so I think um there's a lot of revisiting which is exciting because that's also where this work you know happens that's where I think a lot of the innovation of crypto steps in is like how do we rethink governance for a digital space for a digital and physical space and how can we we do it in a way that just makes a ton more sense from what we have right now um David I'm curious to hear your thoughts oh no do I have to do this yes do you have to publicly say that you love balaji's Network statement yeah I love it so much uh no I chase you I think you encapsulated my thoughts pretty perfectly which is like the theory of digital statehood is is really exciting um because it enables these things like forking and opt-in systems that you have never had in physical terrains um so choosing and and also being able to be part of multiple States at once right the fact that you can choose to participate in multiple networks right that you can just permissionlessly Fork it and build social consensus and that's not a violent act you know of a Confederate like you know uh War that's just you expressing you know a different uh digital preference and seeing if you can build social consensus around it like all of that is really exciting and it's really exciting because it can't be done in physical States like physical states are scarce by definition they are not abundant uh they are not able to endlessly be created and opted into uh you are trapped within a specific locality um and so there's this kind of like sleight of hand with a lot of balaji's writing where he takes the ideals of a digital Network and then applies them to a physical Network where actually those ideals I don't think work um and you know there's a lot of hand waving about oh yeah you just get the UN to you know approve your state and it's like how easy is that to do you know to get the younger previous state and and you look at the motivation behind it and it it is a question of like you know the point of all of this should be in some ways to get out of tribalism towards being able to be members of multiple tribes opt into whatever you want and like let other people opt into their system um but instead you're getting the system that's very much based on rich people congregating together in order to protect their own interests by colonizing land and uh that seems fairly terrifying to to me personally and I know people are excited by this because the return on investment of a state is is pretty huge uh I do think like as much as I lean in many ways you know towards anti-regulation um so much Innovation historically has been funded by governments over and over again all Silicon Valley was funded by governments um technology in the 20th century is funded so so having strong governments matter um having governments that we opt into matters but I think the kind of solutions that they're coming up with to just get a bunch of rich people together and take over a bunch of land it's uh I don't know I struggle with this one personally yeah I'm really curious like where do you think crypto is gonna push things because crypto to me has a network effect and almost applications protocols Etc and when you're talking about nation states part of that also makes me think of like Cosmos app chains and you have like this long-term app changed and most of them have like no activity on them right now now in the future they might but I'm curious if you also think it might just lead to a a barbell effect where it's like almost like the 9010 where you have a few protocols or ethereum different ecosystems that you know maybe capture 90 value and you have a lot of others but like it also pushes out the middle and I think about this in media as well so you have someone like Ben Thompson who is his own business his own Rider um and he's doing great right and that's actually been enabled by technology by like PayPal or stripe and that's something that maybe crypto could do as well but all the like local and Regional Riders like they kind of lost their business to Ben Thompson and then you have like the Wall Street Journal so I'm just curious like do you see that playing out in crypto as well good question yeah um hopefully not uh you know hopefully hopefully like you know digital abundance means that everyone is able to develop their own platform in voice like we are we are already at a state within Society where the local writers do not have centralized backers that they can go to uh the only option is to write online and and will you face that Creator economy problem that like 90 of creators don't have any views uh are not getting any audience not building social consensus um yes like I think here what you're getting at is that like creating a blockchain is basically the next exception of the crater economy you're creating a culture and you're trying to get people excited around it right and it's like ultimately Solana wins not based on the technology but based on a bunch of people getting cited by it right and sharing it with each other and wanting to use it it's around culture right that you win and so the same thing is going to be true for all these blockchains that spread out but but you know I do think there's a way where you look at like 90 of them failing like that's a very good thing that means that like you've enabled tons of experimentation um you've been able to try every version of it it's like Evolution like you want to be able to like have maximize for diversity right and so like being able to see that anyone was able to try this and even if they didn't build social consensus they were able to at least go out and do this thing um and see what happened and get the data from that like it's not it's not such a such a terrible thing I think it is if everyone's livelihood depends on this right if everyone's like you know we live an economic system or the only way to make money is to launch a roll up uh then this gets scary but like as long as like we have some sort of economic protection in place where we can try this stuff as experiments then it's a really beautiful thing if a lot of stuff fails because that's how you learn and that means that we really gave the chance to everyone to experiment too I also think over the next few years we're probably going to start to see especially as like crypto consumer uh applications hopefully take off I think we'll start to see which parts of the stack make sense as like these shared uh pieces of infrastructure and which parts of applications are going to just make a lot more sense for teams to build their own infrastructure and own their own infrastructure and I think that is not really a dynamic that we have a ton of conviction on yet like I think we've learned that it seems like ethereum is a settlement layer makes sense awesome I think like moving forward there's going to be a lot of experimentation and failure of teams who either want to pull in other tooling But realize it makes more sense to build their own on the flip side there will also be teams who build all of their own stuff um throughout the entire stock basically and end up realizing like this made no sense so I think from a sort of centralization of decentralized info structure perspective as well this is something that I think is going to shake out over the next few years I think somehow this ties in on what you're doing with Metropolis to me to some degree because like one thing that's made the internet really accessible is when you have like a thousand websites but also things like PayPal made it where all these websites can actually charge for things because people trust being able to put their credit card information and like buying something and I something that you're doing in Metropolis right now is you have like a tool I think to see like permissions on contracts right so you can see like it's a multi-sig it's a three or four Etc and um it feels like maybe to enable this like why consumer adoption also experimentation you you need to have more products like that and it seems like is that like a core thesis that you guys hold yeah I mean I think like what we've started to see is the emergence of a ton of different types of users you have people who are like highly Technical and are going to go straight to etherscan to to look at contracts you have people who want like a more accessible interface but are still checking the chain and then you have people who don't give a  about any of that stuff and just want to buy shares of their friends and I think um we've been doing a lot of thinking on the people in the middle there um I think you know the the on-chain literacy uh that we've seen in the space thus far has I think actually grown over time like with tools like Dune I think we're seeing a lot more people I mean even blockworks has a ton of people who do incredible research um and so I think we're we're getting a lot closer to making these things more accessible and making it easier for people who you know might skew more towards the like I don't give a um but are now able to like verify what what types of contracts they're using and what the interactions between those contracts are um I think especially as we move into this consumer phase what's going to be super important is not necessarily like auditing contracts on either scan but being able to verify that like you aren't going to get totally screwed by contracts either and so I think this type of tooling is going to be super important in the in the context of saying okay how can we teach users again um trust but verify to push this this sort of like on-chain mechanic that frankly we haven't seen before like it hasn't been possible for you to check the chain when you're paying someone with PayPal so I think building more of this type of tooling is is going to be super important before I do rapid fire I just want to ask one question that I saw or or ask your take on a tweet that I saw from you that I thought was interesting you said on July 19th you cannot out to your way to pmf what does this mean can you expand yeah this is uh I had some people who were like this is a terrible day and some people who are like this is a great egg and by the way I wasn't subtweeting anyone in particular um I think that the thing there for me is just that I think that what we've seen is a lot of times applications um or projects that have struggled to get traction have kind of Fallen back on the idea of being like well gas fees are just expensive and it's really hard to onboard people um which is true again to the point about a death by a Thousand Cuts and being able to experiment this stuff with this stuff like I do think that makes a big impact I I would really love for people to avoid immediately defaulting to going a layer deeper in infrastructure because they couldn't find consumer traction and I think that's kind of what I'm getting at there which is like there is an appeal to being like well we couldn't this didn't work let's just launch an L2 and there's value in that I think having a ton of L2 is going to be great I'm excited about that but I just think it's a very easy thing to fall back on rather than looking more critically at why whatever it is that you were doing did not work um and then I also just think that like everyone's going to be launching all twos and and everyone's going to be competing for for that basically demand for for Block space um and I don't think that that is necessarily the perfect solution to getting to pmf so yeah there's a lot of layers Ico is the proper is the proper yeah of course let people speculate on you yeah when you said that it reminded me of like a life coach that essentially like you couldn't figure out what you wanted to do in life so instead you go down a layer and you become the life coach then tell other people what to do one thousand percent and there's nothing wrong with doing that but it's like we still need people who are actually doing things that are not you know building infrastructure so yeah I just I I want to be wary of that and I'm I'm to be clear I'm super excited about you know the potential for app chains and app specific Roll-Ups and I think there's there's a lot of excitement at least in my head in terms of what that means for consumers I just want to be wary of people who or projects who have not reached any degree of like consumer pmf being like well we're just going to do the infrastructure instead because it just ends up we end up in the same thing that we've gotten to already which is just like the incentives make a ton of sense to do that and it also means that we don't actually make any real meaningful progress towards um mainstream adoption yeah in 2021 you were down 2022 you're an nft in 2023 you're a chain right and you're just like yeah joked out joke nfts joke chain we're just gonna like yeah keep pivoting with the times and trying to test it's like guys yes like if you don't anticipate sufficient demand for your roll up because your app is really killing it perhaps consider whether or not you should be launching a rollout for your app you know that's that's kind of I think the the dynamic there swallow putt uh merch you want to go into the rapid fire sure okay I'm gonna keep this short just gonna ask some rapid fire questions try to keep it you know brief lizard brain but if you want to expand go ahead of course and um we'll just go with David and then Chase and Order every time cool yeah all right um first get nervous it's just round robin um I already am don't worry yes um your three favorite crypto apps and none I don't have any favorite crypto apps uh there's what yeah Joker is joke race joke and race there we go nice Chase damn uh I like Twitter which is not a crypto app but I think that's one um I actually like love using defy like Ave I know that's so boring because it's basically saying a savings account but like there is something exciting about being able to like earn earn eth on top of my eth like that just feels good and it feels like a real use case that actually makes sense but I'll give you two yeah uniswap is also awesome um yeah yeah feels good to you it's a beautiful app yeah how would you explain what a dow is to your parents um it's when you give up all of your money and decision making to a bunch of random people who are buying a thing called your token that you actually don't get any money for uh either because it's all secondaries how's that incredible you're a great salesman David yeah yeah everyone want to join it down out mine is just user controlled user-owned internet use your own digital spaces the positive one yeah okay yeah the cope we're going full cope what's a community that you wish existed in crypto yeah you know okay quick rant we're talking a lot about you know these like Network States and it's like the thing they have in common is it's like we're talking about digital sovereignty but in practice it's a bunch of rich people going to land it's like that's not where the opportunity is for crypto the opportunity for crypto we know this is the mbanked it's all the people around the world who don't have access to an international finance system and we've finally created an international finance system that can be inclusive and include everyone around the world with internet and the idea that you now want to split that off and just take over a small piece of land with a bunch of rich people like this is what I think the full case is for Solana it's like Solana is is the international chain right the one that doesn't know boundaries and can include everyone I would like to see communities of unbanked people who are actually able to pull resources together to support each other I think Gia is like a really great um like project working on this uh but yeah like I'm much more interested in the opportunity both in terms of the chain but also in terms of the people who don't have access to this than the people who have the most access and him getting to use it just for their own sake as well there we go chase big plus one can't even can't follow that up so all plus one it all right which is the laziest answer sorry no it's a great answer um what is your most unpopular taking crypto [Music] um say there's a lot of nuance to it I don't think we should make everything addictive I definitely don't think we should financialize the out of everything we're doing but right now I do think that we need to be making more trade-offs than we've been willing to make in the past to actually experiment and understand what works uh mine is probably the buying tokens was a distraction from the actual use cases of blockchains oh that is that is a hot take nice um what is one thing that you wish everybody listening to this would take away for um from governance what do you what do you what do you want to drill into people's sides about governance it needs to be hornier Chase yeah it needs to be hornier it needs to be it needs to be the feature not the product I think and yeah I mean hoardiness as a feature as a as a mechanic for governance is I think that's how we get to pmf basically all right um last question um don't get murdered excited you have to if you clip that button you have to clip it with David saying that first you cannot just clip me yes don't worry it'll only be you sure I've got a question even though it's not like a formula question yet y'all are both like super fun and get along together really well and it seems like one you're extremely smart and insightful but you don't take yourself too seriously like what one how do you do that how do you talk about being horny and dicks all the time but like you know are you comfortable all the time literally all the time how are you comfortable doing that or like how do you maintain that I feel like most people in the space take themselves way too seriously so I'm just curious either your philosophy about that or I don't know some insight why are you so horny on Maine yeah yeah do you guys have a problem yeah I think other people like wouldn't feel comfortable doing it so do you think you just like started being authentic one day and like owned it and then everybody just accepts it because I think some people would be like if I say this like I'm gonna be like canceled off Twitter I I think it's just like we haven't gotten canceled yet and so we just keep going and then like you know at some point at some point we'll we'll get canceled but you know uh yeah I I I I honestly like for the first six months I was in Twitter I never told a joke I like want to be taken seriously and it was getting like very little traction and my friends are like why are why do you like this stick up your ass on Twitter you know like why can't you be you uh and I was like oh that's interesting and I realized like being likable is actually one of the most important things you can do um in social media like being likable is like that's a reason people want to work with you you know both in terms of hiring but also just in terms of BD and things and so like if I can have fun and that actually is a winning business strategy like that is what is unique about crypto as a sphere like that historically has not been true you did not historically get to both have fun and have that be a good business opportunity but crypto is really really special in that way and that's why despite all the issues of this industry I love it yeah I also think like crypto is very much like not serious industry in the sense that like again we haven't achieved product Market fit and most of the things that we're doing so I'm I the whole like taking yourself super seriously thing I think I'm just not particularly sold on David I think is way funnier on the internet than I am I think David is way funnier period than I am but I do think that there's like a um an element of just like if you take yourself super super seriously you're holding yourself back I feel that way in general about posting on the Internet by the way like if you have this High bar for how you want to be perceived you're never going to create anything and you're never going to share anything because you're always going to hold yourself to something that's just like unattainable at a on a long enough time scale so I think that um doing whatever the you want and being you know at least somewhat authentically you is just much more interesting and really the risk in crypto of that is so low like this isn't JP Morgan you know we're not yeah and when you remember it's all theater you're just a b testing your personality like with every tweet which is scary 280 characters to see you know what people like and it's like most people do not like most of my tweets for good reason they're not good uh but you know it's like I get the a b test and like find out what parts of my personality actually are effective it's great I get between myself all the time we've talked a lot about David but like there's also a scary version where you let you know your engagement drive your personality but that's a whole other audience capture attention yeah yeah right well you guys are just super anti-memetic in that way and I think like people are attracted to that and uh on the embarrassing bit I actually think it's interesting too because you have a competitive Advantage like oh people find this embarrassing it's perfect for me to
