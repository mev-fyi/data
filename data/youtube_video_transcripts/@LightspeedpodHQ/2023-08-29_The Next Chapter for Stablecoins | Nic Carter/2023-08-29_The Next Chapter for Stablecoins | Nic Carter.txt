through their liquid shaking token Judo Soul get started today at Judo dot Network slash taking [Music] what's up everybody welcome to another episode of Live speed today we're joined by Nick Carter the general partner at BC firm Castle Island Adventures Nick Carters and OG in the crypto industry Nick welcome to the show thanks for having me excited to be here yeah fun to have you on mate one thing I want to talk about because I've been listening to your show and you talk about stable coins a lot which I think a lot of people would argue is maybe the only product Market fit that we have found in crypto maybe outside of like Bitcoin as a store of value I heard you on the bank list podcast this is way back in 2020 um talking about stable coins and like is that going to be a threat to ethereum and if you fast forward to today stable coins are now 10 of crypto's total market cap and I think it makes up about 75 of the dollar volume that goes on in crypto so a lot of cryptos is moving around dollars so I'm curious Nick what's your current thesis and thoughts on stable coins where did you get that data from Garrett I sold directly from you did somebody else like also figure that well it's yeah that 75 give or takes let's say 70 but yeah I wrote a white paper on stable coins in 2020 where I called them crypto dollars but nobody liked that and um at that point I ran the I ran the data this is on-chin transaction volume not exchange yeah as a caveat actually the the ratio of exchange volume is higher for stable coins um and at that point it was 30 so Stables were small but they were doing 30 percent of uh sort of the global market share of on-chain transaction value between Bitcoin ease and other l1s today it's 70-ish plus percent which is remarkable so basically crypto became dollarized people haven't even realized it yet like it kind of makes sense that you wouldn't use the native assets um as a collateral type or to subtle transactions because it doesn't really make sense to do um I mean you want stable value in your smart contracts if they have a long duration and if you're even using it as a bridge currency or something like that if you're going Fiat crypto Fiat you want something that's stable on on the inside and you don't want to incur capital gains tax liability whenever you transact right unfortunately in the US that's actually how the Dollar's preeminence is maintained is the dollar is kind of carved out so if you hold dollars and it appreciates um I don't that's unlikely to happen let's say it did uh you know um so you sort of won in real terms you're not owing tax on the difference on the Delta there if you're holding a foreign currency or commodity or something else you are on the hook for a couple against taxes so something people don't realize tax policies one of the ways the preeminence of sovereign currencies are maintained not just because you need the dollar to extinguish your tax liability in the US but because of this capital gains issue and it's you know and it's an accounting overhead it's tax overhead it's annoying so people just use dollars now and this is what happened in crypto it's remarkable I think is somewhat predictable like there's this whole school of thought that payment tokens would win out maybe Bitcoin would become the payment token maybe Ripple would maybe Stellar like people really thought that was a thing that was wrong right that's just not true it's stable coins and that's what we live in that's the world where that's the direction we're going and uh people need to come to terms with that yes Bitcoin and ease are things you want to hold for long durations of time but when it comes to intimidating transactions and holding stable value within smart contracts on chain it's going to be dollars what one thing I'm curious about is the crypto Community maybe has some different perspectives on the types of stable coins so you know there was obviously uh the collapse of Terra and decentralized algo uh stable coins and then there's things like usdc and whatnot which work much better but some people are concerned that you know they're obviously kind of centralized in in a sense how do you think about kind of the state of stable coins and what would you like to see there yeah it was a big hater of Luna Terra I'm on the record Being a hater um so if you feel Vindicated by that um I diligenced uh basis formerly known as base coin back when I worked at Fidelity and I sat down one afternoon on a designed like 15 attacks on it and convinced myself that it wasn't going to work and then I read about currency boards and things like that and I realized crypto people are just trying to do something that Central Bankers have done for decades and there's actually a Playbook there if you want to maintain a peg you want to maintain parity is you need convertibility this is saying which is no convertibility no parity Luna didn't have that or UST didn't have that um it yeah it didn't have a credible organization backing the reserves obviously and it grew too large because of the artificial interest rate that they attached to it so it was predictable it was going to fail many people did I'm not I don't think I have any particular special insight there in terms of the current cohort I don't really buy the notion of a uh unless it's issued somehow you're sterilizing The Exchange risk of some native crypto asset and creating a dollar against that which there are attempts to do this so I actually kind of do want to dig into that so eth collateralized USD stable coins so some really interesting projects that are now emerging so synthetic dollars unless that is the case you're always going to be exposed to government policy that's an issue of a stable coin and it's not good enough to be like well we're just not going to put a freeze in C's function in the contract that doesn't work because if you have dollars in a bank somewhere and a government doesn't like what's going on they're going to ask you to freeze them to get a court order and then if you're unable to do that they'll just seize the reserves you know no long reserves right so this is something that Austin Campbell who's one of my stablecoin gurus says a lot uh you might as well put that function in the smart contract if you're a Fiat fact if you're back with a stable coin with any real world assets that are exposed to governments if you don't have it you're not immune so you are going to always need to have that and you can still have a very successful credible functional system if you do have that so I'm on the I'm on the incrementalist side I don't think you can go fully decentralized at least not with the the tools that exist today it may be possible to issue a USD stable coin in a capital efficient way against let's say yeast collateral there's some interesting experiments there the fact that etha's staking now makes it much more tractable but uh yeah generally I think the fully fiat-backed model is the best one and um there's obviously an array of strategies there I'm on the side of uh we should have a heterogeneity of issuers uh in a bunch of different jurisdictions with a bunch of different uh sort of quality of property rights attached to them and then you can sort of pick your poison uh that seems to be the direction we're going with mostly offshore now is where Fiat back Stables are going and but you know still dollar denominated um and uh yeah you know the existing issuers um we can sort of run through them I'm I'm a bit of a tether apologist I would say I would say tether is sort of not as bad as people think it is and those sort of very good reasons for why people like tether so we can also dig into that um but yeah one thing to note there is I advise this um stable coin ratings agency called Blue Chip so I'm hoping that there will be many more such things that emerge maybe it's Blue Chip maybe it's Moody's maybe it's standard and pores let's start to rate the stables and give regular folks the ability to very quickly to glance see uh what their credit exposure is to the stablecoin issuer what their recourse and bankruptcy is is this bankruptcy remote is it held in a segregated trust um and what jurisdiction it's issued in what's the quality of the assets backing the thing what's their liquidity and duration profile and it seems like things are progressing in a really good direction there so overall I'd say I'm actually pretty happy with the stable coin space I think it's unfortunate that the US is chasing it away but uh yeah pretty pretty content with it overall and since you mentioned Tara you know at their the end of their uh their Lifeline there they added Bitcoin as that like reserve currency almost behind it to save the system in times of stress what did you think about that at the time and is that is that something you see as a future at all I mean it's a form of synthetic dollar being backed by Bitcoin right do you think that's really a feasible case for Bitcoin or you'd say that's a dead use case yeah no I called for that in my 2020 white paper I actually interviewed dokwan as part of the process and uh um he told me that Tara was being used in Korea to buy household goods with uh chai the app if you remember turns out he was very much lying about that uh that was uh later proven to be a gigantic lie um but I think his Gambit with backing it with Bitcoin was an attempt to I can't even think of a good analogy here but basically like trying to bring down the whole crypto industry with him so he wanted to make Terrace systemic I think I said this at the time if you go and dig up my old tweets about it I think he was trying to make the Terra system as systemic as possible so that the industry felt compelled to backstop the Token as the end of that time of Crisis I think that's actually what he was trying to do uh so I'm kind of glad in a sense that it collapsed when it did I obviously it grew way too big but uh it could have been much worse also like he could have dragged down even more of the industry with him I want to just for our audience who some of some of who may be kind of unfamiliar or nourish crypto there there is a lot of controversy around usdt uh Tara uh which you just touched up on um so one could you maybe talk about how you think maybe it has kind of an unwarranted rep and two I'm also curious on your thoughts on delta neutral stable coins uh so things like UFC um or like the one that Arthur Hayes was mentioning as well yeah I think Athena which is uh the brainchild of Arthur Hayes is a fascinating product and I think something like it will succeed um maybe Athena itself um so we'll start with that one so the key idea here is that you can combine you know if you think back to the early bitmex days Traders on bitmex would sterilize their exposure because I think Bitcoin was the only collateral type for a long time and so they would hold an offsetting short BTC position against their long BTC spot Holdings and that would create a synthetic dollar right the and generally speaking you get paid for being short right so not always but generally yes and so there were entrepreneurs as early as kind of 2018-17 that realized you could build a synthetic USD stablecoin and we actually backed some of them we we invested in some projects like that trying to create a USD stablecoin based on bitcoin collateral and it didn't work and the reason was you're not always being paid for being short sometimes you have to pay for being short at which point uh you're the carrying cost of the system gets significant in particular in 2022 but other times of volatility as well um so on its own it doesn't work very well to have a synthetic USD however there is a crypto asset that pays you for being long now called ethereum so um I don't know as of just recently I think the ethereum rate is sort of four and a half percent I checked a month ago it's actually the exact same as the three-month treasury 5.5 which I thought was very interesting and so now if you have a portfolio of long spot stake teeth and short ease Futures you get paid in two ways and the yields are not really that correlated as far as I can tell which is a great thing right so I think based on the analysis I've seen you can reliably maintain a synthetic USD position based on the long staked eth spot position plus the short East future position and also have a yield on top of that which you can keep and use to bolster your reserves and keep as a kind of Insurance Fund or you can pass along to holders in an interest-bearing manner so I think that's going to be a very attractive product for a lot of people that you know the alternative would be a tokenized treasury basically a stable coin that passes along treasury yields which I do think is very interesting and we're backing projects like that um and but I think people will really find it attractive to have a USD position where the value of that actually accrets to Ether itself and maybe in the future Bitcoin too like you could imagine a portfolio of both ether and Bitcoin as the underlying collateral there especially because the funding rates for ether and Bitcoin are not identical so I think that's an incredible Innovation which is mainly facilitated by virtue of the fact that each sticking works now and the entire carry trade with eth can be carried out now you can borrow dollars by eth get exposure and close out that position the whole cycle can be completed right so um that's that's a great Innovation I think um this is the subject of my talk at uh token 2049 and and probably massari mainnet too so you'll hear a more fleshed out version of this in the future but um I think that'll be successful and I think you'll see this come talk by at least 20 percent of stable coin aggregate market cap synthetic USD Stables which has never been the case I mean you could say dies the synthetic USD stable uh but mainly dies a kind of usdc front end so um and then the other question was about tether Tyler I think is unfairly maligned and I've been tangling with the tether truthers for like six years now and I'd like them to introspect and acknowledge that they have been wrong um maybe they were right that it was sketchy but they were wrong that it was going to fail maybe it will fail but if it does fail it's not systemic I think the theory that it was completely unbacked is false uh the fact that they have you know tether themselves have done some sketchy things is not it's kind of part of the tether business model it's sort of by Design and I would say it's a future not a bug actually so the fact that they're running around the world trying to find banking trying to find partners that are going to do business with them payment processors that's because they're offshore right that's because they are meant to be somewhat um immune from US Government right so so they're trying to be remote from the US government apparatus right because of that they're being chased around their Bank partners are being pressured to shut them down then they historically have had to go find unsavory Partners right like crypto Capital back in the day stole 800 million from them or something ridiculous that's when bitfinex co-mingled the reserves with tether and extended them a kind of irsat's loan so that was questionable but that happened because they were offshore and trying to be as remote from from the US as possible so if you think of tether as kind of an unregulated Global Shadow Bank it kind of makes sense that they keep running into these problems but then the reason that that's worth it for them is because the tether holders themselves find Value in that they like tether for that exact reason because it's perceived as being more offshore than a usdc for instance and if you look at recent data like you see with operation choke point 2.0 in the US as that happened right you know in March you're really accelerated people flood usdc for tether they found a safe haven in tether that you know they felt that it was a place where their value would be secure and uh they would be more immune from U.S government provocation so that's kind of the point of tether so people always wonder like okay well why is you know why does anyone use tether if like they've been so sketchy I you know I could never see myself using it well it's because these people are operating from the mindset of being integrated into U.S financial markets and uh if you're not then you can see why you might want to be a little bit more remote from U.S financial Regulators it makes sense especially as um you know Financial policy in this country became super interventionists they started freezing Russia's reserves they're getting really aggressive with the crypto industry cutting them off from the banking system here so it makes sense so I'm not saying tether is never going to fail for I don't think it'll last another three years actually I do think eventually it'll be Unwound um but I am saying it makes sense to me why someone would want to use tether if they're in a particular type of circumstance and to be clear that's not me like I don't use tether I use usdc if I'm settling a transaction which we do at our fund and we're um you know making an investment with stable coins but um yeah I can understand why someone would use teller Nick I want to use a double down on that why did you say you think tether will be like Unwound like what would what would cause that yeah I mean so they've existed since what 2015 but meaningfully multi-billion since say 2018 I think yeah I think uh eventually they'll hit the end of the road and um I think us you know the US like ultimately does have an enforcement arm that reaches globally so if they really want to get them they'll be able to um I don't think it's going to be a catastrophic thing it'll just mean that there'll be some sort of net settlement sort of aggregate global settlement where um if you are a real institution you can pass kyc then you can withdraw your sort of purana share of the underlying Reserves but um yeah I think like as a as the crypto industry sort of legitimizes itself you're ultimately going to see these like Global offshore Shadow Banks like finance and tether like ultimately marginalized right um especially if uh let's say usdc or an onshore stable coin gets a kind of regulatory baptism a blessing let's say there's a stable coin bill then I think at that point there's a lot of political will to go after the competitors that are perceived as uh cheating or not operating on the Level Playing Field but it is I think it's solely a question of political will the tether system itself appears to be fairly stable frankly but ultimately you know given that they're you know they have a long history of being pretty insolubrious um I think they'll be chased down eventually but I don't think it's catastrophic so talking about politics a lot of people might have seen talks about the stablecoin act and stable coin regulation in the US especially right now you probably are more familiar with that than anybody and especially more articulate could you maybe just walk us through what's going on there yeah there's a state of the stablecoin acts and then how do you see it going yeah the the State of the Union uh as far as it pertains to stable coins in the US is uh is poor you know um in January custodia which was a bank registered in Wyoming they were trying to issue stable coins and they were trying to get connectivity to the Federal Reserve they were stonewalled uh the FED didn't grant them a master account they are operational I don't exactly know how but um they were basically walled off from that exclusive club and there is an open constitutional question as to whether the FED should even be allowed to do that to exercise that kind of discretion um there's a good paper from Professor Julie Hill um covering this like does the FED constitutionally have the right to say no to a bank that is satisfying all of the other criteria and uh ultimately I think it'll go to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will say these Master accounts are a shall issue function from the FED not a May issue so we'll see what happens there but either way that was pretty devastating for folks trying to issue stable coins onshore from the bank construct then also in January of this year the FED said Banks shouldn't touch stable coins period um effectively so they de facto banned Banks from engaging with stablecoin which was pretty bad uh because this has led to a lot of entities like for instance bny Mellon not being able to really Advance any of their plans in the US other issuers still can so that's why you have Circle but you know they're issuing it um under the state by state MTL licenses which isn't really fit for purpose it would be better if there was um you know the fintech charter at the OCC which Brian Brooks had proposed under Trump or dedicated Federal legislation laying out how stablecoin issuers can operate we don't have that so um and and actually just recently earlier this month the FED kind of reiterated their view that Banks really shouldn't touch stable coins in any way so the FED said okay well if you're a bank and you want to deal with stable coins you're gonna have to explicitly ask us for permission proactively and we're gonna have to give you a letter saying yes you can do this so it's kind of like the fed's basically saying here's the process um go ahead give it a shot obviously we're going to say no but yeah there's like a way to do it of course there isn't um the other thing that they keep saying is well you need to be able to characterize all the users of the stablecoin which is um is a paradox right because as an issuer of a stable coin on a public blockchain you don't know who is transacting in those secondary transactions on chain you don't know who has the wallet the thousandth wallet on Tron that's moving around a unit of tether right you just don't know you do know who's creating and Redeeming the stable coin so that's like the whole way that's the whole sort of stablecoin construct it's what some people call uh permission pseudonymity so there's an element of permissioning at the Ingress and you know exit there where you have Fiat moving into the system and funds from the system moving back into the Fiat that part's permission but then the secondary transactions where the bulk of the activity happens use the issuer don't really know who those people are and that's uh the way cash works also think about cash right you go to the ATM you go to the bank teller and withdraw some cash they know who you are right but when you then go and use that cash at the grocery store or you tip your valet you know nobody's being informed about that right so the bulk of the cash transactions happening on a P2P basis are not being surveilled so you might think to yourself well okay so this is identical to the Cash System why isn't it allowed well because Financial policy in this country is insane so unfortunately the FED has disallowed effectively the Orthodox stablecoin model as far as banks are concerned and so I would say it's really Bleak in the US now there is a stablecoin bill that's moving through Congress um I think it might have advanced committee um I'm not 100 sure that might be the other bill I'm pretty uh pretty bearish on its prospects to actually be passed because the Senate is democratic controlled and of course we have a Democratic president and uh so I would be really surprised if it passed of course things can change we have an election next year maybe it'll be two Republican houses at that point who knows what's going to happen with the presidential election no idea um so things can certainly change but as of right now the system is not set up to encourage onshore stablecoin Innovation at all uh set up explicitly to discourage it stablecoin issuers themselves have been the targets of regulatory attacks like paxos was targeted uh they're the ones that are issuing the stable coin with PayPal now um they were the target of huge attacks um around the time of uh sort of the BSD wind down the other thing I'll just mention last here is for simcoins to really work you need corresponding real-time Fiat clearing and settlement to occur especially outside of business hours and the networks that did this were the sun Network at silvergate and cygnat powered by signature and what those allowed was the creation of redemption of stable coins outside of banking hours if you think about banking hours that's not even the majority of hours okay there's more non-making hours than there are banking hours and so that meant that uh stable coins could sort of keep very close to the peg because the Fiat inflows and outflows which is how you Arbitrage the peg back to parity um that's how that happens but those networks were destroyed because um in my view uh Regulators crack down very hard on those banks in particular I think that story will come out eventually they didn't just fail they were murdered in my in my view I know that's maybe a controversial view the point is there's no Fiat and as the bank assets were sold the crypto businesses were not included in the subsequent sales right if you look at the sale of uh of signature and their assets to what is the NYCB um the crypto deposits were told to leave and Signet was not included in the sale so unfortunately the Fiat lag of the trades which is essential for stable coins to really work um it uh it doesn't work anymore so the future of stablecoin issuance for the time being is going to be offshore it's still going to be dollars it'll be Euro dollars and it'll be out of Hong Kong Singapore Bermuda Cayman London maybe probably not the EU but it'll be offshore yeah you know I'm not the first one to say this but it's like if cash was invented today I don't think it'd be allowed so um yeah that kind of goes in that conversation hey everyone quick break to tell you about Gino Gino's the number one liquid staking provider in Salon Gino's been known for the Meb software

out at Judo dot Network slash staking that's Judo dot Network slash taking I'll put a link in the show notes use the link so they know that I sent you and go get started today foreign we get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that is the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech Roll-Ups account abstraction Mev app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener of light speed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show we're talking about how important stable coins are in dollars and how much it dominates the crypto industry um I mentioned this at the very beginning of the conversation how do you from like an investment perspective a value creation or capture how does that impact your thoughts on like native L1 tokens or even just tokens in general because for people that don't know Nick it's been the Bitcoin Community a long time very strong feelings on like property rights and self-sovereignty um you also got a lot of flack from the Bitcoin Community because he actually said he likes things outside of Bitcoin too so Nick I'm just curious how is your your thesis um kind of changed over time and how do you think stable coins maybe affect the value of these L1 tokens yeah I would say you know I'm very interested in the world as it actually is not as not in the world as I might want it to be and I think as an investor your responsibility is to try and perceive actual reality as opposed to some fantasy world do you inhabit in your head and um I was probably a bit naive you know I was very focused on the Bitcoin mindset for many years and eventually moved away from that in fact stable coins are one of the things that really uh constitute an Awakening for me and they're one of the places where I think a lot of bitcoiners have gaps in their mental model too they think Bitcoin is going to be the medium of exchange that's just not the way it works right gold is a uh what 12 trillion dollar asset class but no one settles transactions in Gold actually right and uh yeah I wrote a piece for Bank list some years ago digging into this and understanding why the dollar has Supremacy in uh you know the US transactional apparatus and as I mentioned at the beginning there's a few things that make it vastly more efficient to use the dollar as opposed to uh some other financial asset that's really floating I think bitcoiners are still a little naive I still I think they think that because lightning moves quickly that that is going to be the uh you know payment rails of the future and like to be clear I invest in lighting businesses I think Lightning's interesting but I don't think the medium of exchange and the unit of account is going to be Bitcoin so the question is how do you reconcile those things how do you reconcile the fact that people want to use dollars they've revealed preference for that if not a stated one uh with uh you know long-term value accretion for these Networks and um I thought what the ethereum people did was interesting in that they built in this kind of capital return mechanism for ether holders which is a function of how much people use the ethereum network that created a theory of value for ethereum which scaled with the usage of the system regardless of what asset is transacting on the system Bitcoin people still tend to think people are going to try and transact with Bitcoin and that's going to create a reserve where people have a inducement to hold Bitcoin for transactional purposes and that will accrete value to the Bitcoin system so the current bitcoiner mindset is more out of stuff with reality uh from a stable coin perspective then the ethereum mindset uh ethereum the asset gains from usage of the ethereum system uh regardless of what asset is moving on those ethereum rails so uh alternate you know the question is can Bitcoin you know ultimately change itself in any way or can bitcoiners contrive a way to use stable coins on bitcoin or can you find a way to issue stable coins against Bitcoin those would all harmonize the system whereby people want to use dollars but they would like it to be backed in some way by Bitcoin um that hasn't happened yet on bitcoin the two dominant networks were stablecoin transactions occur are ethereum and Tron today for what it's worth is Tron just like 90 Justice on the people use teller on Tron I mean that's the dominant um crypto asset used in Emerging Markets if you look at uh Reverend Howard digital's recent piece on stable coins which was excellent um it's just a matter of looking at the data right I've always been very data driven obviously founded a data company and it was that it was that notion of looking at the data that made me realize stable coins are there's something different here they have a much higher velocity than crypto assets structurally speaking they uh and then there are different uh characteristics so like ethereum has a huge amount of stablecoin volume by dollar value transacted but there's a much larger transactions on Tron you tend to have smaller transactions uh so it's more like retail style um transactions I think that's a function of fees uh but yeah it's really just a matter of looking at the data and once you do that I think a more reliable picture of the world emerges and I think that can then cause you to rethink your normative approach which is certainly what happened for me so you mentioned maybe kind of certain uh members being out of touch with reality and living in some fantasy world you wrote a piece on this on Twitter um a very long one in two pieces uh I think you know which one I'm talking about about maybe like the everyday Bitcoin users and maybe the laser eyes um I'm actually I would argue like maybe the similar thing is happening on ethereum and maybe even Solana kind of you can kind of start seeing it happening what do you think is the cause of that like can you maybe explain why people are kind of form into religions based on the L1 tokens yeah great question if I could answer the question of why we have secular religions uh in the world today you know I would be a best-selling author I think uh you know it is one of those things where if you strip out religion you know established organized religion from someone's life it's not that they become secular no one is truly secular you just feel that metaphysical void with uh some other affiliation and uh you find meaning elsewhere right whether it's you know CrossFit or veganism or being a Bitcoin Maxi right so um you can't ever Stamp Out religion I think is the point here and um people want to belong to a tribe right and crypto is so powerful because it recruits like you know marginalized people that uh have kind of typically like you know minority views on things especially finance and Central Banking and uh it's this incredibly powerful cult because it is financially lucrative historically to to be you know a crypto Acolyte and you feel like you've had some sort of key truth revealed to you that nobody else possesses right that's the essence of a religion is right you have had a revelation and you alone and your peers in that group are um you know adherence to a truth then you know no one else agrees with so you feel special and unique and powerful and uh so I think it's very seductive um and uh it kind of depends on when people joined like if you join the crypto space in 2012 yeah you probably became an adherent of the Bitcoin religion of course like you get so wrapped up in this and it happened to me too like your identity becomes such a you know your identity becomes dominated by your membership in in this religion and it's very hard to extract yourself from it because you have your peer group and you've uh you know everyone knows you within that space and you are a celebrity within the sector and you financially win from being part of that so of course it's true right like of course the underlying values are true because you've done so well out of it uh but you know sometimes things change and uh and you know I think it happens with each of these tribes but yeah I think it's very hard to be a true sort of crypto pluralist it's very hard to be an outsider that's also kind of respected uh by the different tribes and it's hard to be data driven and see where the market is actually going and see where the opportunities are but at the end of the day if you're an allocator that's actually your job like it's your duty to extract yourself from any specific tribe and ascertain you know what are people actually using crypto for like what are the real world uses and to strip out those normative beliefs of to what people should use it for and to focus on the reality and so yeah I think this kind of um you know becoming a a member of an in-group and then being having audience capture happen to you that happens with every single L1 that is really successful whether it's Bitcoin ethereum Solana Cosmos uh so I don't know if that's like a tractable problem to be solved I think the process of disillusionment is very slow um like look at the hex tribe actually um I don't really you know I unfortunately I've like been quite familiar with hex through my friend Eric Wall who like became sort of the chief antagonist of the hex community so I've actually followed their travails a little bit and if you talk to hex people today they are still believers they still believe in it uh what their exact beliefs are I'm not sure but uh they feel that Richard Hart was hard done by and that the SEC charges won't stick and they don't see themselves as victims they see themselves as all all in together with with their with their leader um and even though objectively they have lost money from being part of the hex Community I mean the vast vast majority of them have um they the loss the financial loss has not caused them to re re-evaluate their beliefs because they had so much validation in the years and months leading up to it that their beliefs became extremely concrete and rigid and even today they are they're still adherents and they haven't become disillusioned so if even the most obvious scam ever the adherence and the victims of that scam still defend it and still believe in it think about other crypto assets where yeah there's a drawdown but uh you know people will still stick with those sort of like the core beliefs so it's very hard to get these people off these ideas once they're like rigidly focused on them it's like when a community becomes a religion and becomes a cult and that's something you see with hacks I remember I had this like accusation audit for Solana Twitter post that did pretty well and Richard Hart actually commented on it he said you should do this for hex and I got ratio like a thousand to one like just the you know fire behind that Community it's absolutely insane I think one thing that I really respected of you is actually seeing that like transformation like while you've been in crypto and like open up your views and you openly talk about it um one thing like going back through your old talks that I think maybe you've changed your mind on is how you think about crypto networks and scarcity and the sense of like do crypto networks need to be profitable and why I think this is really applicable to this conversation and also we talk about Salon a lot here Solana has a little bit more of a um I would say ubiquitous theory of value and that you just want to get people to use the asset itself and that will add value to sold the asset and the network whereas obviously ethereum is a little bit different with like ultrasound money and it's really about scarcity and I saw you talking about Bitcoin and one of the big critiques right now is the security budgets I think about 98 of the budgets minors right now is paid through inflation not fees and as we know bitcoin's only going to have 21 million so that could be a problem you thought the long-term solution for this is likely you're going to see exchanges and custodians be altruistic minors in the network and that's because they have enough of a business and a reason an incentive to mine even not a potential like loss you could say just looking at the network alone do networks need to be profitable like because based on that it sounds like it's more important what's built on top of the network than like the inflation and the fees itself that are created yeah I think we weigh over index on the scarcity features and the monetary policy of these L1 networks and under index on the networks as businesses basically and the it's weird ethereum's kind of caught in the middle a little bit uh in that they were still kind of beholden to the Bitcoin ideology uh of uh oh yeah we need the number of units really matters the number the in the direction of travel really matters I think ethereum just had a deflationary year over the last 12 months for the first time ever but that doesn't really matter I mean having some notion of a credible monetary policy matters for sure but there's nothing special about the absolute number of units and the fact that you have some like decaying you know curve where there's an absolute scarcity at the end and this is one of my biggest issues with the Bitcoin Community is this Obsession of the the stock to flow and now that's the completely incoherent absurd idea and it's very sad that anybody believes that I mean it's it's remarkable frankly it's remarkable that anybody believes that I think the ethereum people are also felt they were like held hostage that idea but really what matters is are you creating a settlement Network that is credible that gives you strong settlement assurances and is there some Theory as to how the usage of that Network would result in the accretion of value to the Token the L1 token itself and so to the credit of the ethereum people I think they eventually came around they had that realization and they put a number of things in place which cause accretion to occur scaling in line with usage I think that my qualm of the theorem would actually be they went too far and they created a system that was excessively extractive actually and whereby transactors interests are opposed to the interests of the people that want to be long East so generally today eth is the system that extracts value from users who want to use eth for settlement and returns that value to ease holders so that's actually attention that I think they're going to have to deal with at some point in the future yeah I think the the right way to think about this stuff is are you creating a transactional space that's attractive for people to operate on that gives them uh you know transactional qualities that they really value uh and are you doing it in a pretty credible way you know or are you being super arbitrary changing the variables all the time uh extracting too much value are you being user hostile so that's the tightrope that you have to walk I think that's very well put um while we're on this topic I am curious as an investor on your thoughts on maybe a mental framework that you use because obviously there's a lot going on right now there's Bitcoin and lightning um there's ethereum l2s but then l2s kind of have zks and Rus and then there's the app chain Theses but then there's monolithic or integrated now with Solana monad say um sweet like there's just a lot going on what is your mental framework how do you think about these things I think the biggest and most important debate in crypto at the moment is um the monolithic versus um modular debate and the question is um you know is it better to have a flat uh Financial topology whereby everybody is resident on the same network um and so you have very strong composability right and I think this is one of the best feathers in the cap of the Solana folks um is the notion of composability and that is what makes crypto so good actually you know it's if you look at what Crypt is actually competing with which is the Legacy correspondent banking system uh that is a highly non-composable system right you don't really have the ability to interact with the financial system on an API basis and it's like heavily heavily intermediated right if I'm making a transaction from Jakarta to Mexico City it has to go through London or go through New York and it has to do all these hops to get to the one of the hubs and then all these hops to get to the other destination so that's the status quo that we always need to keep that in mind is our North Star we need to be better than that right that's why stable coins are so great because I can create usdc with dollars here in the US and then send it to anywhere really and as long as there's some you know ultimate Last Mile Fiat conversion now that's a three hop process as opposed to a 50-hop process with tons of information tons of costs that's why remittances are expensive right because you have to do all these transactions go from bank to bank to bank to bank to London or to New York work the bank to bank to bank to bank again to get the all to the to the destination and um so you know I would encourage people to think of those terms and not in like these crypto native terms actually so then we get back to composability uh and what made D5 was so great was the composable nature I mean it's a poison chalice as well because if something breaks then everything that relies on it breaks too let's just assume we can sort of figure that about out eventually the status quo you have on ethereum now is uh challenging that right you actually lose that composability when you have lots of segregation into different l2s and it's we're having an L2 explosion right now but if you think about what an L2 is it's like a recreation of the correspondent banking system right where inverted and eth base layer is like the equivalent of New York in the banking system and then l2s are like these other banks that sort of have these this settlement uh that's occurring but you know I think the risk is that people are sharing the same broad network but they're not actually able to transact with each other directly right these smart contracts can't call each other directly you ended up with all this segregated liquidity that's in all these different pools and I think that undoes the value of crypto which is to have everybody on a shared big Network so I think there's definitely room to take the alternative View and be like okay well we're gonna do our best to to create a single layer where people are transacting with each other directly and I think that leads to absolutely the best defy experiences no question at all because once you get this segregation into different all twos now you reintroduce elements of counterparty risk settlement risk um you know more delays in transaction settlement and that's the literal reason that people liked crypto in the first place because they got rid of those things so it's kind of weird to see it coming for full full circle there like that we're reintroducing the sort of downsides of the Legacy uh trade fight system so yeah I actually yeah from a Solana perspective I think the strongest thing is this very strong emphasis on composability and and you were on Empire back in December 2022. uh that one that's when I was the producer for the show and you said at the time that I think Solana was the number three most maybe most invested ecosystem for um your firm is that still true and I guess has your thesis changed like that was back when Sana was going through some difficult times and obviously the industry as a whole as did you feel stronger about Salon afterwards or like just as yeah what's your view yeah good question I think what I'm seeing in the Solana space right now is very encouraging I think they're showing a lot of growth and you know that's the hardest thing is emotionally recovering from a big drawdown and from being loved to being hated and then it's like how do you recover from that uh so the fact they've been able to Rally a lot of communities wouldn't be able to do that they just wouldn't have a strong enough conviction to be able to actually um you know rally off that uh that you know huge drawdown uh and so that's that's relatively uncommon among all ones I would say and yeah I think the recent data should be considered very validating for Solana people now in terms of your question actually haven't really run the numbers recently um I would say a lot of what we're focused on right now is pretty blockchain agnostic uh is so you know kind of traditional looking Financial businesses that have a blockchain element but they're maybe operating on you know half a dozen chains things like that so we've talked about financial applications of blockchains and disabled coins and um payments Etc a lot this this episode I'm curious what your thoughts are on the other verticals of crypto like things like social Collectibles nfts Etc gaming any of these like you're particularly interested in any of these that you think is just extremely overrated gaming overrated metaverse overrated I can't I can't stress that enough uh maybe it'll work with gaming eventually but you have to make a good game you know the game has to be good right I've had I haven't seen a good blockchain native game or there has to be some reason why uh making some of the in-game essence uh persistent and um composable uh having interoperability there has to be a reason why that enhances the game experience so I'll change my tune on gaming once I start to see that but you know I'm not really a gamer myself so not a not a focus area for me um other sectors I really like um the digital sector um I know that's possibly the worst word and existence it's so terrible can someone come up with a better one please you want to describe what that is though for people that don't know yeah basically um linking the analog conditional world and nfts are a really good way to do that so we're an investor in quite a few startups that do this uh we're an investor in the biggest manufacturer of the chips that go into uh you know physically embodied digital products or digital products that have a physical counterpart and um the the common form factor is you know you have a chip which has a you know key pair on it which is literally embedded into uh some physical good where the sneaker or sweatshirt or something and then you can interact with it via NFC I would say it's the most common way and that gives you just amazing qualities like you take these analog inert Collectibles and you digitize them and maybe you have a counterpart that you can use I just said I hated metaverse but you can you have a counterpart that you can you know use in a metaverse to the extent those emerge we'll see uh you have a relationship with the issuer you have Persistence of metadata right and so this gives the asset a long life and I think you have the ability then to um you know trade securely on a secondary Market knowing that this is an authentic good right see very strong counterfeit resistance properties too this is one of the sectors that I see growing um as even as nfts are totally hated sector now I still see this growing especially with Legacy and sort of web 2 Brands uh they see the they see the benefit here of having that very close direct digital relationship with the collector or user uh and uh so so that I think is should be you know encouraging for that sector um what else do I like what were some of the ones you mentioned I'm I think this is this is slightly um adjacent to this I'm curious what your thoughts are on deep end like have you done any research on depend you invest because that is something where you're using like digital assets nfts and things in the real world um to create a network that was actually the third one I want to touch on I'm an LP in the dpin fund actually uh escape velocity um I think it's very interesting I think helium uh maybe we'll be able to recover but I think a lot of the Dynamics in helium were unnecessarily ponzi-like which is sort of the original set of cryptos you know how in nature all these different uh types of creatures end up looking like crabs right even though they are evolutionarily not linked it's the same in crypto where everything turns into a Ponzi for some reason it's completely unnecessary like we need to get away from trying to get these short-term bumps from injecting Ponzi mechanics into these structures like forget about the Ponzi stuff guys please that's what that's my that's my treaty to the crypto space stop trying to put Ponzi stuff and things it doesn't it's not you know conducive to long-term growth so however I keep seeing ads for helium apparently it's like selling five dollar Mobile coverage in Miami is that real thing I don't know that's remarkable yeah look true Nick how much do you uh hate print Tech then so I didn't sign up to frontec because it's uh has Ponzi Dynamics in it which is unnecessarily anything that's gonna lead to a lot of hurt feelings uh however I do think those really interesting stuff you can do with like tokenized Consulting rights like I issued this orb which uh Eric Wall came up with which has a Harbinger tax mechanic which I think is so interesting you know the point is is that uh the owners have to pay a tax that's proportional to the price that they set for the asset and um that means that the person that drives the most value from the uh from holding the asset is the one that ends up holding it so it's sort of an anti-squater type function so I do think there's really interesting things like we've done there on the social tokenization side uh frontec I think is a good product kind of UI ux wise but um I think it uh it encourages people to um I mean from a Securities perspective it's very questionable to be clear but then also it kind of has these perverse Dynamics where it just leads to issuers encouraging speculation in their token um as opposed to issuers wanting to create value I think for the holders of the token so I think look I think someone's gonna get it right eventually but uh I don't think it's you know historically it was big cloud and now it's front deck I don't think those ones are the ones that will be the winners do you have any hypothesis that you're working on now um that maybe isn't validated but you think is coming true in crypto or maybe it's an assumption that you've questioned and you're kind of looking into right now um yeah a lot of my hypotheses pretend to Stables so um I have a bunch of predictions I was going to make in my talk but maybe I can share some of them now here um but let me let me first you have like 20 talks coming up so you're running a marathon of talks um yeah I just want to remind people that I exist basically um so you know I think people forgot and uh so let's see here what is I don't want to maybe share all of them but uh give us two or three so as it pertains the same coins I think USD is going to remain the dominant unit of account that's very simple safe prediction um today it's over 99 of all stable coins I think it'll remain 95 I think most tables will be issued um you know in dollar terms but they'll continue to be issued outside the US so 70 75 percent um I think 50 of the stablecoin market cap is going to become interest bearing so they will pay holders interest on the reserves they won't just keep the interest for themselves I think that'll happen very quickly within 24 months um I think as I said earlier I think about a quarter at least within two years of stable coin Supply will be based on crypto native collateral which is going to be one of the best ever developments for this space yeah harmonizing dollar transactions with crypto collateral that's what I called for my 2020 white paper it didn't happen people failed to do the synthetic stablecoin thing well die I think basically failed I would argue but I think when it does happen it's going to be really really validating last thing this is definitely uh more speculative but I think to the extent the brics countries which are growing in stature now end up creating a settlement Network between themselves based on dollars held offshore and gold I think it will be issued on a public blockchain uh so I think uh you will eventually have a brics coin where they are contributing reserves the reserves are held offshore the liabilities are on chain so that's sort of like my big big claim do you think they've been sentenced to spin out their own network or they'll use a public one I think for liquidity purposes it'll make all the sense in the world to use the public one so I think you know people have been trying private blockchains for a decade now has failed if they wanted to succeed I think they'll want to rely on the existing exchange liquidity that is already in operation worldwide and all the sort of crypto tools and uh you know custodial and transactional Technology wallets that we've built so far so I think they have a strong motive to do it publicly on chain nice yeah those are great all right you uh you want to go into rapid fire all right let's have some fun you can you can uh expand as much as you want but ideally keep them short um okay so um your Mo what do you think is the most underrated idea in crypto underrated wow um I think a lot of my stable coin views are not widely shared but I would say like the notion that a Fiat act stable is good in having freeze and sees is good also and I think um yeah maybe maybe the notion of the digital sector taking off too I really believe in that I don't think a lot of other people do what is the most overrated idea in crypto the creation of spurious new l1s and and the the concept that those are investable uh I think is incredibly overrated and um the notion of tokenizing everything and creating tokens for every single use case I think most of the time corporate ordinary models work just fine and you don't need a token does that also apply for Altus or do you think I'll once everything applies universally I think like maybe you know .003 of the time you actually need a token when you think you need one what is something you've completely changed your mind on since last year oh and I'll add one other thing is I think an underrated idea would be an L1 that doesn't have a token at all and I think it can be done [Music] what have I changed my mind on um well I thought that the Bitcoin Community could be sort of more tractable and they could be sort of negotiated with and uh you know actually have an open discussion about things like the security budget and I don't think that's possible anymore what is a hypothesis that you were super excited about that turned out to be wrong in crypto so many so many um I would say most of my hypotheses have been wrong um maybe the idea I thought that um I thought that institutional adoption of crypto would be much faster than it was um and I also thought that we would have much higher inflation and that we would see cryptodolarization in Emerging Markets and I don't know if that's wrong but it hasn't happened I also thought more central banks would be buying Bitcoin who do you think is Satoshi um I honestly think a committed researcher like a journalist that actually wants to re re-evaluate the question we'll be able to identify Satoshi like I think it's completely doable it would just take a good journalist like six months to figure it out um I think it's possible that it was the NSA like it was the US government project and uh I call this the Bitcoin lab League hypothesis I think the system could have been developed by NSA cryptographers and then one of them chose to just release it to the world rather than let it just wallow in the archives forever the Bitcoin lab League what is your two favorite apps to use in crypto to your favorite one you used to ask three so he's made it easier uh metamask is pretty good I had a mask and Phantom wallet yeah that question is so hard oh sorry I you know I'm not very cryptic native Nick is the mustache or Mainstay are you keeping it um well there was a it's I kept it because it was a girl I was dating that really wanted me to keep it but then we broke up so you know I can get rid of it now but I feel like it's kind of a trademark now yeah I think it is yeah um okay two final ones a bit more serious um one is you are a prolific writer in crypto probably one of the most well-known ones what are some writing tips that you would have for people looking to start writing more on crypto or just in general the most important thing with writing is to develop original ideas and that's what gives you the motivation to actually write them down if you don't have anything to say then I would say Don't Force It uh so the number one thing is to be curious and try and develop your own ideas and once you do that you're going to feel compelled to share them with the world and that's when the best writing occurs I go through phases you know sometimes I don't have any ideas or any things where I feel like everyone else is wrong and I'm right and in those times they don't write anything so it's when I feel kind of a resentment against the world or I feel like everybody else is wrong there's something that's wrong it's important for me to kind of tell the truth about that's when the best writing occurs what is my tip Don't Force okay um what is one piece of advice you would have for startup Founders in crypto don't price for Perfection you know try and find a uh Venture fund that's aligned and believes in the idea and don't try and optimize for price if you do that you're setting yourself up for failure down the road or you're limiting your set of optimal scenarios to a very small number where you're outrageously successful but you don't have a lot of wiggle room uh and so try and find a Capital Partner that believes in you and will actually work for you as opposed to like a celebrity fund or someone that you like because the Optics uh things go wrong so frequently when you try and absolutely optimize your valuation and price so yeah it's all right that's all I got yeah well Nick thanks for joining today anybody that's not on YouTube make sure to tune in because mer is wearing his Hawaiian shirt today which is uh unusual and great um but Nick thanks thanks so much for joining really liked our conversation on stable coins and just on scarcity and value in general so um anybody that hasn't read Nick's writings I'll put some links in the show notes they're really really good great um so yeah guys and Nick thanks so much for coming on yeah look I recant much of my old writings okay the older it is the worse it is don't read it um I think it's cramming though it's nice to actually go back and listen to Old podcasts and blogs because you can kind of see the shift of where things have gone in crypto over time it's kind of like looking back on history and I actually think it probably sets you up for more success in the future so yeah I read back my old stuff and I cringe I think I think uh Peter Thiel uh said like in a recent talk like having or writing a book is much more dangerous than having a kid or something like that well thanks guys this has been really great you guys really put me through the ringer so you know glad we could do it yeah thanks for joining me all right we'll see you next time all right take care [Music] [Music] [Music]
