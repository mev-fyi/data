nfts will be used more as ways of driving user acquisition engaging users retaining users there is still an expression of value but it's not like oh I'm gonna build a multi-billion Dollar business off of these jpegs which I think in retrospect we can look back on and think it was kind of comical right [Music] what's up everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we are joined by the team from Magic Eden we have said the co-founder in CEO we have Tiff the general manager for salami AKA Solana we have Rex the co-founder and chief engineer guys welcome to the show what's up what's up thanks for having us yeah I'm pumped to have you here we have a lot to talk about today uh we want to talk about royalties and cinepization programs what's going on with magic Eden and a lot more but let's start high level and um Zed maybe if you want to go first let's just talk about the state of nfts and to make it dramatic is the 10K pfb collection dead holy jumping straight into it um I don't think it's dead I I think um the form factor of nfts I think is still up for debate that's for sure but 10K pfp is let's let's acknowledge it it's the only use case that has worked so far uh there are many other use cases that are being experimented on but it is down pretty bad at the moment but I think the the main thing that is driving that is more the um there needs to be a bunch of other Creator types that have to come in and try things vanities and that's actually where we we spend a lot of outsized mindshare at Magic Eden but I don't think it's dead I think to say it's dead is a little bit overblown it's kind of like saying um you know people I remember because I was at dydx in the very early days of crypto people were saying tokens would like erc20 tokens were dead in 2017 right after ICS but the form factor it came back as you know obviously there there were thousands more tokens that came even after that there were tons of token models that were invented like governance models incentive models um you know defy summer all that stuff sort of came after people were labeling tokens as debt so if you kind of just like take a step back and just zoom out sort of a little bit from where we are which is sometimes hard because we're in the depths of crypto Twitter or the depths of uh obviously the spare Market it may be really hard to do that right now now but we've sort of seen this before and I have a lot of conviction that this may not be the exact form factor but it's definitely not debt I think there's something here and um there's re there's a reason so many people are working on this so we continue to be really bullish about it yeah Tiff I'm wondering just I'd like to hear the same from you how do you think about the current yeah I think people oftentimes forget this like universal truth which is like in the the current iteration of nfts really popped off during the pandemic because like people wanted to make friends um like I feel like that is oftentimes forgotten like people primarily boys men wanted to make friends on the internet and um then if you think about well was that able to maintain like true like did was this the format that helps people meet people and develop relationships like that's the reason why nfts are different from fungibles right is because they like reach into your heart they're like emotional they're inherently emotional um no it's not really true right like but it's not because it's part of the form factor and like the pfps themselves but it was a lot of the things that like surrounded the pfp so remember back in the stone ages magic Eden used to have public mins so anybody it was easy for anybody to enter the space and and then we started getting bodied to hell right and then that introduced the whitelist meta which we are currently still in and then the white list meta is really prohibitive for new users to get into the space um sometimes when people like don't want to deal with wallets right that also is like another hurdle so then when you're like okay is this the thing that is going to actually bring connectivity and social interaction to the masses like probably not although it had a really good run I think also like pfps are inherently markets built on scarcity right and there are only a number a small number of Social Clubs that can be considered cool otherwise you know the whole thesis falls apart so um yeah I I definitely think like nfts will continue be to be a way for people to connect and form deeper relationships I just don't know if like yeah the 10K pfp Supply is going to be the thing that brings back like the next Bowl so um yeah so that's um you put it really interestingly there just like uh nfts is a way of boys and men to make friends kind of in the in the cold covered markets um like that's how I can relate to it as like a like a how can I I explain it like a retail and collector I made friends with that over that yeah whatever happens from here I can call this a success well along those lines of thought I do Wonder like for somebody who's just coming into the space or maybe it's just sort about crypto through frantech or something what is the pitch for nfts like why should they care about nfts I feel like you guys are probably more qualified than anyone to answer that like what would your pitch to them be why should they care you want to take a tip yeah I mean I've always thought nfts so I joined nfts because I loved to write so I spent like 2021 doing like different writing programs I got into three programs and then I learned that like the life of a writer sucks right you just like write for 50 cents a word or 30 cents a word uh you pitch all day long to Publications who don't give a  about you and then um yeah you try to like publish a book and the chances are like nobody's gonna read it so the amount of distribution that you can get um and then the authenticity of ownership I think are always like um foundational elements for why nfts are compelling I think to date though it's kind of I will say it's a lot to be very transparent a lot of the things that we've always known were challenges back until the 21 are still like not um fixed or like there are still challenges that like lie in the way I guess this could be like a nice segue to talk about the show that is royalties right like that was the foundational reason why artists and content creators came to the space and now that's even still today it's like the strongest Saga that will never that sorry I should be more positive that is still we're still in that chapter like um that that is currently having its fair share of trouble right so I think there needs to be um the technology needs to be more consistent in order to really get people to care outside of crypto and nft outside of like our native circles but yeah and theoretically right if those foundational elements are there the pitch should still be like very very coherent and compelling for me the we should lean into the things that make nfts that's like the properties of entities really interesting right I think that that has barely that surfaces really barely been scratched because all we've really done is we've put we've like pointed um like images like pointed nfts to images basically is like the extent to which we've scratched the surface and yeah like what Tiff was saying around like um ownership and then I would also add in there you can make a lot of these things programmable in many ways and uh barely anyone has touched that surface area um and I think nfts as different kinds of uh asset types not necessarily financialized assets but you know we're talking about crypto so let's be real it's probably like the the first levels of adoption will always be somewhat financialized um but that to me is where this stuff gets really interesting and the fact that you can just spin up markets for anything you can spin up um you know internet level liquidity for anything you can spin up internet level access for anything right like it's no longer confined to um things that are physically possible like literally physically possible between two or three people or or some small groups of people you suddenly have internet level scale for anything that you do with nfts and to me that is what makes this design space just the most interesting of all of crypto so I want to touch on what Tiff said which is you know at first nfts were more about distribution for creators and artists and I mean they still are but one thing that we've noticed is especially with the recent news of openc not supporting royalties anymore is it's it's actually quite hard to enforce royalties for these digital assets on a technical level and so Rex you are highly technical you have actually solved this problem with I remember you guys had something called the ocp where the open creative protocol a while ago um can you talk about one why it's so difficult to enforce royalties and to um how the different ecosystems tackle this ethereum and Solana for sure for sure so back to the royalty and enforcement topic um I think the root of it is actually ownership I think the most appealing reason for them is digital ownership in the form of NLP that's kind of the really obvious and easiest form to attract users and that concept actually attracts me as a developer I truly believe in like digital ownership and the problem with royalty enforcement is that if you give the collectors like 100 True ownership then you give the users the right to transfer from one wallet to another wallet and in a simple the the fact that you can transfer it freely transfer from one wallet to another wallet you can build a Marketplace you can build a lot of like protocols um you transfer from one dollar to a Smart contract wallet address right and then the fact that you can do that which means you there's no restriction on the marketplace implementation that needs to pay for example pay back the creators um I think this is the fundamental route of like why it's so hard to introduce reward enforcement um on Solana what what's really kind of like um I I think it's also kind of feature is uh oftentimes the the metadata and um the standard of the nfts are really standardized within the whole ecosystem um like before pnfd um uh we basically did ocp attempt to um kind of like being a great experiment to see if we can create a profitable level of enforcement um essentially it's just a white list or Blacklist model so you you basically you want to take away a little bit away from the true ownership 100 ownership from the users and then give it to either a protocol the smart contract or Marketplace so that that constraint um enforces that the process of transaction a nft pays back the creative royalties um so later on I think everyone joins the the effort from metaplex and I think pnft is a great successful like a lot of ecosystem buying and magic and it's actually was actually the first actually implement the Mt in uh in our Marketplace um and I think that hopefully that explains like why Royal enforcements is fundamentally is a pretty difficult problem to be solved and you have to take a little bit like part part of the ownership and then trade it off for Robert reinforcement yes yeah that was a really good answer I think to to summarize the last few minutes for the audience that maybe isn't as familiar um nft is one of the big selling points when they first got popular was that if you're an artist and you do a mint yes you'll be able to profit from that initial myth but maybe you're not well known at the time um but then you'll have royalties on secondary sales so say 10 years from now and you're really famous in your art selling for 100 times the value you'll still generate revenue from that and then people realize it's really hard to enforce the protocol level but on Solana that's actually not the case at the moment and that's because I think it's like 99 of the nfts are under the metaplex standard that has some benefits and that you can put in these loyalty enforcement Clauses which essentially says I can whitelist which exchanges support these like socially support these royalty fees but also it can be seen as a negative because you have to rely on metaplex to actually update their standard right whereas on like ethereum you may not have that so Chase Chapman has this line that like nfts don't have a revenue problem they have a recurring Revenue problem because creators are you know they're making this Revenue at the initial meant but you don't have this like ongoing subscription fee and the boo actually um from drip talks about like you would never wish a one-time nft drop on like any competitor because once you like do this drop you have all this responsibility to continue to build like whether it's an ecosystem or a game to support that um the value around those nfts so they don't drop to zero so I'm just curious maybe Zed or Tiff where do you see the monetization aspect of nfts for creators going forward so my like my opinion is that we were a bit away from figuring that out um I think what we saw with pfps was a model that was inspired by crypto and fun I think it was since I think it was inspired by fungibles it's like okay let's like put some images and then like let's use hype to sell this product right and then that meant that in order to sustain monetization you just had to like get galvanized attention it was super super understandable right like I think if you talk to any of the top creators in the space you'd realize that mental health is like total like it's just this impossible train to keep up with um I think in the near term as we're all deep in the bear I still think of nfts now as primarily engagement um tools rather than monetization tools and I think that's actually a more sincere expression of the content um because they're really easy to um acquire they're really easy to transfer they're really there's this feeling that's like oh when I when I get this content from this Creator it's like a something that they're using to thank me um or vice versa right if I'm a collector I want to give something to a Creator there is still an expression of value but it's not such that like oh I'm gonna build a multi-billion Dollar business off of these jpegs which I think in retrospect we can look back on and think it was kind of comical right so um I I think that these like nft I think nfts will be used more as ways of driving user acquisition engaging users retaining users and less so as like fundraising um tools like outside of the scope of pfps right because in order to monetize the content actually needs to be intellectual property what is IP IPA is when you have content that other people are creating businesses and content around right classic example being Barbie right Barbie is not far because of Barbie making dolls Barbie is Barbie because of like everybody wearing pink and going to the theater together so um I think we are kind of a long way from that right of like having enough creators that can create content that is legitimately considered IP right and that's all because of many things like there's also no incentives and systems that reward people for creating user generated content or utilizing that content in any meaningful way right besides like posting like a pfp superimposed on their body as a tweet right like there's that's like the state we are still in right so I think um yeah a cleaner pure way of experimentation experimenting with nfts is just like using them as engagement lovers and that's actually where I look forward to leaning in um shout out to cnfts so we don't have to go on to that now but yeah um that's how I currently see the market but came to let the guys jump in yeah I have a couple of thoughts on this one is um the Tiff was talking about basically yeah so there's like pfps or like nfts small nft collections there's like fundraising mechanisms which is basically what we've seen before we're now seeing um and you this is probably true for things things like open editions or like things with larger scale uh nft collection sizes right um where that that's more like a fan appreciation kind of use case and um I would say that that side of things so like you can approach this from two different angles that side of things I think the monetization is still yet to be figured out but there are there are models of this in outside of nfts that obviously yeah you can see this working for right but it has to reach a certain scale that that to Tiff's point where the IP has to be relevant and desirable enough that you can then apply these mechanisms to that IP otherwise it doesn't really work right you can you can mint open editions for bands musicians you know artists that you really care about and you could you could conceivably imagine yourself doing that but you probably wouldn't do that for some long tail thing that you don't actually really care about and that to me ultimately is like a it's like a small Niche Community thing that you really have a deep Affinity to or it's like some Big Brand IP that yeah you resonate with that brand right um so that spectrum and these are probably the extremes of the spectrum and this isn't this is um not taking into account like things like social and other experiments that are going on this is purely and sort of like that the minting and dropping of entities space but even in that Spectrum there's a lot of potential experimentation for monetization and uh we actually were trying to push for this um around the time that royalties were kind of going on on Solana like Q4 of last year we put up like a like a million dollars oh okay I thought you were gonna bring up not a shield but yeah no no no no let's let's uh that that word's not allowed in here man um but but we we put up the tackathon to basically incentivize creators to think about other ways to monetize Beyond royalties um and now that world he's a back on Solana like that's great we actually are really happy about that and I think that's actually like a really really strong just even if it may not be the most uh Revenue generating thing but the narrative is really strong around it and to to date we haven't seen a stronger narrative around monetization vanities and um so we're excited to to see basically this spectrum evolve and that that is like ultimately if I think about our creator business here at Magic Eden which so far has been very very you know on this end of the spectrum right like kind of the Launchpad model um it's obvious that that that extension has to has to happen and um yeah we're pretty pumped to be working on that I think that as you were as you were talking through that um that jumped out at me is uh Seth Smith she's the host of the a16z podcast and she's created a lot of content that's how she built a career she talks about like you don't actually create the content sell the content you create the content to create a platform to then sell on top of so like a super easy example of that would be you create free Tick Tock videos and then you sell course um and I could see that being with nfts it's not you don't necessarily monetize from that nfts themselves but you just like gather attention and then sell other things so [Music] everyone we get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech Roll-Ups account abstraction Mev app chains and more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blindspeed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show so talk about monetization and if you also mentions maybe the nft model that's kind of based on Cigar City right now you probably know what's coming next obviously compressed nfts on Solana have kind of changed this around from maybe a mindset of scarcity to a mindset of abundance um so having so just just for the audience who who don't who might not know what compress nfcs are first can you explain what compressed nfts are in two what I'm most interested in is how does magic Eden think about compressed nfts um you know with things like drip um kind of maybe turning nfts into content but even to things like helium which is turning nfts into like actual utility like they use it to represent their hot spots of which there's like 200 000 or 300 000 so just you know what is what is your guys's mental framework for compressed nfts in this new shift we're seeing yeah I can take a pass and then maybe Rex can give the more technical version of what I say too so the very like yeah it's a normal person I'd say minting creating nfts has costs and when you have uh cnfts as a new technology that allows you to Mint a significant number of nfts for uh significantly less cost and if we think about Solana as a chain and where its superpowers are um the ability to have lots and lots and lots of transactions due to low transactions fees High transaction um speed uh low transaction costs High transaction speed is the ability to actually power um use cases that use a lot of nfts so this is like very bullish for the ecosystem um where like in terms of cnnt's on Magic Eden it is something that we're working on on secondary so like collecting and trading cnfts that should be live around let's say like middle of September if not a little earlier and then in terms of us powering more primary or collect um you know minting experiences that should be uh hopefully the same month so sometime later in September um how do you translate the technology into a use case is something that we've been wrestling with for uh the last few weeks because if you pitch it as like oh here's this product and you can mint now lots and lots of nfts yeah why does like someone outside of crypto care right because and also when you're pitching creators and you say cnfts are like oh that's cool but like I don't know like my L2 on East also is like not that expensive or even if it's more expensive like that's fine like I can just eat that cost I want to stay on the other chain so I think for us it's not always it shouldn't be a narrative that's driven by the technology and it should be more of a narrative that's driven by the use case so um challenging nfts did not be about um you know speculative assets and more about you know collectible moments um and so yeah I have huge you know admiration and appreciation for what boo is doing I think it's great that there are other people who are like working with creators as a platforms that know how to work with creators there aren't actually that many on Solana and it's great to see like another player in the space um I think what magic Eden could bring to that conversation is like um a highly highly engaged set of users right that are very real and proven over time so magic Eden power 10 times the number of transactions that as openc in 2022 it was like over 280 million transactions and then also right we have like people who reoccurring like like come to Magic Kingdom our average session lengths are around 14 minutes which is one and a half times that of tick tock so imagine being able to power the idea of bringing more collectible moments that have more Mass Appeal as a Marketplace and then having really powerful Improvement distribution I think that is kind of a sweet spot where then creators can understand who is actually collecting my item like are are they real first of all and how passionate are they about me right this is like a problem that exists in web 2. you cannot distinguish who is watching your content versus who would actually spend money on your content like their willingness to pay you can't distinguish your fans from your super fans and because of what we bring to the table both in distribution as well as knowledge about our users I think that and then the ability to power that technology that that's where I think there are like really interesting things that magic eating can start to play with I don't know Rex if you want to explain anything the nfts I think cnft is uh it's a great enabler um because I think the superpower of Solana is uh like lightning speed of transaction speed and super super cheap transact of T however Solana is actually pretty expensive creating own chain bytes or own chain accounts um I'm not sure like before cnft I think um I'm not sure if the audience like familiar with the entity of Savannah yeah actually to create an nft you need to create a four or five accounts and each account is actually pretty expensive to code and code rent so you need to pay the rent fee so that your account don't get like recycled um so it actually turns out to be um like even for other like L2 chains on evm um their the cost of minting one nft sometimes usually is uh cheaper than occupying the paying the rent fee of creating NFP on Savannah I I fundamentally believe like um Solana Foundation actually want to fix this um I I only think there there may be two two options one option is maybe hey compress the four or five accounts into one account and but I'm really surprised that uh Jerry Xiao like take this step way further it's instead of compressing to One account it's compressing the whole collection into a Merkel route um and and I think that fundamentally changed the game uh it's not like it's not it's not like compressed for that's that's like on scale this is like this is like logins now it's it's it's way uh powerful uh to kind of like cheaply uh create a cnfts I think this is uh this is really yeah I have to admit this is uh this is a really good Innovation uh coming from Rex is it accurate at all to describe cnfts to people that are not technical as you have this metadata off chain um you then use cryptography to create almost a fingerprint of that data and put it on chain in a trust minimized way if you may have said this one thing that just jumped out at me is when you said people spend 14 minutes on average on Magic eating's website like if you've worked in product at all that's absolutely absurd um so I'm sure a part of that is people are just looking for communities and ft collections to see what they want to join right um so a big part of that's Discovery so I'm curious how you think about the future of like horizontal versus vertical marketplaces magic it in right now from what I know is largely just like it's one website people go to and it's almost like a uh aggregation model where you where you have all the nfts in one place and people can discover other ecosystems that's then you also have something like Shopify right where it's like all these different websites use Shopify but you don't actually even know that you're dealing with Shopify and versus Amazon where people go to Amazon and it's less about the actual products it's more about Amazon the reviews um how do you think about that and and maybe just to add on because I think that made it sound like the aggregation model was a bit negative you have something like YouTube that is an aggregation model it's like the second biggest surgeon engine right but one of the reasons they succeed is because they reward creators so well um so yeah how do you think about vertical and horizontal Marketplace and Discovery and then we have this other dimension which is like multiple chains so I don't know if you're like horizontal vertical and like some other 3D I don't know Justin do you want to take a stab at this one there's a lot to discuss yeah there's a lot um okay so so let me try and Tackle this in a couple of different pieces one is like uh let me describe what magic Eden is today as just the bass line and today magic Eden is basically I would consider ourselves more towards like the Amazon than the Shopify right but we're not totally Amazon either um and but we have this dimension of basically building on multiple chains and serving multiple ecosystems so you come to Magic Eden it should have all of the inventory from all of the chains uh all at your fingertips right and I think that has always been our sort of P0 thesis of what the marketplace at least should serve in the let's call it short to medium term and the reason I say that is because magic Eden and just the way that the nft ecosystem is developing um is that the reality is that there is content on all of these different places and it hasn't played out exactly how we thought it would in in the sense of we always thought that there'd be really really different forms of content on different chains so that hasn't exactly played out but it's true that there is different there is definitely content on all these different chains so whoever can basically make that the most frictionless experience um for a user to discover access not feel like it is a tribal and segmented kind of Market I think there's a massive opportunity there and what I think that thesis is becoming more and more true with um just the sudden rise not sudden but you know the the very recent rise of a lot of activity on on l2s now and so I think we can get into all of that as well um so that's part one part two I would say is that there is there's been a thesis around um uh verticalization of marketplaces for a while um there's been I think I've read various things in the past about like oh you know there's like a general model which is more horizontal which is what magic Eden is and open C is and all of us then there's more vertical which is like maybe I'll just surf gaming only or maybe I'll just serve music only and go extremely deep into those verticals and um I think that thesis probably will still play out to some degree over a longer time Horizon but that requires basically you kind of kind of think about the order of operations the order of operations is like there has to be some use case that forms creators have to come in and then the creators then launch a bunch of assets and then the assets dictate what needs what the needs are on the marketplace right and you see that with like I think there were some really gaining specific marketplaces that develop in 2021 uh that you needed like really rich off-chain statistical Discovery to determine what horses you wanted to buy for zedron right like that was like one of the things that was really important but that relies on creators the content basically making sure that that stuff is still relevant and and interesting for users but I think those those verticals are still just just so early right so that's why I think the verticalized thesis hasn't really played out yet but I think it I think it still could and probably will um we have also dabbled into the vertical eye space just through providing magic Eden um kind of in this like Shopify like to use your words like some Shopify model where games are using magic Eden's back-end infrastructure and using that to build their own uh White labeled marketplaces right so I think that for sure is still a use case um but that isn't the primary thing that magic Eaton cares about today the thing we are focused on is let's make sure we are present and available where all of the nft content uh is being created right Solana is a big part of that because probably there's there's no other there's there's no like Grassroots Community Australia Solana um I really believe that and um but it's true that there's a Content that lives everywhere and we're seeing different times and types of content form so we should be the place that people come to it should be really seamless you should not even know that this belongs here and this belongs there actually that mental model should just generally get expired over some amount of time hopefully and when it does I think hopefully people will say like wow magic even really did a great job there yeah so then to distill that into like yeah let me take Josh's big brain thoughts and make it cool I think the the very obvious near-term goal is just to diversify the types of content on Magic eating right um I I didn't I was gonna say improved but that's actually not fair to the current set of creators who like worked really hard right um yeah there needs to be in order for you to like really deeply invest into different categories um there needs to be like confidence that there are enough like creators in each of those categories that can make like a 10x like opportunity and I think everyone is kind of like I think everyone is kind of feeling around right now that's that's the vibe I see in the market it's like oh maybe I'll try like this thing and like people are trying to like see what is the next best product Market fit Beyond you know the the pfp collection uh and then more people are trying to use pfps that represent something different that are not purely community that are actually like dapps right like Mad Libs is a great example of that and that was the last project that like really you know um picked up a lot of Steam on Solana so um I think yeah first order of business is to try to get different types of content I'm as you get in and then that gives us the right to think about verticalizing um and then also we do have to find a way to make people from different chains okay with seeing different chained content so this is like a big piece of drama if you guys remember right at one point there was a point where you could see chain agnostic content and Magic 8-in but Solana specifically was like really upset about it and so then we changed things back so when you currently go on Magic Kingdom and you see Solana first right everything is prioritized for Solana but like it's kind of like we want people to be able to discover to discover projects across chains but we want to do in a way that doesn't offend users and that that's also the next like one of the near-term things that we're trying to focus on that doesn't Pro like we strongly believe we should help the user do the things that they want to do right we shouldn't be like pushing what magic Eden wants onto the user but we ultimately do believe in like a cross-chain world and a very very long run I'll give you guys one really concrete example just to crystallize the point um and and it and the reason I want to give you give you the example is because it's hard to imagine in this world of where it's like pfps and this kind of these kind of assets so imagine if someone wants to buy like a Pokemon card and I'm obviously making a logic leap that like these kinds of collectibles like physical Collectibles can be digitized into nfts over time which is already starting to happen right and it's already starting to happen on multiple chains right um there are many many of these sites and vaulting services that a whole basically like stack that's building for these kinds of things and as a user who wants to collect like the Charizard holographic from 1999 I actually don't want to know where it doesn't matter to me like where the thing it has been minted and so long as the thing is vaulted somewhere and I can trust it and I know that it's physically redeemable um I want to just be able to buy that thing and to the decision on like should I do it on this channel that chain or this chain like that should not be in the calculus and I think hopefully if we do our job well that's the kind of experience a user can have on magician it's they come here they look at the inventory they browse it they realize that's the thing that they've been looking for they buy it boom done I'm gonna I'm gonna push back on that okay just for a second so one one thing I would say is I think some some types of content and or nfts do make sense to abstract away for sure what one thing that I've seen in practice from the market at least is that some people don't feel safe storing highly valuable assets on for example some L2 versus ethereum security and so you know there there are some interesting chain specific considerations that pop up but I do want to take maybe a little second to do a little history lesson for the audience here um so magic Eden did start on Solana um during the early days of Solana actually this is before like or during the time of like Salon art and and 2021 summer essentially and you guys were by far the most dominant Marketplace um by a lot and then you made a decision to go multi-chain which at the time had mixed reactions from the community which is what you guys were just talking about and then some and I've seen some interesting stuff on Twitter about this and then kind of tensor came in and started maybe making it more competitive on Solana while you guys were also expanding multi-chain and so you've been through a lot of battles on multiple Frontiers right and then you have things like you know youths and D Gods going from Solana to polygon to ethereum and now you just going from polygon to ethereum and so there's a lot of shenanigans going on here which might confuse a lot of people so this is going to be a hard question but how do you just think about multi-chain in general like have you learned anything from these events right um and what do you think everybody kind of gets wrong about these like what does you know just just tell us your you know honest thoughts on this whole multi-chain Fiasco oh Fiasco yeah no no like um just uh like the community's reaction because like it's it's a very polarizing topic um so what do you have to like what would you say to the community and what would you say like hey like what the decisions that we made were right which like obviously it seems like it is um and and also I am curious because Z you said that Solana you think has the strongest Grassroots Community what are maybe some of like the strengths and weaknesses of like each of the communities you worked with so far wait before we we should dig into this I'm totally done to do it but can I actually ask you mer because you're a big Salon I'm actually but I I actually want to I know like do you ultimately believe in like a multi-chain future for nfts like do you believe that as a as a platform like users would want to see nfts across chains or are you maximal is to the degree where you're like I actually just want to see yeah one well listen there's a difference here I think everyone knows what you've your view like what you wish for but there's a there's a Viewpoint that's like what do you think is actually gonna happen right so maybe you should share both yeah I think it's a good question I'm probably my perspective is slightly different than a regular user because I have like this curse of knowing too much about the underlying details of the chains like for example I wouldn't feel comfortable putting like a you know a million dollar jpeg on some of these chains just because I'm kind of sketched out about the security I'd be fine with putting it on ethereum and Solana but maybe not in L2 just because I'm not sure what might happen at the same time there are other that's not the only type of nft right there's like just Collectibles for example or content right like music that stuff I'm probably fine with putting on l2s and like there are some certain types of nfts which I am completely fine with going multi-chain but then there are some for example cnfts as well which are like only possible on Solana and so it kind of gets weird and I don't really have a good answer for this and I'm not sure anybody does which is which is why it's such an interesting topic but also like um I'm curious just how you guys think so obviously like it seems like maybe you guys have more of an abstraction thesis where the underlying chain details will always be abstracted away and you'd like to offer an experience where the user doesn't even know right which is fair and I think a lot of people agree with that is that kind of would that be a fair assessment of how you guys approach this I think in the long run yes right but we're like pretty far away from that even at the wallet level right like you can't actually seamlessly transact on nfts uh we've only started to see multi-chain wallets like popular in the last year um but okay I hear how about this I'll take the past and then Josh and Rex it's two wise gentlemen will take the future so in terms of the past yeah uh happy to take like you know basically we decided to go multi-chain I think we expanded to what was it like three chains in the course of like four months or something like that um and this was I think we started going multi-chain around the same time that Solana was starting to have um its fair share of beatings especially with like Stix and a lot of stuff that that happened at that point so I think there was a fair amount of um Community backlash about like why is Magic eating going across chain and why like at this specific juncture in time that like compromise a lot of trust and and in the brand um I was happy to call his face paid I think also maybe us going to like adding that many chains at that level of velocity was kind of like yeah being like you know a very small country and trying to like invade China like and other countries at the same time so yeah there's definitely something to be said about um hey maybe we could have done this in a different way but in the case of and I'll say that for you know polygon ethereum right but in the case of ordinals I vehemently believe we did the right thing at the right time uh and Rex can speak actually Rex is the reason why we were so successful on ordinals he was the one who identified the opportunity and was like we should do this and um yeah we spun up a Marketplace in around a month right a month and a half I don't remember breasts can go into the details and because of that we were able to like ride you know the wave of ordinals and see and support all the success there and support all the creators there too so it's kind of like I think in retrospect the learnings were definitely that we could have um timed certain events better we could have built certain stocks more uh slowly and more comprehensively but there is something to be said around timing the market specifically for owners that we we don't regret and we're actually like really proud of um Rex today uh I think actually after chapter two I think this is a couple months ago uh the whole company a lot more actually most of the resource uh in Solana and uh we will have like way more products uh to be shipped really really soon I think the the I think I'm personally really excited about those things although I cannot say anything about that right now the the hype but um and I'm pretty pretty bullish about alsoever and and uh especially like the new protocols and new uh standards new use cases I mean it's a everyone knows it's a deep bear Market but it's also a really great time to build especially For Engineers uh they're just like not not a lot of distractions to to take a look and we just execute on our prologue map on Solana in terms of cross training um I personally it's just a decentralized station Maxi and um I honestly think what ordinal compared to Savannah like uh one key difference I think it's the own chain assets um I think there's a lot of room I think especially on even on Solana there must be a room for us to move more nft assets on train maybe the attributes could be on training the jpegs could be on train um right now it's just a pointer to somewhere that's not even on the Solana validators so um I think the the mindset I have is hey can we learn from all those Innovations friend tag on on base um the the social attack a lot of D5 Innovations from East um the own chain inscription ideas from oddness and it absorb all this like really crazy and Innovative idea going back and put it back to Salon I think I think imagine kind of in a really good position of doing that and we're exploring a lot of like uh sort of porting some of the great Technologies back to Savannah yes that's my thoughts one thing I'll say quickly is that the on-chain thing that Rex is mentioning nfts on Solana generally have a pointer to generally like our weave or ipfs I think that's what you're referring to um there are efforts to move that on chain just you know nobody um has done it so far but our efforts but um I think those are those are great answers I do want to get these thoughts so Z was one of the if people don't know it was one of the earliest employees at dydx on ethereum he was a PM at coinbase which is where I met him and he is the CEO of magic Eden so see you have a lot of uh good background and perspective on some of the stuff I think I think quite underrated actually what are your just general thoughts on going multi-chain as a company in crypto and you know what what's what are some of the things you've learned and what do you think you know makes so like there's the dragonfly thesis of like um you know each chain is maybe a country or a city do you agree with that like just how do you think about it first of all I love it when Matt hyps me up dude he's like hyping you up let's see he's like really important so you better give a really good answer yeah he's acting out waiting for the waiting for the draw um funny story though I meant Matt uh when we were when I when we were just starting magic eating and Merc was like one of the earliest nft just like Twitter guys that were just that was very very active on nft Twitter and on Solana too and I realized that he worked at coinbase and I was like holy like what are the odds I think probably two guys at coinbase that were even interested in Solana uh anyway um okay so there's kind of there's a lot to unpack so I don't wanna do a whole like Soliloquy on on this thing but let me try and unpack some of it one is that yeah from like a pure like Chain versus chain perspective I I kind of do buy the yeah I've heard many people say it um dragonfly as many kind of people who've posited that chains are like countries um and I think that that is quite true today because the level of focus um mind share that you need from both a technical but also a go to market perspective to go there and do a good job and be relevant and understand like The Innovation that's happening there it's hard and it takes it takes a lot of effort to make that happen and you that's why you see you know um chains or companies that have come to Solana to do things rarely have they been successful if they started on some other chain right that that's objectively true it's really hot because you're not going to get as deep as like ocp and cnfts and like you're just not going to follow that stuff because it's just so it's it's deep right but it but it's important stuff if you're building on Solana um okay then then what's the if that's true then like why did we go out and do that because to this point yeah it was like launching in France and Italy and Singapore and Thailand all at the same time right it really did feel like that uh and I can go through each of the chains because I think each each one had its own somewhat level of significance so polygon um we went there mainly actually for a lot of the gaming projects because I think a lot of people know imagine Eden is very you know we believe in gaming over the long term uh we have a whole team that's working on it and even in this market where gaming doesn't feel like it's the hottest thing compared to 21 we have a lot of conviction I spent a lot of time um talking to our gaming partners and understanding the things that they need because I think it it has the potential to really really be a big a big driver of nft activity um and polygon did a great job signing a lot of gaming IP right um both web 2 and web3 Native gaming IP and to dispel one thing about the polygon thing we launched it in December which obviously timing wise looked like we were just doing that because of FTX but we were working on that since like August um July of that same year it just a very unfortunate timing that we happened to launch that as a lot of things were unraveling with FTX so it wasn't a direct relation actually from a timing perspective we were always going to do it um and that I think shows one other thing about company building that I just want to call out company buildings hard because it's so multifaceted right you've got to like line up the strategy around like do we go on all these chains how do we do it you go to line up the go to market you're going to line up the tech make sure you have enough resources and then when you do it it's like what are the what's the narrative and the cost how do you convey that to your users the community everyone who follows crypto such that they understand the decision and especially in this market um or in this in this industry you want the community behind you and I think kindly we just didn't do a very good job of that that's actually where I think where we really really underperformed relative to at least my expectation from just a pure company building perspective but what I do in defensive marketing at the time I actually do not know if it would have been possible to get to Garner excitement yes it's very hot very very hot with our existing audience but yes please go ahead Tiff is amazing and yes this is not a dig let it be known this was not a dig it too a lot of digs on the show yeah yeah um but would we have gone and done BD and partnered with all those gaming projects on polygon would I do that again yes 100 because I believe now we are set up for the next couple years as the really really high quality games continue to build out over the next two three four years right like one example we worked with wild card who we are really really bullish on as as a team they were on polygon and to work with them we had to be there right as much as we wanted them to come to Solana and do some stuff on Salata it wasn't possible so we had to go there um ordinals we already talked about so I think we don't have to get too deep there but I think there's insane levels of like really interesting collectibility mechanics and on-chain activity that I think is just really cool and like the average value of items being traded or bought and sold is is like five to ten X greater than the value we see on um Solana polygon and then sometimes even higher than ethereum right so it's just the properties that are really interesting and um we're doing this like Bugatti egg mint yeah in a couple of days that's that's just interesting you know we're not seeing that anywhere else right but that's that's cool um and if I think it's just you know I came I grew up in crypto through ethereum um back when D5 wasn't a term and back when um there were probably four or five protocols working on financial use cases dydx was was one of them um and I I still believe that there is a gravity of weight when it comes to liquidity and some levels of innovation that still originate on ethereum that that that's just the reality so there is some level of like um yeah there's some gravitational pull there right regardless and and obviously the there's a lot of creators there as well so at some point I think to be relevant with nfts over the at least the shorter medium fan there is a lot of activity on Ethan uh same with some of the l2s um you know disregarding uh yeah I take some of the points like there's a lot of trade-offs around things including security and things but um just from our perspective as a platform that supports nft assets it's almost like we're agnostic to what the assets are we just want to make sure that the inventory the discovery the the point of sale is all really really easy and really really seamless so pure business decision I think um yeah that's like a crucial priority for us that's really good what what the is said um but I also think if you compare uh blockchains as countries I think there's a like look outside the earth look into the Galaxy there's a billions of planets and those aliens those those people who don't believe in crypto don't believe in nft they're attacking us they are they are they're fighting they're fighting crypto all the time they're fighting nfts all the time nfts that crypto is dead I'm just thinking we should not fight each other we should learn from each other and and and and there's enemy out there there's a lot of mass adoption opportunities out there I think we should own the important helping them to understand us uh I think this is kind of like yeah I I the moment chosen mentioned about blockchains like countries I I'm just thinking oh there's there's a whole universe of like audience that we we haven't even tell them what nft is what what crypto is and there's a whole lot of opportunities out there yeah I feel like Rex is like our personal Neil deGrasse Tyson wait I actually did want to ask it's a follow-up right so mert was saying Hey do you believe in like the abstraction like thesis what is our like media shorter to medium term approach of yeah cross-chain awareness and is is that something that Magic Kingdom seeks to do which is like introducing people to different chains how would you guys respond um yeah there's a couple of key things one is um are you talking about like product level things Tiff I guess yeah um so one I think it all starts around there's the obvious one which is like Discovery right and it's very segregated discovery even I would even say even before we even get to Magic Eden just in general it's like extremely segregated Discovery so one I think that's really important two is I think the um and this is I get it's getting better with time which is the ability to purchase transact um without needing just the wallet plus like downloading a brand new wallet plus going to an exchange and setting it up that whole Pro like there's a lot of shenanigans process there that it's it's just getting a lot better and a lot of these native behaviors um I believe should happen on Magic Eden or can happen on Magic in and then the the last one I think is around um like the profile experience right when you are coming to check out your items your inventory all these things yeah it should feel just like the stuff that you own it should not be like I have to click these things and then then look at my things I have on Solana then look at the things that it it shouldn't feel like that it should feel like here are the things that I've just collected and um yeah most of that is then yeah pretty well abstracted um and then once you have those building blocks I think you can start to really introduce users to new like new content that exists on the chains and maybe the the thing we did wrong was actually we tried to do that a little bit too early right when some of this infra some of the stuff that we feel like is quite possible in the near town was actually not really that possible so it was basically just like a front-end representation of the segregation that already exists today right and we just magnified that maybe that was the case I don't know I need to reflect on that a little bit more but I think that is basically the direction when we talk about some of this abstraction work um and it's really important for us like some of the key stuff advera's profile collection page home page the end to end sort of like getting the user to their first nft and then getting them to discover the other types that I think is a really really important Journey that we have to uh continue to nail down see you're on a podcast with bank list it was you stani and Frank from tea guides and this is when you were talking about going to polygon supporting polygon and we're talking about D guides going to ethereum and Utes going to polygon and at the time Utes and D guides were making up I think like 60 of the the volume on in salon nfts and that's one reason Frank said that they're going to essentially like expand into the bigger audience um Zed I'm curious like everyone in that group is talking about how there was this like symbiotic nature of brands on polygon and how that like elevated individual Brands within that ecosystem themselves because you had like Nike Starbucks these other companies all in one place um and that would benefit other nft brands I'm curious now that you see Utes going to ethereum um it's clearly probably because of liquidity do you still believe in that that thesis and on that you also mentioned that you thought nfts migrating to other like l1s or l2s is something that you expect to be to see more often do you still think those two views um okay on point number one on both of those things I still think that it's um it's a thing that is possible on on number one the brand point let me talk about why I think that hasn't been realized yet because I think that might be interesting to illuminate um and I've said this yeah to many people like including the a lot of people in the polygon ecosystem a lot of these Brands built in very uh siled walled Gardens right if you look at actually the examples that you mentioned even Starbucks Nike they actually built those in Walled Gardens on polygon so it wasn't like an open you know it wasn't tradable really on open marketplaces um the community was pretty isolated so the users that then you know bought those or minted those nfts the same is true for Reddit for what it's worth um which generated a lot of wallet addresses for polygon those users didn't they never really came into their ecosystem truly right they came in did their thing and then they never really came back again so there's the thing that has been missing I think on polygon has been this concept of like what is what is the home of nfts there what do these users how do these users then come back to do something else right rather than just attach themselves to the walled Gardens uh that's like I I don't have the answer to that but that that I think is just an unsolved problem and maybe it's also like a yeah unclear if that was the best way to bootstrap an ecosystem I think it's one way it could still work but uh thus far I think it hasn't generated that flywheel that that people had hoped but I think it's possible and um I don't know we talk about this a lot in gaming as well it's like all you need if you have one game with like a ton of users man that in and of itself is just going to be massive so I don't want to dispel that you know that um that potential way of growing because it yeah I feel like once we see one then we're gonna be like oh maybe that is possible uh okay then point number two um um which is sorry what was number two it was like liquidity or something yeah number two is talking about how youths went from Solana to polygon and now they're going from polygon to ethereum yeah and you talked about at the time you said you think this will actually become more like normal you'll see this more often yes um do you still think that's the case after seeing not necessarily a failure but you know the polygon thing obviously didn't work out for you yes yes um I don't think it's for everyone but I do feel like if creators are trying to achieve different things um they will still try things on different chains and I mean a lot actually a good number about Bitcoin ordinals creators a good number of them came from Solana actually uh so there's something to be said about that and they launched you know rarer items rarer collections higher priced all that kind of stuff on bitcoin um and I think with things like layer zero where they're making a lot easier through like they have this thing called o nfts that allow the nfts to then be able to be bridged much easier much more easily over time with infrastructure like that like starting at the right at the beginning of when you are conceiving of your collection that kind of Technology also makes it easier for these use cases to happen so I don't want to necessarily put yeah uh put this in sort of the Creator's mouth so to speak but um I I do feel like it is something that people will want to experiment with still and uh we still continue to see it happen whether it's like successful in and of itself just by doing it I actually don't think that's true same thing of what I said about us going to other chains that applies for creators too you've got to be relevant you've got to be native you've got to understand what is the discourse in that community that all still applies so just the technical part of getting there that actually is like the easy part so um if creators can are able to and want to think about that roadmap then I think they can still be successful doing that yeah I can't my my take is like very simple which is um it just because there are brands on a chain does that influence or impact funnel down to individual projects no just just know that there's that's not necessarily like if a then B like at all partially due to the wall guard and stuff but also just yeah maybe assuming that linkage was there was maybe not correct but I do think there's something a very very strong argument for do creators tend to create vortexes around a certain ecosystem yes and we've definitely seen that with gaming and other use cases where it's like the leading indicator or reason for like a project or a brand to choose one ecosystem is that other projects are in that ecosystem and so I do believe there is that kind of a flywheel that does exist at a prime level all right so before we do rapid fire I do want to take a second and just for the salon audience who might be watching this I would say like magician is one of the only teams I've seen that has actually been successful in going multi-chain so I think you guys deserve a lot of props for that I mean I know open C tried to come to Solana it didn't really work very well if I'm being honest um and I mean you guys have succeeded on multiple chains so a lot of um you know that takes a lot of hard work so Props props there um and and you guys have actually really helped us on a nft scene grow during the early days and even now I mean you just said you know the Bitcoin ordinal stuff so um I would say you guys have probably gotten an unfair rep uh which which I disagree with so you know just just wanna just wanna say take this last second to say thanks on behalf of all the community now let's get spicy soil now I'm going to do rapid fire um the order of these will be Tiff Z and then Rex and then try to keep them short but you know if you want to ship always go ahead um all right thoughts on friendtech oh super bullish Iraqis I think can take the stage on this one um I think it's uh it's the idea being tried many times and looks like this this time is the most promising one bullish on my side too but I wish wish there's uh there could be a Solana version yeah happy to see more competitors jumping to well like similar friend tag tag well talk about competition um what are your thoughts on competition I don't lie awake thinking about market share on Solana because I think the market is to the point where like we need to figure out how to grow the market and bring more creators in and yeah okay 40 50 60 market share like I don't know um it's just not not something a lot of way thinking about yeah I actually I think about um Tam of this Market more than I think about competition because just think things like friend Tech illuminate that massively you know it's kind of like step changes in Innovation or a use case that suddenly gets a lot of people excited and brings people in um I think that is more important to think about I think competition from like a pure nft Marketplace perspective there's a lot of energy marketplaces um I think for magic Eden if I if I were to describe where we need to be it is when people think about nfts whether it's the actual word nfts or just the form factor in which they get popular they should think about magic Eden that to me is the success case over the long term uh I think we we should probably be leaning more what customers want uh instead of what competitors is doing if customers want really smooth trade experience let's improved dramatic improve of the training experience if if customers want better Rewards program let's build a better Rewards program for for our users okay [Laughter] first aliens now now the token airdrop hey I got my last one that I Gotta Throw in here okay so we're talking about competition um you see tensor go from two percent market share in February they have a point system or loot box uh that goes live starting in February now they're all the way up to like 45 market share are you bullish or bearish I know this is nuanced question but it's fire around are you bearish um these incentivization programs during this type of bear Market I can go first I think all the incentivization programs today have been incredibly mercenary and only reward one side of the market and what we want to do is flip the table and reward all sides of the market so pretty excited to bring something new to the table that doesn't yeah it's not just it's something that I could actually like bring your users into the space too oh Alpha yeah I think rewards can be more magical make nft magic again I don't know we're gonna make a soundboard Direct all right um your favorite app in crypto that's not nfts or friendtech foreign flowers I think it's cool what they've built um appreciate it oh shoot not nfts yes wait can you repeat a question here coinbase because the power seamless transactions dude all I do is add up these yeah uh the question Rex's favorite app that's not Crypt uh friendtech or nfts okay Z I'll tell you the one I used the most um I use unisop and dydx the most outside of nfts but they're not really like consumer brand I mean I'm I had to show the idea actually used to work there but they're not like consumer brands that I love you know what I mean because it's kind of not like that I don't know if there is one I can't think of one that that invokes me in that way but those are the two that I use the most outside of entities uh for me for especially for Solana audience I I would definitely say anchor as attack it's uh it's uh it's like it's like uh how do I it describe it it's like it's like the 2.0 of how you write like lost smart Contracting Salon it's casually two I think two years ago image just enables like the the bull market for for someone it's just like a influx of developers just being enabled by by the anchor tools developed by Armani I think that's uh that's a really cool attack your three favorite nft collections Collective oh I have two I'm trying to think of the third one it's okay you can take time Merritt always asks like top three that's hard that's hard okay cool I'll I'll say um oh I Gotta Give Igor a shout out so yeah Bitcoin Bandits OG I just feel like it's just a really Pleasant community that isn't trying to flip every other day um I think Lily is really cool I think bundle is one of the few builders in this space who's actually trying to create like a real Community that's easy and accessible and isn't he's not purposefully trying to be esoteric um and then the third I I actually think Google's are really cool I think George is really cool um like just kind of the same Vibe of actually trying to bring more culture to Solana which I think we we would benefit from so they're trying to do a lot of stuff around merge and brand building that I think is is different than what's in the space I was gonna say Boogle as well that was my number one not that I have one I didn't have one but George if you're listening I could really use a hand up yeah um two ordinal Maxi Biz uh ZK you know yeah he's been doing so much on Seoul on on bitcoin even from the early days I just think yeah that guy is just a machine um I have a soft spot for some of the really OG Solana collections as well um some of these I I own some of these I don't own anymore but you know if I think back to like September 21 it's you know it's DJ and Abe's it's a lot of Monkey Business it's Thug Birds I just have like a real nostalgic soft spot for when people used to go on spaces and just go like this was this magical time I like something about it uh I yearned for yeah  uh uh for for me I I actually own a lot of these trade a lot uh but I really want to highlight some of the builders behind those collections uh Fox is one of them uh malas of course um and uh and also uh Bitcoin Band-Aids OMB um yeah these are the the on top of my mind and locksmith Labs we should give them their flowers like they've built incredible tooling um yeah I think they're one of the best builders in space how do you explain what you do to your parents dude I think my parents think they're working on an art gallery like um my dad knows about nfts and asked about openc and I was like no I don't work there um my mom was like oh we have money that you can invest you want to take do you want to take some of my my money I was like no don't let me play with the family money on jpegs um yeah I think they yeah something about nfts and art is their extensive knowledge yeah I've stopped trying to I mean like I couldn't explain to them dydx at the time I couldn't I mean coinbase is somewhat explainable and then when I just said I was leaving coinbase to do something else more risky in crypto they couldn't really accept that so I just at this point it I sort of leave it as people collect some stuff online and then we let people do that that's not uh back to the favorite collection by the way I also have to give flowers to asset Dash they are also building something very real um I think like the first the most like um real event loyalty program and they're really experimental too especially with cnft so I think they're really cool Rex what do your parents think you do uh it's very hard to explain to them but once uh once they got hey this is some digital art digital ownership thing uh they started at it but it's also kind of crazy like they always the news about magic that seems like the the bad ones like broadcasted the most so sometimes they uh when we when we chat it's just worry about that I think yeah kind of normal eye all right two more um one is what is your most unpopular opinion in crypto I think the I think most people are not gonna mess with a non-custodial wallet like I love Phantom there are boys but like yeah until that's easier I can't possibly get my friends to even buy an entity I think that's a huge hurdle I don't know if this is unpopular or just I don't know uh I'll I'll just say it I think um we haven't seen the last of royalties by any means like there's gonna be just more drama more to happen but I do I actually think they're a critical part of um what makes the entity narrative really viable um for me web 3 is easier than web 2. another sound bite hold on can you like give one more sentence of why why'd you say that uh I I think it's like the the infrastructure logins wallet ecosystem is just like so convenient available versus compared to web 2 uh it's very recommended there's Web Two Giants you need to fight in web 3 is much easier to get started all right I'm going to do something different I'm going to personalize this last one for each each person on the panel Tiff you talked about how you want to be a writer and you went right before you were also formerly or maybe you still are head of marketing as well as Solana what is one writing tip and one marketing tip that you would give two people listen oh show don't tell so um like explain how something is cool or prove how something is cool rather than telling people it's cool all right z um you are a great product mind I'm going to I'm going to Hype you up a little bit again um what is One Piece um of advice you would have for people doing product product managers CEOs founders um don't forget to talk to your users that very easy to just gloss over that um but that ultimately actually is the is the most important thing even at a huge scale you know at coinbase even I mean my job was very different there as a PM I was trying to serve we're trying to get hedge funds to buy Bitcoin this is in 2021 right with like microstrategy and you know Tesla all these things um but same thing uh even at that scale we were trying to talk with the biggest hedge funds in the world just to understand in my new detail how they could get onboarded and the same is true in whatever context so never never yeah never under investor yeah very easy to underestimate that Rex I'm gonna ask you a first question before mert does what do you think of product managers do you think that they're extremely useful in like putting out requirements talking to users or do you think they just do tick tocks and like sit in the pool and you know write a sign of cards kind of PM's work but but but like PM's actually needs to think a lot of things uh so it's a lot of hard work that I think our PMS in this company I mean Joseph and Jack is basically are doing a lot of PM work since the beginning of my Jaden uh and yeah I think I mean they they're the best PMS I've ever seen and I learned just so many things from from these two guys it's very PC thank you no sound right there um well Rex what is one piece of advice you'd give to web tool developers looking to break into web 3 and also what are what is one piece of advice you would give to existing blockchain engineers uh I think number doing uh just don't be afraid to get started I mean there's so many so many tools out there so many information out there spend your time to get something going ships join hackathons um there I know there's one going on only possible in Savannah yeah try try that to see how you can build something uh and as I mentioned like what web3 is actually easier than web to um you the the the space is spoiler which means you you can the information flow is like much more efficient like go on Twitter join the communities full of merch so you get a lot of offers from Savannah and I know just yeah learn by doing yeah yeah I think that's that's the fastest guess of it so right that was really great Rex sad Tiff thanks so much for
