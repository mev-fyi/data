there's going to be a lot of next-gen blockchains that can compete with Solana from a technical perspective but you're never going to see any L1 launch at the same valuation that Solana launched at just because of how well slanted it in public markets VCS are not going to let that happen and people had time to essentially get into the community at those low price levels and that Community aspect is one of the most important pieces of building out a L1 blockchain this episode is brought to you by Geno Judo is the easiest way to start earning Meb Awards on Solana through liquid safety get your soul stake it with Judo and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token Judo Soul get started today at Judo dot Network [Music] what's up everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we are joined by ansem if you don't know ansem he's one of the top traders in the space he's also huge on Twitter he likes to [ __ ] post but he also has a lot of Alpha and really clear and concise tweets so Anson thanks for joining yo what's good guys thanks for having me on yeah man pumped to have you here I uh I I actually two years ago I wrote down the top 10 people in the space based on like the takes that they were getting out and uh just yesterday we interviewed Kyle samani and he was on there and then Anthem you were also in there so uh I'm pumped to have you on I think one thing people don't know about you is maybe they see your Twitter post um a lot of your [ __ ] posting but they probably or maybe haven't read your articles and you're a very clear thinker and I'd love to touch on what you I think this blog was from March 2022 and you started it by saying one of the favorite phrases that you took out of the pandemic was terminally online and I want to know like what that phrase means to you and why it's relevant to crypto and like where the space is headed yeah I can talk about that a bit um so I like as a kid I was a big gamer I was always online um so I played a ton of World of Warcraft I played League of Legends uh like the backyard football games all that I played on the computer actually played with my dad a time um like I was I was the kid who would get my work done and then stay on the computer until like 2 3 A.M and just be gaming um but it's like recently that trend of being online has converted into making a ton of money not just in crypto but also in like streaming like gaming um like Esports all of that and I think during covid you kind of saw that accelerate a ton um and then people were just home all the time and trying to figure out okay I'm not making as much money as I want to at my regular job how can I make money online and there's a ton of people that are online I think more and more and more and Theo talks about it I think a good way like very very eloquently he's like the metaverse um is not strictly like games and video games but just people being online and being in that online State having their own online Persona that's different from what they have in real life um and in crypto if you do that in the right way you can convert that into actual Capital if you are able to follow like the trends of attention and where people are looking um just like narratives and crypto as well as like this space and just how it's moving um so it's kind of like generally what it means for me um I've been online all the time and then obviously pretty much converted into being in crypto more and more people are spending more time online uh one of the use cases for like nfts is people want to own more online because they're spending more time online they're having their networks online Etc and I think um yeah what you what you've written about and who you are really represents that um one of the things you said you used to play a lot were games and I know in your writings you talked about D5 kingdoms a lot what is it that Drew you to D5 kingdoms and and crypto gaming and why you thought it was so unique uh well for me trading crypto is essentially a video game in itself um on its own this is a video game that you can make money on but D5 kanans was the first application that I saw I've been bridging to basically every every new chain that dropped the D5 um incentive program I was averaged avax that bridge uh what Harmony Phantom like all those different places had dexes where you would do the yield farming I know you guys know that the decks you look for the dog coin you look for whatever the borrow lending um coin that was like the early Playbook Center for people who are doing stuff on chain in 2021 um and then D5 kingdoms was the first application that I saw on crypto I was like oh this is not just a DEX it's also a game has decent Graphics it has a soundtrack behind it and it has all these pretty well thought out mechanisms on how they want to design their game um like in the long term in the future and when I saw all the different classes or it's like you can be a I don't know what it was you can be like Mage Warrior or whatever um all the different classes I was like oh this is like World of Warcraft I can use these as nfts and I can level them up in game by doing stuff that I'm doing already um whereas on the dexes where you were just liquidity um like the kitty mining um you're getting tokens but you weren't really leveling up a character in any any way shape or form um so that was like my main draw on dfks I got I've done this in World of Warcraft I've grinding up gold grinded up my my theory crafting whatever mining um abilities in those games I can do this in crypto but now there's like also like tangible uh money monetary value attached to it whereas if you're trying to sell your gold in World of Warcraft you have to sell to somebody through PayPal or some other uh like sell your account that way um and I don't think crypto has done it yet but I do think it's a great opportunity there where if you have um the correct game design and the correct incentive structure um you can create a fun game that also people have ownership and be able to profit off of playing the game so it's different it's difficult to find that balance um and dfk kind of what happened with dfk is it grew way too fast way too quickly it's difficult to build out all the features in the game that they wanted to do in a couple months but people's attention just blew up on it went to like multi-billion dollar market cap um you have to look at the game now they've implemented a ton of stuff that they wanted to earlier like a year ago um but it has down like what 90 98 99 uh but if you go play the game there's like a lot of the stuff that I was looking at and expecting them to do um they actually finished and have done but that was like my main draw towards the UK so you said something pretty interesting there that you basically think of maybe crypto trading or whatnot it's kind of like a real life video game um and I know you have some good takes on like people commenting on the speculative assets or aspect of crypto is this aspect a future or a bug like what are your thoughts on this and why I think it's definitely a feature so I it's like it's good and bad I would say that it's good because the reason crypto's been able to stay along stay around so long is that the people who are early to these networks um have that they have such a strong attachment because they were able to profit off these networks growing like the early bitcoiners who bought it at like whatever under a dollar under ten dollars back in 2012 2013 they're Die Hard bitcoiners forever um and it's kind of like almost a religion in that aspect but they have really core you need that core group of people who really know like why Bitcoin is important why the network has value because those are people who are putting Bottoms in um during bear markets when sentiment public sentiment is low and stuff is down eighty percent um those are people who still have that vision of like what Bitcoin is why is important and the ethereum community is the same way um but like that that aspect of being able to profit off these networks in a way from very early stages is only something that only exists in crypto whereas when you have stocks you're buying somebody's a thousand X immediately um when it gets listed on public exchange like the NASDAQ or the S P whatever and that happens a bit more now because the space is more popularized and there's more VC involvement but there's still that aspect of if you're early to things in crypto you're gonna get much more benefit than you would in other um and like other asset classes but then I'll say the the bad part of that is you you also attract a ton of Bad actors because crypto is so early as an asset class you can make a ton of money um of people who are purely looking for that speculative oh I can make money off this really quickly so you could also attract Bad actors in that way so it was like a that's a duality toy you have the people who are building because they understand why crypto is important and the fundamental value of these uh decentralized networks um you know being able to exchange value without any third party build like whatever applications you want on chain immediately um and then you have the people are just really trying to make money so it's it's a it's a duality but both they will always um like need to exist I think hey everyone quick break to tell you about Gino Gino's the number one liquid staking provider in Salon Gino's been known for the Meb software and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the salon ecosystem Solana D5 summer is heating up and what asset do you want to use in D5 liquid safety tokens why because Vegito you can take your soul stake it and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token cheetosol you can then use Judo solo throughout the salon and Depot ecosystem while earning yields through Mev rewards and staking rewards with Cheeto and Judo makes staking super simple you can take your soul stake it get instant liquidity and start earning rewards all within three clicks and not only do they make it simple they make it secure Cheeto has seven audits they have more than a million Souls stayed and they're one of the most respected teams in all of D5 Geo is for whales who need deep liquidity it's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid staking you have your soul why not sake it earn some meal so go get started eh check them out at Judo dot Network slash taking that's Judo dot Network slash taking I'll put a link in the show notes use the link so they know that I sent you and go get started today [Music] everyone we'll get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech roll up so count extraction Mev app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blindspeed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show so while we're on the topic of D5 I know you're always on the hunt um what what are you most excited about in D5 right now uh definitely Solana D5 I think Solana D5 is definitely the biggest opportunity for people um you have these D5 coins on each like uni uniswap um like Ave maker a ton of coins who have done really well and they emerged out of the last bear Market um or there wasn't really any D5 existing at the time and they're these are all like multi-billion market cap coins and Solana D5 hasn't had that that emergence yet so the first cycle for Solana was basically just the token like soul went parabolic but all the early apps on Solana were not um like essentially no nobody wants a lot of made money off any of the early Depot apps like oxy didn't do well Maps didn't do well uh like but serum was like didn't do all that great underperformed soul for most of the time um and I think that's just like it's because it takes a while to build up the developer ecosystem and also like the social community on a chain and I think Solana's done that over the past couple of years but now you have a ton of really strong D5 teams that don't have tokens and they're like launching their incentive programs to try and get users on their platforms and I think they've seen pretty significant growth over the past couple of months and it's also at a period where public sentiment on Salon is super low so if you have that like Divergence of you actually are seeing um like New Growth but the public sentiment is not matching it that's opportunity for you as a Trader um to benefit off of whereas stuff like ZK sync um everybody's like on pharmacies Inc like that's like a very common thing I saw I saw the air job I got with arbitrum I'm gonna farm this so there's a ton of people like spinning up a ton of accounts farming ZK sync whereas what's up like margin five drift I want to say drift had 20 like 2500 users past month um that was up from like a thousand something a month before and margin five I want to say it's around five thousand uh so you're just your competition is a lot much smaller um if you're looking for Alpha there so it's like you will probably get an outsized portion of whatever airdropper or whatever they do in the future if you um are early to that you mentioned margin pie I love mcbrennan um and his tweets and I know you've talked about this he says if you think Solana is stuck as a low TBL chain you're probably you're probably a [ __ ] yeah yeah I like the modified guys because they're like they're one of the more aggro teams in the ecosystem they're not afraid to say like to talk back to people uh so I like them they're funny but he's right though he's right yeah he goes into you know the Tweet thread which we don't need to go into it too much but he talks about TV out of value stakes and on the East had 60 on Soul it's three percent um and you know so right now as TDL I think it's about 320 million or 300 million today and um but if it gets like if that ratio goes from three percent to 30 which is half of eth then that tvl jumps at 3 billion so I don't know how great that math is but um I think the other thing interesting about Salon is they talk about D5 2.0 a lot which is a lot of these projects don't have tokens um which you talked about and they're doing these like points programs I don't know what I think about D5 2.0 because that reminds me of like Olympus dial and Tok Mac that didn't didn't really work out but um what what is your like overall Solana thesis because I think you started trading Solana back in 2021 and then I don't know when you got back into it I think maybe like December when FTX was falling apart part of me was like I saw an answer on Twitter being like jumping on the Solana train I was like always just looking for a new ecosystem to be like the influencer of it but but at the same time you talk about how obvious of a trade it was and like you were just making a really smart move so I'd love to hear your thoughts on it yeah so my original Salon of thesis back in like early 2021 um I missed most of D5 summer like I came in D5 summer late um but I saw what happened with B5 summer and I thought was was there when Gatsby started spiking on Eve um and it was actually Jeremy pointed me to towards salon and Sarah um originally uh but but yeah I was looking at someone I was like well if there's another um like L1 that can do what ethereum is doing but cheaper faster that's a pretty simple thesis and BNB was like a similar similar thesis um so at that point it wasn't nearly proven out yet at all um it was more of like the idea behind oh this guy svf is supporting this is a cheaper and faster chain like looked into Anatoly and read through his his podcast his interviews and like his background and where he came where he came from um and it seemed like a pretty uh like a good hedge against Eve um if you are also betting on the bull market continuing while you're also expecting risk to go down the risk curve people to bet on other all coins um so if you can do Solano or people can't do defy on each they're going to do D5 on these other chains that was the original idea um and then through 2021 2022 that's like two years of growth in the Solana ecosystem and I've seen sng everything evolved there basically front and center um so I feel like I've been exposed to the ecosystem for a while I saw what happened the issues with digestion um on the Chain like when they were getting the spam um from nft mints and they were essentially no fees so people were just oh I'm gonna spam Spanish I've never held a bot and it would break the chain um but I think what people Miss is a lot of the upgrades that happened uh during mid 2022 on Solana that kind of made these congestion issues not as much of a problem um before and so I was aware of that and then I also was aware of the public sentiment and then also you have the FTX blow up which crashed price 80 from the highs I was in Lisbon um in late 2022 talking with all the teams there and nobody was talking about SDF at all like people were excited about Solana people were excited about moving forward the ecosystem I think it was trading around 30 37 38 um and then we get on a plane to go back to the States and like it was like literally the FDX stuff happened um so it was a combination of price being I think down further than it should be I think it should be around like 40 if that MTX um thing didn't happen then you have like the technical upgrades on the Chain so it's trading at the same price as it was in early 21 but doesn't have any of the issues that it had um during that same time period and then you have probably 100x more um just like social Community developer Community like active D5 teams in the ecosystem um all that happening at the same time and I I tweeted it like a couple months before I was like I think I'm about to be a soul Max again soon I just like have a have a feel for what I think it's about to be time because it had been trading pretty much sideways a few months still like six seven months I weighs um and it's like 20 to 25 area range but like eventually this is going to get repriced higher just because it's it doesn't make sense that they have the second like what second most active users one of the most active developer communities um and just in my opinion a better ux than all the other l1s um on the market and it's trading at like whatever five percent of ethereums market cap I was like that's way too low um and also thought okay we're at the beginning of a bull market so this stuff is going to bottom eventually so it's a pretty good bet to make um see I was I wasn't trying to just be the the influencer so but I thought of a pretty good pretty good uh pieces but yeah you actually remember the nft botting spam problems and congestion due to low fees um but then you said like a lot of people are missing that actually it's actually fixed so that's actually something I want to talk more about like Solana did have a lot of improvements since those days but the narrative hasn't necessarily upgraded why do you think people have such outdated Notions about Solana still well I think it's it's two-part so you have the community in crypto that doesn't read anything which is like the average person they're just not going to read white paper it's not going to read the developer updates if I tell you go look at patch 1.14 on Solana they're gonna be like no I'm not doing that um so you have those average people and those people will only listen to the people they think are smarter than them on Twitter or like on podcasts or like on whatever else in crypto so that's like one group of people that just will not do the work to read and then you have the other group of people in crypto who are very dedicated to what their bags are and like where their money lies so there's really no reason for them to talk about I'm going to draw attention to what Solana upgrades are because that takes away from my work and what I'm doing and where like my like where my money is essentially um so I think it's twofold it's like the people who don't want to talk about sauna even though they know what's going on there and then the people just have no idea yeah and it was actually three pieces I think then and it's just like a marketing thing um like ethereum does an amazing job with marketing all of their like technical achievement technical upgrades they do a really good job of that they have a good um Community that's super supportive of them and all their developers um like e 2.0 and they upgraded to prove a mistake that was like a huge huge achievement which it was but I think that Sultana should have had a similar Soul 2.0 type of movement and push and marketing push when they released like the isolated feed markets quick and like what is it the stake weighted quality of service um it's like when they released those three things that should be like this is Salon 2.0 we're not going to have the issues that we had before with all the congestion and then point to literally look at this month over month we had four outages in the past four months the past nine months we have won so it's like we that should be a clear draw um that should have been pushed I think super hard um it's yeah it's like it's threefold but yeah people people in crypto I'm not gonna say people in crypto don't wanna like the average person in crypto who who doesn't know what's on about crypto they just don't have the time to research everything on their own so if they're not given that information then it's hard for people to know about it yeah I think one thing we all like about Solana is like the isolated feed markets optimizing hardware and software um obviously not only Solana can do that um maybe they're the only ones that have done it today that you have sweet Aptos and other chains that are working on it I've heard you talk about Solana's moat which is probably their community and a lot of that has to do with when it actually came out in March 2020. um I'm curious if you can like expound on that yeah so I think um I do agree there's going to be a lot of nitrogen blockchains that can compete with Solana from a technical perspective perspective um that backspace is going to get a lot more competitive in the future but you're never going to see any L1 launch at the same value uh valuation that's a lot of launched at just because of how well slime it did in public markets VCS are not going to let that happen uh so like you're never going to see an L1 with like whatever 300 million dollar Vow where it was and people had time to essentially get into the community at those low price levels which is why I think even though Salon is still down 90 or you have a really really strong community of people that are invested in the ecosystem very strong developer Community um and that Community aspect is one of the most important pieces of building out of L1 um blockchain in my opinion so teams like Suite Aptos I think monad's another good one say um they're gonna have to do a lot of late work on that that part as far as building out community building out their developer Community um just getting people excited about their ecosystem so a lot of salana has like a two-year um Head Start in my opinion on that front um and then as you said like the technical piece they can also also have that Advantage currently but that's something that's easier to catch up on I think so while we're on the topic of you know different l1s and these different kind of chains there's obviously a lot of other chains right there's kind of Cosmos option thesis there's the l2s and modularity which I know you've talked about optimism before and you know arbitrim there's now Bass with with uh some interesting Shenanigans going on there um and so it's super confusing for somebody just entering the space probably right like there's a lot of stuff what is your mental framework for navigating all these different kinds of architectures and blockchains yeah so I I try to do try to have a uh thesis on on both parts so the modular piece which is like separating the execution layer separating the sediment layer separating the data availability layer um and then the monolithic piece which is like we're going to do everything on one blockchain um my current thought process is it makes the most sense to scale the base layer as far as you can um before you add these other l2s on top uh so for people who don't have that General general knowledge ethereum is focusing more on the modular architecture meaning that ethereum wants to be a sediment layer and datability data availability layer for these other Roll-Ups so they want to push as much execution off change with these other blockchains as possible like optimism arbit terms of gay sync um and then essentially just have ethereum be the most secure um layer instead of all of the proofs of these transactions that happen on these other chains on ethereum uh so one of the reasons I'm really big on the cosmos ecosystem is because they've been pushing the modular architecture for a really long time um like their whole thought process around app chains is essentially that that modular thesis we want each specific blockchain to have its own um I'd like to have its own thing on Focus um that's kind of like kind of similar to what ethereum is looking at with Roll-Ups but in in the cosmos ecosystem you also have teams like Celestia um and dimension which are focusing on being my Dimension wants to be a modular settlement layer so let's say it wants to purely be uh modular datability availability layer I didn't have rollups built on top in the cosmos ecosystem so I try to try to think through like how I want exposure to the modular thesis as well as the monolithic thesis um I kind of lean more towards the cosmos ecosystem right now um I really like the optimism team and what they're doing uh with the OB stack because they essentially want as many Roll-Ups to use their sdks as possible and be able to Interchange whatever da layer or whatever um like infrastructure You're Building um on top but still be able to use the op stack um I think they want to operate with like a shared sequence share cost across all the Roll-Ups but yeah I'm trying to think of it and I try to have exposure to both um but I think it just makes sense to scale the base layer the furthest you can um before you do anything else because you're always going to be restricted by how scalable that that layer is whether you're just pushing proofs to it or whatever else like you're still going to be restricted by how scalable that layer is yeah you cannot cheat physics as I like because I like staying there um so actually I think you said something interesting there you said you preferred uh maybe the cosmos approach a bit more which I think is probably non-consensus right so um you know obviously there's l2s and maybe the new L2 app chains and then there is Cosmos which maybe are competing quite a bit and you said you kind of favor Cosmos what is everybody missing there like how do you think about those two things and why should people care about Cosmos yeah well it's yeah it's definitely not a popular thesis uh because it's not proven out yet Cosmos has probably I think the least mind share and like activity out of those top three if you look at top three like Cosmos ecosystem ethereum ecosystems Lana Cosmosphere has the least mind share from users uh and like activity from that perspective um so my my thinking on why I like Cosmo so much is if you were to design um a modular architecture from the ground up I think that you would build something more similar to something like Celestia and have the roll up separate um for all their individual Roll-Ups separate or that's that's Sovereign Roll-Ups or something else instead of building out something like ethereum which I think really pivoted to the modular architecture After figuring out that ethereum didn't scale um with how it's currently designed as an L1 so it's like you're you're pivoting to something but we have a ton of tech debt and that's why I thought I'd like a lot of the ethereum upgrades take so long to do because they just have a ton of tech debt that they need to get over whenever they're implementing something new um and that's why they're very very very safe with all the upgrades that they make so I take a while I think that the ethereum developer Community is super strong in that regard like they don't want to break anything that's their number one priorities not break anything on ethereum before we move forward um I think that's good as ethereum the push for why ethereum ecosystem is going to be the strongest forever that that Community has because it's the most secure um but in my ad I'm like we're only at 500k whatever 700k daily active I mean less than that if you're talking about people who are actively using all the D5 protocols so if you look out in the future say 10 years we have what tens of millions of users in crypto which hopefully the case I don't think that that moat that ethereum has which is purely from a Time perspective as I see it that security Advantage is going to be as powerful as having the best technical um infrastructure when you have because you can catch up on all these new users joining into crypto in the future so if you have all these new users that outweigh the current cohort of really rich people on chain it's like what are they going to use first they're going to use whatever team has the best ux whatever like experience is the best for people um that's kind of how I think through it it's definitely not proven um I think Zacky exactly had a really good tweet a few months ago he was like Cosmos has six months to really gain mind share and crypto or like you're gonna have a ton of catching up to do um I think they'll do well like there's a there's a ton of teams building out in the cosmos ecosystem over the next few months I should um should get attention more that way but yeah it's my my general thought process I I agree with you on Cosmos one thing I am curious about is and a lot of people have been talking about this but Cosmos and ethereum in some ways are almost converging on like their path and what they think the future is going to be yeah right like it's been very clear at this point but I'm wondering like on the path dependency here like your bullish Cosmos but that doesn't necessarily mean the cosmos Hub and an atom itself versus like eth the asset and none of this is financial advice but but my thoughts on this is that because ethereum started as like the single logical state that the whole Community got around and now it pivoted to Roll-Ups versus something like Cosmos which had this like vague vision of what Adam was going to be it always knew there's going to be all these different applications with their own tokens it never had that like coherent strong community that eth has and now you see the Roll-Ups like arbitrum and optimism and others who are like pledging allegiance to ethereum for really no reason other than just a latch on to that Community whereas you don't really see that in Cosmos so I'm curious how you think about that and and maybe what you think about the Hub itself and Adam yeah dude that's it's the hardest that's the hardest I would say the biggest struggle for them honestly like that modular thought process is Like There's No One winner so it's like you don't have people to join around and center around one one uh one chain one person um yeah so it's tough It's like that's one thing that There community has done really well but I think these newer Cosmos teams are aware of that and kind of see in the cosmos ecosystem um like the doodx CEO I think talked about it a bit he's like I don't want to be seen as a cosmos train I want to be seen as dydx like an individual chain in the cosmos ecosystem and we're our own like thing I think that's kind of the right mindset that you're going to have to have if you're working on bootstrapping a community on your own um I think to say guys I've done a pretty good job of pushing towards that as well like they want to really rally um their community in the early stages um funny enough like a pretty bad example Luna um which obviously blew up a ton of stuff in Cosmos but what they did a really good job of was evangelizing their Community like the Terra I don't know what they used to call them the terror people or whatever yeah yeah so the lunatics they were like super Gango on on Luna and like everything dokwan was doing um he was a really great figurehead and like bringing people around even though the the technical uh like Emperor behind it was not solid um but I think you need a leader like that around a certain chain that's going to be able to Rally people and ring Community that's like a really important aspect that people don't really talk about as much I think in the in the cosmos Community like they have a ton of really smart devs um but like the marketing and the like Community aspect around individual chains is kind of weak um see it's it's tough it stopped being bullish on Cosmos as a like ideology but then like okay what do I buy in the cosmos ecosystem like to make money um so it's like yeah I'm not as as Bush on Adam Kurt like right now compared to stuff like Salon I think Salon is probably a better bet because of how Miss price it is um but yeah there's a few chains over there that I think are good good setups right now that people are kind of flying under the radar so in the previous question you mentioned the word Tech debt on ethereum which is something that generally software Engineers talk about a lot which reminds me you're actually uh previously a software engineer right yeah yeah so um with that said I want to ask two questions regarding that because most people in the space that are you know maybe Traders don't have that technical background and don't really understand what they're talking about when they're when they're comment on technical architecture but you actually have an agitator um so okay like the first question is how do you think your software engineering background helps with in terms of how you think about blockchains if it even does and two if you were building something today which chain would you pick and why um yeah I think it helps it helps a bit helps me like being able to understand all these papers that people put out and read through all the information um it's I think easier for me to digest than your typical person who doesn't uh understand anything about crypto at all or Tech at all uh I think it definitely helps me in that that regard like going fa research um but honestly I'm not like I have not been an active developer in like all three like ecosystems and compared them like the dev tooling myself personally like I've done some stuff some like basic stuff but nothing like really really in depth that would be able to formulate an opinion okay this has the best like onboarding um for for devs also I can't really speak to that that much um but I just generally um I probably would say Solana just because I think that you have a combination of a ton of people who are looking at that ecosystem like from a social perspective the community perspective um and then like obviously I use ethereum all the time there's no application that is gonna be able to scale really on on that L1 um like I've seen even like operational monopolism like they Spike whenever you had like I think when the arbitrum airdrop happened these spikes like ten dollars whatever it was so just like there's much more throughput like much lower fees on Solana so you want to build any Global application in my head I want to build something for 10 million plus people that are going to be using every day um and just the way that slime is architected it just makes the most sense yeah I think one of your like secrets to being a good Trader and also talking about this and reading about it is that you actually use the product you've like probably used 10 000 chains at this point I don't wanna I don't want to know how many wallets you have or how hard your taxes would be so I'm curious like as you've explored all these different chains like what what are either your favorite products that you're using or have used or what do you what do you think's missing like what what does Solana need to actually build out that next step the the biggest thing that I think Solana and other crypto applications need is a focus on people who aren't in crypto um and that's like where I really want to focus a lot of my time over the next few months is how do I make how do I bridge that gap between people who have absolutely no no understanding of crypto at all I don't know what crypto is and bring them into crypto like what applications do those people want to use um I don't know if that's like more social stuff more nft stuff I kind of lean towards that um as like a good way to onboard people like I know if I give some of my friends maybe some eth or some Bitcoin oh I have some eat or some Bitcoin but if I get one of my friends at nft it's like oh I have an nft I'm a part of this community we share this with all these different people um and it's kind of like a more communal thing so I really like what drip house is doing um they're one of the newer apps on Solana um they're kind of comparable to Art blocks on eat where they do drops with art but instead of doing you mints they do free drops for people every week um and they give out all these art so people who subscribe to different artists on their platform and then you can tip the artist if you really like their their work um and then share and send other people but they've um I want to say they've sent out entities to something crazy like 700k 800k wallets and out of those new Wallets on their platform 250k of them have gone to use other Solana apps in the ecosystem so they've done a pretty good job of onboarding completely new people like you you don't need any slot in your wallet to get the nft um completely free now you have you're like oh now what else can I do in the ecosystem so I think they're doing a really good job of onboarding people um stuff like that I just think more applications along those lines um and then I'm still big on gaming I don't think anybody's really hit it hard yet you need something it doesn't really have to be all that complicated um but I think about a lot of the mobile games stuff like Flappy Bird and games of those types where they weren't really that complex but they did a really good job of getting people's attention and I think crypto has like really great Lane there to do that especially with Solana focusing on Solana mobile um and App Store and everything else with X and the t's and backpacks stuff like that so that's kind of where I'm at with it so you mentioned uh drip house I'm just gonna quickly show we we did an episode with trip if people want to listen to that um but uh yeah I mean I totally agree especially on the reaching out to people who aren't even in the market uh or at least in crypto and getting those guys in I think that's the biggest unlock and um something interesting you said there is about um attention right um you are very good at the Bird app or I guess it's called The X app now yeah um and crypto does play a very big or I mean the Bird app does play a very big role in crypto in general um which which is kind of weird I would say I don't think many Industries have this much Reliance on a single Communications Channel yeah how do you think about that like how should people think about using Twitter for crypto I honestly don't know man I like I've been active on Twitter since like 2012 or like super early so my people always ask me like why are you docs on Twitter like why are you one of the only people in crypto who's docs and I tell them all the time it's because my Twitter was my college Twitter like my high school like my Twitter that I had um in college was the same Twitter that I used for crypto I was just always tweeting out random stuff about whatever was going on during the week like when we would go out to party and stuff I'll tweet about that like I'll tweet about whatever I'm doing with my boys um I just always tweet because I was always online anyway I went from Tumblr to Twitter and now it's just in Myspace like online so then when I found out about crypto in like 2016 2017 um that okay who do I follow on Twitter to learn about crypto and that's when I just got into crypto Twitter followed people like Kobe tradermain um all those people I would say for people who like are not in crypto you definitely need to be on crypto Twitter because there's no other place on the internet where you can get uh such a like large concentration of alpha information free information people like all these different types of discussions only live like there on Twitter and I've learned probably like 90 of what I learned about crypto has come in some way from Twitter whether it's like linking out to a blog post linking out to somebody's account like learning about trading stuff learning how rotations work um like Kobe I don't know if you guys know Kobe's pyramid he's like a pyramid of his portfolio breakdown and he was like top 40 50 you do Bitcoin 30 you do mid cap well it's 20 you do whatever 10 you do like Giga the gym stuff [ __ ] Point stuff and that's like that that just thinking thought process I didn't have that coming into crypto didn't know how to trade before crypto um and how crypto Market Cycles work are different from a lot of other asset classes because they're so rapid paced because the industry is so new and the only reason you're going to learn how to trade any of that uh like those rotations and like narrative ships and crypto is by being on crypto Twitter so like a lot of that I would say if you're if you're new to crypto learning about crypto you got to be on Twitter as far as from a protocol perspective I do think that push and marketing push um it's big on Twitter I honestly didn't realize it as much into the pet like this past year um but I was like I don't really know it I don't really know what marketing people do like I don't really know what like the core like day to day of a marketing person is but I realize like a lot of people are Focus all their attention on what people are talking about on Twitter so if you don't have a big presence on Twitter you could be building the greatest like technical whatever protocol to exist but if it's not like big and people don't know about it um nobody's gonna use it so it's like it's a huge piece um for like spreading the word about your your protocol and so I remember you Tweeting and someone do these threads it's probably like a year ago you do a thread but the threads never be attached he'd like do a tweet like every hour or like 45 minutes so you never knew what he was talking about just controlling and trolling everybody but that's one thing I really like about you answer is that like you don't take yourself too seriously and that's something like in crypto probably uh people don't do on average like especially a lot of like group think going on I'm curious what what um what do you like not like about crypto like it could be a hard industry to stay in year after year as the market implodes and you know there's a few cringe things that happen throughout the ecosystem like one like what do you not like and then like what keeps you in it yeah how do I not like about crypto um yeah I think that the markets as far from a Market's perspective there's not really much I don't like I think the opportunity outweighs all the volatility like the blow-ups and stuff that's like a challenge for me so I I was mad during the the Luna blow up um because I actually was out like I was out with my family actually Mother's Day but I was like dang that was like easy like killer short if I like like whoever caught that printed off that short like yeah a lot of people got crushed on the other side of it but like those opportunities for Traders only exist stuff like that in crypto um it's like the volatility aspect doesn't really bother bother me all that much um I would say probably the thing that bothers me the most about crypto is just like some of the community like some of the people like online the anion kind of like the end on culture is kind of similar to stuff I don't know you guys are like 4chan the old 4chan boards um and they're just like some people who just say a lot of crazy stuff online I get a ton of DMS from in on people or like saying whatever that I know would never say anything like that to me in real life um that's probably really the only issue I have like with crypto like crypto crypto Twitter um other than that it's pretty cool I'll tell you like out of all the people that I met from online that I meet in real life are great people it's like everybody that comes outside and leaves their house they're like is are cool people but it's like the people who are purely online like came from whatever Message Board um and are only sitting at their desk like typing typing typing some of those people can be pretty pretty weird but but yeah so I know there's obviously people watching this who who who want a better Twitter game and you have one of the best what what advice would you give them how should they use the Bird app I honestly the the best advice I would say is to be genuine like I would say people people are much more willing to listen to what you have to say when they know that you're not hiding anything from people um like I've shared so many losses on on Twitter so many of my losing trades also all my like my winning trades but it's all there probably like I don't I don't delete stuff I'm like oh I did this when I didn't really do it um so it's like I think being genuine and just being true to yourself and like what your actual personality is is invaluable especially in a place like crypto Twitter where a lot of the people are faking stuff and trying to get people to believe things that aren't necessarily true um because even if you don't think people can tell like people can tell people can and really um tell like when you're a genuine person and you're being honest about whatever you're sharing um so that's why I mean open as possible and then also just like really responding to as much people as I can um like a lot of the friendships that I've made like in real life friendships were from responding to some random anion when they had like five followers on Twitter and they're like hitting me up in my replies and I just hit them back and they're like DM me a couple times I hit him back and I'm in a Discord with them and they're like yo I'm gonna be here in this country during this time they're like yo I'm gonna be here and then we link and it's like oh you're my homie now and like we we link up in places like all over now and that's happened a ton of times um with people and I think it's it's it's kind of easy to find online which people you like really Vibe with and sync with it's kind of like um I know how to explain it it's like it's online it's like an online Vibe check and then you meet them in person it's like in real life buy check and it's like the people that you have those connections with is huge um so I would say yeah just be as responsive as you can to people because you never know who's going to be your like friend that you meet um and then down the line there's somebody that you may be working on something with so I was like be genuine and talk to people as much as possible love that um coming up on an hour so we'll just we'll ask a few more questions one thing I think is in a Twitter space yesterday you said the next six months for crypto are really important something that you're watching um yeah why do you say that yeah uh see I thought you guys have seen I've I've converted into a full Bowl football mode um uh yeah but I think the reason for that is like the next six months I think are the last time that crypto is going to be seen as a like Fringe asset class um so if you look at what BlackRock is pushing with their spot ETF grayscale like with their spot ETF and a ton of these like big traditional Financial uh corporations building out stuff for crypto like oh we're gonna be the ones on all the exchanges we're going to be the ones who own all the rails we're gonna be the ones who own everything going into crypto and once that happens crypto is no longer a small thing on the side it's like now it's going to get passive flows to bitcoin pass flows to ethereum um and then once that happens that opens the door for just a lot more money to flow into the space in general because cryptos right now I want to say we're like two trillion market cap or it's maybe smaller than that um and BlackRock alone manages 10 trillion like if you compare how small crypto is to the bigger stock market we're tight um so this is the last bear cycle in my opinion where you kind of have that outsized opportunity as a retail Trader retail investor to get into a really early asset class that has outperformed everything else in the past decade um and then once it's a multi-trillion dollar asset class and it stays there then the volatility is going to drop a ton um you're still going to have like all coins in the mid cap range do whatever but the volatility just in general is going to drop a ton I think it's going to be like less opportunity than previous Cycles after it's it's that big just because stuff gets dampened um when it's that big of a NASA class that's like one of the advantages that we have right now everything that we're doing on chain like being early to stuff I don't think you're ever going to have an opportunity where you're like one of five thousand new users on a platform like in a bear market like I I that's that's something that I don't think people are taking um I think people are taking it too much for Advantage right now that's why I'm like super heavy on on the bullpost like charts can go up and down 20 but you if you're thinking out six months plus um I think it the most opportunities right now do you think Bitcoin needs to to Rally again like does Bitcoin then send off the rest of the market I know like the happening is happening I think it's March 2024. like do you think that still needs to happen where Bitcoin leads the way and then risk Capital slowly um you know kicks out to more and more risk um I think I think it it will happen um I don't think it needs necessary to happen for you to generate Alpha in other areas of crypto like if Bitcoin and ethereum are chopping around there's currently enough opportunities in the market where if they go sideways you can still find plays along and um opportunities protocols to be early too um but yeah like once Bitcoin re rates higher like if it goes back to 50 or whatever okay that's like not only are the Bitcoin holders like up a ton in profits but the new cycle is going to hit so it's like oh Bitcoins back near all time high ethereum's back near all-time high and when that happens that's when you also have a ton of the retail like oh it's time to buy crypto again and then the money trickles out across the board like across the risk curve like you said so that always that's always going to happen in crypto um I do think that like the rallies in Bitcoin are probably going to get progressively weaker um like the one we had last cycle I think went to like 69k and previous high was 20K but before that it was something like whatever one 1K or whatever to 20K um so I do think it's gonna like progressively just like be smaller Cycles less volatile like not as not as parabolic on the majors which is why which is one of the reasons why I'm so confident in Salon outperforming Ethan I don't know why people fish back on it so hard but it's like if the ecosystem doesn't die it's very unlikely that you have a 250 billion dollar asset outperform something that's 10 billion dollars um just generally in crypto us how how the altcoins work if Bitcoin if they're in reread higher it's okay like what else is going to re-rehire that's a solid um fault in crypto um see I think it it will happen it doesn't like need to happen for stuff to do well in the interim but but yeah you just mentioned you know um why do people push background so hard like you don't know why this is and uh I've seen people push back on it quite a bit yeah uh and very aggressively as well uh what do you have to say to these people like how should you know how should we handle these people because I've seen you I've seen you do God's work here but uh what's your approach here well I mean what I say is like I'm I'm supportive of everybody in crypto that's building something to bring news into crypto and like move the stage forward I'm fully in support of all that um I'm supportive of ethereum supportive Cosmos like all all the Roll-Ups I like all those teams um I think that the industry as a whole needs to be more honest about what the backdrop of the like the current state of the industry is like you can still be bullish eat and you don't have to talk bad about Solana it can still be bullish Solana and you have to talk bad about optimism or talk bad about arbitrine but you can also be critical of these phone calls like you can say that Roll-Ups maybe are centralized more than they should be right now you can say that ethereum can't scale past whatever TPS on mainnet right now and then High fees are not good for people who don't have a hundred dollars to spend on each transactions I think you can be be honest about each ecosystem's pitfalls well while also championing them because in my for my like from my perspective there's a ton of developers in the salon ecosystem um but they can't be like I'm bullish on a bullish on bushelna because they're not like they're not objective obviously they're working on Solana protocols um so that's one of the reasons like I'm so bull Solana publicly on Twitter is because like I feel like I can help them um in that regard but that's what I'll say I think people just need to be more honest about how we talk about the state of crypto um and not try and confuse new people because like a lot of a lot of the marketing efforts I think from some teams is are like intentionally confusing to new people in crypto just to like pump whatever their coins are which I think is really net negative for the the industry as a whole um Jeff that's what I would say I'm supportive of everybody but I think we can be honest also so I love that I love that answer um Do You Wanna Do you wanna do a fire round yeah sweet yeah do you have anything else or let me just go let's do it all right sure so we are now going to do a rapid fire uh I will ask you not so appointed questions but I will ask you some aggressive questions and just try to answer them quick short but if you want to expand on obviously go ahead okay cool cool all right your favorite three D5 protocols in crypto uh modify drift could I say when it's not out yet uh sure yeah up to that team but yeah um well they're like public well I think I think pair pair is cool like pair protocol because they're like all I do is pair trading a lot of the Paris you're gonna do is they're like one they're I think they're they're um not yet but that's a cool one your favorite three nft collections oh man uh definitely the remilios vermilio babies um dang the pandas can't buy pandas and I'm gonna say the lotus lotus nfts oh nice three most overrated chains my god um polygon is like 100 chains so it's confusing yeah three times it's like three different things uh polygon Harmony Harmony [Laughter] my conversation D5 kingdoms launched on Harmony which is an L1 and then they uh deploy it as a subnet on Avalanche so and so I'm curious what you think about Avalanche right now I like average um I think so one of the things I pushed back on Luigi and them all the time on apex is because they don't have they didn't have anything like IBC which Cosmos has um with their chains where all the chains can easily communicate with each other it's like a standardized messaging protocol um but now Apex has built out I think it's called what's it called um cross chain Communications something yeah yeah close yeah but some some avax work messaging um so they're building out that which is like makes it easier for all the the subnets to talk to each other and then also their hyper SDK which is supposed to allow different VMS to be easily filled out um on top of all these submits um I think they're they're interesting because they focus more on the institutional side um and they're like BD is pretty strong um so that's like one thing that differentiate them from other changes like they're really heavy on the the web to Partnerships you like writing what's your number one writing tip for aspiring writers to write every day that's my number one tip literally like if you can write something every single day like whatever you're thinking about just be consistent on doing that you will get better consistently consistently consistently um I like try and journal like as frequently as possible but I think it's really like you got to be that's really the biggest thing is consistency because like you may think oh this isn't that good but like right you read you write you read you reiterate and it's like keep going keep going keep going I think that's that's probably the biggest thing um and also ask your friends like I have a ton of smart friends um in crypto that are like like I can ask about really anything um so yeah I would say like bounce bounce your ideas off your homies your three favorite apps in crypto overall drip house um I like play The Heist right now it's like a nft game maybe Quinta on optimism um yeah your most controversial taking crypto my first controversy I think my most controversial take is probably the salon to point one e like I I'm pretty confident that's where it's going um this next cycle like the as price uh price prediction I think that's that's probably my most controversial take what what's something a year ago that you like strongly had a belief in that you've completely changed your mind on I think it might it might be Adam to 100 bill I like one of them like my rare I I did a list of like um things that I like had a low possibility chance of happening but I thought like could happen at the beginning of 2022 and I said Adam's like 100 billion market cap um I think it's honestly more realistic that you have a conglomerative change to get to that that size or like that combined more than just Adam um as a hub getting that big that's not what I'm saying your favorite Three Twitter follows oh man that's hot oh my God that's a good question my favorite Three Twitter follows let's make it five that's not fair dang can I check Twitter real quick let me see dude I was like it would have been Kobe I feel like maybe but he doesn't tweet anymore he's gone yeah I mean Kobe is like all time probably like one of the most the my favorite accounts for sure yeah I don't think I feel like I gotta shout out some of the new guys bro like I like being horny be horny is cool Lucas is cool um um who else is cool mirror asks us questions so that someone will say him eventually [Laughter] um mission accomplished yeah oh air mass air mass is the moment and uh bdb big big bull when you said Lucas are you talking about uh Buffalo or is that which Lucas ah nah the schizo poster um what's his name schizo I think schizo underscore f-r-e-q gotcha yeah all right I got a random one um I know you're really into basketball so if we're playing a game to 20 is five on five how many of the points are you scoring five on five or are you playing with crypto people it's all crypto people all right like 14 14. yeah uh favorite NFL team Eagles Italy Eagles favorite NBA team Texas who should everybody block on crypto Twitter dang it was everybody block bro all the uh dang we're not gonna have that many people blocked bro I don't know I don't really block people I mute people all right we can uh maybe that one's a little targeted advice you 'd get anyone listen to this and that could mean crypto or outside of it just something that's really helped you I think I think I've been pretty consistent like my my biggest piece of advice in crypto is like keep your balance between crypto and whatever you got going on in like life so it's like during bull markets you're gonna make a ton of money if you are all mine all the time 24 hours like not sleeping not getting good rest but currently tapped in like oh I I'm I'm close like I'm on every new launch like I'm on every new chain like I'm on every every new rotation and catch everyone you'll make a ton of money that way if you really just like cut everything out um in your life and do that but the issue with that is when Market turns it's a lot more difficult for you to unplug and then go back to whatever else you were doing um so like it's not it's like it's it's like beneficial in the time but you also like lose a ton of just like in real life stuff like I think it's much better to have a good routine where you're balanced um you can go obviously have your own crypto in bull market but don't just go like 100 and not talk to your homies not talk to your friends like not not hoop or whatever and then to keep um active so I think that's the biggest thing don't get sucked into being 100 in the in the bull market it's great advice great advice and some thank you so much for joining everybody you need to follow Ansel on Twitter I'll put links um also to his blog go read them even older ones they're really insightful so um answer me out thanks for joining man this is awesome conversation yeah man thanks for having me on sweet all right we'll see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you
