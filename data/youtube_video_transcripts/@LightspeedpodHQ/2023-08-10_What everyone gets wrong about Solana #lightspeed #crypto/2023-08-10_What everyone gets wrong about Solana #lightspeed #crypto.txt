what does everyone get wrong about Solana that is not decentralized it's just dumb okay it's just such a dumb thing especially now like hell we like survived the FTX collapse the fact that the network went through that show at least continued running and people continued building it it's like the most decentralized thing possible I honestly don't think that like ethereum could have survived consensus collapsing at that particular moment of time but ethereum would have died
