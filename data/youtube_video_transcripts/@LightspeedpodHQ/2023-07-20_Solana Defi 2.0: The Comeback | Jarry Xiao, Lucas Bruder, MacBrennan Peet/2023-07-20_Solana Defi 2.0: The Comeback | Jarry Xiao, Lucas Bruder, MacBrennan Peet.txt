the crypto true Miniatures users will not know what L1 they're on and they won't even know uh a lot of the time if they're using margin 5 because that'll also be abstracted away to this you know consumer grade application front end however since crypto is so small right now you need to be super sensitive to like motives of an L1 appealing to the immediate users because if you can't appeal to the immediate users you'll never get a chance to appeal to the Future users this episode is brought to you by Judo Judo is the easiest way to earn Mev rewards on Solana with liquid sticking take your solojito to start earning high yield powered by MAV and access instant liquidity through geodes liquid staking token Geno solo so that you can use your staked assets across Solana's defy ecosystem [Music] what's up everybody welcome to another episode of Live speed today we have a special one it's a D5 Solana panel we've got Lucas from Judo uh Jerry from Ellipsis lab and mcbrennan from margin Labs guys welcome to the show thanks thanks for having us pleasure being here all right let's let's get right into it so I'm gonna just call out people's names before answering or asking questions but um first what's going on in D5 macbrennan yeah so um so a few things I think you're seeing this explosion in TDL uh first uh we just rate for for context like uh the the one of the protocols that contribute to margin if I just raise caps two days ago and within like a second uh raised like three and a half million three three and a half million was poured into that uh hitting like new Supply caps Supply caps existing in the first place because of like a variety of risk constraints in terms of that Supply turning into borrows and the capacity to liquidate that safely uh and so I think actually uh Lucas said this where um for a while now Solana has gone through this period of and I hate drawing these analogies but there's like the 2017 Ico hype in ethereum and then 2018 D5 products like really started maturing and picking up steam I think that's kind of played out a similar scenario has played out with Solana where Solana was a new technology some teams came in like there's this like opportunistic period and then all throughout that period there was teams like Judo uh seems like uh ellipses teams like Zeta Camino drift Cipher uh Zeta Etc uh that we're building during that time and they're all hitting inflection points but the product right now um and uh and the three variables have been there like liquidity has been there use users have been there like users are constantly from a daily active user standpoint rivaling ethereum polygon binance Etc exceeding that liquidity is there there's currently seven billion stake to validators on chain priced in Solana essentially waiting for like higher rates um and more opportunities to pursue on chain uh and the dev ecosystem has been there you know the teams I just mentioned the teams on this call and so people were just waiting and liquidity was waiting for like the right opportunities at the right time and that's what hap what that's what's happening real time right now is the right teams are here the right opportunities are here and there's this like this bottleneck of liquidity that's like broadly just blocked by risk and this is not just like on our front this is like something we're working with with Cheeto I know uh um and it's really just like a a move of working iteratively on the risk front to and take as much Supply as possible as fast as possible uh and doing that in a safe way and so that's that's the explosion we're seeing right now and that's that's like something very excited about yeah Lucas we've seen really the same thing with Judo soul I think it was in June you're at 650 000 Soul stakes and now it's over a million so you're having this hyper growth like what do you attribute to that um yeah so I guess in the last like months we've uh seen the protocol grow like 50 or more um I think a lot of that is due to uh just like narrative around Solana D5 coming back there's a lot of uh protocols like margin Phi and um like mango and Meteora and other places that are kind of popping up that uh really kind of go like hand in hand with liquid sticking tokens and I think that you know uh sure you can hold a liquid staking token by itself and that's great but at the true utility comes from using it in these D5 platforms and we're starting to see a these platforms get a lot more adoption and things like Cipher points margin Five Points and some of these Point systems are really driving a lot of growth to salon defa and then you know the liquid staking tokens go hand in hand with that so that is um growing pretty fast as well so would it be fair to attribute a good amount of the growth so far to this new Point stuff that that have been you know developed by margin Cipher and the composability across D5 yeah I think there's a lot of it that's driven by that and I think more broadly like we're seeing platforms like Meteora start to pick up and you know um I think they somewhat announced the their token plan or their token revamp so we're seeing like more tvl and liquidity go there and I think the points have contributed a lot and there's kind of this like wave of new D5 protocols coming or uh these like new users that are coming on chain and this liquidity that is really kind of uh snowballing and having like a a pretty wide blast radius in a good way so points actually it seems maybe they're kind of a controversial topic on the Bird app I've seen various takes for it against it Jerry um Ox [ __ ] Trader Eugene your co-founder uh tweeted this the other day points are just a way for teams to defer airdrop it's isomorphic to a shooting lock tokens the advantages are to the team token has no Mark Price can't be dumped can arbitrarily change scaling no transparency variance and pursuit valuation is exploited at Etc uh for your first question is a very loaded one but what do you think about that um I think my co-founder has a lot of very like uh opinionated takes on Twitter um I oftentimes agree with a lot of them um and I think that like there's clearly some some Nuance at this point uh I think like Point systems in general like uh the whole purpose uh to me it seems like you want to bootstrapis activity um but you also care about these like second order um and also like long-term effects um and I think that's like pretty important to consider especially when it comes to like General airdrops across uh like a lot of D5 protocols where you have this measure of like you have this like carrot that you're dangling in front of the user it's like you use our product and then you get this carrot carrot usually be in a token and then once the token gets launched it becomes liquid and uh someone is going to want to buy that carrot from you and I think that like it's it's a model that has proven to like uh really boost short-term growth um often at the expense of long-term sustainability where you see these charts that kind of look up and down right where some someone tries to immediately uh like I don't know in the beginning you farm this airdrop and afterwards the users kind of taper off over time uh maybe this is an okay way to do some growth hacking um I do kind of believe in like the long-term vision of defy where this thing kind of uh is able to operate by itself without these uh token incentives because ultimately what should be the driver of product is product itself not token and too much we see in defy and in crypto that the token ends up becoming the product and I think that like in order for this ecosystem in order for this industry to set kind of like um become something that gets ingrained in the long term we have to sort of move away from that I do think that like growth hacking as a way to like bootstrap users is not a bad strategy but I do think um in the much longer term well we should be like striving towards is building products that are sustainable yeah yeah background and I'd love to get your take on this I think you started with points July 3rd and you went from 3 million in tvl to 17 million I know TBL is not everything in D5 and that's something we'll probably want to talk about later but maybe talk about your experience what you think about points and how's it gone from marching by so far yeah so so I think one important thing about points is like or tokens in general is that having a token is unequivocally Game Theory optimal and if you're building an open source protocol and you have the same liquidity in users versus another open source protocol with the same liquidity and users the one with a token is going to win kind of 10 times so like having a token is sort of a necessity if you're building something or open source you're building something closed Source then then it's not then you know you can have some like proprietary code base um but that's sort of like counter to the broader D5 movement that we see which is like anchored on transparency and trust and a lot of that is validating what's what's going on in the code base uh so so given that instance like margin 5 is an open source protocol right and so someone could theoretically like I I dare them to try to Fork it get the same users get the same activity uh and then get to that same point that we're at and then if they were to launch a token and we did not have one they would have a serious advantage over Us by default um so what we're doing uh live is we're testing okay if we did have a token live right now how could we effectively um ingrain that into our into our product into our protocol what incentives work what incentives don't work what user archetype does this attract what user archetype does is not attract where can we find distribution for this flywheel where can't we um and and points are like the highest leverage way to do that um this is actually something I'm um and this is like a big team-wide push this isn't uh anything you know any sort of individual accomplishment but I'm very excited about like pioneering points on the D5 front I think uh like points have really only been tried out in two formats previously for the best of my knowledge they've been tried out on blur nft Marketplace on ethereum and then tensor on Solana quickly followed with a similar um similar like setup within D5 it's like kind of like this Blank Slate of like how can we figure out uh how points work here and like for a team like Judo for instance they're so multifaceted right they have vegeto soul uh LST they have you know certain like considerations around Mev searching they have considerations around like validators and so you know you you can go right to a token and launch it and hope it works but you could also like you know across those stakeholders for Judo for example they could just test a bunch of incentive mechanisms just and and make them sustainable first in the lead up to the tokens that when they drop drop the token it becomes this like sustainable flywheel that they're looking for and that they can again remain open source they can have this competitive advantage that's what we're working towards with margin five um and I think just that simple Innovation not any sort of because like there's no sort of contingencies in fact attached to this point this that's simple Innovation is why you know users are resonating with so much um and that that's that's that's I think where we've seen this explosive growth come from Lucas why do you think we haven't seen more tokens from Solana Salon D5 specifically I think that it makes sense for protocols to hit a certain amount of usage before uh before they launch a token I think you want to like to uh Jerry said earlier like uh having a token is in like a business model you want to make sure you have like product Market fit and there are people using what you're building and so I think there's that there's obviously a lot of like legal red tape that you have to go through to launch a token and um I think that it's pretty expensive and time consuming to do that um I think that like going back to uh what Mac was saying about points I've I think there are interesting uh growth hacking I think um we've seen a lot of teams that have like really messed up the initial token distribution where they over inflate certain they over inflate it or they uh you know there's like similars like people buying Lamborghinis from the arbitrum airdrop from like sibling um so we've seen like this massive like incorrect allocation of tokens when these protocols go live and um I think the points are kind of like a worthless like uh you know the points themselves are worthless but it's kind of an interesting way to uh experiment in the way that uh like where you where do you dangle your carrot and how big and juicy is that carrot and like if it's not doing what you want can you like tweak it or um can you like move it around or maybe you know I think kind of like trying to experiment with uh the behavior of people is like pretty important before you have a token because you want to make sure that the token is like uh you have like data and uh kind of these experiments that you can run and look back on and say hey like this worked well this didn't uh where do we need to like juice the juice this a little more and all that yeah so Solana a lot of the projects were known for not having tokens now you do have incentives and you have these points like what is Solana D5 missing Lucas you said that sauna summer or D5 summer is confirmed like what do we need like is it LST growth that's so important because that has to be throughout D5 or what do you what do you guys think like what's missing yeah I mean I think uh like more LST growth is always awesome there's a lot of protocols that can use lsds but the thing that we're running into with margin Phi is that there's actually not enough liquidity on chains I think uh people that are like minting these lsts uh maybe they can do like 50 50 LST in Seoul and put that into uh like an amm or something to provide liquidity um I think uh Stronger like Primitives more Capital efficient Primitives like Phoenix um and then uh I think also like there's probably going to be more projects launching tokens coming like later this year or very early next year and I think that that will be uh pretty important I think um like l1s are kind of useless if there's not like a ecosystem of tokens that are like native to that that blockchain it's kind of like uh you know tokens are in a business but you can think of them like uh like a like a business or something and like a reason for someone to visit the city uh where the city is like the L1 and you know if ethereum didn't have any defy or any tokens it'd be kind of useless um so I think like more tokens on Solana will definitely help so Lucas just alluded to kind of capital efficiency and mentioned Phoenix which is uh in order book Jerry you're obviously building Phoenix um I saw that you had a really cool analogy uh comparing kind of Center limit order books uh with like a physics twist can you maybe talk to us about you know why should people care about order books over amms how do you think about the differences um obviously um there's a lot of hot takes on you know do you take amms do people even care about our books um you know Aura books are obviously something that Solana first brought to the scene with serum can you just talk us um talk just a little about that yeah I mean I can go for hours on this topic it's it can get pretty deep um I think the the high level idea right is that markets are this kind of system that operate dynamically and they don't really have these rules necessarily it just kind of like where Supply meets demand and generally when you have a system like this where some people want to buy and some people want to sell um you sort of like you end up the market kind of ends up becoming the middleman to connect these two people and the the people who facilitate this uh this connection are the market makers so you have uh someone who's willing to buy and sell at the same time and they get a set of terms I think this is how almost all traditional markets work you have trillions of dollars moving through centralized exchanges like stock exchanges every single day um and that's a system that's really beautiful because you have these people who are like these strict zero-sum actors who are not really looking out for anyone they're not trying to make the world a better place they're just trying to make money for themselves but as a consequence of this you have this like deep liquidity that exists in the real world where at any given point in time you have this portfolio of stocks that you can you can liquidate and you can speculate on um and that's all facilitated by the fact that this liquidity exists um unincentivized uh due to this mechanism of people getting to dictate um what prices should be and what uh prices they're willing to trade on this is what an order book really enables it gives you the ability to be precise about um the price levels and sizes you're willing to specify for each order um and the difference with an A M the primary difference is that the a m gets to set those terms for you as a liquidity provider so you kind of have to be proactive in telling the amm to not do something versus on an order book you get to be proactive and saying this is what I want to do um it's kind of like having an assistant to do actions for you um and sometimes his actions are things that you just never want to do in the first place and so you need to like uh explicitly have the finger on the red button to say like hey this is bad let's not do that um like a sandwich is a perfect example of something like this where a real life Market maker would never never let himself get sandwiched a sandwich talk to those who are not familiar is when um some uninformed actor makes a really large buy against an amm that by offsets the price of the amm to a price that's like outside of the range where the True Value should be and the emm immediately is willing to uh buy it back at a price slightly lower because they originally sold now they're buying back at a much higher price um and a real Market maker would never let this happen because what they would effectively do is Warehouse the risk because they realize that they sold uh the asset at a price that was a lot higher than it was worth and they're not willing to buy it back at a very low price or like at a price close to their sell price they realize that um they made a really good trade and they're not going to immediately sort of like get out of the trade because they're afraid of the risk they realize that this risk is worth the amount of edge that they received um and that's kind of just like one caveat there where like this amm is doing these things on behalf of the trader the trader wouldn't do themselves um and Order books kind of allow them to set their terms on um the kinds of Trades they're willing to make and the kinds of orders that people into place does this make a big difference for everyday users for example let's say somebody's just getting into D5 how should they think about hey do I go on ethereum and maybe use uniswap if I want to play with this D5 thing or do I go on Solana and use order books yeah so the kind of beautiful thing here is it doesn't make a difference at all this is kind of just like an interface right the interface for the normal user is like you place trade and then the trade goes through uh you don't really care where it came from that's why Jupiter is so powerful you make a trade on Jupiter it routes to wherever the best price is that could be an A M like Orca iridium that could be an order book like Phoenix or open book um but it doesn't matter to the user they don't care what the end state is the reason why I think order books are powerful are is because like they have a proven track record of allowing their LPS to be profitable the people who provide liquidity are on there because they're making money not because they're being like tricked that they're making money uh I'm not gonna go on this like Spiel on how like amms are like super unprofitable I think they're just like negative EV and I think that oftentimes people don't understand the nuances there of like why it's such a strategy uh potentially isn't like always going to print you money turns out that money doesn't grow on trees turns out there's no free lunch and uh like professional emotion doesn't exist it's kind of the nature of how markets work order books are this thing where uh they have been this proven mechanism where you can provide liquidity and be profitable um and that I think is like kind of powerful and for D5 to see it in the long term I think that this is something that has to be addressed because ultimately over time um you can't have unsustainable models uh govern the way that liquidity operates on shading so collabs require professional investors to some extent active investors like you're talking about in deep liquidity for it to really be useful how do you picture Solana's brand because I feel like At first uh Anatolia came out saying it's NASDAQ on chain and right now you have a lot of people in the ecosystem saying it's a consumer chain right like that's where consumer applications are going to take off nfts have really taken off so how do you see that balance because for Solana D5 to work with how it's built today and to take advantages of Solana's High throughput you need professional investors in D5 but it seems like a lot of other builders and ecosystem are basically saying this is going to be a consumer application chain with nfts almost being the dominant aspect um Mac Brennan do you have any thoughts on that yeah I think um especially when you're looking at usage through like the lens of like usage when it's attributed to products with huge financial uh overhang if you will you need to be super adaptive to where we are in like at the stage of the cycle and Solana has been that and so what I mean by that is like V1 of margin Phi um was like we were the first team to provide Universal margin across derivatives on different dexes uh for for any Traders uh so for what like quickly what that mean is you could set up a delta neutral position between like drift and mango for example and your margin would be managed um through you'd have Universal liquidity a universal interface Universal risk your margin would be managed appropriately that product didn't even have a front end that was like only dealt with uh sophisticated algorithmic traders that dealt with like small Prop Shops in like Asia for example and that's because we were at a stage in the cycle where rates on chain were super high there's a lot of opportunity capture and it made sense for these guys to come in you know we're in a different stage of the market cycle if you will right now we're in a stage where those same guys really aren't active on chain they're partly active off chain on like centralized exchanges um but they're also just like largely dormant and so the big user architecture right now is retail what just basically like you and me like people just using the chain to to for like commercial use cases for just like normal user-facing use cases and so nfts are a big part of that because this Salon has just been like super adaptive to that you know a lot of teams have been super adapted to that like tensor has been super adaptive to that um and when you have a a product that's like sort of dominated by this stage we're at in the cycle you also have to be adapted to that so what did we do we went over collateralize we built out a front end you know we're we're one of our strongest user archetypes right now is people coming to margin five with usdc borrowing Solana against that and going and trading nfts with that so that they can hold usdc exposure but have tactical uh Solana to just like go after an nft trading opportunity and so everyone like kind of needs to understand this this is one of the different things I think about building a D5 product versus building like a consumer product is with a consumer product you can sort of like pick a target market and you're like okay I'm gonna go after like this user archetype type in this market and Market Cycles you know where interest rates are really don't like change what you're doing but when you're building like uh an order book on chain You Know You're Building infrastructure on MAV you're building a borrowed land you have to be like very sensitive to where are interest rates like what's going on on like the finance space and and that's just exactly like what's happened at scale on salon so as rates go up as opportunities go up um P5 is going to play a big part of that because it's going to be like very front and center uh the the broader push I think is like ingraining crypto more and more into the real world so that these fluctuation periods can like even out a little bit and we can find more like predictability uh in our product building but that's like I think like the the tldr there is why why building a device a bit different so obviously order books are more Capital efficient than amms and this has led to some discussions about TBL um TBL is this really interesting metric that some people use as the end-all be-all some people think it's useless some people think it might be useful what are some good stats to really understand how D5 is performing and how a chain is performing uh Lucas and actually also what are your thoughts on evl as well um probably uh I think high tvl is good um I think there's a lot of people that are like oh Capital efficiency is more important and all this stuff and yeah I agree there but I think as far as like a trust signal goes I think tvl is pretty good um or it's a one potential trust signal like you know you look at some of these other altel ones that no one has ever used and the tvl is high and you're like maybe questioning it or something but if you look at like arbitrum or these like Blue Chip L1 l2s with high tvl it's uh I think when you see that you're like okay this is actually like pretty legit um and so yeah I think high tvl is good I think um but also like in uh the case of like uh if you're providing liquidity uh uh you know you really care about the capital efficiency that's going on in the protocol so like uh I'll let kind of Jerry speak more to this but like Capital efficiency on Phoenix is like way it's way more efficient than uni swap or I guess like any amm I agree with Lucas that like ipvl in general is like a good trust signal so I'm not like anti to high tvl in any way I think there's a lot of like benefits of how can igbl namely like you have this like uh value secured in the chain where like if your TDL is higher than like a does sort of imply that there is more value to secure and so there's like benefits there um another thing about tbls is kind of reflexive in a way in like like a big way where like the price of the token like the L1 token is a huge determinant and like what the like TV all of the chain is so like when Seoul went from like 18 to 28 dollars in the TBL of Solana chain went up that um I mean that really shouldn't be that surprising right because a lot of the assets on chain are like actually just Soul um and so in that sense that there's like a little bit of like misdirection in there right it's like yeah the tvl did go up but like did you check the prices um so I think that all that is it's like it's like obviously important in the sense uh where you have like um this like trust uh in the chain like people are trusting the chain to custody assets and that is valuable and that uh sort of allows other people to be more interested in what's going on um with respect to Capital efficiency I think that it probably matters a good deal for Traders where if you are uh trying to do something on chain um I think the program that footage is a really good example you don't want to be like super Capital constrained uh you don't want to put down a lot of capital um in this and like use it ineffectively because that effectively is capital you can use somewhere else um Phoenix is I'd say like relatively Capital efficient obviously like this thing is a pretty tricky subject and there's like many different ways that you can uh can can look at it and like I'm not going to say that like volume over tvl is like the world's greatest metric but it is something that okay kind of approximates it where uh Phoenix regularly does like five million dollars of volume in the Soleus DC Market with less than a hundred thousand dollars in the book um and I think that like this is something that you can't really do on an am and I'm like I think maybe you could but it's probably pretty difficult to accomplish this while your LPS are still um like steadily profitable um we've run all the markouts on the people who provide liquidity on Phoenix and those numbers look pretty good um for those unaware markouts are like this pretty standard metric and traditional Finance to measure performance of Market making strategies and usually when this graph looks up and to the right it means that in general you're making trades that are uh like usually collecting positive Edge which means that uh over the long term uh if you view all price movement as just pure variance um the the pro the strategy itself should be proud and so when we look at those numbers on Phoenix we see that uh the market makers are consistently need to be profitable this is not true when you look at the numbers on Unison it's not true when you look at the numbers on other amms on chain um and so that sort of indicates that having this system where you're able to not only um trade with high levels of capital efficiency um but also like dynamically dictate where your prices are moving um has some benefits to the person who's trading Terry I think you were talking about is that is that the same metric as D5 velocity which I've been spring talks about where you have like TBL divided by volume over like a 24 24 hours seven day trailing period yeah so I I think that's it's kind of a weird metric um it's obviously not perfect there's a lot of ways it's not perfect I'll give you an example where like keep like volume over TBL is not a perfect metric like suppose you have someone who's placed a bid for for so lot like one dollar and in that bid there's like a million dollars right so this this particular order is never going to get executed on um but the tvl is like a lot higher right so effectively that's an example of a capital not being used efficiently um if you have like a lot of volume near the top of the book so like close to where the fair value is and there's a lot of volume that's been done that generally indicates that like um the capital is being used more effectively basically that capital is being transacted with um and so yeah I think it's not it's not a perfect metric but it's one that I think that like uh it does sort of like highlight some of the differences between an order book and an amm where I don't really think it's all that possible for an AM to generate metrics that looks similar to this but let's just assume we are you know just a crypto enjoy or right uh and we just want to mess around in D5 maybe we don't know what chain we're going to pick how do you what are like what metrics do you look at to distinguish between protocols like it's not TBR you can't look at that alone you can't look at volume alone what are some easy to grok numbers you can look at as just a regular Joe to you know assess this is a good protocol this is better than this protocol and this metric etc etc up to the floor anybody can answer this I I want to call out one thing here that Savannah can definitely improve on um also like a quick thing with with volume and amm is that Jay also didn't mention it's like how much volume on amms is just simply rebalancing and like all the treasures coming back in and correcting prices uh which you also don't have on the on another book so like volume on an amm is just going to be by default severely inflated but um so it's just another reason like volume as well is a great metric and then also not a great metric but one thing I I do really appreciate it's like on GMX for example uh there on on arbitrary there are these like massive massive trades uh that like there's a 16 million dollar trade like every day for example um and so massive trades like that uh where there's like the appropriate liquidity depth to handle that trade um and it can be executed at a good price uh and you kind of get that experience you can place these fat traits that you could you could also like make on like uh okx for example or coinbase bringing more of that to Solana is like an area I think we should we should all like collectively work on um a big part of that is like having the liquidity on chain in the first place to uh to field that so that also like goes back to what Lucas was saying previously where sometimes TBL is a good metric because of having that liquidity there is important um that's that's something that I would I would really love to see because that means that we're not only we're not only building these tools that um are very efficient and very easy to use and like great for users but they're scaling to you know our tradify counterparts if you will uh and they're more practical for bigger players especially in the world of Finance that's dominated by bigger players that's something that's like a metric I I'm always like watching for um because and and it's it's it's important for me a variety of reasons but like as a as a user just like where can I place like really big trades and not be like get get a great price for it I think that's something we should all work on quick break to tell you about our sponsor Judo judo's been known for building Solana's top MVD software and now Judo is the fastest growing liquid staking protocol in Solana Solana D5 is hitting up there's no better acid to use in D5 than liquid staking tokens that's all you should check out judo's liquid saving token called Judo soul Vegeta soul you can start using your stake Soul throughout Solana D5 while earning Meb and staking rewards at the same time and Cheeto is made staking extremely easy you'd start earning rewards and receive instant liquidity all within three clicks by visiting judo.network staking if only all a D5 was this easy Judo is perfect for Wells who need deep liquidity and also people who are new to staking because not only does judo make thinking simple then make it secure Judo has seven audits they're one of the most respected teams in Solana D5 and they have over 1 million Souls staked just go to judo's website start testing out their staking product and go use your stake Soul throughout Solana D5 Cheeto is one of my favorite teams in crypto and they have one of the best products in Solana if you're not liquid staking you have to go check it out go visit cheeto.networktaking that's Judo dot Network slash staking go get started I'll put a link in the show notes [Music] hey everyone we'll get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we've got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech Roll-Ups account extraction Meb app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blind speed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show going back to your question on like what do you look for as a user that doesn't really know defy that well I think um understanding the I think risk is very important in understanding the the risk involved with what you're doing um you know I think that's like the most important thing and that will kind of lead you to other things to look into but you know is this um there's this program audited uh or the risk like clearly stated somewhere doesn't rely on an oracle um you know when you when you bring an oracle into the system it it the risk changes a lot and uh you know are they open source audited things like that I've seen a lot of users get um lose a lot of money in crypto unfortunately so I think the best thing that you can do for yourself is to like understand what you're actually putting your money into so while on that topic um I I recognize this when I first started crypto at least is like and my brother actually asked me about this hey like yo should I eat this and it's basically like you see these pools and they say like things like 655 APR or something like that or like you know five thousand percent yields um let's assume there's people that are new to D5 watching this how should they think about those claims uh I'll I'll give this one to you Jerry yeah I mean this isn't something I've seen a lot and I like it usually irritates me a lot because I know kind of like where these numbers come from and like where why they're kind of Bitty and so generally how this happens for like amms um is that you have these like at least in the early stages you have these admissions um from this like token that is sort of like airdrop to you uh as a consequence of like providing them couldn't do a pool in addition to the fees and you kind of take the amount of fees generated in a single day plus the amount of missions collected in a single day um and then you multiply that by 365 to kind of give you like this really really appealing massive number where without ever accounting for things like uh loss due to price movement um and then similarly I think like options protocols will uh that sell like covered options will sort of quote you the risk Premia of selling an option without like um indicating what happens in the case that like say your collateral kind of like moves down in price or if you get exercise on on the option right so these are like things that kind of get hidden away from the user when you have these like high level numbers um so I guess I would I would just say that there's like no free lunch where like if you see a number that seems too high like if the number has like more than two digits it probably isn't like something's being hidden from you if it has three digits something is definitely hidden from you if that's four digits I think you should just run um because like usually what ends up happening is that you like probably uh can like make a little bit of money in the early stages by collecting these emissions but uh as time goes on like that's going to dry up and then eventually I guess if you especially if you're lping into one of these like like [ __ ] coin pools like uh you could just end up losing everything because the national flow of things is when people start dumping like you're gonna be left holding this bag um and so yeah I just I just think that like these numbers are incredibly misleading um and they should definitely be like viewed with a skeptical eye if you see something that looks like this the things that are usually like more transparent are things like I would say like staking yield is like generally pretty transparent where you kind of know where that comes from um but things like uh oh you deposit into this random black box and it gives you some percent yield that's a little bit sketchier or like you uh do some on-chain options protocol that's usually like they're hiding some information from you um I think like borrow levels are generally pretty reasonable about this because like uh there is like an actual Interest being paid for the capital being provided um but yeah in general I'd say that like be cognizant of the fact that usually if the number looks too good to be true it probably is too good to be true it's a good warning for everybody I'm curious what do you think is next for Solana D5 and I know it's in the earlier stages in ethereum one thing you're seeing with ethereum D5 though is a lot of the apps are vertically um doing vertical integration so you have like Ave with go you have frax doing steak fracts and you have the stable point and then you also have the exchange uh do you see that happening in Solana and I think one other trend is real world assets and is that something that you think is going to happen in D5 like what do you think is coming next I think we'll probably see more teams do some type of vertical Integrations I think it it makes sense um obviously you want to balance uh you need to be careful in the way that you message it and all that stuff to avoid alienating other projects that you uh when you vertically integrate you might compete with but I think it's inevitable it's like uh projects look to like direct more fees towards the treasury um I think the thing that I'm looking forward to is more liquid staking adoption on Solana I think we're gonna see that ramp up a lot here and people like minting lsts and using them in like stable swaps and borrowing and stuff like that uh I think less than less than two percent of all stake soul is in liquid staking where on ethereum that number is like much much higher I can't remember off the top of my head um but uh we've seen that drive a lot of growth to uh we've seen the growth in liquid staking on ethereum grow into other things like other protocols Drive the TVO there and you kind of get this like uh reinforcing like feedback loop from that so definitely looking forward to that I definitely agree on the liquid staking point in particular there's a lot of value to the like I there's a lot of asymmetry there with how Solana is positioned um in terms of D5 protocols being positioned for that to intake that um Lucas also knows like we we definitely have we've already kicked off some vertical integration uh plans ourselves I'm very excited about like there's teams building on margin five uh now and sort of you know not just the team itself like building new products on top of the recording foundations they've built um but you know outside teams coming in and now using these like trusted Primitives um to to build complementary Solutions that's where I think um especially just on like the retail adoption side people get very excited and Solana definitely needs to level up to that that's something um that evm has had a time to to get to and to mature to and uh Solana still really hasn't and so that that's that's a broader Trend as well I want to call out I think would be super exciting so while we're on the top of ubm uh I know you guys probably saw this coming but how should people think about building defy on Solana versus Altus and maybe some evm Centric Solutions uh I actually want everybody to answer this so Jerry let's start with you yeah I mean I think through the thing that's most interesting about Solana is like how much the design space grows given the execution and programming model like there's so many things that you can potentially do on so on that you just aren't unable to do on ethereum um even unable to sustainably do on an L2 because I think right now the fees are probably too high um I think there is an EIP that's like coming up that maybe might change things like that but at least in the current day and age Solana enables uh unique Innovation and I think that's like kind of the thing that I'd like to see more of so kind of like really utilizing the capabilities of the chain to do something that like would be uh very difficult if not impossible to do elsewhere and really leveraging composability um I'll give you an example that isn't my protocol uh which is Jupiter I think Jupiter is like by far the best aggreater in all of crypto and I think one of the major reasons why it's able to be so effective is it's sort of like really pushes the is still on a program model to uh like to to do like basically the boundaries like it's it's doing things that like I think most other protocols aren't thinking about doing and as a result you get this like really impressive thing where uh right now like I can't tell you with like uh like I can't honestly tell you the best place to swap on chain is to go to Phoenix I'm going to tell you that the best place to swap on chain is to go to Jupiter because that is like where you're going to find the best prices and the way that they're able to do that is via composability and it is via like this unique set of programming paradigms that Solana introduces and so I would say that like to try to like build D5 for the future you should really kind of understand what the technology has to offer and leverage all of those things to build a protocol that is innovative and differentiated and something that's not possible to do another chain I'll put Mac yeah um I mean everyone gives a quick answer that Solana is lost in cheap here but like Salon is fast and cheap and that actually opens up a lot of things as well um apart from like what uh Gary was saying um I think we're still um like the only team in crypto to provide Universal margin between derivatives on different dexes and that's because like we can uh from risk management perspective uh you know derivatives are fast-moving products and and so like from a liquidation capacity perspective we have the ability to liquidate faster and cheaper and safer on Solana than you would on uh chain that for gas prices are shooting up where like the chain is throttled etc etc there's a reason like these things are important for finance um and so yeah very much to Jerry's Point like that's something that really is only Impossible on Solana truly um and uh and that was like a 10x experience for anyone like sophisticated trading across markets um and so like we very much um like we're we're going to continue down we we actually have uh two products that are like very close to a completion now that we've been working on that are going to be tightly integrated with the margin five hour lend and there's going to be a lot of things that are only possible and Solana these 10x products improvements simply because um like on the foundation that Solana is fast and cheap to use um and like I'm very excited to to like launch those and know that um there's really nothing someone on evm could do to compete with that because of because of just the foundation that they're on so so yeah um I'm just calling out the basics here since uh Joey had a more eloquent answer but like yeah fast and cheap enables like some really interesting use cases is we've talked about like the composability and stuff like that and I think those are all good points I think also like fast cheap that's obviously true um I think it changes the way that you can think about protocols and like uh one thing that I've always been thinking about is like more Automation and like more rebalancing and things like that like can't really do re like for instance if you're trying to like rebalance or something on ethereum it's gonna be like you know anywhere from like five dollars to a hundred dollars depending on the usage on Solana rebalance is like a hundredth of a penny so you can just do way more and have more automation involved in your protocols so I think pretty pretty excited about that I think um ethereum like evm will focus uh they make you spend a lot of time like gas golfing which is basically trying to optimize your evm code to make it you know maybe use a certain evm instructions that are cheaper or use different uh like storage types and things like that to make it cheaper and you can kind of see it when you read through some of these solidity programs it's like what is what the hell is going on in here and like uh so yeah I think I mean you don't you depending on what you're doing like I would say that is like the the default in Salon is not gas golfing like you don't really have to worry about that it's super cheap you have plenty of compute but uh when you do uh you do have to worry about it if you're starting to compose on a lot of these things you have to start worry about the like transaction size how many accounts you're locking and things like that so um there's definitely trade-offs there but I think like not gas golfing not having to worry about that is pretty great because everything's just so cheap and fast partake automation is also potentially very relevant for AI and like the inclusion of AI and crypto uh for like these automated programs to run um which is like also something we've always been thinking about but um if you think about that like very hot Trend right now um I think that's also very complementary to what Lucas just said Mike Brenda how do you feel about the future what customers are going to think when they think of an app are they going to think about Solana first they're going to think about margin 5 first and if it's margin five first that's the brand and that's like the user touch point would you look at something like the svm when it's expanding on something like Eclipse do you look at other high throughput chains I know Eugene Twitter the other day similar to I think Sunny tweet about Cosmos ecosystem is that they need to come up with basically you know game changing products in the next 12 months or ethereum is going to catch up to them I'm just curious how you feel about that and how you like relate margin 5 to the Solana brand yeah I mean there's so many levels this a right now you just think about l1s and they think about protocols and then that's about it um they should in the future like if crypto truly matures users will not know what L1 they're on and they won't even know uh a lot of the time if they're using margin five because that'll also be abstracted away to this you know consumer grade application front end uh that is like the future of defy where it's these Financial rails and these infrastructure pieces are essentially competing on efficiency which is why like Salon is like a really good foundation for that um and and essentially they're open source so anyone can compose on them and build on top of them uh however since crypto is so small right now um and it's really just like tiny uh crypto is like very much a new novel technology you need to be super sensitive to the community specific uh like um the community specific like motives of an L1 and you know infusing your your your protocol with that L1 and appealing to the immediate users because if you can't appeal to the immediate users you'll never get a chance to appeal to the Future users and so it is important now to understand you know the different um like nuances between people who traditionally use like evm and people who traditionally use Solana and you know position yourself accordingly uh however we've failed as an industry if like 10 years from now people are using an application like using it because it's on Solana and even really knowing what like borrow land architecture and like margin 5's case they're composing them they're they're using on top of their like consumer grade application that's sort of my like zoomed out and zoomed in thoughts on that so while we're on the topic of maybe the future of the industry let's I want to maybe role play a little bit so imagine I am just somebody who is you know big big Trad five fan I love my interest rates and my t-bills and then just parking money and getting you know uh yields from the government um why should I use D5 foreign yeah I mean that's a good question I mean I think that like in some cases it might not even be like a thing that everyone needs to use right like if if you do kind of want to like use tea bills like dude there's always going to probably be this like off-chain real world way that you can collect the seal um it's possible that in the future like some of this stuff will be tokenized and put on chain and that could be pretty interesting too I imagine in that world like it's probably not like a free permissionless system but rather like a permission D5 if you want to collect heals via like treasury bills or like bonds but I think the thing that default like makes D5 powerful is you kind of have this like ability to sort of uh like I think like I really think the composability theme is I think that's pretty cool where like you can uh do things with existing infrastructure where like uh on ethereum I think that they've done a very good job of like composability I mean that's like one of the things that makes the evm powerful is uh if you want to go like integrate with uniswap um I think it's maybe like 10 lines of code and you're done and then like now you have a protocol that can like auto swap into a udv3 pool um I think that's pretty powerful like you basically have this like existing infrastructure that is extremely easy to to work with and extremely easy to sort of like attach to a product that you're building um I think that like the answer to to this like like who uses D5 like you need to have like products that use D5 right I think real world assets makes a lot of sense here like one thing that I'm very interested in is this idea of like potentially moving in Forex markets on chain um in some capacity maybe it won't be like the the whole set of all four axes on chain but like some piece of it might be and so if you want to like participate in some of these like Global remittance flows like there's some common ones out there like us to Mexico Dubai to India like these these flows of capital are very natural they're gonna happen regardless of whether crypto exists or not and if there exists the ability to sort of like off-ramp via these crypto um these crypto rails uh that could be extremely interesting where now there's like this real world problem that gets solved by having crypto being this like middle layer and like what Matt Brennan was saying no one really needs to know like it's just this thing that they use in a consumer grade application where they interact with it and then at the end of the day um there's some transaction that occurs um it might occur on the blockchain we hope that it occurs in Solana but this can hypothetically be like totally abstracted away and I think that would that's kind of like what makes it powerful like you have this like programmable layer of composable programs uh that can transfer Real World value um and if D5 wants it is going to take off in the future it has to really capitalize on that there's been a tweet going around or a trend on Twitter and it's like my controversial take and crypto is and it's that guy with the swords like pointing towards them what do you guys I want to I want to go and hear from each of you what's your controversial take whether that's about Solana ethereum or just the ecosystem in general that you have that you think maybe most people don't agree with and Lucas if you're ready start with you or somebody can volunteer oh man um I feel like that that Meme was funny because there was a lot of people like sharing takes that were actually like people thought they were controversial but they're actually not and like everyone agrees upon them 100 um but yeah I guess mine is like I think probably for the next 10 or 15 years uh the chain people will know what chain you're using and that it will matter a lot um I just don't really see that being abstracted away anytime soon yeah agreed why wait why do you think that I'm interested um I mean I think like uh when you I think there's a lot of complexity and like the bridging and all these l2s and things like that and I think uh that is gonna be extremely hard to abstract from the user and I just don't really see that happening anytime soon I think there's also like a lot of tribalism uh from other communities also within our own Community uh if we're just being honest with ourselves here um and I think that uh there's a there's a good chance that crypto remains like pretty Niche for the next few years and I think that if it remains Niche then I think it's like tribalism will continue and people will know what apps chains are on and will not use apps because they're on some chain that they like or uh don't like what do you got yeah this is I agree with this like um it's a bit difficult I saw a bit this is oh I'll say two things I saw a bit like um or I'll say something that I think is more not um contrarian but that people um like needs to be said is that if the if Solana doesn't attract continue to attract an increasing amount of liquidity developers and users like it it'll fail even if it has better under a long attack uh because essentially it's still infrastructure so um let's never lose sight about like every team and user on Solana should be doing everything they can to attract more users more developers more liquidity uh full stop um one thing that maybe is a bit more contrarian is like um that I think when when you're building in crypto you need to very much like um uh embody your own like you need to adopt this sort of like overhang overlying crypto governance that exists and and um and if you're going to be successful you need to like move independent of um you know the day-to-day of what you know what is Gary gunzler saying today or what is like you know this government body's saying today etc etc I think things are like very very overreactive to that um and ultimately if we just conform to the same like the same thing we've seen in like um like traditional Finance like we're really Building undifferentiated Technology and we're wasting our time um like there's a reason for permissionlessness and the centralization for other speakers so I don't know maybe that was a bit too General but um I do think like a lot of teams have like been really happy to embrace this like sort of uh this infusion of Trad find a lot of teams are trying to land that because they think it's like a big golden egg um and I don't think that's the right approach uh I think you need to build for like like crypto Natives and like embody that crypto governance first um and make people reacted to you even though that's very hard to like do in practice it's a bit abstract yeah yeah it's a hit on your first point really quick when you're talking about like why it's fun on my fail what do you think would be the main reason that the sauna does fail to get those users is it is it products because it does seem right now that's one of my being the best position to build the the best cheapest you know highest Performance Products yeah or do you think it comes down to storytelling and I see you get involved quite a bit on Twitter and going back and forth with some people in ethereum it seems like they do really have good storytelling in community and Salon is something that's building from that what do you yeah what do you think the main failure would be yeah it's it's all a distribution game uh at the end of the day and so Solana right now um and this is a lot with ethereum but not as much and this is where ethereum has like some strengths Solana is like broadly speaking uh a blockchain for Americans by Americans like extend extending that to like also Canadians just like westerners in general like if you go over to uh Asia uh like you go over to Singapore or South Korea um ecosystems like like Tron and finance and Luna when like Luna was a thing or like have massive distribution and we have not there's you know half the world is over there um so uh like appealing to to that market is like existential I think to Solana and so we need to break outside our own Bubbles as like westerners generally speaking um everyone here is like definitely based on the western side of the world um I I think at least um so so that's that's like one thing that like we need to make a broad a broader push-up um and and when that happens then teams come in and compose on top of the existing friend days that's like step two because again we're still like like Ellipsis is building a uh an order book you know Judo is building like critical validator infrastructure we're building a borrow land these are these are Primitives these aren't like products on top of Primitives so we need to make that step as soon as as possible uh that's where you start to see compounded value TBL adoption Etc and a more complex Financial system like breakout so like those things in order like capture distribution break people in and then build on top of what's here yeah and Jerry yeah what do you got what's your controversial take yeah I think I have two that are actually maybe kind of controversial so the first one is I think that like Solana developers uh need to I guess focus more on traditional crypto values of being like open decentralized um source code is still oftentimes closed um and like I don't think you have to necessarily like go like full open source with like the right license and everything but like your coach be public they should people should care about verification too like if you have some source code that is uh publicly available but I can confirm that this code compiles down to the exact thing that you uploaded on chain you can have like a hidden drug function in there right like it's table Stakes for ethereum to do this and it's ridiculous to me that like came to the salon I don't treat this as like a priority number one like this should be the status quo and it shouldn't be like this thing that is sort of like an afterthought not the first one the second one is I think that like decentralized Leverage is like an oxymoron where like if you have a protocol that offers leverage um ultimately somewhere down the line there's going to be some centralized piece of the system and that could be like an oracle I think you'd argue that Oracle is like there are like decentralized aspects to it but ultimately this price is coming from somewhere and that's a dependency that you you have like very little control over and it can also potentially be manipulated um and you also have these like Risk parameters and levers that realistically aren't going to be static like I think it's very difficult to sort of like come up with a system where you have these like hard go to parameters and it's going to be like forever like these are the parameters that are are going to be the things that govern the way that risk is managed like it doesn't seem very likely this is not how like the real world works like real Finance Works generally speaking you have these like um situations where you have people make discretionary decisions to sort of protect solvency and so I think that like uh it's a very uh Noble and difficult problem to try to solve but I think fundamentally no matter what happens with like these things that have some version of on-chain Leverage there's going to be some element of centralization whether we we like it or not Jerry White why why don't we have this culture of Open Source and Publishing ideals on Solana what's what do you think is yeah so I I think it's like probably uh two reasons the one is like the dev X is kind of hard and so like I think that like once it becomes difficult to do this uh like that initial activation energy to try to like get it to work is like not super like it's hard to find and like the goal is that you want to ship quickly right so I can't really fault The Depths for not doing this because like if it's so hard to do and like your goal isn't to like oh let's let's try to be practical let's try to be like super idealistic here and make sure that everything's like verifiable and open um let's try to get the product out the door like I get that um I've been there this is like really what should be on your mind and like if the dev X is tricky you understand why some teams might not be like super willing to do it uh I don't think that excuses the open source aspect but it definitely excuses the verifiability aspect um and I guess the other is that like there's not like this um shame culture out there right like and I I hate to call it that but it's like I think that um once you see teams out there that aren't like willing to reveal source and you feel kind of defensive of it yourself um and like I think that this should be some of the changes where like maybe the status quo should be like if you have a program that's on a midnet like you should have public source code like attached to it like I think there's nothing wrong with building the clothes like I think that's totally fine I have no issue with that I think the main thing is that like when you have this thing on chain like that thing should map one to one with some piece of software that you can like read like my life and realistically like not many people are going to do it and that's fine like it's not like I'm gonna go meticulously go read the rely on every single line of code that someone else wrote for this on-chain program I think the the big part of it is that like you have the optionality too and I think that's something that like the Solana ecosystem should really focus a lot more on so what you're saying is we need to bully protocols more that are close to ours I think lightly bullying like to be like oh like like totally [ __ ] on them for not doing this but it could be like hey like it would be really great too and like it it should kind of be like not enough right it should be like this is a thing that you kind of go in with the expectation that like by the time you're on main net you're also public source code like that that that's I think how how things should work in an ideal world yeah there's also something interesting there where like the if you have like inertia where your tvl keeps growing the likelihood and like the the pain if you open source something later is gonna be much worse if you uh if there's like an exploit or something so the earlier you do it the uh and the less TBL you have then there's like less friction and like worry to open source but you know if you have like if you have like five billion dollars on a closed Source protocol and you open source it then that is going to be very stressful uh time in your life definitely but that's not to say that like closed source is necessarily like that much safer like you can definitely still exploit closed Source protocols it's not like impossible there are people they're like Wizards out there who can like read the by code and like understand like vulnerabilities in there like you're not gonna be protected forever um but ultimately I do think it like it does send like a better signal out there where like uh I like I I think just like from the perspective of like someone uh who like probably uses ethereum a good amount they probably aren't comfortable using the protocol that doesn't have like verified code in either scan um and hopefully Solana can get there um I think it's like probably soon but um yeah I think that's like a really really uh important thing for the ecosystem to kind of like understand and really like uh take into part when they when they go launch new products while we're on the topic of bullying I do like doing a rapid fire section at the end just to get some spicy takes so just for context I just made these questions up on the Fly I do not just whatever I think of and I'll just ask a question and then you guys can kind of go Jerry Mack and then Lucas in order all right uh should programs on Solana be frozen yes 100 yeah yeah no can you expect yeah I don't even think you heard the question he just said no um I think it for certain protocols it can make sense to not freeze them as long as they are under the control of a multi-sig and it's uh you know a multi-cig that is like well distributed um and I think as long as the community knows about it I think that is okay I think there's probably a point in time where it does I guess I would say overall it doesn't make sense to freeze them but I think there's a point in time where it does make sense to freeze them and that is probably based on like tvl and other risk factors that uh I would have to think about more I do think that having time locks is something that like we should be doing a little bit more research into where like if you do need to make a program upgrade um at the very least it's behind a time lock where it won't execute for X number of days and then when it gets in like everyone can kind of get a sense of like what the changes actually are like those source code associated with the change that's being pushed and uh people can kind of like look through it and understand like what are the actual changes being made to the code just for like transparency sake I'm not going to say this is perfect there's downsides like if you're trying to hot fix a bug um like this is obviously like potentially really scary where now you have like this race against the black hats where the black hats have like two days to exploit the contract um and so that's kind of scary but I do think it is good for transparency versus like hot updates cool um usdc is usdc okay the user should we aim for decentralized algo coins uh I think uscc is a great product um I think that if you're like using a stable coin like uh I think you kind of have to be okay with this like level of centralization I do think that like decentralized stable coins all kind of have some sort of like gotcha associated with it like uh for with Dai I think it's a pretty reasonable idea but over collateralization is not the most Capital efficient um I don't think something like like the the idea with uxd or the idea that Arthur Hayes posts where you're like um selling derivative to delta neutral head your position I don't think this works on chain um we saw that like when uxd was live they were just paying ridiculous spending rates on Mango because turns out that if you're the only seller in the market like the funding rates are going to move in Direction against you and so I think this is like fundamentally really hard to do I think it's a pretty clever idea but I I ultimately think that the way that stable coins should operate is like you probably need to be backed by something um and you probably need to be backed by the actual asset that you're trying to track okay it was it was So my answer is no um I think um if the ustc de Peg actually happened when we had that massive scare Solana's ecosystem would have been decimated Solana is completely reliant on usdc uh as a token pairing for everything um completely Reliant and there's really no uh like Jay mentioned you actually there's no decentralized stable alternative right now um uxt is wrapped usdc at this point so it's the same problem with uh with dye so uh funny enough we will be announcing a decentralized stablecoin at margin that's collateralized by lsts like jitosol um so it's truly decentralized it will not be collateralized by usdc uh and it will be you'll be able to lend into margin Phi and mint a stable coin against that collateralized by lsts I think this the ecosystem will like this is a must-have for Solana from a treasury management standpoint from a portfolio risk standpoint if you're holding a big bag of value on Solana it's just in usdc you have risk to Circle uh and so uh an alternative is extremely important um yeah we're working on that um it's it's it's getting close um is that the first time this has been public it went uh so we have a margin telegram where uh they were spoon fed this I think like yesterday oh nice but uh but yeah this is definitely helpful for everyone so uh it'll be musd the centralized stable coin and it'll be one of the highest yielding stable coins uh for individual mentors available on chain because you're going to be capturing staking you staking yield nav capture like with Cheeto for example and lending yield um which which will be like very competitive and it'll be truly decentralizing so if usdc depegs maker will not also depend like just as maker also depict the stable coin will not also get back nice I'm fired up I wasn't expecting that nice uh Lucas Alpha um I think uscc is fine for retail um I think it's a good onboarding mechanism but uh I think sings more things like musd would also be great what is the worst defy take you've ever seen [Music] uh I think that's that LPS are like printing money is probably the worst one I've seen or like I think especially the worst one I've seen is that like when you get arbitraged over and over and over again you are profitable [Music] I've just seen so much stupidity I can't even narrow I'm really struggling with this question um I I'll I'll um you know show uh Phoenix um and say like the apys that you see on amms are like straight up criminal they're not even just like misinformed they're like Bad actors um that are trying to use retail liquidity as their dumping grounds so there you go if people say something even slightly alternative to that it's a bad take Lucas worst the worst D5 take I've seen yeah ever just so good you just said you're like what the hell is going on here over there uh or just Mev actually just just to tailor it for you yeah I'm having a hard time coming up with something okay I'm gonna pass this one all right so we can get rid of Mev right oh yeah there you go yeah that's a that's a good one I'm still in the next question okay I'm coming in okay yeah all right Jerry let's start with you all right um You have to build on either Cosmos app chain or an L2 and you want it to be the most successful product from both user adoption and value over the next five years what are you building that's a really really good question um got to my head I would probably say L2 right now just because I think you have some composability benefits where like Cosmos you kind of have to build this ecosystem entirely from scratch one of the reasons why we built on Solana um instead of like another chain is because you don't have necessarily like this like ecosystem bootstrap problem where if you're building from like total like total absolutely nothing you need to like get all the liquidity into your your chain I think like with l2s um at the very least like there's like a relatively acceptable path to do this or if you build on an existing L2 there's like a like a path to do this where there's like liquidity on arbitrary and there's liquidity on optimism I think there's like building liquidity on ZK stink so that problem is less uh of something that you have to surmount and additionally like you actually do get composability which is which is pretty nice whereas like IP IPC via like different Cosmos chains is kind of this thing that I think is not super great for your user experience and uh like yeah it's harder to tap into other people's products yeah if you need composability you should use an L2 if you don't you should use an L1 if you're a first time founder you should use an L2 because you're going to have like liquidity advantages and like more helping you out if you're an experienced founder and think you can do your own thing like the ydx yeah go to an option yes uh for most Founders I would say L2 just because of the composability and like Simplicity and like tooling out there um but you know if you have some a very specialized use case like dydx or something where you have like these order books then something more like a fast style one or a custom app chain that can like address those needs make sense but I think uh for the most part I would say an L2 cool okay uh two final ones quick uh nfts yay or nay uh in the current state I'd say nay um I think they have potential I think they have a lot of potential but I don't really think this uh profile picture craze is really it like hopefully down the line like if this uh new technology takes off that is usable there has to be some like real world like things that you can do with them and I don't think we've seen this yet I only think that we've seen rapid speculation generally yes and it I in many ways I like I'm not even qualified to answer on this question but um but I think art blocks is super cool I think the original like crypto punks pfts is super cool and as in space and I agree with Jerry that I will love to see evolving use cases um with the nfts um so if it stays in pfp Forever then no because it's just like it just shows a stale industry yeah I'm going to say yay uh just because I did well on board API club but uh I think yeah yay there's a good driver for like people to like visit Solana and start to like dip into their toes I think also uh like two years for xnfts because I think it's actually a like extremely novel use case of uh nfts a little bit of chilling on that we just had Armani on so if you haven't listened to our first episode check it out uh okay final question let's and then a wholesome note you guys are all founders here what is one piece of advice you'd give to aspiring Founders existing founders that's a really good one um one thing I'd say is that like a lot of times the hard problems that you're solving is not really giving the tech like a bunch of your time is spent thinking about strategy a bunch of chapter times thinking about like hiring um like being a Founder is like extremely stressful but also really rewarding um and I guess like the the piece of advice is not really advice but just kind of like a statement is that like what you think is going to be challenging is probably not what's actually going to be challenging yep I would just say send it go as fast as possible surround yourself with people who are way more brilliant and smarter than you are way more accomplished than you are uh and if you do those three things you're off on a good foot and if you don't um you'll probably fail and you'll probably fail anyway so send it yeah uh I feel like I could go on for a while about this I feel like I've learned so much I think uh you want to find a good co-founder that will push you and hold you accountable someone to bounce ideas off of um I think the uh selling some of this earlier but I think past CEO told me that uh like the hardest part about building a company isn't knowing what to build or like how to build it but it's like what order do you do it in and make sure that you're focusing on the most important thing at that time and not wasting your time um and then yeah I think you just have to to like what Max said I think you have to uh be comfortable with being uncomfortable and continue to like accelerate and push yourself in like push your team as well and um yeah you just gotta just gotta keep accelerating amazing all right guys I think we can wrap this up I do want to bookmark this I know we haven't agreed on all the right metrics but I'm just gonna say today Solana has 312 million and tvl uh the stable coin market caps 1.5 billion and the volume of the last seven days is 781 million so I would love to do this episode whether it's three months six months whatever it is down the line come back look at these numbers and see how the projects are doing so um Everybody we'll put links in the show notes to All their projects thanks so much for coming on [Music] yep we'll see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music]
