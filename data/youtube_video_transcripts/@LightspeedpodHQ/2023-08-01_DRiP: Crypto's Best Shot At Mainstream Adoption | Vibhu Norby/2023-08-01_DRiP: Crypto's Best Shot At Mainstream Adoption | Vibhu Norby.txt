games have just built the best feedback loops the best incentive mechanisms the best virtual economies as well I think they've organized I think about World of Warcraft RuneScape these games really have nailed for how to build a virtual economy and then most crypto companies like especially in consumer space just like throw all those things out the window and just focused on like let's just build the economy and not and like none of the other like feedback loops are the other fun features and this just doesn't work like it just doesn't resonate with like the masses like they're driven by fun and you know having something you do when they're boring this episode is brought to you by Geno Judo is the easiest way to start earning Meb rewards on Solana through liquid staking get your soul stake it with Judo and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid saving token Judo Soul get started today at Judo dot Network slash taking [Music] hey everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we're joined by the boo the founder of drip drip if you don't know about it I didn't have too good of an idea just about two weeks ago but I've been looking into it and it might be the top application and protocol on Solana today welcome to the show thank you for having me so as I was getting ready for this episode um I was going through some of the podcasts that you've been on and one of the things that you said is that in the next six months drip is gonna open the floodgates and Solana may never be the same again so that's where I want to end up and see why you said that but I want to start off with just what drip is and to give everybody an idea of the adoption that drip's already having there's been 17 million nfts minted and because of compressed nfts which we'll get into it only cost two thousand dollars and I believe this has been over is it 900 000 about 800 000 wallets received an airdrop and they have about 300 to 500 000 active all today so if any app is found product Market fit uh in crypto I think this might be it so uh yeah it'd be great if you just gave it an overview maybe the inspiration and behind drip and uh what it is sure drip started at Salata spaces which was a set of retail stores that were designed to onboard people into Solana and one we were working on those stores we just felt like there was a there needed to be a better way to introduce someone to crypto other than tokens so we started giving people free nfts um and you know free artwork basically and uh it really resonated it was really amazing kind of retention tool we sort of send them every single week with Solana even using the old nft spec and the list kind of grew and grew and grew and it kind of went out of our control in January and we decided that we're going to focus full time on on this project so what we do is we partner with creators and artists and Brands projects um and they use our platform to send out free digital Collectibles every week to a list of people and those Collectibles are all kinds of stuff like we have art from a typewriter with degenpo we have um music videos from live shows from Vault music we have comic books with bork we have science like microscope science with mcquinn um just all kinds of stuff people are um Distributing out for free for users and for the and for the creators um on a regular basis we send and around 3 million nfts a week which is unheard of in the old world events um but uh with this new uh spec that we've that Solana has compression um it's totally possible and it's very affordable so you said you these Collectibles that you do send out are very different in flavor you have Maybe audio you have some actual art you have I think there's some by bet decks with like sports moments which I personally subscribe to because I'm a big big sports fan what do you like I think that's a very new mental model or framework when thinking about nfts whereas before they were kind of just these jpegs which you put on Twitter and now you're part of tribe X now I believe you've kind of termed this new way um of Distributing these things as content like d2c content can you talk a bit more about that that's because that's a it's such an obvious idea but it nobody really put it quite that way before and and you have and you found success with it can you just you know talk about how you think about this yeah it's one of those things that's only obvious once you've seen it and then it's like okay of course like why can't nfts be any types of content um basically you know our nfts they just don't function like normal FTS not in any any fashion even though we you know some people use the same terminology um we sort of think of this as taking a an object of content a video a music file whatever it is then wrapping it in this composable layer which is what the nft is right um what is actually an entity I don't think most people are trying to ft's even understand what exactly is happening what an nft is is you have a storage of metadata somewhere which is like not get too technical but it's basically a file that like outlines the properties that are on inside the nft and also a link to where the nft exists sometimes at nft like the file itself is on some essentialized storage provider sometimes it's in you know Amazon S3 um and the and the nft itself that the user owns is basically a pointer to that piece of metadata saying hey this address has this spot that's it doesn't matter where other than ordinals which is an exception to this everything else in nfts basically works the same way um and you know so in our opinion we just felt like okay well that's that data structure like we can stuff all kinds of stuff in there um what happens when um all content is kind of open uh anyone can add to it anyone can build on top of it um and anyone can distribute them yeah that makes sense you you've said that trip you think is the is the best way or the best chance that nfts go mainstream that's why is that like what what's so unique to trip other over other platforms and as a Creator like why are so many people going to drip I mean I I quoted the amazing growth you've had so far let me reverse that a little bit like what of the web 2 products that we have today that are at scale um would have been at scale if they started with requiring you to kyc transfer tokens save your seed phrase like um you know pay a hundred dollars a thousand dollars whatever the mint price was um to get into like none of we wouldn't have Facebook we wouldn't have Instagram like none of these things would survive they would not exist today so I think we just came at it from a very practical standpoint which is that people um first of all most people don't have any money second of all most people don't want to kyc they don't understand tokens they're very um very scared of crypto stuff they don't want to lose you know what they have what they've invested um so I think you know at a basic level uh free token list is just the only starting place for a very very big scale product um so let's put that in one bucket I think on the other side okay well once we solve that what are the things that people in the world like to do they like to watch videos people like to listen to music it looks like to look at pictures um you know like none of those things are you know again uh either freely accessible on the internet you just boot up Tick Tock or Instagram whatever you want and just zone out right for a couple hours so I think we're just saying okay let's let's break the barrier on the accessibility side and then let's just like give people what they we already know that they like which is like content that's engaging and it just happens to have all these superpowers that that you and I know know exist in crypto that's a very good point and it almost in my mind at least drops somewhat of a parallel to just social media something like Instagram where you scroll and you see videos pictures real shorts but also just quotes as well so different types of content so I guess the natural question there is what is what is it about nfts that makes this different than just you know using a database for example um a lot of stuff I think some of those things that come to mind are like things that consumers might care about and some of their things that developers might care about um and some of them are things that creators might care about um I want to start with creators because I think that's the place where the most inequality has sort of showed up on the Internet so far um today when a content creator posts a picture on Instagram um whether you know gets seen by 10 million people or three people uh the content creator doesn't get compensated for sharing that information and that's okay to be honest because most of the content that's shared on the internet has no value to anybody um but you know the thing is that um uh when that becomes someone's business when a Creator is using content to make money um or you know to Anchor you know a business after running somewhere else um all of a sudden it starts to become very unfair when the content creator is producing the the content it goes into the platform the platform is now utilizing the audience that that creator has built to serve ads and kind of capture the economics of that transaction and only like literally only in the last couple years did most platforms realize this might be a problem that you know creators uh should get compensated for these things and so you've seen things like subscriptions and Instagram um and Twitter um and twitch and so on but um the reality is that like from day one the economics were just really really tough and uh and you know uh almost entirely aggregating at the platform level so I think what we've sort of stumbled upon as an opportunity is uh the nft is kind of this like sliver of attention that gets captured in that moment on chain where creators created something they sent it to somebody and it went directly from them to you even if it was done at you know 200 200 200 000 people at time and you know that sliver of attention you kind of own it because you have it in your wallet so if you want to keep it if you want to share it with somebody if you want to even sell it um you know that that's something that's totally new that's that mft's kind of enable uh from the user point of view I think it should feel the same I think it should feel very very close to subscribing to any other following someone on Tick Tock uh we're getting there but uh the reality is that we kind of crawled up through the degenerate ecosystem a bit and so the way the product feels today is like kind of a mixture of like the nft game where you're like Rarity and this and then you also have content and they're all kind of coming together in this unusual way so I we'll see where that goes but um I it shouldn't feel different I guess is is where we want to be hmm how did you get to the point that you got so much traction so quickly I think you went live in October 2022 um I know like low cost is part of that I'm not exactly sure when compressed nfts went live I'm curious if that played into the adoption that you've witnessed or like how did you start that Network effect and now that you have over 800 000 wallets have received an airdrop yeah we um so we turned on compression when we're around 120 000 users so we already had scaled quite a bit to that point um yeah honestly uh uh it's just spread virally word of mouth I mean we we turned on we kind of from very early days we had a invite code system you had to have an invite code to get in and the way you got into that code was from somebody else and our early users were fanatical I mean there's every time they got into the code they would share with somebody else that they knew whether that was an internet friend or someone IRL or someone their family and um just had this like really um awesome K factor from from probably like December onwards uh and yeah I mean we've uh there's a lot of other things going on behind the scenes like we work with a lot of discords and telegram groups and and projects to distribute codes in different ways um but yeah honestly it's been totally Word of Mouth uh and nowadays we also work together with the creators to onboard their people so many of our creators have sizable audiences elsewhere 200 can Instagram million on Tick Tock and so on so when we bring them in uh we work together to try to transition some of their um some of their existing followers over when you close down Solana's spaces and you move to this because you saw this as the best onboarding mechanism did you think that this would happen or like yeah are you surprise by the attraction yeah I think I am surprised I think I am surprised um I thought it would be a little bit a little bit slower a little bit more difficult uh what people don't know is how much effort we spend on multi-account prevention as well like civil resistance so we've had this like Balancing Act from day one of uh figuring out new ways to grow new audiences to grow into at the same time stopping people from trying to kind of attack our systems and farm accounts um and yeah honestly uh the last couple months have been pretty mind-blowing and but there's I mean I this is not the first time I've built a social product I started my career in Social I started my career at ROBLOX and uh building a company called everyme which was a social network and like I think to me like the same stuff that we used to do kind of still applies like if you build a nice onboarding system if you have referral systems in place uh if people like the content and they're addicted to it like they they'll tell somebody else and at like enough scale that kind of that thing kind of has a life of its own so a lot of people actually don't know about your background and I do want to touch on that a little later in the episode but while we're talking about kind of the earlier days of drip one thing I'll point out is that at least on the Bird app or now the X app this wasn't necessarily A a fan favorite at first I would say you had some critics about the idea for drip and you know why are you spreading so many different nfts you're going to dilute my bags or you know just classic comments on Twitter and so you had to actually overcome a pretty fair amount of adversity I would say can you describe what those days were like uh and and you know what was your mindset when seeing these comments yeah we still get them so I guess I don't feel like we've overcome anything but uh yeah there was kind of this uncanny valley um of growth for us where in the early days uh our like the size of our drops was kind of competing with like art editions um and so for a lot of artists it felt like you know hey like you're giving away stuff for free and you know over here you know we're we're charging for it and therefore um you know you're stealing audience away from what would otherwise make the money into something that didn't cost anything and I I think for the most part we've overcome that just with scale because you can't you just can't compare a drip drop with anything else in crypto like there's no other there's nothing else out there that like consistently sends you sends out millions of nfts every single week so um if you thought this was competing with art now you realize this is really competing with Instagram and yeah we've for the most part we've gone past that uh nowadays the the big thing that's on my mind is how much financialization to welcome into this into this product because the crypto people all want to be financialized hyper financialized um my you know our team's vision is like completely the opposite but you know the same thing that you said about like you know why you're diluting my bags I think there's just like some level of expectation across all people that entered crypto that even if it was free and no matter how you kind of got in that you're going to take care of my bags in some fashion even if those things I didn't pay for so we we're um you know starting to see like hey I hold a bunch of nfts why aren't you doing this or that for me you know that kind of that kind of like stuff and um it's interesting but I'm very uh I've been around for a long time uh we listen to our customers but we also have a pretty strong sense for where we need to go and this thing only like the only way that drip is kind of a massive success to me is if it really breaks through out of crypto into many many other people's hands and it's something that gives a lot of people joy and a lot of people is like tens of millions otherwise it'll be very hard to make the economic subject even though the costs are small um they're not they're not as cheap as one two so um yeah we just try to keep stay focused on where we're going if there's fun let it let it happen that's just kind of natural with the territory I suppose talking about financialization um and speculation I know you're not a big fan of the speculation side of crypto it's probably like your least favorite part of this um it is interesting though because speculation is really comes down to being a game and like financialization is a game right in many ways like D5 is almost gamified to some sense so you talked about how you used to actually work at a gaming company uh and you said you've gotten a lot of inspiration from gaming and I think it was fortnite when shaping and building drips I'm curious like what do you see in gaming which many people probably know this but like gaming is bigger than music entertainment and movies combined um so it's a huge industry and especially with the younger population so I'm curious like what's been your inspiration from gaming or like what do you see in gaming today that you want to bring to drip um later on yeah that's a good Insight I mean every young person grows up playing video games that instead of watching TV um and they're playing you know things like fortnite but also like um you know Clash of Clans on their phone like they're playing these these very cheap kind of gotcha games as well um I think that I think games the best games are very good at uh reinforcing like positive feedback loops and kind of training your brain to um enjoy playing but also enjoy the uh like the journey to the reward and uh you know having to balance how much dopamine you're allowing someone to have it in a given moment it's just an interesting thing right if you played a game in like every three like let's just a theoretical game there's a treasure chest that shows up on screen every three seconds and you can tap it and open it there's a big confetti blast um and like you get some item in there right uh like okay I'm releasing dopamine me the first couple times open the chest but it starts to get boring right so um you want to you want to have a you know sort of like a a loop where I've done something I put in the effort I've checked once today I checked a couple times they had done this now I get to reward and you know it makes me want to continue to do this um so yeah games have just built the best feedback loops the best incentive mechanism the best uh like virtual economies as well I think they've fortnite think about World of Warcraft RuneScape these games really have nailed sort of how to build a virtual economy and then most crypto companies like especially in consumer space just like throw all those things out the window and just focused on like let's just build the economy and like none of the other like feedback loops are the other fun features and it just doesn't work like it just doesn't resonate um with like the masses I guess they like they're driven by fun and you know having something you do when they're bored and um and and not not much else so um yeah the product is is not fully fleshed out yet but I mean you'll definitely see over the next six months that the game the drip will feel more like a game um in terms of how we kind of push you in from being casual to being an expert uh but doing that without attaching Finance financialization to it uh is a challenge and uh and I don't you know I was thinking about this today like whether financialization of crypto is a bug or a feature I think it actually is just a feature I think you know when you browse Facebook mindlessly and they're feeding this uh you know all these all this content into your brain um you know we just sit there and let them use us for whatever purposes that they want um whether that's like altering the political landscape or you know serving us um you know McDonald's as whatever it is um we just let that happen I think the fact that crypto users kind of demand uh that they participate in those economics is like a very beautiful thing that we need we do need to acknowledge and figure out okay can we make them Equitable participants here make sure that like drift the company doesn't like take every single dollar out of you know um out of the ecosystem for ourselves because that's that's kind of how we end up back where we used to be before drip you were actually at Solana spaces and before then you had some other um you actually found a company again and you also had a pretty um great blog post I believe it was a blog post about your time at nest and what you've learned and kind of your journey so far can you give us a little research wow um uh yeah so uh yeah I just been doing Stars my whole life that's all I ever wanted to do was to build new things um and I think that the like thread between everything I'm interested in uh kind of starts at this like ship on my shoulder that I just I don't know why it's there I think you have one tumor I know you have one in fact and that that chip kind of just drives how I think about stuff and like my life's mission is really to uh you know take things that's aren't accessible and make them open to all and um and you know I what was appealing about Nest at the time was when I joined was that uh you know they were uh building these beautiful products that were kind of Forgotten in your home and um and Tony Fidel was just funny is probably like one of the most empathetic Rock designers ever like he he's he designed the iPod the iPhone um so being able to sit next to him and just hear how he thought about uh you know bringing people in into a thermostat was just a master class in in product design and uh like we I I didn't I was an executive I was a software engineer so I can't I'm not like saying I was in the room with him like that but his conference room was right next to me and he was spend hours in there just like breaking down the packaging that Ness came right and thinking about okay what should the person see first when they take the box off and what should be underneath that and um and like you you know these details uh that that level of detail um you just don't get to see that much and I think I've definitely borrowed a little bit from that and I mentioned on my little blog post that I haven't read in almost 10 years but um yeah coming into retail from from Ness was uh exactly I mean very similar to drip just in a different industry what we were trying to do was take the concept of having your product on a shelf and move it from something that was you know only for the very biggest companies and make it accessible to the smallest ones and uh even though um you know beta which is the name of the company doesn't exist anymore we had a very big impact on the retail industry like um retails all over the world now they all have programs that allow small retailers and Brands to come into their Source directly fashioned after what we did so yeah I definitely um definitely like if there's one life mission for me it's uh trying to think about breaking these artificial barriers like most of the barriers in our world were designed by people that uh were designed by people they weren't designed by markets and uh and and therefore like they have the flaws of those creators inside of them you know um there's so much to do I mean crypto is an amazing industry that uh if we can only skip past ourselves uh it will really have a big impact on on how the world works I love how you're an engineer um yep when you talk you're like so focused just on building a great product and you're thinking about the users and you're thinking about creators whereas the majority of builders in the space are on crypto Twitter especially and maybe the ethereum ecosystem and it's more like academic and you're arguing about like decentralized sequencers and I've heard you talk about like yeah D5 is great but that's like maybe not your thing or like you know like token protocols and so forth um so it's really refreshing and it's also exciting to see someone like you with that attitude has one of the most successful products out there in crypto today so I think that's really cool hey everyone quick break to tell you about Gino Gino's the number one liquid staking provider in Solana do you know has been known for the Meb software and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem Solana D5 summer is heating up and what asset do you want to use in D5 liquid safety tokens why because Vegito you can take your soul stake it and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token cheetosol you can then use Judo solo throughout the Solana D5 ecosystem while earning yields through Mev rewards and staking rewards with Jito and jitto makes staking super simple you can take your soul stake it get instant liquidity and start earning rewards all within three clicks and not only do they make it simple they make it secure Cheeto has seven audits they have more than a million sold stank and they're one of the most respected teams in all of D5 Geo is for whales who need deep liquidity it's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid staking you have your soul why not stake it earn some yield and start dabbling in Solana D5 so go get started today check them out at Judo dot networkdaking that's Judo dot Network slash taking I'll put a link in the show notes use the link so they know that I sent you and go get started today [Music] everyone we'll get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech Roll-Ups account abstraction Meb app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blindspeed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show one one thing I wanted to make sure and touch on because you are you're talking about how something like drip enables for like the long tail of creators um to get distribution and be able to get their assets out there and connect with the community but when you earn the age of AI and content creation and zero distribution costs how do you think about aggregation or curation to help put those artists out there because I think that has to be one of the most difficult uh parts of crypto and just Tech in general um I'm actually like uh personally like very anti-curation um which I think is in line with my accessibility thing like the world is full of people who um who want to sit in between um you know artists and creators and uh you know broker where those like who should be buying what and what things matter um I think what I like about nfts as a structure for this is that uh it can't be interrupted by uh a middleman it's uh when a when one of our creators drops content to you um it literally goes from you know their wallet through uh you know I don't know Helios okay we'll throw in some some tech in there but uh you know basically it goes directly from the Creator to um to the customer and uh and so you know the customers need like at the end of the day like the customers are the ones that's and and the recipients of these drops are the ones that um will curate with their dollars and with their attention in time um right now we just uh we have to make decisions because even though um it's very cheap to send nfts there's a lot of other costs to getting um started like for example uh one thing that we never talk about maybe we should is that just onboarding a single Creator into this data structure that compressed nfts use creating a tree costs you know close to 75 today so it's not zero I mean if you had 10 000 creators um you know now you're spending almost a million bucks right uh whereas you could put 10 000 rows in a in a database on YouTube or zero so uh it isn't it isn't free so we do have to be a little bit you know um we do have to gatekeep a tiny bit but I'm I think long term the play has to be to make this just a tool to facilitate a Creator building a list um of of followers and you know sending them composable assets so on Lightspeed me and Merritt like to pretend that we're we're creators or famous creators um how would we for example as a podcast use trip to you know create these entities and distribute it to the community like I guess one what would the selling point be and then how would that actually work yeah that's a good question um we've talked about it so uh this is not like a new new idea for me and we've definitely talked to many people at video podcasts um about this I think um you kind of get a bunch of stuff rolled into one right you have the ability to distribute this content freely just like you do I mean the podcast spec is built on like RSS right it's like or it used to be at least yep it is yeah we go through megaphone which then blasts it out to like Spotify Apple um and then we also post on YouTube yeah I feel like um RSS and like podcasts are like the most similar actually model to drip in the web 2 world because you uh like the user actually does have like some kind of ownership over that data just because of the way that most of these apps um try to sync between like what you're sending out and what the user has already done or seen right so um yeah you would build a list with us right we'd set up a Creator page for you people would subscribe and then we dropped in the episode every single week it would be um not fully different but what becomes interesting is you know hey maybe um you know uh there's a behind the scenes you know uh take or there's questions that didn't make it to the full version or there's other things that you might reserve for people who um donate to you or you know collected other editions or been there from day one um and this is very cool because uh you know people like to say oh I was listening to lightspeed from uh the very first episode but you can't really prove that today uh with with drip you really can like the chain doesn't lie so if you receive this content on day one you actually were there and uh that's interesting for the consumer but also gives you as the Creator awaits to like think about okay how could we like maybe take care of people who were here early who supported us um you know really deeply from day one to get to some bigger stage um this is something that you don't care about right now because you guys are just getting started by like think about you know a year or two or three years from now um you know you'll have a ton of data at your disposal to to build interesting programs yeah this might be a little bit wonky from like a podcaster's perspective but when when I thought about putting for example light speed on drip one of the things that comes to my mind is attribution because we want to see how many downloads we get for example on Spotify versus apple and I'm and I'm curious what type of attribution a Creator could get on something like drip um I know you've tweeted in the past about how you have a large focus on ux and because of that you wouldn't be able to say serve ads like you might have in web 2 which this kind of goes into the monetization of drip but I'm just curious as a as a Creator what what type of information could you get from your audience do you do you think about that and like almost mapping audiences out like having cookies of sorts on a blockchain I I know it's a lot of questions in one but I'm curious what you think about like no getting to know your audience through data that a Creator can see and drip yeah I mean I think you have different types of data than you have in web 2 um and you could of course instrument it with um normal data collection stuff like surveys and so on but um yeah I mean the chain uh you know has a full complete record of um what other things uh that wallet might be receiving or interested in what they're paying for donating to um you know imagine like if we had hundreds of crypto podcasts uh you know I think you'll have a pretty good sense of what other um people might be good candidates to listen to your podcast you can do that with zero zero part data like we don't even have to sit in between um you also could send your podcast to someone else's audience which is a a totally brand new idea that's only possible web3 um hey uh I don't know what's another podcast that you guys have today um we've got Empire bell curve zero X yeah all right you could send yeah like you could literally send the first episode of Lightspeed to Empire and you could do without their permission uh do people want this I don't know that's uh kind of the the jury will be out on that kind of stuff but um yeah I I uh attribution is interest is a very interesting question and you it's very hard to build a like a good ad uh business model without some kind of direct attribution and I've kind of um thought about this from a composable standpoint because your content is on chain sitting in the user wallet if that user's wallet touches anything else maybe it's something specific that you're trying to get them to do so you're trying to get them to also subscribe to your email newsletter um you know and that activity is is uh connected through the same same wallet now we have a link between these two things and we can build interesting incentive structures between them and you can literally pay people to do that right hey connect your wallet and sign up for email service and we'll give you a dollar right so um this is what many brands are already doing with drip today uh we're just observing sitting back watching many of the projects build out different attribution Solutions and they're all built they're all based around you know connecting that same drip while to Summer Place and doing without our permission which is a an incredible thing I'll just add to that because you can also as on top of everything website you can also just embed cookies and whatever sorts of trackers on the nft metadata itself just like web 2 as well so I would say you actually probably have better tools and or at least more expansive tools that you can use for attribution and tracking and while we're on maybe the topic contribution and so we've talked a lot about drip and what enables for users and creators a common critique that I've heard uh or I mean you've definitely heard is the monetization aspect for for drip itself right uh how do you think about that what how does how does drip make money does it need to make money um you know just uh I see you're already smiling so I'll let you take it I mean I just every time someone asks me I I'm like you know what thank you so much for your concern I'm really like you know it's like they say it in a way that's like as if we're not uh we don't realize that we're not faking money you know um yeah we're fully aware of that um yeah I mean uh when I what you know where I'm basing the entire feature of this business off of is the fact that um the most profitable companies in the world are all they all build free products and you know if you just look downstairs all the fan companies Facebook let's talk about Google or Facebook these guys make between ten dollars a user per month and you know forty dollars a user per month depending on where they are in the world um just from just from ads alone and you know I like making a hundred dollars a month off of a billion people you're one of the very best companies it's ever existed so that's kind of like the can we get to that place in the future and how do you ask for the hundred dollars right do you ask for the user to pay for that or do you ask businesses to pay for that um that's really just what it comes down to so you know my my our Direction here is let's build a big audience let's not reinvent the wheel of monetization there's lots of amazing models that have been built already let's figure out a way to you know at scale to help businesses um you know or even creators influencers reach the audiences that um they care about using nfts that's that's the critical path but like we overtuned monetization right now we are just shooting ourselves on the foot for sure uh and that's like our users want this because this is where we disagree with our users a lot because they want this to be um smaller because then the nfts might become more valuable there's less Supply um but it's just that going down that path is a path that takes us into you know just being another nft project we're not going to do that trip is going to remain free for a really really long time probably forever to talk about how maybe drip is impacting the industry as a whole I know it drips relatively new but clearly it has with the the volume uh that you picked up um you tweeted out how trips potentially shifted the Overton window to some degree um from some misguided ideas that we had about nfts and how a supplies meaningless nfts are not Investments free art does not mean bad art anything can be an nft and audience is greater than money I'm curious what do you think the future of nfts is going to be like like do you think it's something that's just used for everyday items do you think it's going to be more of the Collectibles and like premium objects that you see on ethereum what do you think the future of nfds is um I I think it's probably if I were to guess I mean it definitely is going to be a huge spectrum and there's no you can't I don't think we're going to get rid of them at all there's always going to be someone that has an idea for a digital Community they want to bootstrap them but I think the middle is going to be washed out I think you're going to have basically um a lot of freely accessible or hyper accessible nfts with big Supply and I think you have much smaller communities maybe even than 10 000 that are basically you know uh uh exclusive country clubs that just happened to be on the internet uh that that model like I can't find a fault with that model to be honest like I've you know either in Solana we have like Googles which is a collection of a hundred only a hundred and these things sell for I don't know 50 60 000 each um you know there's definitely like there's going to be space for that kind of stuff what I don't like about the 10K idea and that's kind of what I was talking about on those tweets is like 10K is a very arbitrary and weird uh like number to choose that all nfts you know decided that they're all only going to be ever ten thousand um like it's not small enough to be like you know only available to like the wealthiest class of of crypto people uh but it's also not big enough to be accessible to the masses so um like I guess if I were to guess it probably looks like the way our globe looks demographically like you have unfortunately uh most of the world is very very poor and probably like the vast majority of people are going to trade in very um they're not going to trade maybe they're going to be working with things that are free and have and have a lot of Supply um and you know there's a fee there's like uh the middle class has been disappearing for some time but um especially in developing world I just think yeah it probably mirrors that at enough scale but today I'm I'm fairly convinced that's like the 10K pfp game is done like we will not um uh we may see another like small small uh pump or something like that but but from uh like where they sit in the ecosystem I just don't get it I can't I can't find an argument for it so Vib you just made a very strong statement that drip will probably be forever uh free right and you have made similar strong statements in the past uh my particular favorite is this one I'm just going to read it this is on July 25th we will not launch on other chains if you want free art Comics music videos and in-game assets get a salon a wallet enjoyed 400k Plus on drip house if you don't want to try Solana that's fine you'll be missing out on the most fun and accessible products in crypto so obviously I retweeted that those are very very um based post and I want to ask the obvious question which is why do you feel this way I just what is the argument for what is the argument exactly for switching chains other than there's a foundation giving us a grant to go and build the same thing somewhere else like there's no first principles argument for why this is something that users want um and uh and and what we need to do as drip and as an industry is figure out how to break out of the crypto audience and find people that are not here today and if you jump from Solana to optimism or arbitrary whatever it is polygon it doesn't matter you are basically uh stating that uh we haven't solved or making our product interesting um all we've solved for is liquidity and trading and speculation and I just I I mean there's just you just you can't convince me that um anyone is doing that for the tech or because they can't get something out of Solana um so I'm just focused somewhere else Solana has the tools to scale to a billion users right now and um that's what I want to do that's what we want to do and going to ethereum bitcoin whatever chain it just doesn't doesn't solve that so um I don't know like I just everyone needs to keep their eye focused on the ball which is making crypto a part of the of the rest of the world so Vib what what are you cooking up overhead trip because this was I think a week ago you said in the next six months you're you're opening the floodgates and I think it's a quote you said Solana will never be the same um talking about having in the future bringing onboarding hundreds of millions of users so I'd love you yeah to talk about that yeah so um you know during the 20 21 uh Bowl we saw a couple of like famous people do things in crypto that included like buying or getting gifted at board Abe from moonpay most of them were being gifted these um or like dropping a 10K pfp collection that is probably worth zero dollars today um like those were the two things that like influencers did and what's interesting is that you understand creators today especially the biggest ones and you ask them what things they care about they don't care about making money they're making tons of money from sponsorships and you know I don't know they walk out on their the Kardashian TV show and they put their back on the table and Louis Vuitton pays them you know 600k for that right so they're not worried about money they're worried about audience they're worried about being relevant and getting their content in front of um you know the Next Generation and I think what dripit can offer here is um another way to reach young people that um is different and this is why they go this is why they you know if you look at Instagram Tick Tock every single one of them had their moment where uh Twitter even had this moment where you know it went from you know people uh like me who were in San Francisco um interested in sharing my thoughts to overnight like breaking through with some big influencer coming on board and as soon as that influencer shows up uh if it's the right one Kim Kardashian whoever you know was back in the day uh other celebrities start to show up you start to build this healthy flywheel where the mainstream audiences are interested in seeing what's going on over there so you know my my goal is to be ready for that moment and um you know we're not right now to be frank like why do I say six months I mean it might be a little bit longer um but uh we need a lot of stuff that we don't have we need a better way to sign up we need um there's a there's there's a number of things I won't go into and um once we're there once we feel like we've gone to that point we're a little bit away um we're gonna go hard after uh bringing in major content creators into the platform and some of them are coin operated um some of them will understand the vision uh it's just about finding the right ones and you know on that side uh there's uh it isn't so hard to reach these people I guess I'll just say that like the right content creators today there are investors they're investing in a lot of startups they're always thinking about what platforms are coming next and um they're not going to dismiss an audience of millions of people who are young wealthy connected and engaged a lot they're not going to want to miss out on that so uh we're just prepping for that moment and when the right person comes on board yes like Solana will change overnight because you're gonna have like five ten you know 20 million people that we've never seen who are going to be engaging with nfts in an interesting way and like of a small subset of those people are going to find the rest of the ecosystem do you think people are going to be doing that through like Phantom or backpack or so you're gonna need to be something easier where it's almost they don't even know that they're interacting on chain um they're gonna be doing that through the drip mobile app is that live today no no okay it's not even announced but we're definitely worth it so I'm gonna ask some um I think I'm gonna ask probably one of the more annoying questions for a Founder at least uh if I were you I'd be annoyed by this um so obviously you've you've found something here and it works and it looks promising and you have big big Vision here so it's only a matter of time before competitors start annoying you and I think maybe this is probably already happening to an extent um as a founder how do you think about competition uh I've been thinking about uh the idea of like founder paranoia because I know you know founders of very big companies as well like every founder you will never say it out loud I would never say it like that you know we care about competition like but but like yeah I'm definitely like always thinking okay like someone um you know what if there's a variation of this idea that's like a little bit different that's like much better right um and history is littered with like things like that you know like we like Snapchat as an example was like a tiny derivation on like 20 other mobile apps at the time like path and what I was building um but there's like something about the way that they built it that just um was a rocket ship and everything else kind of thing so yeah I'm always um um thinking about it but uh you know um Well we I'm not really sure what the question is you just said am I thinking about competition or Insurance how do you think about competition like what's your mental model yeah I mean what I what what I worry about is just to be honest like one of the hard things about building a crypto company is everything every aspect of our data is public like we you can't hide anything about our user growth our numbers supply all that kind of stuff like it's all out there retention if you wanted to like some user did an analysis the other day that was pretty amazing of of like how many of our users that receive a group nft as their first transaction on Solana like do other things in Solana um so it's interesting to have like a war field of people who can like attack the business model just from a data perspective and you know as a Founder like a venture back founder um like uber like you know I mean part of your job is to like understand the narrative and control it to an extent and you can't really do that in crypto um and then there's this other thing which is all of our users our wallets and all the wallets data is public and someone could tomorrow say hey this is jip two and by the way it works exactly like drip except uh we're gonna give you points or give you tokens as a reward for collecting and that is going to happen in six months and then you know we get blurred to death right um and like we can't even stop it because all the data is in public so that is a like the uh vampire attack is a very unique aspect of crypto that I definitely like I'm thinking a lot about but um so be it I've uh I've been around for a long time um and uh and I what I hope is at least we make an impact on the industry and um you know if we if we get to that point I'll be disappointed but but happy with with competition what do you think drips biggest mode is is it maybe the relationship with creators or is it the brand um it is it is right now but long term it's going to be a monetization um for sure like that's that's the only the only thing that will keep creators around is if we can figure out how to get them paid consistently um but this is a hard question because it's very tempting I posted this the other day it's really tempting just to like turn on features right now that just get them paid but don't set us up for you know um getting them paid over a long period of time so we're very sensitive to that stuff I promise every single day we sit down and like at least one idea that we discussed that's like off The Vision what would be good for the short term um and staying focused on on the long term uh is um yeah it's hard but but it's something that we are we are we are doing so taking a step back while we're maybe on a meta founder and startups topic of um competition whatnot how do you think about obviously drip is a very distribution heavy platform it's the name of the game for representative distribution uh but you also obviously worked at nest and you earlier in the episode you talked about how you learned to appreciate detail and product design and how that's influenced some of your thinking how do you think about especially in crypto where you just said everything is like open source people can see everything how do you think about product versus distribution in crypto what is what is just uh say my uh most Niche short again what is your mental framework for navigating product versus distribution um I mean I I think for pretty much everyone um like there's this you know very famous meme in the final world which is like the term product Market fit like it's so popular that it has an acronym and everyone uses pmf pmf EMF and um I've always been skeptical of that of that idea because um like most of the world's best products um were created creative markets out of thin air and like there was no market for search when Google was founded like Google um you know and those companies like made that happen so I think there's uh a lot more science to building companies than than people think I think product Market fit is like this uh idea that like you're going to keep building your product and then one day it's going to fit some market and then things will really take off then um but but in my experience so far um there's a push and pull at every every at every moment between those two and you are kind of whittling away at both at the same time and really great Standalone products like standout products they um they create markets from from their existence and from the sheer power of the narrative and the and the comms that um that they produce and uh I think like where a lot of Founders go wrong is just building building endlessly um wondering why nobody's showing up but uh it's much more important in in that Spectrum to you know figure out how 50 or 100 people are going to love your product and uh you know building something just for them and then you know seeing where it goes like product is just the easiest thing to do because you can kind of you can just like commit code to to get every day right and you feel like you're making progress and like why isn't why aren't things working um but nobody cares about what anyone is building in the world they only think about what's fun and interesting for themselves um or what's or what's useful and so um yeah my my thought is like yeah if you're like if I had to choose I would build distribution before product um uh if you're a little bit more experienced you kind of build those things together in lockstep and you try not to push one too far ahead of the other that's a that's a great answer do you think there is a there's an inherent difference because you've been a Founder in both web 2 and web3 now do you think that's an inherent difference between being a Founder in web 2 and web three yeah there's a huge difference um in a lot of ways for sure the biggest change for me was building in public having to tweet all the time I didn't tweet before um I I was in crypto uh and I found out I was very good at it but that wasn't like I'm not an influencer I just uh I just like speak English very well so um like that's sort of been like the the way that we kind of got into the ecosystem um and then the hours are very intense like our the when I'm ready to sleep most of the world is waking up and so like that's when it's most hot on Twitter most hot on Discord and all of our kind of customer service channels so um you can't you can't you cannot work nine to five if you're a US citizen in crypto you have to you have to work like tend to like you know midnight pretty much um and then weekends too you don't get weekends off because I I don't think anyone in crypto understands that other that the builders Behind these products have lives they they're very insistent um they hold you to a high standard um I also think the investors are very different like uh web 2 like raising money I've raised over 100 million in web 2 and uh the discussions there are very focused on um you know uh what is like what does this thing look like in five seven years I think crypto investors are very impatient I think they um they want tokens like 90 of the VCS I met um uh they'll say a lot of things but what they want as tokens and what they understand is um is you know having privileged access to a token Supply at a low cost and being able to uh sell it on top of retail when they don't care about the vision as much as that stuff in some cases uh and yeah they're much younger like everything in crypto is Young like I don't know how old you are murdered but are probably about the same age um yeah because are you in your 40s 40s mid-30s mid-20s yeah 17. okay well I mean that's uh yeah that's the hair though I'm definitely I'm definitely old for for our for this industry but uh yeah super super young so I still feel weird like on Twitter I have no problem like you know like saying things that like 19 year olds say uh I can't do it in real life like I can't I'm not going to be sitting here saying like that's you know that's okay you know all that no cap right um like it just I can't utter those words but on Twitter I'm just like yeah you have a good Twitter you have a really good Twitter hey uh talking about VCS I'm curious like what is the metric that you think matters most um to trip like what are you watching and then I do like this concept of like a hidden metric so maybe you can't quantify I'm curious on both of those what would you say um we we mostly been focused on Dau um daus right now um most of the stuff that we're kind of working on in the future is like focus on driving daily um daily use to our website today is pretty strong because people come back to play this game we have called legendary lock-in where they can um open a treasure chest once a day and and lock in a low Supply Edition um so yeah d-a-u-m-a-u and then um hidden hidden thing I mean like my brain right now is like very wrapped up in um in civil stuff so like I've spent and this is the hidden like thing that we've been working on forever is just like trying to control how many people want to game our system in different ways um I think that way we're very similar video game companies because any company video game that has a virtual economy has like a lot of I'm an effort focus on trying to separate real from unreal from from inhuman um so yeah like there's Dau and then there's like on the onboarding side um like how many unique human beings are accessing drip um yeah like more difficult in web 3 than web 2 for sure do you have any last questions or others otherwise I'm just gonna do rapid fire let's do the rapid fire all right let's do it so bib uh this is a rapid fire section I just make up questions I don't prepare these beforehand um and you try to answer them as quickly as you can but obviously if some of the answers or questions require further Insight or you want to dive into it feel free uh but yeah we'll just keep it short and fun okay all right so uh okay well you just said you are you found out that you're good at Twitter what are three tips to people listening to be better at Twitter um active voice uh Humanity and keep your links out of the out of the main post put them in the same posts does humanity mean like don't be a troll or no it means like be human like don't be uh uh don't sound like a robot or like an average Advertiser yeah gotcha that's a that's a very important one actually especially in the age of AI and you can always kind of tell who's using chat GPT and who's not right um if you weren't building drip or would you be building um probably a uh theme park did not expect it what type of thing I don't know I just like the idea I've just I think it'd be really interesting challenge to build like a modern theme park like most theme parks that are very old um they like uh they they're kind of like uh I've had this theory for a long time that that like that you could start a a blockchain centered around like a theme park and build from there because like the best biggest theme parks in the world they have like cities that like pop up around them do you need hospitals and hotels housing for the workers like Disney Springs right in in um in Florida and so like you want to start a digital Nation like you can make the center point this like Hub of of activity and fun entertainment and um like there's so many interesting rides and experiences that nobody's ever no one has ever built so yeah unfortunately those things cost like billions of dollars and um take you know a decade or more to plan so I haven't been haven't found the time for it so actually I remember you saying something about D5 and having a controversial take on that what are your thoughts on defy um you know what I'm gonna be honest I don't really understand it I don't understand why uh like I don't even understand what some of the terminology means like there's like this is a complexity of like some of these things I don't know why anyone would care I don't think any real person wants to swap things back and forth um like I like loans on chain are just a complete dead end like everybody abuses them um it's just there's just no accountability there um there's no like none of the credit scores matter like none of the things that anyone's built of mattered there so as much as like the theory is very interesting the only like D5 thing that I care about is like swapping between the base layer token and um and ustc and pretty much nothing else I don't think it's a scam I just don't get it personally sorry that's fair that's fair do you get it do I I I'd like to think so I I mean I like it um but I I do agree that it is certainly not user friendly in any sense of the words so far and obviously with somebody like you who's super focused on that part I can I can see how you would think that way how often do you do anything with your bank in real life um and do you want to and do you enjoy it no I don't I do not um probably like my biggest use for Defy is using Jupiter and I'll just mess around and do like liquid staking to like help secure the network and then I'll use that to like get points on margin or something like that um but but I do agree that it needs to be made much more accessible and have other use cases um so maybe actually maybe I don't get it as much as I think I do uh but I do think it's pretty fun yeah for me it's like I I see use cases for maybe like five percent of the population for example getting access to uscc or US dollars in a nation that you can't do that I think it's a valuable use case that we have right now I also see it as something like fantasy football or you know right now I have friends that are betting on digital horses um I think they could use D5 over that for at least I know speculation may not be high utility but something that's true but there's kind of a bug right because like no normal person cares about what the underlying uh currency is they just want to spend their dollars or their pounds or wherever they live right um it's just kind of an artifact of are of crypto that like we've we have thousands of tokens that have wildly trading you know uh prices like I don't like I you couldn't I would never want my mother to um like swap US Dollars into like some random token I don't know like Pepe and like hold on to that for any reason whatsoever like that kind of stuff I just I don't know I just feel like it's yeah I think I don't know I think I think that sort of stuff is maybe for the power user or the power Degen uh whereas I think that maybe the Mass Appeal who uses that you know you would actually tell your mother hey you know buy this coin I don't think that's really the use case I think it'll be more like um you know we I mean I don't want to say Celsius or block five but like uh trading on like dexes and like getting passive yield from that and stuff like that that could be interesting if there's a intuitive layer on top of it but as it stands currently then I I would agree with you I don't think it's ready well I'm gonna play this I think what's very if not understand it what I think is very stupid is that um that people think that if that the chain only works if the defy ecosystem is working that's an absolutely absurd concept like uh no the chain works if real people want to use it for things that they care about Point Blank like nothing else TV all that stuff it's all it's all made up stuff it's a good uh it's a good hot take I think my last point on it I think if if somehow defy can help improve the efficiency and allocation of capital in whatever way that is then like that would that would be the end use case but yeah I think it'd be hard to argue that that is happening today I think what we should do is we should have Vib and somebody from salon and D5 on here for an episode in a few weeks or a month and uh they should battle up because I think like you're making some solid points as well I mean I just I just can't I don't understand it so I don't want to I wouldn't want to be in that situation like these Founders are good people I I'm sure that they are building something that in their worldview makes sense I just don't I just don't think it's going to solve the fundamental um thing that we need to solve as as industry which is like convincing people like my mom my younger my younger brother to be interested yeah I don't disagree and it's actually partly why I say like we need much better marketing and messaging like why should I care about Solana why should I care about order books and all this like we need to messages much better um okay back to Rapid Fire uh who's one CEO you look up to in the whole entire world in history our world in history hmm um what I'll give you a weird answer um you remember uh this company called MoviePass oh yeah yes yes I just I thought that I thought that was such a he was he's such an interesting uh CEO you can read about him sometime in his background but like I'm very uh um taken by like foundries you have like ideas that like only work at like a really really massive scale like those ideas have a lot of appeal to me because most of the time they just um they don't work but uh but I enjoy the I I I'm happy to know that there are people out there who can see like a a problem at a very big scale and and want to fix it at the highest level um for people that don't know like pass is basically trying to like Netflix uh you know uh the movie industry the movie theater world where you could uh subscribe for a fixed fee and then go see as many movies as you wanted in the theater and great idea and they got squashed by the you know the the like Monopoly of the of the big theater companies who are all going out of business anyway um so yeah that's that's probably the weird answer that came to my mind when you said that I actually use a similar service today in Canada it's called Cineplex Plus or something so cine Club so I actually like the idea talk about Netflix what show is nobody watching that they should be watching so there's nobody watching that they should be watching um so uh my like popcorn answer is like my my wife and I we really enjoy uh the circle um have you seen that show yeah I don't know why I just really I don't know are a lot of people watching it but like I don't know I just enjoy it it's like it's fun it's interesting to see how people um behave in these like in these weird experiments um basically like since crypto and and drip like there's just no time because at night we're working every night so I don't have any like interesting picks there unfortunately yeah buddy what do you think about Doodles Who start off as just an nft collection and I think now they may not even call themselves an nft you know company uh more than IP company like do you think that's a route that's gonna work I'm pretty bearish on that category of companies because I just I think that um there's a I'm sorry I might hear my uh sun in the background crying no worries um like there's a very binary moments uh in the traditional ft world where like the second that you ask the community to fund your um your project by buying your nfts um your life will never be the same again uh like I I know I've gotten to know a lot of nft project Founders I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy because now you have ten thousand or four thousand people that are wondering when you're going to give them return forever and the thing is we don't have a good mechanism for Brands and IP companies to deliver value in the way that nft holders want it um based on the success of that entity so you just end up in a point where you have these two disconnected things like I think you can build a great brand like of course you can but um trying to tie that to something that someone paid money for as a digital asset without breaking the law right now is virtually impossible so you know like the thing that drives the price on a tease is speculation and non-delivery there's no project that has delivered on the roadmap that has satisfied holders because you just can't you can't satisfy them you deliver I mean the worst thing you can do is deliver a roadmap to be honest that's why I like the very best Founders at FC Founders like the ones that have kept their price very high they do very little and the game for them is uh pushing the ball another step forward of course all of them will um will collapse at some point but um you can keep that going for a couple years for sure I'm not talking about anyone in particular um how old's your son uh my son is three my daughter is five how do you explain drip to your daughter um I haven't but she um she does she does like wander into my zoom meetings a lot when I'm talking to artists so and she really loves drawing my son is three man he doesn't understand anything but she um uh she likes looking at the art and she really likes the cleaners so she likes to start we have a Pink Dinosaur that I bought her um so sometimes she'll come and ask me if she can see it I don't think she understands what's going on it's just the picture for her right does drip have a one-liner like how you describe the company yeah we say uh free digital gifts from your favorite creators okay two more questions um other than the D5 one what do you think is your most controversial take that you believe is true um none of the blockchains are worth their market caps today I I think they're all worth a very very tiny fraction of what they um what they are like basically blockchains get value like get value it adds the like 50-year terminal like valuation of that Network like they just um and not anywhere based on the economics of those underlying networks like I uh for all of the of the next gen blockchains I have a deep concern about whether or not they will make enough money um from from the fees to pay to pay for the cost of the network because it scales because you know Helios I mean is something that kind of helps with this a little bit but like uh like to me uh like the 50 biggest apps and the 50 biggest infrastructure companies like built on something like Solana will all be significantly bigger than Solana itself and this is like uh like a flipping that that no one will talk about until it happens but you know that's partly because the apps aren't big enough and infrastructure isn't big enough but partly because all the networks are overvalued I actually think Anatolia feels the same way uh which which it's it's a very um under the radar thing but I think you're right where the apps and the infrastructure companies will be bigger than the chain itself and then thus they have an incentive to keep the chain going which kind of really changes to economics and economic model of the chain um okay last question so you're obviously a Founder yourself and you've founded companies before you've raised money you've built products you've done distribution you've probably spent way too much time on on on um you know thinking about things no human should be thinking about as a Founder um if you could compress compress your what you've learned so far and give it as advice to aspiring startup Founders or other startup Founders in crypto what will those sentences be um one uh this is it will serve as a disclaimer for the advice don't listen to anybody because um everybody is wrong all the investors some of your and most of your customers um sometimes your team members like there's so many external forces that want to exert their um what is good for them even if they don't mean to it just happens so um you know for a founder uh like to go from the first time they've started a company to becoming Jeff Bezos part of the part of your personal process is becoming very centered in your um in yourself and your beliefs so and and I think that uh that's a very that's just a very important thing to um understand what has value to you and not let other people um uh convince you otherwise um I think two and that includes me don't listen to me uh as well um or anything I'm saying here uh I think two uh you know most of like a lot of a lot of uh a lot of what I think about is kind of this like Global local thing where you I'm sure you think about this too where uh the stuff that where you want to go and the things that you have to to do to get there feel very disconnected um and you want to kind of tie all those things together into into like a tidy narrative but uh but the reality is that's uh the history is written by the winners and if you see outside some other company um and they've told their story in a certain way and it feels like this linear path um that's always a lie like every company is twisting and turning and making mistakes and and like you know facing like near-death situations whether it's Facebook or it's a you know magically um like all those all those things have the same thing problems and when you get to the top then you get to tell the story how you how you want it so you know I guess I guess the point is like uh it's okay to like it's okay to experiment with things that don't don't fit the long-term Vision it's okay to make mistakes um but I like the Jeff Bezos thing which is uh make sure that all your doors are two ways this is why this is why like the nft the 10K nft thing when you have a project like a really promising software product and they launch it um nft collection you get very worried for them because that's that is a one-way door um and you remove a lot of optionality for yourselves same with tokens to be honest the same thing with doing like an Ico um and uh yeah the third thing would be um uh find a an awesome um uh like get a white for or or like a spouse because um you really uh it's really easy to uh it's really easy to get lost in what you're doing and lose especially in crypto which is such a crazy like it's hard I'm sure you know it's hard to talk to other like normal people about the world that we were in um but I think like I think friends that are outside having a support system having family and a spouse that can keep you anchored in the real world um is more important than ever today so uh mert are you are you single no I actually surprisingly have a girlfriend uh four years now that's great lock that down it would be a great decision yeah you don't want to go on a date and have to describe what
