[Music] hey everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed with Richard and Ilya the founders of tenser guys welcome to the show hey good to be here thanks for having us yeah glad to have you I want to talk about how nfts are becoming the next trillion dollar asset class and how we're gonna get there and I think to get the audience prepared for that let's start with a high level overview of what tinser is and how a team of two devs took on Magic Eden which has a firm of over 120 employees so Richard maybe if you want to start I think that'd be great just to give a high level overview yeah I guess I could start from the beginning so uh just briefly I know I've mentioned this on other pods but Elena Emily and I met back in March 2022 we kicked it off by trying to look for a co-founder to work together on a cool project long story short we initially worked on an NFC pricing Oracle we found that there was no product Market fit there no one wanted to buy it uh so we pivoted to building an nft trading platform I think what we initially underestimated was how competitive this space was we obviously knew magic Eden was the big player in the space we obviously knew there were a couple of other players that were still pretty big at the time like hyperspace like Coral Cube and they were doing cool things with nfts I think for us we saw that there was an opportunity to appeal to the prosumer audience we call them the pros but realistically like there are no Pros in the nft space like we're all just a bunch of dgens trying to flip nfts and jpegs for profit uh so really we were targeting the prosumer segment that was heavily underserved by existing platforms and we wanted to build a truly revolutionary experience when it comes to trading nfts in bulk in size on a very simple to use UI that almost looks like a binance or a buy bit almost like a centralized exchange term and experience and so that's when we started working on this Pro nft trading platform we also went into an accelerator called Alliance they helped us a bunch when it came to strategy when it came to marketing and long story shorts we basically followed a similar Playbook to blur which is obviously the the big success on ethereum who overtook openc which is obviously a very big company on ethereum and you know since then we've sort of uh developed our own personality and uh we're trying to pave our own way on Solana yeah that's a great intro how does the so how does the nft trading actually work so I think when sensor first went live to bootstrap you started with an aggregator is that right and then what are some of the products that you offer today because I know you want to get to the point where it's like a true order book but that maybe doesn't exist yet so what how what does the offering look like right now yeah it's a mixed bag of things so the the product that we shipped right after the aggregator was the amm and for anybody who doesn't know amm stands for automated Market maker it's just a fancy way of saying hey if I give you a bunch of Soul where I give you a bunch of nfts you can just run the trading strategy for me so you either sell on a curve or you buy in a curve or there's a third thing you can do which is called Market making where you both buy and sell on a curve and that was interesting because it was novel it unlocked new trading behavior that you couldn't do with traditional entity marketplaces but what we also learned over time was that there's a there's a tool for each job and yes for some of the more advanced Guys these amms were good but for you know normal retail traders who might have one or two nfts they were they were Overkill it was too much and so over time we added features that are more similar to the trading you see on traditional marketplaces like Open Sea like magikita and just kind of traditional buying list and sell and so today like we have three different contracts at Bart denser one for bidding one the amm and normal listings and then we have a third one completely separate one for compressed nfts this is just a long-winded way of saying that guys ultimately the only thing that matters is the ux for the user the user doesn't give a what delivers it you need to build whatever you have to build as a developer and then hide it away behind a beautiful UI and just make it work for the user um yeah that's what we have today so I mean obviously you think very deeply about products and the user experience one other thing that maybe some some rice doesn't know is you guys both have Finance backgrounds so Richard uh did some Quant work sort of juice yeah and so I guess I'm curious you guys could have went to D5 you could have went into something else why did you choose to build for nfts I think at the time we felt that D5 was pretty crowded obviously like we knew a lot about Finance uh Ilia was an investment banker I was doing Quant research on sort of the traditional financial markets and so we had the one I guess the knowledge and to the skill set to actually build something interesting in defy but I think at the time we just felt it was a bit too crowded and there was not a lot of like green field for us at least to work on um that's when we sort of like looked towards nfts and we saw that the financialization of nfts was heavily unexplored both on ethereum and on Solana this was before the time of pseudo Swap this was before the time of blur before the time of tenser there was practically no interesting Financial Primitives that were being built for nfts that were similar to what was happening in D5 and we saw that as an opportunity as almost like low-hanging food for us to tackle uh the second thing is like we found that nfts were like pretty fun to uh play around with and the community was like the query represents Twitter if you go on like crypto Twitter like one in like two people will have a an ftpfp profile and we thought that was pretty cool because nfts are almost like a representation of the crypto culture it's where people convene socially and rally behind um when it comes to like the crypto community and we wanted to build something in that space I don't know if Ilya had a different View at the time but maybe you can comment on that yeah I think it's pretty much that it was just a newer asset class fewer things were done like we started building right at the tail end of the previous poll Market um and guys there were a lot of really smart D5 teams at the time trying really interesting things and we just kind of didn't feel that we had an edge where we were like stepping into a Sandbox where there were guys who are thinking about this for years with nfts it felt more nascent um it felt more like okay there's fewer teams the teams that exist are less technical some of the concepts that they're trying are also less technical like we basically had I think that the initial um hunch that got us excited about building denser into what it became today was this idea that most people saw nfts as kind of this ebay-esque experience of shopping and we saw it more from the trading perspective and there weren't many people at the time who shared that vision and we thought that okay that's a different way of looking at it which means that we can build a more interesting product and whenever you're a Founder you're basically looking for these moments of like where do you see the world differently to other people like I think Paul Graham or somebody said like you basically need two things you need to see the world differently and you need to be right obviously the second one was a lot harder but you know you don't try you don't know well I mean one thing that comes to my mind then is so you you guys were exploring so you thought D5 was too crowded and you thought there was Greenfield nfts and it was an unexplored space in a sophisticated way like nobody had escorted deeply so I guess then the question is why pick Solana over something else like what what why start your journey on Solana I think for us when we thought about how we enable trading behavior for nfts or building the Perfect Trading experience for nfts we didn't consider ethereum because frankly like if you're trying to trade nfts back and forth in a lot of quantity in with many transactions and at the time this this was so during the Bull Run of ethereum where gas fees for transferring and nft minting at nft was 20 30 40 plus we just didn't see that as something sustainable that someone could feasibly trade nfts back and forth with that sort of fixed cost of gas and be profitable at the very end what we have it what we envisioned like with nft trading was that people could trade these nfps back and forth without having to worry about essentially a a fixed cost that could amount to you know 10 100 basis points even a thousand basis points for certain nfts like that was just not sustainable long term um and and frankly like in hindsight it makes a lot of sense there is this liquidity effect on ethereum where people sell trade on ethereum because that's where all the money is that's where all these high-pressed nfts are but we're still pretty bullish that Solana and the low gas fees well not gas fees but like low transaction fees transactions confirming in less than a second we think that is what the trading experience for nfts should be uh long term I saw you tweet and you said that you started doing the funding round for tenser basically on the day that FTX collapsed if not the exact day I think over those next three months you had over 15 BCS give you no because they said like you need to leave Solana like why are you still building on Solana so I know you obviously chose salon and you almost just described why but what else what else were you looking at because you had a specific product in mind where you wanted to Target professional Traders but you also wanted to have great ux UI which required latency as well so was there any other chain that you guys looked at for tensor at that time a short answer is no because no other chain had even resemblance of a nft community like ultimately as a Founder you need an interesting Tech to work with but probably more importantly you need real users that care about the community they're in and let's be real guys like at this point it's two it's ethereum guys and like all the ethereum like nearby communities I wish I mean the l2s and it's Salon everything else is I mean I'm not saying it's not going to be huge in the future for all I know it might be but as of right this moment there's nothing there it's all like Builders building for future users that are going to come at some point and at least we felt that we were better positioned to build an app that serves real users than a piece of infrastructure that serves developers that one day build that app for users and so that was kind of a hard constraint for us not that we wrote it somewhere on the Whiteboard and we said like this is why this is just like intuition it's kind of what was telling us that that's where we should look and I guess to to answer your your question a bit more deeply about like why Salata it's interesting because yesterday I was on on an ether space and somebody asked us like hey why do you guys think am impulse took off on Solana and they never took off on ethereum I was like why does denser have so many uh has the name impulse that's so popular and it was so obvious to me it was like because it's cheap like it's so cheap to send these transactions on chains so people do a lot more of it so they trade back and forth a lot more and so what we saw in Solana and what we continue seeing to this day is just a different design space that's completely unexplored with existing products underneath you know I keep saying this it's not better it's not worse it's just different and like the product is going to be built on this chain are different and we have a very clear thesis for what you can build on Solana that you can build on other chains and for wide matters and I know we'll get into that with like compressed entities and whatnot but ultimately for us we want to build a company that serves millions and hopefully ideally billions of users one day and I think Solana frankly is one of the only chains as of today where you can do what do you think about path dependency because you saw a beachhead with professional traders in Solana and using that speed but you have somebody like magic Eden who's starting probably more retail focused and then they're making their way to professional Traders do you think you have an advantage um starting where you are with professional Traders and I believe there's almost a convergence probably of tinser and Magic Eden and other competitors who you're starting a professional they're starting a retail and in some convergence where you're getting closer to also catering to retail as well here's how you think about that and as a retail user like why should I pick tensor today or is it not there yet that's a great question I think there are parallels for what happened in the centralized exchange space so if you think about like coinbase they definitely went from a more retail approach and then slowly built uh towards Pros with their coinbase Pro which they later merged into sort of the regular coinbase app but then they also have coinbase institutions which was clearly targeted towards the pros and then you had FTX on the other side obviously FTX had a lot of other issues with it but they catered to the pros first and then went down to retail buying out stadiums putting their brand essentially everywhere that retail people would see I don't think there's like necessarily uh I don't think one or the other is necessarily better I think it's like you said it's very path dependent magic hidden just saw that clearly there were a lot of retail people who wanted to trade nfts we came in after them and in order for us to differentiate it against magic Eden and what I mean frankly a pretty great product they had at the time we needed to Target an underserved user segment and that happened to be the pros and this usually happens in a lot of a lot of these industries so I think to your point to your question about why would a retail person use tensor nowadays I don't think we have like a thing to show a retail user like why you should choose tensor over magic Eden besides trying to sell them like super hard and essentially trying to buy their favor and like essentially trying to buy them to use tensor I think that'll come with us creating differentiated products and features so one of the things that we're trying to do right now and and trying to push hard on and I think mert knows this is compressed nfts we think that compressed nfts are the vehicle for onboarding the next million users into crypto and into digital assets and the one way that we get more retail users is to build something that no one else has which is support for these compressed nfts first when it comes to trading and secondly of course creating them managing them and everything you can imagine you would want to do with digital assets so really like I I can't give you a straight answer for why retail might use tensor over magic in right now I think I'll just come based on the stuff that we build that's differentiated that will attract new users to our platform following your story chronologically here so you we're exploring design spaces and you essentially double down on nfts NFC Finance on Solana and so now you are essentially two pretty hungry devs and you you choose to build this new platform but then you know the the elephant in the room is Magic hidden right so now you have this massive competitor who has I think at that point they had to raise a series a and they have a lot of funding and a lot of Mind share and market share as well how did you like maybe a matter question is how did you think about that as two Founders like how did you approach competition how are your thoughts on this have evolved over time yeah it's probably another one of those questions where there's no single answer like how do you win against another competitor well I mean where do you start and stop right there's like a million things that matter from the quality of people you hire to who your investor is and how good of an advice they give you and ultimately like how good is your hunch for the product because at the end of the day all of these are bets like them us the next guy we're all making bets about the future we're saying like we think the market is going to go this direction we think the market is going to go that direction and depending on how successful or unsuccessful those bets are is basically like whether you come up on top or not but I guess maybe to touch on a few things that we think matter so you mentioned how like magically done our biggest competitors are super well capitalized a large team we don't necessarily think that's a good thing um having a lot of capital can make you lazy and right now the market is such that it's actually not obvious how you deploy that amount of capital the other thing that it does is it creates a very layered web to style corporate structure with seven layers of management between you and the decision maker by you I mean the dev and so the dev that is actually working with the product or is actually talking to people on Discord who has intuition for what needs to happen can't action it because he needs to go all the way up and ask like hey is this part of our roadmap that's part of our roadmap that's part of a quarterly report well for us I mean we just turned on a dime like we just show up at the office you know we're actually three deaths now not two deaths and we're still hiring in case anybody is interested so you know we show up in the office we look each other in the eye we just said like does this film make sense and if it doesn't we just throw it away and we move on to the next thing that does make sense and we think that in crypto given how quickly this industry is changing those kind of nimble small teams are the teams they're going to win because you can just make decisions a lot faster you can iterate you can make mistakes and you can be onto your next thing when your competitor is still worried about you know the thing that you you basically abandoned three three years ago so that's maybe one thing um another thing is I would say I can't comment on Magic either or anybody else's obsession with the product because I don't know but I can comment on ours and I think it's pretty much you know as as obsessive as it gets I I mean all of us double as customer support agents partially because we have to partially because we love to like I go into Discord and I want to hear what users have to say and like as soon as I see feedback that I know is going to take me 10 minutes to implement it just go and do it like straight away because I don't want the user to have to wait for like you know seven layers of people to approve it and then somebody just say like okay yes this can be built and so I think again going back to speed going back to agility that kind of gives us an edge but like ultimately I think time will show and it'll really be a battle of placing the right bets and putting the right conviction behind them we'll get away from Magic 80 and some of the comparisons but I think it's good to frame it because in January 2022 magic Eden had 98 of the market share and right now you're sitting at like 47 so it's been a big change but that really all started um was this back in February or no March 2023 I think you had about two percent of total market share at that time and then you launched your first um loot box program kind of like an airdrop where based on it's very similar to what blur did um it's loyalty points and based off that I think you can win some nfts et cetera um but you just saw a ginormous like exponential rise in the number of users and volume I'm curious like as a crypto developer how do your systems handle that like I've seen you I think Ilya you talked about 90 of the code of the protocol is not actually on chain or the contracts it's like data pipelines it's the front end how does that have how can you scale like that I think like just just to be like very um objective here I don't think the volume and the amount of traffic we're getting is even comparable to what a web 2 company that is serving hundreds of thousands if not Millions if not billions of users is handling right now I think like the the amount of technical demand or I guess stress that we're experiencing is probably like equivalent to like an average consumer app in web 2 which is good for us because we're I mean me and Ilya at least for me I I don't have experience writing an app that scales to a million like a consumer app that skills to a million users like my background is quat models and machine learning models that predicts stock returns um so for me this was all entirely new but the benefit is like we're both very hungry we like to learn we like to try new things we're very principled in the way that we approach uh like like building a new product building a new building on a new framework and I think that's what you need to succeed especially as a Dev is to just be able to learn quickly and be able to iterate on what you've done so far and just continue building and building better better pipelines a better product a faster UI a better architecture I think this would be a good time to transition to compressed nfts um Richard I've seen you tweet that it would make sense for every nft and crypto to be a compressed nft and Ilya you then later go on to say that everywhere in the like in your everyday life you're going to be dealing with nfts all the time so essentially compressed nfts are going to be everywhere I think the average person has no idea what a compressed nft is so I think maybe let's step back and give an idea of what that is if you can explain it to the audience and then we'll get into what the compressed nfts can actually enable yeah so the simplest way to explain compressed nfts is just this thing that mert can charges for and feel okay about it but it all Terraces though so uh we are using Helios and they've been great uh but yeah to to go back to the definition so compression of keys simple definition it's the cheapest possible way in crypto to create an nft so cheap in fact that I think a billion of keys I think it's about ten thousand dollars to to Mint which is like nothing and that's like a billion if you if you scale down to Millions it's like a thousand or less now why does that matter well it turns out that a lot of things in life if you make them cheap enough you can basically 10x the market size great examples of that are car rides food delivery things that people thought normally you would maybe do once a week you know like you'd get takeout or something all of a sudden if it's one tap away and it costs you nothing you can get it in 30 minutes people do it a lot more and all of a sudden it's like a daily thing and so you 10x to Market size maybe you even more the market size and so we that's our bet with compressed nfts where the initial meta of nfts that existed after today was all about scarcity and getting fewer people involved and getting those people to pay up more you can think of them as luxury goods we think that the next matter of nfts will be the polar opposite of that it'll be about involving as many people as possible and in order for you to do that you have to make these things as cheap as possible and that's why we're like so hyper bullish this technology and on Salon I guess Solana is to quote the meme the only place where it's possible right now and for us like when we ask ourselves the question of how do we build a product that caters to a million or to a billion people then well it probably starts with you being able to create an asset that cost you nothing because then all of a sudden you enable distribution models such as drip where you have hundreds of thousands of subscribers that receive free nfts and all of a sudden they're engaged and there's a conversation between the Creator and the receiver there's donations back to the Creator so there's like a myriad of things that open up once you can do that but yeah ultimately all goes back to cost and uh Solana right now is the only place where you can do that yeah it's compressed nfts are this very interesting new primitive where before we just thought of nfts as you know pfps 10 000 collection Supply size you know eight pictures that you use on Twitter but now you can think of them as many different things right you can actually use them to model content which is what drip drip house is doing um and dialect is doing with sticker packs you can use them for gaming so the design space is very um it's it's much more expansive than it was before where we were actually limited by technology so and this this actually is very interesting for tensor specifically because you guys are in the intersection of nfts and finance and so you're actually able to leverage this and you actually have leverages in practice much faster than other players who do have like a maybe more of a simplistic um focus and so I guess maybe what are some so you've you've worked with uh compressed nfps for a bit now and you were actually one of the guinea pigs uh you were one of the first pioneers of it um what are some lessons you've learned what are some things that you think they enable like any concrete use cases like what do you wish existed with with these things I think with any like new technological shift it's sort of like a Fool's errand to predict long term like what these will be used for like I think a great analogy is when the internet in computers came out right who would have thought that we would be using the internet for trading images that are you know encoded in as jpegs for money back and forth like that's something that no one not even the inventor of the internet could conceive of that even if it was like the most brilliant guy in the world um that being said like I think we have some hunches on where this stuff um what's what this stuff will enable I think very like something that is definitely going to happen is that these will be used um without thought in every single crypto consumer app at some point so if you want to give someone a digital thing that they can actually own and that they have possession of it's going to be a compressed nft or it's going to be some nft that's really cheap to create what it makes sense to give them a regular nft because because the app doesn't can't essentially pay you know tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to give every single person a digital asset that could have basically be worthless but this basically unlocks these consumer apps to experiment without having to think about sort of the cost of goods that they're paying up for for creating these assets that basically opens up like distribution models like what Ilya mentioned with drip uh with dialects dialect are basically doing chat stickers with compressed nfts so if you think about like telegram or any chat app that you that you use you send these stickers around and they're kind of like they're kind of just whatever right like you don't actually own these stickers they're available to everyone but now what dialect has done is basically allow people to collect these stickers and make them things that you own but it's digital but it's still worth something because there's a limited quantity and you can trade them back and forth so you think about like any consumer app in web 2 that's remotely useful that has some notion of um like some something that you could perhaps own something that you could perhaps collect and show off I think all of these will eventually use nfts and I think it only makes sense for them to use compressed nfts because of the cost what are the trade-offs of compressed nfts because when you see it on Twitter it's like everything sounds amazing and it's it's like salon at one of Solana's new narrative but like why don't you see other blockchains talking about this do you not to get too wonky but do you have some more trust assumptions I would assume like you don't you maybe don't have everything on chain or like oh yeah what what are the trade-offs in terms of trust there aren't any trade-offs because the way these things are built without getting too technical here is that you store something on chain that even though this thing which in this case is the the proof isn't itself or the root I guess isn't itself the nft it 100 guarantees that the nft is there and it belongs to you and it has exactly the amount of data you think it has so trust us is not traded off but what is traded off is complexity and developer experience and I'm looking at Merv here because we're in his DMS pretty much daily discovering new problems uh and it really requires a very close cooperation between the RPC provider in this case Helios and the app uh maker in this case tensor like constantly going back and forth and resolving issues because this technology sort of spans the infrastructure stack as much as it spans the apps back and you really need these two teams working in tandem and so you know when it comes to a solo developer that just wants to spin up a fun little app for a hackathon this is going to be a lot harder to do than it would be to do with normal nfts so I think the biggest trade-off is probably that I don't know Richard can you think of anything else yeah that's a great Point like developer experience it's going to get there like merch the guys at Helios are building awesome tools like basically a one one API endpoint to get all the information about compressed nft so that's great I think the other thing is that I mean one thing that we're starting to see happen with compressed nfts is because they're so cheap to make like people don't even think about like how much it costs to send someone one of these compressed nfts or to create a thousand compressed nfts I think spam is going to be a very real issue people will be getting thousands tens of thousands of these compressed nfts it's going to make the jobs of wallet providers of RPC providers of us like a Marketplace indexing all of this data and surfacing them to the user like efficient efficiently enough and also like trying to hide the spam that's going to be very difficult or it's going to take some time some thought into thinking about how we handle this stuff I I think like you know it it's part of the it's part of the um part of the benefit of having really cheap stuff um like we're gonna get a lot more data we're gonna get a lot more compute coming into our infrastructure that we just have to you know handle that we have to think about but it's all like engineering technical problems right that's a really good point on the developer complexity I think that's maybe even a more Salon a specific trade-off that you make which is you you get a lot of performance but you now have to understand it counts very well you have to understand the program all of Solana very well and um one thing I'll also comment on just I can't help myself I'll burst uh is that you you couldn't actually have something like compression on ethereum or really any other album I'm aware of because the compute the storage ratio for the costs is not the same so on Solana compute is very cheap but storage is very expensive and compression just solves that directly whereas on ethereum so actually the only comparable thing right now is lens has like an L3 called Bonsai I believe and that's the only thing that comes close to this but obviously you need an L3 to come close um and so I'll stop that there uh I'm not gonna make it a monologue about the L1 Wars one thing that's interesting to me I'll go ahead quickly comment on that I will say that if you were if you were to play the Dallas Advocates that uh argument you could say that an ethereum guy would say okay well hold on uh our the way we do com the way we do nfts on ethereum is way more efficient because we don't need to Mint the token for every single nft so it's kind of like we did compression before you guys did compression but you called it like a cool name and now it's you know now it's like a whole thing on Solana it doesn't scale to the same numbers as the salonic aggression uh does so you can't bend to billion for a thousand bucks but somewhere in the middle and you know a lot of people could argue that maybe that middle is actually kind of optimal because you you can do like a single uh long object with a hundred thousand nfts in it and it all fits into a single contract and that's it and you don't have all this headache that we have on Solana with like tokens and accounts and all of that connecting all of it and paying rent and yeah just I think that's an interesting Contra argument in ethereum the way nfts work is kind of interesting because they're actually tied to the smart contract itself as opposed to um you know being their own collection that inherit from the token program or something uh and that what that is done and this is something that isn't really talked about that much in the industry is openc has this API that you need to get listing prices for these nfts at least in the old version I'm not sure if the new uh Seaport stuff is fixed at and I think it has but there's been a very long period of time where actually working with and actually like Twitter's um the the hexagon pfp integration actually uses opensuse apis and so there was actually this very um semi-centralizer let's say custodial thing that you need to do that you have to use openc apis to get to work with nfts whereas on Solana you you also have your centralization problems like metaplex having control of the program but it's not as if like one of these things is much better than the other it's like all these ecosystems just kind of suck and we need to just do our best to make them suck less um so that's just something I just I just want to um I feel like it doesn't get brought up enough yeah a comment on that I think this would be very controversial and very perhaps a bit provocative but I don't think anyone cares about centralization when it comes to nfts I think people are totally fine if they're bored ape if they're D Gods if they're mad Lads if they're Planos has a ton of centralization around it as long as they can so trade them back and forth as long as they as long as they can still rep them on their Twitter profile picture and as long as enough people believe that these things have value and that's social consensus that these things have value despite all these centralization um aspects of it I think that's what like frankly that that's what people care about it would be nice to have decentralized enough or like fully like 100 decentralized nfts but I don't think that's a world where we'll get to like as optimistic as I am where's the metadata uh for these compressed nfts is that is that with the RPC provider is it with our weave wherever you want is the shorter you want you can you can choose where you want to have it some people will want to have a more decentralized other people want to have it more centralized I will say that I think this space has obviously a obsession with decentralization and like that's a good thing because otherwise the space wouldn't exist but I will also say that I think the history here is very telling that there's actually only one layer of consensus in blockchain so that's social consensus and for anybody who thinks Salon is decentralized and thinks that this argument doesn't apply to if I want you I want you to remember the Dow hack when ethereum just came together and said okay actually no this is not correct and just like threw away a bunch of guys someone someone's money and just said like no actually this is the correct Fork right and like where's Eve classic today ultimately all of this is social technology and it goes back to people and I think what we're trying to build here is not a perfect ideal world where everything is decentralized or trying to build something that is a magnitude improvement over the current system and that's a very different way of looking at it it doesn't need to be perfect it needs to be better and it needs to be tedx better but probably not a hundred X better because at that point your Market size of people that you can serve without technology is Tiny like not every person in the world is prepared to have seven ledgers move them between three computers you know air gap this and air gap that just so that they never lose their money it's not going to scale guys you have to be pragmatic you have to make trade-offs that are like okay yeah like somebody can sell your nft and that's important but maybe your energy metadata doesn't live on chain because if it did then it would crowd the chain and it would become unusable so I think it's important to think about these things in context [Music] everyone we'll get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the alphas had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech roll up so count abstraction Mev app chains more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener and light speed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show so I mean we're already on topic so let's just get to it you guys at tensor are also releasing nfts I think they're called tensorians I've seen some designs with tattoos or maybe even haircuts with the logo so far uh I mean are you guys are you guys crazy like why why are you releasing the nft what is uh what do you think what is the thought process there and before you before you answer that I gotta add I think Richard you you tweeted just two days ago or three days ago that you're actually bearish pfp nfts on Solana and you said that it's not that they're going away but that's not what's going to 100 times the I guess nft Market on Solana so yeah why why are you releasing nfts when you said you were bearish yeah I think there are two pieces to that so I guess I'll answer the why we're releasing an nft project to begin with and they'll sort of answer part of the second second uh question so one thing that we lack currently uh on untenser right now is that while we have a really cool platform that tens of thousands of people use every single day that people Rave about on Twitter they say tensor is awesome the sensor is awesome that it changed the way that I trade nfts amms are so cool while we have all that uh sort of at our Tailwind one thing that we lack right now is something tangible to actually give to people so that they can say that they're part of tensor that they're part of the tensor community that they're a tensorian that's sort of our collection name I think that's really what's really unique about web3 is that you can give someone something tangible that is Meaningful that they can use that they can rep on their Twitter pfp that they can essentially show off and say that I am a proud user of tensor and I support their mission in making nfts scale to the next million users to the next billion users and become a trillion dollar asset class and I think that's exactly why we're doing an nft project it's not because of the money because the men's cost will be like dirt cheap like it'll be like inconsequential and in fact we'll probably lose money based on all of our expenses uh going into this nft project uh and it's not about you know becoming an nft project founder it's really about giving building a tangible community that we can uh you know talk to people at conferences say hey do you hold the tensorian if you do let's chat let's chat about what you're working on um so that's the first part the second part about pfps while I said I'm bearish about pfps on Solana I wouldn't say I'm bearish about pfps and and it going to zero because I think those are two different those are quite different I think pfps will still be around on Solana for sure and if Solana grows pfps will grow proportionally but I think the difference here is that Solana isn't the chain for pfps and collectibles I think that clearly belongs to ethereum and I think a lot of people feel more comfortable having high valued collectibles on ethereum as much as I want that to change and as much as I want Solana to become that chain I don't think it's going to happen just because of the Lindy effect because of the liquidity effect I think what is going to happen is Solana will differentiate Itself by coming up with a new meta of nfts we think that's going to be that's going to evolve compressed nfts and having cheap enough almost like vehicles for digital assets that a million users can actually use without the issuer without the users themselves having to pay you know the exorbitant costs of creating an nft right now do you one thing as a Founder myself or I mean I could say LARP is one um I always worry about or the reason why I haven't done it myself is because I worry that it'll take too much time away from Building Products is that a concern you guys have like how do you approach that because now you have essentially you have like the Rabid fan base of like a public company that thinks they're an owner of the company which they're not I mean they're just a part of the community which is a completely different thing uh my lawyers helped me with the wording of that and but then but then they still act like it right that's been a big deal with nft communities so far where they think they have like I don't know they'll say like you guys are doing it wrong you're stuck and then they'll create fun so that's going to probably open some headaches for you guys how are you you know mentally preparing for that uh how are you gonna split your time between product and community yeah I'm gonna be the most controversial here because I'm going to disagree with both of you I'm going to disagree with Richard uh and that I actually think Solana can become a chain for Collectibles and uh just different Collectibles and I think if Salon as a community does well there'll be enough people basically the simple equation to understand with Collectibles is that when do you buy a collectible oh like let's start here what is a collectible well it's a luxury good like really you don't need it you buy it because it's it's a status thing it's it's for you to show off now when do you buy a luxury good it's when you have an excessive wealth and so Salon as the chain does well there'll be enough people on this chain D5 Founders investors Traders you name it who made enough money that they will want to put it into something native to the source of their wealth that's basically why ethereum nfts are 10x the floor of Salon nfts is because people who made their money in ethereum feel allegiance to ethereum they feel loyalty and so they want to give back to that Community by buying nfts of that chain so for me the conclusion that Solana will be a Collectibles chain is not at all for God but that's my personal view um and by the way I like for anybody listening we always need to be as Founders and I think that's part of the reason we're a powerful team uh now on the second point I also don't think that us releasing an nft collection will create the issue of people telling us what to do and us not agreeing with that first of all I think we're releasing a collection when we already have a product rather than releasing a collection and promising something in the future and I think that makes all the difference in the world because we're not telling somebody like oh guys you should buy this and then maybe maybe something in the future we're telling them like guys we've been doing awesome things for the last year we're going to continue doing awesome things and if you want to be a little bit closer to us you want to have faster access to new features you want to be closer to the founding team you want to feel special you want to be you want to feel like a product dancer then you should get one and that's a totally different pitch because all of a sudden all of these people that choose to get one I mean we want to listen to them because they chose to align with us they chose to be part of tensor so I'm actually not at all worried about what feedback our holders might have if anything I want to hear that feedback because that is the feedback that got us to where we are today and I think that is going to make us 10x stronger going forward so we talked about compressivities you talk about your focus on the users I'm curious about the the upcoming road map for tensor and like what you're looking to build next uh you've seen blur with blend their Perpetual lending protocol is that something that you're exploring or like what type of products are you looking into and I think Richard you may have mentioned with compression of teas one thing that it does allow it almost creates fungibility for nfts even more than you have today uh with collections just because the collection size can be so large and then that can enable new products itself so I'd love for you to expand on that and maybe what other venues you're looking into for us I think blend like just lending for nfts Lending when it comes to not depending on an oracle uh that's sort of like what blend innovated on compared to existing peer-to-pool models I think that is something that we're thinking about but it's probably not top of mind for us right now I think what's more interesting is sort of the whole compressed nfts being able to scale this technology to millions of users and that's a lot more exciting for us I think one thing that we're starting to realize right now is that while we can build really cool things uh perhaps creating creating a new lending protocol primitive for nfts perhaps creating more sophisticated derivatives for nfts while all that is very interesting we just feel like right now that's not what crypto needs and that's not what the nft community on Solana needs or just any nft Community across any chains what we need is to find a way to bring more users into the space to actually proliferate nfts and the idea of digital assets so that you know your relatives your the friends at a Thanksgiving dinner will actually be interested in nfts Beyond just like speculation um I think that's something that people don't want to talk about much is that a lot of crypto is just speculation right now and that's while it's while it's keeping you know while it's paying for the bill as well as keeping the wheels turning it's not something that is exciting in the long term like it it's fun for now but we need to grow Beyond just speculation yeah it's like a bootstrapping mechanism that hopefully turns into something um you'd say maybe has more utility in the long run I I think it's interesting you have a you have a large focus on ux and your four professional Traders but I've also heard you talk about you want to become like the liquidity platform for nfts that others built on top of if you got a choice maybe explain that further but if you had a choice are you looking to become a platform where users maybe don't even interact with you directly so they're not going to tensor.com or your website like would that be your ideal Vision or would it be others are building on top of you and they don't even know that you exist for example something like Shopify yeah um I think the ideal outcome that every entrepreneur wants every Tech founder is that you build something that other others are building on top of and you just kind of sit back and let it scale to a billion users and you win but I think the unfortunate yeah I think the unfortunate reality is that that very rarely happens most often what happens is you have to fight tooth and nail to build your own product your own consumer product your own brand and then it might just so happen that once you've built that you have a platform that others want to use and I think Beauty swap is a great example here where they didn't set out by saying Kirsten API guys you go build this exciting stuff no they shipped a consumer product that people liked they continue to iterate on that product and ship new versions of it building their brand into something people trusted and then lo and behold they found developers knocking on their door saying hey can we build on top of you and so if I was to model tensor on something I would probably bottle it on something uni swap-esque where the job for us right now is to build a consumer product that people love and can't live without and if we do that then everything follows we briefly kind of thought about the idea of becoming like a pure deaf platform or like a liquidity layer we just think it's a pipe dream right now we don't think you can do that today maybe when crypto is like 10x the size it is today then yeah but not today that's a really interesting response I'm curious how you think about um almost owning the user relationship and you've seen uniswap we made that comparison there they've built a wallet which I think it's way too early and to see if that's actually successful um I'm curious if you think that's a route that applications should go towards I know you've talked about Armani with xnfts and backpack is that something that you've played with uh recently and C is maybe a distribution mechanism um yeah just how do you think about that the user touch point I think we're starting to realize that owning the user touch points is super important not because not because we want to like own the entire stack for the sake of it and just like own like basically or try to own the user but I think it it gives us more opportunities where we were not dependent on you know someone who's building on top of us to implement a feature that we know has product maybe not we know has product Market fit we know has demand and just like waiting like depending on Upstream I guess Downstream Downstream Builders to build the right things for us so that you having that user touch Point basically lets us experiment and iterate and move much quicker um with the user than sort of like just intimidate disinterminating that and having someone else on the user touch point so I think for us like We'll always want our own UI for tensor tensor the marketplace for as long as we can maintain this UI but if it happens that someone else builds a much better UI on top of our Marketplace and is fast to iterate and is satisfying the users and they're basically making our users very happy and perhaps they don't even know that tensor is the underlying Marketplace then we're also happy with that outcome for now like because there are not a lot of people building consumer facing apps we kind of have to own that relationship and be able to iterate quickly on that interface so shifting gears slightly we're now getting into maybe a meta discussion of building products and you know scaling to a million users and consumers you guys are obviously a venture-backed startup you you raised from placeholder and Chris there and you before that you were actually at Alliance which is sort of an accelerator um could you and and so like that's to say you are first you got first-hand experience into building the early stages of a startup and you know getting some sort of success and and hiring people or performing a team what are some things that you've learned about startups so far that are surprising to you okay um maybe I can start probably this thing that is super obvious to me now that it wasn't obvious back then is how much distribution matters versus product I think there's the saying that like first-time father thinks about product second time founder thinks about distribution and like I just couldn't agree more because ultimately everything is about whether you can put the thing that you build in front in front of the right eyes and whether they can get excited and that equation can be very complicated or it can be very simple like if you're coming out of an industry where you work for 10 years can you put like your next B2B product in front of people in those industry probably at one phone call right or on the contrary if you're like my first startup that I ever attempted was trying to sell software into investment Banks you guys can imagine how that went uh there was no exit there was no nothing because I couldn't get the meetings like nobody would take the meeting with me right I was a 20 year old trying to sell software into investment Banks and so it's all about distribution product absolutely matters but it only matters in as much as you can serve the user the most important the 80 20 right the most important thing that they need within the distribution channels that you have access to anything on top of that anything over that is kind of nice to have like your brother have a worse product with a better distribution than the perfect product and no distribution I think history is just literate with examples of that so I think to me that's probably been the most visceral learning where it like completely changed how I think about the company uh company building I'll throw it over to Richard yeah I think one of the most real Revelations that I've had while building a startup while going up against large incumbents that are well capitalized have hundreds Millions hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank is that your advantage as a startup is to be able to navigate what they call sort of these this idea maze um very quickly and be nimble enough to make a decision on sort of the a flip of a dime I think that's really important if you want to survive and succeed eventually as a startup uh because like that's that's the only Advantage you have against a large incumbent like they can out user acquisition you they can out um engine out engineer band with you they can out hire you by tenfold 100 fold but one thing that they don't have is being able to move quickly and shift the entire company shift the entire product towards a direction that you as a Founder have a really good hunch on just because you're grinding it out you're in you're in the trenches every single day talking to users and that is the advantage that you would have over a CEO that is running a 1 000 person company or ten thousand person company that is so far removed they have like so many more important things to do like figuring out finances figuring out fundraising that you as a startup frankly don't need to think about um the other part to that is that it seems like it's very path dependent and that making it's almost like every decision every significant decision um can change the course of the startup and it's all about making better than average decisions along the way so that these decisions accumulate and you get to a really good place I mean frankly like there are competitors in any field and how you compete against someone else who's building the exact same product as you comes down to those key decisions that you make and being able to iterate on those being able to iterate on the decision and the outcome of them quickly enough so that the competitor isn't um like so that you essentially stand up compared to the competitor I will also add to that um that the point about making decisions I think that's a really important one as a founder your job is actually not to make the best decisions as a Founder your job is to make the best possible decisions under a that of pressure fast because your day is littered with 75 000 things that you need to get done you'll never get all of them done and you need to be in the moment deciding like okay this is what I allocated my time to this is what I allocated my time to can I Outsource this to this person can I answer this to that person and if you can't Outsource something because it's too important then what is the 80 20 that you can do here can you just read through the code and leave a bunch of comments or do you is it better for you to sit down and rewrite it right like I think what I'm realizing more and more and more is that it's it's never about making the perfect decisions it's actually way better to make good decisions but make them fast and then just learn from them and just just make more good decisions but make them fast it's all about speed startups are basically a race anybody getting into this thinking that they're gonna have the luxury of time it only gets worse with this each passing day and each extra customer you're on board and you it's basically a race you have to be like constantly constantly constantly thinking about speed and how much you can get done in a short amount of time so while we're on that topic oh yeah you know I was going to bring this up uh you have a very Infamous post on Twitter uh after you I believe you interviewed someone and you you talked about their GitHub activity and it got some um let's say controversy around it um what do you what are your thoughts on okay so number one what are your thoughts on work-life balance because I mean I know I personally don't believe in that concept but you know everybody has a different take on it but two there's a lot of people in Salon that look up to YouTube uh right YouTube guys and what you've been able to accomplish so far what advice would you give them on you know how to how to get started and and you know amp it up and accelerate and build startups yeah I'd say that a device on something like this is a very situation dependent do you have two kids or do you or are you as a single guy in your 20s I mean that question alone basically like decides like how you should be thinking about building a company right do you do you have 10 years of experience in an industry or do you not and so obviously like yes so there's there was that post where I basically saw somebody who didn't do any commits on the weekends and I posted I said well I wouldn't hire this guy and what I was getting out there I said if somebody is telling me that they're a passionate engineer they love what they do but in two years they haven't done a single commit on a weekend can I really trust that they're passionate because for me it's hard to believe that somebody who's genuinely into their craft doesn't touch their craft on the only uh slot in the week when they have free time I just I just cannot believe in that to me that's just a signal that they don't they don't care right like for them it's a job and and they'll just close their computer and they'll go home now of course there's a million ways why I could be wrong like maybe they just don't commit to GitHub or or maybe they have a second game it doesn't matter like of course people just glorify the whole thing but I think the point I was driving home is that at dancer we're looking for for people for whom it's a craft they're passionate about it Way Beyond the here's the objective we need you to fulfill it's like the current engineer we have the reason he's magical is because we tell him like hey could you do a he comes back to us and he says guys I did a but in the process I discovered B and C and D which I thought about and I tinkered with and I want to tell you about and that's magical because if you have 20 of those guys on the team then all of a sudden the best ideas are not bottlenecked into the founders and all of a sudden they can emerge from any part of the business and that's how you scale into something as awesome and and big as Amazon or Facebook or Google where each individual contributor is an idea center right well at the science at the same time performing performing work and so like the the advice for like how do you build a startup I mean there's no single advice what's your life situation where do you live how much money do you need to survive ultimately the one thing I sort of believe in is that the younger you are the more time you should be spending on this because it costs you less you don't have other people who depend on you you don't have other real responsibilities they need to take care of as you become older you maybe have kids you have you know family that you you should be spending time with it's just harder you can't be you can't be sleeping on a bin bag in the office anymore you know like you have to you have to spend time with your family and so yeah there's no easy answer but I think that those are some of the thoughts for those who don't know tenser's slogan I don't know if you guys call this a slogan two dabs two trucks coffee two or two hours of sleep and wild dreams so I think that that fits your description pretty well if if you did have a bigger team and know you have the resources and you've you've kept basically the funding trim for a reason is it like really gives you focus but what what do you think either your protocol is missing or something and Salon is missing that you'd like for someone to build and maybe something you would do yourself if you did have that time that's a good question I think for us at least speaking from sort of uh a Layman's perspective outside of like nft outside of the nft space like I know nothing about what's going on in defy I don't know anything about what's going on in Dow technology or l2s or you know whatever l1s are coming out I think outside of that and and just focusing on Solana or focusing on everything that I know about Solana I think one thing that is sorely missing in this ecosystem are apps that consumers or retail people want to use outside of just speculation I think it's hard because creating a good consumer app is like very difficult if you think about like all the web 2 consumer apps used daily they use um like maybe once a week maybe once every single day depending on what it is like there are only a handful that I can name off the top of my um head that I would personally use in web 2. and now if you think about like web3 where a lot of the focus is on like there's this shiny object which is called speculation there's a shiny object that is called Trading if you come if you sort of like position that against like building a fun speculation app a fun trading app that you know generates you a bunch of fees towards building some like consumer app that is not very well defined in terms of like what is it going to accomplish that's different from web2 like that's pretty difficult that being said I think people exploring ideas when it comes to building essentially fun consumer apps I think that needs to happen more often especially in salon on Solana and I think there are teams that are tackling this that are using for example compressed nfts to try try exploring new ideas since you're no longer inhibited by technology or the cost of the blockchain Garrett do you um do you have anything else or I'm gonna do some rapid fire let's do the rapid fire all right so disclaimer I make everything up on the spot here and I will just ask for any questions try to keep the answers relatively short but I mean if you think it makes sense to expand on it of course go ahead um and then I'll just go ill yeah and then Richard for every single question so we can kind of get both your takes cool all right so uh let's start let's see how do you describe tensor to your parents it's a platform where you can buy and sell sell pixelated uh pictures of animals for large amounts of money mainly for a loss they must think you're crazy man I love it they think are unemployed I guess Where's the Line yeah so my parents are like pretty big into luxury goods so just tell them like this is the new way to buy and sell luxury goods but it's like entirely digital so you don't have to like go to the store what is the worst possible take you've ever seen on INFJs before that you just vehemently disagree with it's probably people who say that nft shouldn't be financialized and the reason I think that's short-sighted is because there's a very clear Trend in the economy of anything that has value becoming more financialized and saying that this whole basically 50 of the economy that just happens to be non-fungible shouldn't be financialized I think makes zero sense to me I guess for me it's like very similar um I think like one of the biggest things that came up during the a m stuff is like people said liquidity is bad for nfts because it somehow makes the price goes down but if you like if you're from Finance or if you have like a Quant background you know that it goes both ways like liquidity like it doesn't have a bias towards the price going down or the price going up so I think that's like completely you know to put it lightly like horseshit so you're referring to like the blur excelled nfts narrative essentially there um okay uh describe your co-founder in one word too smart that's two words sorry but it's what it is uh I never have to check Richard's code because I basically assume that whatever he wrote is gonna be more carefully prepared and like more accurate than like me reading of it and like trying to find like things in there even though I always try and sometimes I leave like a little comment for me it's driven or ambitious I think Ilya like out of everyone that I've met like whether I was looking for a startup like co-founder or it was some colleague that I had at a previous workplace like he's probably one of the most laser focused individual when it comes to building a a big company when it comes to building an awesome product nice if you could steal one personality trait from anybody in history you know Leonardo da Vinci's drawing skills Steve Jobs marketing who would it be from and why I would pick Clarity of thought probably Steve Jobs Maybe Elon Musk but like pick your favorite you know person who thought about the world very very clearly from first principles unaffected by the short-term emotions fomo and all of that ultimately like one thing I learned when I moved from banking into product is that the quality of your decisions actually matters more than how many of those decisions you make or how fast you can execute on them because if you make the right decision and even if you're moving at twenty percent of the speed of your competitor you'll still end up ahead if they make the wrong one and so like being able to think clearly about the world and just see things for what they are and make the most objective decisions I think is the single most important superpower it's just like in general like personality trait wise I think for me it's being able to be it's kind of like similar to Clarity of thought but being like downright like super intellectually honest with yourself and being able to um like put it straight to people I think that's like and being able to put it straight to people like in a good way so that they don't feel bad they don't feel like they're being unheard I think that's like the quickest way to getting stuff done I think if you can be straight with people in a nice way they'll understand where you're coming from and you don't have to waste time uh trying to make them feel like you know they they have a they have some opportunity with you to work with you to partner with you like frankly like it doesn't make sense I think that's something that I'm trying to learn to do better over time but it's also difficult it's it's a skill that you have to kind of learn over time I've got one I'll throw in there um what is something today that you think people are missing or they don't talk about that in say five to ten years everyone will look back and say that was obvious and specifically in crypto or nfts yeah maybe the fact that the next wave of products is gonna look nothing like the wave before I feel there's this just strong desire in crypto especially from people that have already made it to pattern match and what happened in the past cycle and to just say like okay well the next cycle is going to be the same thing but 10x bigger but if you actually look at each cycle ethereum was not Bitcoin but that next bigger ethereum was something else and I think the next cycle when we start seeing applications that actually drive it and take off I don't think they will be a 10x bigger version of things we've seen in 2018 and 19. I think there'll be something completely else maybe things that we can't can't even think about today and by definition they're going to be unpredictable and like going back to what we spoke about earlier like our bet is like compressed and if these will unlock some of that design space and enable some of the things that right now might seem totally crazy I think for for me when it comes to nfts I think we'll see it essentially be used in almost everything that touches the blockchain so think about just crypto as a whole any consumer app any uh infrastructure we'll use NFD in some form but the thing is like these entities won't be traded and that's fine for us these nfts uh may be sold bound they might not even move change hands but it's such it's a more natural way of encapsulating essentially almost like a almost like a backpack or like a like a luggage like a crate of stuff that is non-fungible you can't you can't commute it with any other object um and like it's hard to imagine what they'll be but I think like it's going to be I mean I don't know if this is like unpredictable but it's it's going to come in all sorts of forms and it's going to be so uh proliferated that like any anything we touch will basically be an nft and we'll get to the point where somebody calling themselves an nft Marketplace or nft project won't make any sense the same way that calling yourself a.com today it doesn't make any sense you'll be like yeah of course you're an nft project because it's a superior way to do something like it just just makes sense right interesting what is your currently most unpopular opinion that you're convinced is correct that Solana is not going to zero I mean we're basically betting the company on it hate it or love it to us it's such a clear bet in terms of the risk reward profile um versus everything else right now I honestly don't know what I would be building if if not there's Sean so on right now like I'd probably still find somebody on Solana because I feel that the space on evm is getting crowded in terms of what you can build that's totally novel and something like ZK Roll-Ups or whatever still needs like another number of years to run before it gets to the point where it's like totally productionized and you can actually unlock even your design space there so probably not as boring as it is yeah very similar I think but I think just to go even further I think there will be more daily active users on Solana than any other chain um because consumer apps in the near term would just be it's more obvious for them to be building on Solana than an L2 than on ethereum mainnet then on let's say the next L1 it's just like Solana right now I think is in such a good position to capitalize on consumer adoption that I can't see how it could fall behind when it comes to mass user adoption even if the user doesn't know anything about Solana that there's Solana running in the back background I think there will be more users on Solana just from from a pure like numbers perspective I think that's uh I think that's a good place to close Elia Richard thank you so much for joining I've uh as getting as I was getting prepared for this podcast I was listening to a few of the things you've done in the past and I was just like blown away I thought I thought that you must have been like five-time Founders by that point because the wisdom that you talk about with product and distribution and and so forth is really fascinating and you've done an amazing job with tensor so it's super exciting uh we'll definitely put links to the show notes to tensor into your profiles if there's anything else you want to close with um you can do that now but thank you so much for joining thanks for having me thanks all right thanks guys we'll see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music]
