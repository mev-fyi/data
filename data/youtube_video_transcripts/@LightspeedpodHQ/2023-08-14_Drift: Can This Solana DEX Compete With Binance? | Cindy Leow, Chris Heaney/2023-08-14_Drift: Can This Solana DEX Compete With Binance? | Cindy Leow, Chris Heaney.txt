we want to raise the glass ceiling for D5 yes and we want to build like kind of the the pipelines too to get there and people shouldn't be talking about binance in five years everyone should be trading on tune so that's our vision hey everybody welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today we have a special one for you we are joined by Cindy the founder of drift and also Chris who's the lead engineer at drift guys thanks for joining us Tim hey guys great to be here yeah I would want to have you um on the show we'd like to focus on products and how crypto enables new use cases we like to get technical but we also want to see like what's the end goal here um we'd like to start with just an intro to drift and how drift is aiming to make it easier for the average user to participate in defy drift is a Perpetual slots exchange uh built on Solana which might sound like Mumbo jungle to a lot of you so it's basically a way to get leverage on chained while trading Futures type products um we have about 15 markets right now so you can bet on the price of Seoul BDC eth um and a bunch a bunch of other assets uh with you know the speed and the low fees of Solana while being fully on chain and not trusting an essentialized exchange with your keys or telegram Bots for that matter we were founded in 2021 one of the earliest Solana projects and we recently launched our V2 about eight months ago we're now the largest Solana perp Decks that in all of D5 actually um and yeah our goal is to be the largest protects anywhere and you know build a remote to attract more users from centralized exchange to to use D5 so building a lot of bridges some into the line of D5 so drift is a purpose exchange um and I want to take this time to maybe talk about exactly what a purpose for those in Solana who might not be familiar so um I'll let any of either of you take this but so I mean I have two questions one is what is a perp um and and two is why should people regular people not like arbitrages but why should regular people care about them so a perp is a form of derivative where uh basically you can trade uh the price of some asset um in the traditional world people trade derivatives for things like Commodities like corn or oil Etc and that's where actually like the origination of like derivatives came so people were um basically using it to hedge the prices of Commodities and then it kind of just as Finance evolved over time it just became more and more popular way to trade um basically the prices of uh different assets so it got really big in crypto because it's this really easy way to um trade how crypto uh like crypto tokens are are going to move um and the I think one of the reasons why uh they got really big is basically it allows you for you to trade it synthetically so instead of going to each blockchain and buying the asset on this blockchain having to bridge all over the place you can actually all do it in um one spot so if you were on Solana but you wanted to trade the price of ethereum you could actually use a perp to do it on Solana instead of having to bridge ethereum over or Bridge Bitcoin over and obviously there's like a ton of um like bridging risk across crypto we've seen a lot of hacks so a lot of people want to trade crypto but they don't want to have to like go all over the place and incur you know the time and the financial risk of going to different blockchain so perbs just offer you a way to trade all crypto Assets in one place which is I think how they got so popular yeah that's that's really helpful and it's it's not that you're just or drift is not just a perpetuals exchange you really have three different sources of liquidity um Sydney I'd I'd like you to maybe introduce that topic because I think it's really interesting definitely yeah I think um I guess talking about perps and why they got so popular in in C5 as well I found it in like in 2016 um by the bitmex guys um a lot of the reason that proves got popular was because liquidity for them was so good compared to a spot market makers were more willing to quote on purpose um than any other spot assets just because of the fungibility um issues that we talked about um for a synthetic acid that is pegged to a spot acid it's just a lot better um we're trying to recreate those conditions for liquidity on chain in a way that no other D5 protocols really attempted before um I think a lot of other Diva protocols have relied on you know porting over emm models um to to trade perks or you know building an off-train order book um that then you know goes and matches it on chain uh how we're doing it and our philosophy behind our liquidity mechanism which I can go into a little bit um is that we wanted everything to be fully on chain and we also wanted to encourage participation from not just like a single Market maker but built ecosystem for multiple types of market makers um to to participate so to to boil it down are um our liquidity Trifecta as we call it um has three sources of liquidity uh one is a a virtual amm that is backed by um liquidity provider positions so anyone can go in here and deposit money into the emm and trade against um traders that want to trade perks on undrift the second is a an on-train order book um it's a order book that is hosted by a network of Keepers that do the searching uh locally and then match um match the orders on chain when they see across an order book and then the third one which is probably the most complex is something we called it just in time auction um essentially when a user places a market order on drift to let's say go 10x long on a sole purp um the market order goes through a Dutch auction um that functions kind of like an RFQ it goes to a network of makers that can compete to fill it at the best price as possible within a short time frame uh and the combination all of this allows for a very diverse um different types of liquidity on the system you sort of have like top of the book liquidity by active makers um you have passive liquidity by the emm liquidity providers and then really quick uh good fills by the Justin Time option so yeah yeah you can also slow down any of these Concepts yeah I'd like to like to dive in a little bit so like to give it's an overview I think a lot of people know what amms are especially because they're if you're from the ethereum ecosystem just like what unit swaps offered order books you have bid and asks a lot of people to see that in tradpy um the last one the Dutch auction which means right the price starts high and keeps lowering um essentially like the first price is at the Oracle price so it's the best price you can get and over time that price decays until someone actually says okay I'm willing to you know buy or sell at that price what is a stepping back what is a virtual amn compared to just a typical amm yeah so the reason is called a virtual amm is because perps are synthetic or virtual so um versus like a normal amm where you deposit in like the spot token like Soul or usdc um actually all the positions and perps are synthetic or virtual so it's basically just a virtual amm is uh like a perp amm in some ways um but the cool thing about a virtual amm is that because all the positions are uh because they're all virtual like it's much easier to um basically bootstrap a virtual amm um than it is for a like a normal spot amm so in drift basically the fees that are being paid while users are trading are being reinvested into the protocol into the virtual amm to keep making the liquidity uh better for users so this is like one of the reasons we're really excited about virtual amm is because the protocol itself uh the fees that it takes are being reinvested into it to like create a basically a better Marketplace and eventually ux for Traders and the virtual am kind of like uh uniquely enables this so Cindy you mentioned that you guys have one of the highest dau's daily active users um in in defy and maybe even crypto can you talk a bit about that like what has the story been um for that like why is that the case there's obviously a lot of competition but what is it about drift yeah absolutely I think drifts um UI and kind of feedback from Traders so far um the the recurring kind of feedback that we always get is it's probably the closest thing to a fully centralized experience that you can get in D5 I think a lot of the assumptions that E5 protocols make uh when building a product is sort of like okay the users already understand what a wallet is they sort of already understand what Leverage is but we really take the time to peel it back from a product standpoint and make it super easy for for anyone to like take these positions without necessarily understanding you know how um while it's my work or how transaction approvals Network so so I think what we've done well in the product side is like broken it down to like many different levels of sophistication like if you want to be like super sophisticated yes you can go and you know provide liquidity in the DLP and maybe even like lever up on that liquidity but if you also just want to make a simple spot trade or a so simple like you know five ten X long um it's very easy and intuitive to do that um and I think that's because we've been very obsessed with how easy and simple like the product should be and making that just as accessible as possible to users yeah I think I'd just follow up on that and say that drift kind of is hybrid where we're very focused with like D5 native like let's build a transparent open protocol on chain open source code like all that kind of uh D5 nerd stuff and then another part of the team is very product focused and like how can we make this simple to use um and make this like a fun product and so we kind of try to like layer on abstractions where your hardcore user can still have root access to the exchange inspect everything see everything and then as you get maybe less sophisticated you can interact with it at a different level um which is easier for it to use and still like enjoy it and I think our our goal is kind of to be strong across the whole Stacks we have like uh you know there's a bunch of ux and design ux people working on it and also like hardcore like D5 people working on it and it's like a really good combination I think that's why we're seeing our users uh like like drift protocol one of the big parts of having a very successful decks is attracting liquidity so I'm curious how you've gone about doing that um and maybe just talking through the waterfall with that because again you start with that RFQ which is request for quote and then you go to the order book and then then the amm and I'm curious like I'm assuming at the very top you get the best pricing usually it's like RFQ and then you go down to the order book and at the end you go to the amm so how yeah how does that can you just explain that a little bit more in sourcing liquidity through those layers I guess it's actually not as linear as that it's actually like all these liquidity sources are all competing to give users the best price so it's like when you submit a market order it's like a Dutch auction which means like you're gonna want the best pass price the best price possible and it's slowly getting worse and then during that auction basically if the amm has a good price it can fill you if there's resting liquidity on the order book that satisfies your price it can fill you and then if there's an active Market maker who just wants to provide just in time liquidity uh it can fill you and so it's all designed for these different liquidity sources to be competitive such that the taker gets the best price but also there's a lot of different ways for liquidity to be provided So based on like the LPS Technical and like uh like technical skills and preferences they can provide liquidity so if you're a passive user you can LP like a normal amm if you're a really smart like person who can run a bot and has like capital and Technical infra you can provide just in time liquidity and all these things are competing with each other to get you a better price so it's like it's kind of just like real market dynamics like who's ever the fastest most effective can get uh Traders really good fills and so like I think you've seen like the first version of D5 like it's like okay there's one amm and it's really simple um and that's the only thing you trade against and then the prices aren't really competitive and what we're doing is we're just trying to push it so there's more and more competition um for how for liquidity and we think ultimately that'll make it um way better for your like average Trader and that's how like tradify Works um like when you trade on Robinhood there's uh makers that are like you know basically paying to fill you and it's very competitive so we're I think on Solana you can start to step away from some of these like simple mechanisms and uh build in more dynamism um so the goal with drift was really to like design um more competitive sourcesly liquidity to like force people to compete to give users good fills so that's it seems like that that was the initial goal for drift um one thing I am curious about especially when talking to other Founders or or lead Engineers um what is your guys's vision for the next five years like where do you want drift to be um right like what is your dream here yeah that's uh that's a good question to have a really robust ecosystem built on top of it uh where you know we sort of like built a really complex backend um that we think is extremely scalable and can bring like D5 to the next level and what we want to encourage sort of like people using drifts back in to build products on top of that that will then scale the usage of directors of back in to millions of users or that that sounds really far-fetched for for D5 and crypto right now because you know like D5 has like maybe 10 000 users right now but to actually get to the next like order of magnitude is where we you want to position ourselves um you know we don't see um we want to raise the glass ceiling for D5 yeah so we want to build like kind of the the pipelines to get there and um you know people shouldn't be talking about binance in in five years everyone should be trading on chain so that's our vision for for the next experience yeah I'll give like a a slightly different take that's similar but I think of like drift as like the OG Builders and the OG community members are trying to like bootstrap almost like a living thing um it's even funny how in crypto we use like an ecosystem like a ecosystem is like a complex adaptive um system it's almost like a meta organism and I think the most successful protocols actually end up being like that where there's a lot of participants there's uh no single point of failure um and it's sustainable and it can keep going and I think a lot of D5 protocols basically can't get past that like initial activation energy where they're sustainable so everything what we're trying to do is to make the protocol and eventually um the broader ecosystem more sustainable and there's enough participants and enough energy where it can keep like living on um and so it's all about like trying to design like design the incentives and the different agents so that like this thing can live on um deeply into the future where I think yeah like the kind of cynical take is a lot of D5 teams like they build something they launch a token and then without the token going up in value it basically dies and then as it goes zero it's like what's the point where like I would love to see drift become like this entity that lives on yeah five ten years long time like one of these um it's like Financial like superstructure so that's what I would love to see nice just like um I believe there's a term hyperstructure that uh Jacob came up with from Aura um so I think yeah that's that's pretty cool and I like Cindy's slogan of nobody should uh have to use binance in in five years that's uh that's a good one um so talking about ecosystems um you guys obviously chose to build on Solana and I guess the obvious question is you know why Solana over some of the other ones that have higher TBL uh more history in terms of defy why um why make that decision yeah maybe you can get started on this one um so as I mentioned earlier we actually started building drift in May June 2021 which feels like ancient history by now um and and at that time um the decision Matrix of a building on Solana versus building on you know L1 if or l2e made it very obvious um that kind of Solano was the the place to be was live at mainnet um there was a budding developer ecosystem that building around it and what was interesting was I think developers and Solana at the time were willing to push the boundary with um with Russ zabeken and stuff that hasn't really been tried in D5 before um like on each you know you didn't see anyone talking about clubs everyone was trying to make emms better um and that was like the conversation there at the time uh that might have changed today but on Solana you know you saw people trying to build um these really cool applications that just didn't exist before and that was what attracted us initially to the Solana ecosystem and I think a lot of that is still very true today and I can learn like Chris chime in there as well yeah I'd say in a lot of ways Solana might be the most decentralized blockchain right now and I think the reasons for it are kind of counter-intuitive but if you look at the system holistically the more things that you have to put off chain because the core chain is really expensive and slow the more like single points of failure you introduce so even for eth like the L1 whatever maybe it's super secure and if you just hold eth on the L1 it's the most secure thing you can do but once you start trying to get more users you have to have l2s which then right now are like very centralized where they're secured by a multi-sig you even look at like uniswap X's new design and they're forced to put a lot of things off chain um so it's like if the core layer is too too simple and not powerful enough it actually makes the holistic system more fragile and I think you can argue this about Bitcoin and ease that because the core layer is so simple they push all this stuff off chain and ends up you have bitcoiners putting their money into block fi for example so it's like you really want your core layer to be as powerful as possible and I think we believe that like Solana core team is really pushing uh the chain to be sufficiently decentralized so that you can put all this stuff on chain and I'm really excited about that and um I think it's a great place to build a DEX and like the future of France that's a really um unique take that I haven't heard too much before um so I guess maybe to push back on a little bit uh not that I disagree with you but just maybe I'm sure somebody will disagree with you in the audience um why do you think um or why is it a good thing that everything should be Unchained like what should wouldn't it make more sense to have some things off chain like what what is kind of your philosophy on that I guess the point of having things on chain is that like the underlying network is like permissionless and adaptive so if one validator goes down you know there's other validators that step in and you can't just take the thing down but once you start putting more things off chain if you don't replicate that like permissionless nature that networked approach you introduce single points of failure right so if you look at an L2 and there's a centralized sequencer and there's like a multi-sig that controls it if you take down that multi-sake it's going to be hard for it to like basically adapt and keep going um so it's kind of like you have to rebuild the thing you already did on the core layer at the abstractions on top otherwise you introduce single points of failure um and it's like you're already teams are always putting so much work into making the core layer permissionless and adaptive that ideally you get the benefits of all that hard work um without having to replicate it all over the place which like for the fractal scaling approach with eth you basically need to like go through this whole hill climbing process again where you like make each layer adaptive and I think it's just uh that makes it more fragile because you're not basically like focusing all the dev efforts um in one place so um yeah I think it's about single points of failure and how you design the system to like prepare for that and I guess what we've seen a lot this year in terms of scaling Solutions is like people are sort of becoming more like Islands um themselves so the apps are becoming more like Islands um where like perplexes are launching just like on a single app chain and that um means that devs have to focus entirely on rebuilding an entire like ecosystem of their own like to go back to that word you have to build Bridges you have to build spot emms you have to build um like routers and aggregators kind of all that like Falls on on the the the role of the team um that you know was supposed to focus on scaling this kind of like application layer and so what we like about building on Solana itself and being part of this ecosystem is that a lot of this core infrastructure exists and um is layered on top of each other so drift for instance um we have a borrow lending um we have a borrow lending like module built within Drift But for a spot exchange for instance we route orders to through Jupiter which obviously around sort of is like across all of Solana um and we benefit from liquidity that something like the Wormhole provides to zuselana itself so so I think it offers that kind of peace of mind um for us like while we do want to push the laundry and the low level like infrastructure so it is there it can be scaled and it there's the benefit of other like very smart team we're working on it as well yeah I think it's the the composability helps a lot drift is composed with a lot of protocol calls like pith Phoenix open book Jupiter marinade like it kind of inherits all these um subsystems that are already there I think another thing you get on a monolithic chain is like more distribution so users are more likely to try out Solana because there's a lot of good protocols on Solana so I like jokingly said one time that like blockchains are like shopping malls but if you think about the dapps as different stores if you co-locate with them uh you're more likely to get more flow and that's why a lot of similar stores usually co-locate versus like being just like randomly distributed um and I think like the kind of app chain world it's really not clear how users are gonna like cleanly hop between all these different chains I think that's a really painful ux and then as like adapt how do you convince someone to like take this random route from Fiat to your specific app chain so I think that's really tough and then I think the last thing is also because it's all on one chain is actually there's a lot of security like you get to Solana you're there and then you don't have to worry as much about like bridging across uh to different change and inheriting all that risk so it's also just I think ultimately safer if things are going on in one state Machine versus like scattered all over the place and we've obviously seen a lot of like security issues um like traversing between the different change so yeah it's like composability just distribution and I think security yeah Chris I've heard you talk about that you are interested in like the cosmos ecosystem and app chains and that you can have the validators actually like understand the semantics of the app itself and through that you could potentially have other ways to do value accrual um but to the audience you touched on the bridging risk as well because there is dydx which is a Perpetual exchange that you have in Cosmos it's being built um but if you're perpetuals exchange it's everything's synthetic so you don't really have to bridge anything but the asset that the Perpetual is like the base currency of that which would be like usdc but as soon as you have a spot market and you have to bridge in all these tokens there's a lot more risk which is something that like drift doesn't have to encounter foreign we get back to the show in a minute but I want to let you know that we've got our permissionless conference coming up start conference with bank list that's the biggest and best conference in defy it's going to be in Austin Texas this year yep I know you love it you got tacos barbecue Barton Springs got it all September 11th through the 13th it's been in crypto for a while you know that the bear Market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there it's going to be great for building a network for learning a lot and look we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like hasu stani Christine Moy and Kyle samani talking about ZK Tech Roll-Ups account abstraction Mev app chains and more look I'm damn excited because you're a listener in blindspeed you're going to get a special discount type in discount code live speed 30 and you'll get 30 off your ticket that's right just type in Live speed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30 off click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks all right back to the show one thing I am curious about how do you think about uh vertical and horizontal Integrations that you see with D5 protocols because you mentioned Jupiter and they're an aggregator and you've seen with uniswap that they kind of with uniswap X now have an aggregator they also have a wallet then they have an amm how do you how do you think about um that as a D5 team yeah initially we built and architect a lot of V2 around allowing for specific features for pervs so a lot of like why we built borrow land for instance was to enable cross collateral for for perks so instead of just using uscc you can now lever up with soul as collateral and that's been huge enabler for kind of folks in the Solana ecosystem because people don't necessarily want to sell out of their soul especially 30 now people want to use BDC and eth so we built this back end like borrow lens system to enable um cross collateral and a lot of other decisions like enabling spots within drift was also to enable safer liquidations for Perpetual positions because we wanted to avoid bankruptcies and having spot within our system just makes it safer so I think while when you go on our app now you can do all of those things as standalones too so you're sort of like um becoming this like oh it's a default Empire of sorts and have all the functionalities like within a single smart contract a single app but the reason that we built a lot of this was to enable a smoother like prep trading experience which has been our core Focus so far um as the benefits of that that spills over is that users can now access everything um that they would need in D5 like under a single interface so that's been a sticky Point as well for users to continue using our app like we've seen people start off with perpetrating and then go into like using spot um to swap their collateral going to like staking products as well um so we really see it as like can people come in here because because they can like gamble on chain and like trade with really high leverage but they'll stay for like other features like you know just keeping their funds um within something that gener this generating yield um so yeah I think vertical integration for us very much focuses on the core Mission but then has functionalities to keep users within our app okay yeah I think we're always uh focused on like how can we boost like the value of the the core protocol and keep adding into it that makes it more robust and uh more sustainable so the interesting things about perps like Cindy talked about is isolated there they can be kind of um they can actually be more dangerous than if you actually have uh cross collateral so when we were like designing V2 we were like okay like we actually need all these additional features to increase the the safety of the um protocol um and so then like we actually it's like you kind of have to go big in order for it to work at all and it's sometimes a little counter-intuitive because like your web 2 startup because you just have so much control over your back end it's like just ship something really simple and then just keep changing it because you can change it at will whereas in defy um you don't have that freedom so you actually kind of sometimes have to spend more time up front development um because like once it's out there you can't you can only really make backwards compatible changes um and so it's kind of like this in between hardware and software development which is um pretty interesting and so yeah we did the vertical integration where we thought it would make the uh the protocol more robust and safer so while we're on the topic of vertical integration app change um composability and whatnot one thought that I found interesting was from Antonio from dydx when he said he doesn't want um dydf to be associated with Cosmos it kind of wants to be its own brand do you guys have a similar philosophy how do you guys think about the relationship between drift and Solana I I I do agree with that take in in a way that um users shouldn't have to know Solana to use drift and drift should be you know the the entrance to to the long train and and our goal with the product really is and even the brand in some ways is to um I guess attract an audience that doesn't need to know about like whatever underlying blockchain is on um so our our mission sort of like become a a neutral like player within the space and and a lot of what we're doing which is uh adding like email um logins where we use that magic Link in the back back end to create a wallet for you um and you obviously have like full access to it but all you see in the front end is like okay I'm gonna use my email to to log into this exchange so I guess our philosophy with The Branding and with the product is that eventually um you really don't need to be a hard core Solana user to use and love the app um and and we think things like you know approvals and and all stuff like eventually like it's instructed away obviously in a safe and secure manner um but yeah I think obviously a lot of our community still loves uh Solana and it's like a part of that and we love being part of the narrative um but we want to get to the stage for the product that uh anyone you know clicking in from like a tick tock ad for drift um should be able to use it without knowing you know what Solana is or having a phantom wallet um so that maybe is an additional layer of obstruction from the underlying blockchain and that's where we see true scalability foreign yeah I think um I agree with that that I think from a product perspective they over time there should just be more abstractions then it should be easier to interact with things without knowing the blockchain you're on uh I think the like strategic misstep that's common is like believing that and then trying to like just go to multiple chains and do too much at one time and then basically end up losing on every chain because there's more focused competitors on a single chain um so the reality is that like demand Aggregates in certain places and if um if there's competitors that are super focused in one place and then that's where all the demand goes and they're better than you then like you just lost everywhere so it's kind of like even though in theory you should keep abstracting it's like in practice you need to be super focused on where you like spend your time um which is why like I'm a pretty big proponent of just like going all in in one place and making that place great versus trying to hedge our bets and like have drift Deploy on multiple chains because like it's just it's just really tough to do that and not lose to a more focused uh Team Building like a better product on that I've got a question on distribution because obviously you can have the best product but if you don't have users um it doesn't matter so you've got to find that attention how do you think about maybe distribution today but also if we had another cycle where we have a lot of new users coming in um yeah how do you think about that is it do you ever talk to wallets for example would you think about like making some type of deal where you go there and it's curated and you can see drift or what's your strategy there yeah um I think with distribution within crypto um you're like talking to wallets um and putting yourself where other users would see it's like Twitter is the best like platform for that as well Twitter telegram um because most of crypto attentions then sort of like exists within the form of a tweet right so I think we like to be like quite front and center within the Twitter universe the Integrations with like wallets and and other DFS I think that's also another distribution channel that we haven't explored as much um like putting ourselves front and center where like for instance with backpack we built a leaderboard feature an xnmt on backpack and we found that that was a funnel for a lot of more like nft focused um traders to actually come in and start using it like via backpack um so yeah that's definitely been a pretty interesting funnel like we've talked to for instance like multi-sig wallets like squads right what if you could one click um deposit your treasury into drifts uh if seeking protocol um there's things like that that I think because our app is uh has so many different functions um you sort of need to build like pockets of access um and in multiple different places and I think um the the D5 infrastructure like wallet infrastructure ecosystem is very right for that yeah I think we're just trying to make it as easy as possible to get to drift um so we're working with different wallets to make it easier to interact with drift and then we're also working with Bridges to make it easier to get to drift um and so it's just like reducing that friction I think the bet for like right currently ethereum has the best distribution like without a doubt um I think Solana is like like trailing but of like the next tier of um chains has great distribution and the BET kind of is the next bull market if there's an inflow of demand Solana will have the best pipes to like support that demand and so probably you see ethyl two's like the block space gets saturated fees Spike people get mad and then hopefully there's just Bridges and they like they pop over to Solana and they trade on drift and then Solana has the pipes to support all the demand and you know maybe some app chains and Cosmos also have the pipes but they're even further out and they stop on drift before they even get to uh into the Cosmosphere so it's kind of like what it's a combination of like what has good distribution and also what's close enough to users that um you can suck them in in the next bull market when things get crazy um so that's that's kind of our thesis one other um distribution points um thing that we we've been very focused on is yeah how do you actually distribute the Solana D app to users on on Eve um because that's been like a there's a huge Market there that we're not tapping um at the moment but we're starting to see a sort of a lot of inflows that come into drift like via evm and how we're thinking about this going back to the the neutral like product question it's like Building Bridges to as many places as possible um metaphorically and actually um so we've built an in-app bridge that allows you to bridge from ethereum um and how to's via Mayan and Wormhole directly into your drift account um that's been a really popular feature for like arbitrim users um because they're actually attracted by they want to do like cross um cross-chain like trades funding radar things like that and something that was uniquely enables that um and you know something that we're going to be launching very soon uh is a integration with metamask snaps that allows users who have metamask to actually connect to drift and British Drive funds over directly so we're super excited about that because sudden lost you know what 30 million like nms users and um gives that like wide distribution channel that we wanted that's that's amazing do you know um do you know when those are snaps live like have they gone live in general they're in beta right now but um a lot of protocols that are integrating synapse early are getting their audits finished we just finished ours so hopefully we should be launching that next month which we're super excited about that's really cool I'm surprised you didn't tease that immediately if anyone doesn't know snaps you kind of described it there but snaps is a way for people that are using metamask which is just really for the evm and like ethereum they can then use applications on other chains and you can do a whole lot else on Snapchat it's really cool really cool release coming yeah we also uh so we wrote one and then right now it's like tailored to integrate like there's some drift branding but it's all open source and we're hoping that it can evolve into like a plugable thing so other D5 protocols could Fork it and use it um so it's it should be also a good public good to get you know more reasons for people to come over to Solana which obviously like Rising tide lifts all boats type of thing I want to maybe put on my hologram hat and start zooming out and talking more startupy stuff um one interesting thing about perps drift Salon D5 blockchain in general is so you guys there's competition within Solana in terms of per exchanges but then there's also competition in all of crypto within purpose changes how do you is your mission like as a founder and as a leading engineer what is the what is the approach there like are you trying to get people that aren't in crypto to use it are you more interested in power users from other chains how should how do you think about go to market we like to start at the very um at the very top I guess um I guess it's smaller funnel but people who are already used to defy and getting them onto onto a perfect change that's like bully on chain people because people can sort of buy into the mission uh maybe people who like got burnt by FTX and is looking for an alternative to that um that's sort of like top of the funnel for us um the second there is like people from evm um who we think can get a better experience on drift um to to Market there so it's a very different kind of funnel um and obviously at like the lowest and widest like level of the funnel is like people who maybe trade on Robin Hood but are looking for something that they can de-gen on like on chain maybe the reason that they would trade on drift is very different from the reason that a Solana um a Solana lover would trade under for the salon of person it's because it's already there versus like somebody who has traded um you know maybe options and like Futures before but doesn't know much about crypto it's sort of like giving people different reasons to come in for the third audiences it's maybe adding like really exotic um assets that they can't trade anywhere else and having liquidity for that rather than emphasizing the on-chain question um so the way we kind of separate and segment people um and users is by like targeting like and having like pockets of a product like appeal to appeal to them yeah I think um I think about it like moving in concentric circles so you start with the core use case like get super fans basically build the network that satisfies them and then on the edges you keep layering on like more abstractions and I think you see you like uniswap is basically doing this like you can critique them or um think it's you know you can complement them on how they're doing it but like the uniswap X thing is like trying to utilize their core protocols and add a layer on top where you can do gasless transactions right so um I think we're kind of similar we're we're super focused on building this robust underlying protocol and then adding layers on top and getting each like next marginal type of user um on board um so I like to answer a lot one thing I am curious about is your overall thoughts on defy um as you know product minded people like what are you are you happy with the state of Define crypto what what has defy gotten wrong what are we what do we need to improve on I definitely am not happy with the state of D5 I think I think the current versions of it are basically just like uh warm-ups for like the future uh where you have a financial system that's open and transparent um and ultimately because of that safer and cheaper I think you look at the Modern Financial system and it's really securitized by lawyers and it's really expensive and no one knows what's going on um which you know there's this like semblance of safety but really it's like um behind that arguably like uh not very reliable and the bet on Defy is that by making it open transparent and having devs write all the rules it'll be cheaper in the long run it'll be safer and obviously right now that hasn't been the case at all so it's been like a failure by the builders to accomplish that but I think the reason people keep investing in it is because that vision of like a programmatic open system is will be so much better than like kind of the analog system that we have and I see like for my own career drift is just like like we're starting with the core like Risk seeking crypto users that like it right now but it's like a warm-up for finding the mechanisms um that'll ultimately allow for like the whole financial system to work like this and so it's like kind of like I was talking about before I think Defy is still kind of like a toy um in a lot of ways and it's like outside the core system but it's like until we can just like serve the core native users it's kind of crazy to think like normal people are going to use it um so I'm just like what motivates me is to nail it for the core native users now and then scale it up over time and um yeah I wanna I Wanna Live in the world where the financial system is secured by like great code written by like amazing devs so that's what I'm hoping for and I think another point that D5 has sort of failed in is just unincentivized usage I think over the past couple years and this might be good for like D5 backholders and early users but um a lot of the initial growth was driven by so like over incentivization um to the point where a lot of the the equity value of like governance tokens in defy has been like almost saturated you know that market is like definitely an oversupply and that's also one of the reasons that we rely a lot on um Native and natural incentivization to get people to use vertical um in a way you sort of get this like short-term Flux Of um in influx or users um via like huge incentivizations but um the the effect of that in the long term is that these even protocols kind of become unusable because the value of that collateral the value of the the tokens um go down over time so I think a lot of teams have relied on this as like a short-term crutch to um try to get like an initial amount of users but you know that's not really the kind of game that we want to be playing um within D5 um we we want to build something that that actually lasts and has a natural like incentive mechanism within itself um without uh necessarily over incentivizing to to to buy an external tool I'm not saying that that's not something that um what would happen uh but I think it's important to start with the actual like internal flows first rather than over incentivizing it initially that brings up an interesting point to actually talk about incentivization um what do you guys think about the state of Solana defy in terms of tokenomics a very common criticism is that no projects on launch tokens or there's just nothing to trade um how do you guys think about this what how would you respond what we're trying to do is like build a sustainable Marketplace that doesn't require like that could work without um constant token subsidies so um that's why we have this crazy liquidity Trifecta that people are like what the heck is going on but it's because we're like actually trying to have competitive market forces like lead to um a great marketplace where I think like the easy thing to do is like okay launch a token incentivize users and then somehow when it's up you'll like get a network effect um but nine out of ten times maybe maybe higher than that it's like teams launch a token and then they don't get a network effect and then the token goes to zero and then the users who hold the bag get upset anyway so I think when you do a token I think a token used well can create a network effect but when you do it you need to land the network effect otherwise it goes it like dies so I think you just need to be really thoughtful about the rollout of a token and how um how you make it sustainable as those token emissions go down and it's really hard and I think uh you just want to be mindful of how you do it but there's a lot of teams that have done it well I think dydx so far you know that helped them get like their V3 Marketplace is really good and it's like a great exchange I think the depend stuff is another example of trying to use a token to get a network effect and it working really well with like uh helium so I think there's good examples you just like really need to iron out how the incentives work otherwise it's going to fail I think what a token enables is a hardcore group of loyalists and and fans to she own a part of your network so what we really like about um like D5 token models is and at the risk of this um you know sounding like a security in a way it's like users have to put in the work and the effort to get rewards from the network so what I mean by that is you shouldn't be getting a token for free and you should only be getting tokens for like proportional to the amount of work that you're putting into a network or the risk that you're taking so Market making is an uh you know free exercise like you need to put in infrastructure and being rewarded for that like makes sense um putting money into the insurance one of the D5 protocol for instance also makes sense the distribution Network because you're sort of giving out tokens to people who have already put in like time and an effort to um use the protocol so I think a lot of our philosophy around that um is that the people who use and champion and have skin in the game the most um those are the ones that the token should be distributed um to so yeah I think uh Salon Delphi hasn't really rewarded this type of faction um which is also interesting to see because all this traction has come from um just people who want to contribute in like natural incentives but when you layer in something that could accelerate that I think um maybe that's that's that's what we need for a Solana summer at some point um but you know I think the initial attraction needs to be there first as far as as I understand it that's not a security because there's idiosyncratic effort and risk being rewarded um separately it's not like a pooling a fund and a common Enterprise so uh I think piggybacking on that like things like uber and Lyft they actually did liquidity mining or token economics by other means they basically would pay early drivers at a loss in cash but that cash came from selling tokens to investors so this idea of like um overpaying initial users to bootstrap a network effect is actually really common I think it's just like the current Arrangement makes it hard for like the early users to actually share in the upside of uh bootstrapping a network and like if you're an Uber a Lyft driver early on like you probably would have preferred if you got some like Uber or Lyft and I think they tried to do that but they uh they couldn't do it so it's like none of this stuff is actually that crazy new um there's like precedence for all this stuff um and uh yeah I think that the token is to reward users for work that's valuable for the network in order to bootstrap the network effect that's how you get like lasting value or power and what I do that we keep coming back to is that a lot of the ideas within crypto and like token distribution is very counter-intuitive to um traditional principles of um of I guess startups and and Tech startups in particular um for instance like all of d5's Open Source um you know giving giving more equity and giving more token away can actually help you bootstrap a network faster than if you kind of kept it all to yourself right so um taking these principles in mind and applying them like specifically to DPI um is is an interesting exercise for people coming in from like Trad five because all these concepts are so counter-intuitive right so I hold on to as much Equity as possible um like to do like you know drive your competitors and your fees to zero um but in and you probably sort of like you see this lack of um elasticity to fees because people still like want to use the protocol that maybe give some the most rewards so allows them to own this much of it as possible so that's a really interesting phenomenon that we've seen in defy and I'm really excited to see it play out within Solana yeah I love those answers and Uber didn't just do liquidity mining with the supply side the drivers they did the demand side too because I remember I was living in Dallas Texas at the time and they'd give out referral codes and if you pass those along to your friends you get 20 off a ride and Arkansas is two years behind on everything so I racked up like 500 two years later when my friend started using Uber um but uh talking about defy uh Chris I'm curious what really both of you what do you think about the other sectors outside of D5 in Solana Chris you had a pretty hot take saying if Salon is defy ecosystem doesn't work or fails that the nft network like the nft ecosystem was fell as well so can you uh can you explain that for the audience how far back in my tweets did you go and then pretty pretty deep I just sleuthed on you a little bit wow what did I even what did I even think when I said that I I couldn't read it for you I tweet hot takes like mer like just you know off the cuff while I'm like waiting in line for a coffee um I guess I was like I was thinking like okay nft as a pfp as a metadata that points to like an S3 or our weave link is not useful like or it's not going to be valuable you're going to need to embed more logic and more value in the chain itself for it to like mean anything really instead of doing it off chain so it's like if you can't have D5 mechanisms on chain like are you really gonna have gaming mechanisms like or anything when people talk about nfts like they they like imagine it's just like a piece of a bigger of a bigger system so it's like if we can't make it work with D5 you're probably not going to make it work with any other of these use cases um and it was more like a Solana needs to be good enough to support like on-chain activity for any of these things to be valuable um I think is what I was saying there um like you're not just gonna have a metadata pointing to S3 bucket and like that's just going to be inherently valuable if users can't like get their trades through or their transactions through I think I tweeted that like when Seoul was probably like at its uh trough in terms of performance which has gone a lot better so I'm I guess I'm bullish on nfts now oh wow bullish went around I've got to finish with one more hot take from you Chris you tweeted once I think Dows with security councils with limited permissions Will trump immutable contracts in the long term um just curious what makes you say that and you still feel that way oh cool um I guess there's yeah there's two different things there uh I tweeted that because um basically the curve exploit happened and um there's like a bug in Viper and now it's a race for a white hack versus a black cat to take the money from the curve pool and it's like I think people who are very bullish on immutability it's like I get where it's coming from but I think D5 is complicated enough that it's really hard to do and like the curve exploit the curve team was perfect in a lot of ways built a great thing and then it's just like a dependency had a bug and not anyone that was using that like is affected it seems like that is just it's too fragile where it's like a governance system does like you can have a governance system where there's limited permissions and there's only certain things they can do and perhaps it boosts the value to participants and participants in the network so what I was imagining is like with curve well what if you had trusted people voted by the Dow that have like basically ability to kill certain like turn off certain pools and like they're only allowed to use it in certain circumstances and with like with the Viper hack you could basically just turn off remove liquidity and then it's like it's frozen which sucks but it's better than probably having downside risk all the way to zero and curve has a dow and they're voting on things so it's like why isn't there some Security Council that can just like Blacklist things and turn things off and um I think the immutability thing comes out of Bitcoin which I think makes sense for something as simple as Bitcoin but when you start getting like as you try to increase the complexity I think you can like relax some of the assumptions about immutability for and lead to like a safer system but that doesn't mean like the Dow should be able to you know do whatever it wants and like take users funds or changes the rules like randomly it should be very limited permissions um I actually think like the U.S government as much people hate on it like the founders of the US Government tried to frame this constitution to like similarly have this like checks and balances on power because they're like you can't just be like overly idealistic and um they actually sought to make it decentralized while still having humans in the loop so I don't think uh it's crazy to have some humans in the loop for defy and very limited um ways and I I'll shout out mango because I'm pretty sure they have something like this like a security Council that can turn off certain instructions like just blanket for the whole protocol if they see things going wrong and I think I think that's like a good move in the spirit of keeping with the founding fathers and getting philosophical um before we do rapid fire I want to ask a question um that is going to be very general but I am curious we've talked about you know what drift is and why drift exists what you guys think about D5 one thing that I'm curious about is you know crypto is this very interesting ecosystem and environment full of interesting demographics um and and challenges why are you building in crypto like what what is your why why do you get up and and build things for both of you yeah um I guess initially got into crypto because it felt like there was a lot of inefficiencies within the crypto space that um you know could be improved by better like infrastructure and you know when we talk about inefficiencies it's also inefficiencies within um the the traditional like Finance World um like sending money from Malaysia where I'm from to the US um is still a huge hassle right and like takes like three or four days to clear um I lived in many countries in my life I used to live in Korea uh where you know we had Capital controls you couldn't withdraw more than a certain amount a year out of the country um lived in Shanghai before where you you literally can't um be part of the financial ecosystem if you're not um Chinese right you're you're locked out of of entirely like um the Finance of the whole um so so a lot of my initial motivations for coming to crypto's like this is really interesting because you finally there's for the first time ever like you have the potential for a globally um for a globally subtle um currency uh that allows anyone to participate without qyc without needing to um without needing to know like who your final party is and now you know today I think you're starting to see like a little bit of that Vision come true with um the uscc and some other stables and and Bitcoin youth um even Seoul where now I can send uscc from one pencil to another like without incurring any um more than like some some Penny fees right so I think that was a lot of the why for me um which was the access question um being able to participate in a financial ecosystem building for users who can't trade perks if they are kyc anywhere or um you know cancer person different parts of the world and that sort of just evolved into like tackling these inefficiencies in the first place yeah I guess um for me I think I was always a little bit of like an outsider or um self-taught where I didn't feel like I had like a certain pedigree to be a software engineer so I picked it up later in life and kind of like believed that anyone could learn anything if they were given the resources and like they were driven enough and I think when I stumbled upon crypto and I just saw it was so open and transparent and like um basically there are no Gatekeepers I was like wow this is amazing like anyone can just come in here read the source code pick it up learn how all of Finance works from like first principles and I was like I just like kind of got obsessed with it um where I felt like even though I didn't work in like hft or anything I could just come in and learn how a club works or learn how borrow Lynn works and it's like really just um kind of an amazing Community to be a part of because everyone's like that everyone's like if you want to you can contribute and if you want to you can learn and you can go and build something that a bunch of people will use versus before that I was at um I was working on Alexa and kind of in an AI and like the capital cost to work in AI are so high that like you kind of have to kowtow and like raise a ton of money before you can do anything so I really think crypto is like like friendly to Outsiders and the little guy in a way that other Industries aren't and um I just like fell in love with that and like I feel like I've learned so much just being in this space like people criticize Solana for being closed Source but like you literally have all these Financial Primitives all the best teams are open sourcing their code and if you want to go read it you can learn how a cloud works you can learn how a risk engine works Etc and I think that's just amazing and I want to contribute to that love both as answers I would I would say I feel that the same way and I also often tell people that like if you're in traditional Finance you want to talk to the CEO of say like Bank of America or Goldman Sachs or it might be like you have no chance but in crypto you can just DM someone on Twitter that's like the founder of a top protocol and you can talk to them so it's really really cool Cindy you uh apparently have lived in quite quite a few places I didn't know that that's pretty cool um obviously there's a lot of interesting regulatory challenges let's say in the USA um and you guys are a D5 team you you are on Solana as well how do you guys think about the position of being a Founder in building like uh in the USA um is that does that scare you at all um how should uh what what words of advice would you give to other people who maybe have a similar conundrum right now not legal advice leave the US um I mean I think for us we think about it in the sense that we're a globally decentralized team um we don't really have an HQ anywhere per se um people can sort of build and live wherever they want to be for remote for his team that like focuses a lot on like building like this culture where we have hubs all around the world people like um come to different locations uh and like build a team from there and I think that's from a regulatory standpoint I'll be the the best way to like operate within within D5 it's it's very hard to like be a D5 team and like live I guess directly in the US but you're kind of seeing like maybe teams that like are classical and D5 like uniswap DUI DX um being like a bit Brazen with like their building office space like directly in the middle of like New York right um whereas I think um for us as a smaller team uh makes more sense to have a global presence um in in regions that are a little bit more friendly um to crypto and that's like a choice I guess individually made by the contributors on the team versus US putting our flag down and being like we're based here now um yeah that's our philosophy towards them yeah I think um I think if you really buy into the principles of defy and do it the right way like you're not doing anything wrong or illegal I think it's the people that like do scam icos and like commit fraud that are doing something illegal and like you know does it is it unfair that the US goes after them I don't really think so but like if you build a legitimate Dao it's permissionless it's this adaptive organism and like you're not issuing Securities like I don't think there's anything wrong with being in the US and I think um I actually think Defy is like in a continuation of like American principles where it's like there's a rule-based system that is governed by some democratic body that updates the rules for the betterment of the system and I think I think the US will come around especially if like the more good builders that like live up to the principles of defy um so yeah I think as long as you do it the right way you'll be fine as evident by like dydx compound uniswap Etc now it's time to get a little lizard brain so we're going to be doing rapid fire um I will ask brief questions and try to answer briefly but expand if you want um I want City to answer first and then and then Chris in that order every time just to make it predictable um and then Garrett might jump in as well okay uh question number one how do you explain perps to your mom betting on the price of something um with more money than you have in your wallet yeah you just you get to trade um any asset and uh basically pick whether you think it's gonna go up or down what is everybody mid-carving about D5 see everyone expects D5 to continue to innovate in the underlying layers um like making things more complicated um which is what like you know gets like nerd Snipes people and developers but I think it's more important to actually focus on Valley capture and distribution than the underlying mechanisms yeah I'd agree um you should they like they're not uh thinking enough about how protocols can capture value and build like sustainable business models or alternatively they use a lot of buzzwords and like act like crypto is this new phenomena and not just like a continuation of like business principles what is your most unpopular take about crypto unpopular in usdt so a very cool collateral Chris will probably disagree I guess this is like I feel like it's there's so many frames of reference but vis-a-vis um other crypto people is that like Bitcoin digital gold has pmf but I feel against like all uh all like my other Tech friends that like crypto is actually gonna be valuable I go on um you're you're seeing a narrative on Twitter some people are pushing that like this next cycle is going to be like all about cash flows um should protocols turn on a fee or is that short-sighted I think I think protocol should turn on MP and that's kind of part of the value capture and narrative um ultimately um things that aren't capturing any fees will go to zero over time or will become public goods that um certainly doesn't have funding um behind so these are really the only sustainable way for us to kind of dive into the next big bull run yeah to to have no fees is like basically to just like capitulate and say like you're not gonna you're not gonna make it like you should have fees they should be redistributed to users and then if you can they should be reinvested in the protocol to form some type of moat what is your three favorite D5 apps other than drift um a great one Jupiter has great UI and uh unironically really like uidx's ux as well yeah I like um like Jupiter I like M Soul and I mean I'm yeah I don't know drift super sexual sensor I actually already know you said D5 I feel like tensor guys are doing a really good job yeah yeah I agreed uh for people listening we did have tensor on just just a Shameless show if you want to navigate to the previous episodes um what advice would you have for crypto Founders moving um moving fast uh is probably a little bit overrated um because moving fast might mean you over index to the the current trends um I would like mobilize quickly but also with a longer term mission in mind so don't over index to kind of like short-term pumps and entrance because then you get very distracted and you kind of hair brained and you lose sight of the mission try to think from first principles or just like or even like Old School principles so don't just buy the hype and if you can't explain things and understand why they're working then you don't understand it and you shouldn't believe it I think embrace the open source transparent ethos like let like put your work out there build in the public let users and Community challenge you and just be honest I think people value um like Candor basically in the 21st century so just put it out there and do the best you can and uh I think you get rewarded for that what is something that you've completely changed your mind on in the past year yeah I don't know I don't know I've changed my mind that much this year I feel like maybe my trust in in institutions um that seem strong long-standing has gone down a lot um with me uh that whole FTX incident it was probably been the the biggest like I think yeah institutions that people believed uh were long-standing and trustworthy likely are not and there's usually a single part of failure in these and that's probably like the biggest eye-opener for me in the past year um I think I um I think I flip more bullish on the traditional Financial system after just seeing the wreckage of uh crypto the last year um I think at least in the beginning of 2022 is like okay like US dollar is a joke everything is gonna break into the extent that they just flip the other direction it really just showed how important the US dollar is and obviously there's still issues like banks are still in trouble from the all the um interest rate hikes but I feel like you can't deny the fact that like the US dollar is still so important and that crypto got ahead of itself so I think that was super humbling and just like showed that my mental model about like how inflation and all this stuff was gonna work was really naive and over simplistic so that was humbling yeah it's maybe not always the best for crypto at the moment but I do enjoy not just seeing like Doomer after Doomer post on on Twitter right now which was going on for a while um but I think that's a that's a good place to wrap um Chris and Cindy thank you so much for joining um I'm gonna put links to the show notes to drift everybody should definitely go check it out it's really really cool and you can learn a lot when you're doing it as well so thank you so much for joining today thank you thank you guys this is awesome yeah all right we'll see you next time bye
