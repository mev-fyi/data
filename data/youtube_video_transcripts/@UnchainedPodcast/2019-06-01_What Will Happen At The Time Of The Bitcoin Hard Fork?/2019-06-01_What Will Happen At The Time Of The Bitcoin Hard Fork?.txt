fork if this is a topic you are not familiar with I suggest you go read an article I wrote that came out last week called will this battle for the soul of Bitcoin destroy it it's a long read it's actually the longest article I've ever written I think but it describes the philosophical differences between the two sides of this upcoming hard fork the political differences and how the hard fork itself could play out you can also refer back to a couple episodes I've now done on this topic episode 19 why Bitcoin may slip into and how to prevent it with Jeff garsik and Charlie Lee in April and episode 26 why November will be the real test for Bitcoin with Eric Lombroso and Brian Hoffman and that came out in July the very brief background here is that blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain have been getting full which has been driving up fees as people compete to get transactions included in the next block or one seen after it's come down to two proposals to increase the number of transactions that can be processed at any given time one is called seg wit which is a different way of organizing the information in the blocks and the other is a compromise solution that includes segments but also just doubles the size of the block and that's called segment 2x the first proposal just Segway is mostly backed by the developers and a vocal contingent of users and secretary is mostly backed by some of the largest startups in this space such as coinbase blockchain Zappos circle and block as well as the vast majority of the miners as of today which is Wednesday the Wednesday before this episode comes out about 80 to 85 percent of miners are signalling their intention to put their hash power to segue to X as of the time of this recording however a few markets have opened for so-called chain split tokens which functions sort of like futures markets and those are the exact opposite they show 85% support for the 1 megabyte chain and only 15% support for the segment 2x chain so around November 15th or 16th this hard fork to a chain featuring a 2 megabyte block will occur creating possibly temporarily possibly permanently to block chains both with segments but one with a 1 megabyte block and the other with a 2 megabyte block here to discuss how and why it's reached this point and what could happen next our mic belching CEO of echo and one of the developers of the secretary for and Matt Correll Oh a long time that coin protocol developer welcome mic and bad hey Laura hey thanks for having Mike can you briefly tell us your role in segue to X sure well Vic oh did not sign the New York agreement which is kind of what kicked off the process for segue to X I think my role in this debate goes back a couple of years now uh you know as does mass we've all been working hard to figure out how do we move forward with improving scalability for Bitcoin well there's a lot of different approaches that have been talked about over the last few years and there's been a lot of heated debate over all you know we get excited about this as though it's all contentious and we want different things but actually probably more common than we're not common so anyway in in May of this year what did lead to this is you know Sedwick had been out there you know we had been unable to achieve consensus to activate steglich largely blocked by the mining contingent the community as you know is made up of many different folks but a lot of us wanted to cigarete go through and we wanted to how to increase capacity more generally as well so we actually a group of folks led by Barry Silbert got together said hey how can we get past this impasse how can we get seg would activate as we make everybody come together with consensus to get this done and we came up with with basically the same plan that had been come up with a year ago before at the Hong Kong agreement which was this to do segment and a two megabyte home increase so that's what we came up with and I've been interested in that I think that you know bitcoin has a long prosperous future out of it and it's gonna take a lot of changes good ones it's gonna take good engineering it take our effort we have to get consensus again and again to do different types of things that's what makes the coin great so there'll be more things that we have to do to make it available to the world yeah so my did my my involvement to promote the both both types of capacity increases and looking forward to that that going through and so why did Vicco not sign but but you're working on the this segue to X code yeah well sometimes I get you know all the just an ignorance CEO but actually my background is in technology I yeah I've been involved with standards processes for protocols you'll find my name at the top of the specification for HTTP 2.0 so you know the internet protocols mostly have been developed through a process which which is chartered with the IETF which is the internet Engineering Task Force and that's where my background comes from I don't like the idea of companies signing agreements and saying hey we're gonna do it I think the great ideas start from the ground up we start with development you get a good group of people together every idea it starts with one or two people they work together they figure out how to make a little better you start to socialize it grow it and grow it and grow it and the IETF is very much about individuals coming together and trying to break chains of whatever corporate sponsor then they come from so for instance when an individual comes to protocol development the ITF they know that they vote as an individual and even if a company may send you know five ten a hundred developers to a conference each of those developers speaks for themselves and not for their company so I mean the New York agreement I'm not trying to discredit it it's fine well it just not for me I think about first ya don't score and then you know people want to say yes I support this I don't support this you know coming you need sign offs right so so that's all fine but um we didn't like that approach it had been done a few times before in the Bitcoin space to try to just get a paper write off and you know they haven't worked and folks from all sides have tried that right I mean folks on that the core development team assigned these things corporate folks assigned these things the Bitcoin Satoshi roundtable put one together I mean this they just haven't worked very well so really I was looking for something different okay and that would explain why I don't know if any listeners saw this but on Twitter people and I think this was on reddit people were laughing because there was a Twitter exchange between you and some of the some of your own employees where you guys were arguing about when X 1 megabyte versus 2 megabytes and they thought it was funny that um that you are publicly airing your differences and I also just actually wanted to reference for listeners earlier Mike talked about the difficulty in getting segment 2x adopted and that was sorry segment adopted and that was because after the developers created that code they said oh well only adopt it as long as 95 percent of miners signal that they would like it and only about 30 percent did so obviously it didn't get adopted and then he also mentioned Barry Silbert who if you don't know his the head of the digital currency group which is one of the biggest investors in the space and they have invested in I think almost like a hundred different bit coin and crypto companies around the world ok so let's try to Matt Matt what is your role with the Bitcoin protocol um so I've been a developer on various Bitcoin projects since 2011 early 2011 which to me I believe roughly the 6th publicly recorded person to contribute to the Bitcoin project as it was called at the time now Bitcoin core I've also contributed to numerous scaling proposals and implementations of an of projects across the Bitcoin space yes I I just have a long background developing various technologies in and around the Bitcoin space I want to push back on a few things and a few characterizations here first of all I think viewing segue to X in the context of just a block size change or just a block stage debate is frankly somewhat myopic great I thought your article or it was really great it gave a lot of background a lot of detail but it did miss kind of the fundamental reason why so many people are staunchly opposed to segue to X great and that's because it like every other hard fork proposal and hard fork attempt over the last four years as Mike mentioned there's been numerous ones numerous sign-on letters numerous proposals numerous whatever have baked in a kind of proposal for how to change the governance in Bitcoin and how how Bitcoin should be changed in the future and we've seen segue to exit I think it's been really interesting because it has cut right at the heart of how people to find it and there are numerous different answers this question and I think all of them are valid but we really need to be focusing on what are the kind of core beliefs that lead people to have such strong feelings about this kind of change and there's a lot of people coming down on different sides and I find that really interesting right there's a lot of companies who've come out and said that they will call Bitcoin the thing that has the most hash power over time there's some companies that have come down and said they refer to Bitcoin as the thing which is defined by its rules as software and that changes to it require some level of fairly broad consensus and that if there isn't such a thing then the default is that there should be no change some people are defining Bitcoin according to the markets and according to which one has the most value and which one people are willing to purchase for more money and I think it's it's been really fascinating to watch how people define Bitcoin and how people just talk past each other and many of these issues so much of it has been focused on that but people are often not willing to have those debates directly yeah actually it's funny that you mentioned that I didn't put that in my article because I don't know if you remember like I framed it as like oh these are some of the different divides and there are parts where I talk about how like some people defined Bitcoin you know this way and then others like I do mention like Oh some are saying they're following the white paper which says like it's the longest chain which they're describing as accumulated difficulty and then others are saying it'll be determined by price by users so I did I actually did include that but I didn't make it a section the way that I did some of the other divides but I do agree with you that that is actually really really really interesting to be that's popped up I do actually have a question later on to to get back out to this point so I'd like to actually circle back to it later um but first I want to turn back to Mike and just ask you Mike why not call off segue to X at this point the chains what tokens across multiple exchanges are trading 85% for the 1x coins and 15% for the 2x coins and the split is going to create havoc across the world for both users on exchanges and hosted wallets as well as users who manage their own private keys and their own wallets so why why even follow through at this point well I don't think it's a it's gonna cost havoc at all actually I'm pretty confident that coming out of this one way or another the community is going to come together I think we've actually seen this type of debate you know right where we're at today it seems like there's just no way it's all gonna come together but we've seen this before if you go back to Internet protocols in the mid-90s we had a problem which was actually pretty much the same set of debates about centralization versus scalability at that time it had to do with routing tables and honestly you know the folks involved in those debates they were so extreme on their different views the name-calling the arguments is so similar to what we have today and the debate was that we had grown to a point where the existing protocols you took a lot of a lot of RAM and so you had a really large router box and you'd like to gigabytes of RAM right in order to hold the full routing tables and so some proposals were on the table for how to make it scale better and of course as you start to think about what the trade-offs are gonna be you end up with the exact same set of trade-offs that we have today with with the Bitcoin debate here you know is it centralizing is this giving too much power to one group and how are we gonna scale if we don't do it so we've been through these things before and they do resolve so the one thing I I would say to the world is like look you don't have to worry this is gonna be a little bit chaotic for a little while but we're gonna get through it in terms of the futures markets I think that's a it's definitely something to look at I wish we had a really good indicator that that you could fully rely on one thing you've got to remember is that you know these are running through exchanges it requires you to put your coins on those exchanges it's gonna be interesting to get the market price to really settle out and it's certainly something that that I'm watching I think it's the best indicator of all and yeah it's you know you talk to folks on both sides of the fence people are worried about putting their money on bit finex there's a couple of other exchanges doing it as well now but it's not like we have a full open eat order book it's a very thin market we know what happens within markets you end up with prices that are manipulatable it's not much of a thin market though right there's about two million dollars a day traded on the Bissonnette market and there is quite a decent amount of volume traded on the who OB market as well so it's really not that thin of a market right if you're looking at this and you're saying like oh well I think it's clearly gonna go the other way or even the market is off by more than 20% there is a lot of money to be made in betting the other way and writing it off based on well you know some people aren't willing to put their coins in exchange that's true but there's some people on both sides of the fence as you point out so that shouldn't materially affect the price more than one way or another I think it's it's you know these these prediction markets are actually very important and looking at where things are gonna go here well a two million dollar day market is a tiny market there's no doubt about that very manipulable very very very thin so there's still a lot of money to be made that I mean I mean you can make 1020 million dollars if you think it's gonna go the other way why haven't people then well it takes a lot of time for people to move cold storage as you know I mean you know people are apprehensive about moving large amounts of wine and I think you know we probably both agree that the bulk of Bitcoin users out there are fairly neutral on the topic they're like hey can't this just be solved already I'm certainly pulled our customers and I know where they're at I do think that the markets are important don't get me wrong I think they're very very important I think that the best indicator there is but I don't think that we have a great indicator yet so still watching it okay and I um I also have a question for you why not capitulate why don't the Bitcoin core developers just adopt a two megabyte block size limit into Bitcoin core and say hey it's dangerous to have a chain with only 15% the hash power you know it's it can be so easily attacked let's just work together with a miner since they're part of the Bitcoin community too and do our best to ensure than this hard work is not contentious and also that Bitcoin core retains control of the protocol yeah that argument a lot and I'm actually really glad you brought it up because I think it rather fundamentally misunderstands what Bitcoin core is right Bitcoin core is not an organization it's not really even a group of people it's more about it's a process and you can maybe argue that it's a group of people who believe in a process but it's a process and it's a process whereby changes are thoroughly vetted anyone can participate in this process it's very open even the top people who contribute a lot are very active in contributing in the open on public mailing lists on discussion on github in various places and when you look at Sigma 2 X there you know all of these features that are key to the process of making changes in Bitcoin core and ability Eve that most of the community holds ear as the process of making changes to Bitcoin just aren't there right this is why you saw the sole Bitcoin meetup yes really Bitcoin Association the Bitcoin Argentina meetup the bickering Munich Mita all released statements from their members from large groups of individuals who care deeply about Bitcoin are heavily invested in Bitcoin and are very knowledgeable about Bitcoin denouncing Segway to X and saying that this just isn't the process by which changes should be made there is no discussion as my kind of said there this New York agreement was pretty much a declaration it said this change is happening most of the writings on Segway to X on the side which works mailing lists and from people pushing the project are simply stating that this is gonna happen and miners are gonna switch to it and that'll kind of be the end of it and so this is kind of fundamentally incompatible with the process that is Bitcoin core and with the process that is Bitcoin and defines Bitcoin to so many of its users Matt I didn't say that this is the fact though it's got to be this way and the New York agreement didn't say that either what we did say is like hey we would like to go figure out a mechanism to look at increasing the block size through hard for yeah that's in there it wasn't even created by the Segway to I've seen this is an idea that's been battered around for a long time Aparna why I didn't sign the agreement is because I think the process is to go figure out how to do it and make sure you can do it test it do all those things those things have happened and this characterization that you know the Segway to X team did not do those things is just a myth people like to on you know criticize things you won't find me focusing on the wrong part of the process though you just mentioned testing and engineering effort but that is like the last 10% of the process the first 90% of the process by which all of these meetup groups all of these users who care deeply about Bitcoin and people who are contributors to Bitcoin Cork's who are deeply about is consensus and asking people with their view is I'm glad you mentioned the hong kong agreement that i was a party to and some other people signed I believe it was about a year and a half ago and compared it to Segway 2x but the reality is it's fundamentally different it was very very carefully worded and it says that if there is strong community support but there wasn't and so it was largely dropped but Segway to X instead you look at comments from many of its most vocal proponents and they say very clearly hash power is going to adopt it and then this is going to happen and sure you know I think a lot of people have somewhat back downs and that view and said well you know if the market doesn't support it or hash rate doesn't support it that's ok but this is still cutting to the fundamental question and how you defined it is it based on hash power it is it based on users and consensus for changes and what does that process look like whoa wait but Matt I have a question about if you turn that same lens onto adoption of Segway where only 30% of minors wanted Segway and and you're saying like oh you know you shouldn't force things onto other people and stuff like that some of the people on the two websites say oh well then you know this user activated software tried to force said went on to the minors and Bitcoin core didn't announce them and yet they're not denouncing Segway to X even though they're saying that they're doing kind of the same thing so why why is that I mean the reality is many if not most of the people contributing to Bitcoin core very very strongly denounced it 148 in the UA SF moment including myself including several other people at chain code the research and development lab I work with many people very strongly denounced it because it didn't have that level of consensus there was a large part of the community that acted in spite of these denunciations but claiming that people working on Bitcoin core didn't denounce it is just a misnomer there were one or two more come out with an official denunciation against secreto X but it didn't against the UA SF the the problem is Bitcoin core is as I mentioned kind of a process and the process for making any kind of formal announcements or any formal declarations or formal statement so taking a formal position is about getting consensus across all of the major people who contribute and as I mentioned there were one or two people who contribute to Bitcoin core even often than a minor capacity who were in favor of the UA SF movement and we're pushing for it and so no such statement was possible whereas with 2x there were no such people there's no one who contributes to Bitcoin core who has kind of any interest in it and so such a statement could be made that does not however mean that the individuals involved in Bitcoin core weren't loudly and as a group with the exception of one or two denouncing that 148 because it just simply didn't have the level of consensus that people wanted to see we're getting really super deep into the weeds so I actually just want to take it one outcome - oh no I mean I also you know I'm interested in these details but I also want to take it back to a little bit of a higher level and just ask - an outside person a one megabyte blog versus a two megabyte blog seems like a pretty trivial difference so why is it that you believe so strongly in your in your you know that your way is the right way well I think everyone Matt included don't let me speak for you Matt but would agree that you know there's a lot of work to do on the coin scalability going forward to megabytes by itself is not not the end there will be layer 2 solutions as well that come on in the not too distant future so there's a lot of changes that have to happen but if you got to remember the genesis of where this comes from at the time that we created this proposal we didn't have segments and we didn't have anything else on the table that was shippable anytime soon we do know that you know significant changes to the protocol take years to get through part of that's technical part of that's consensus so we do need to get to a world where we have a steady stream of like things that are coming so that we can get that consensus on time no thanks well anyway what we unblocked and I actually I wanted it I just define this word consensus because both both of you guys are talking about it a lot and you know as we mentioned with the segue proposal the when Bitcoin core released it they said oh it'll only be adopted if 95% of the miners want it is there anything in this world that gets 95 percent support for anything and you know if so like which I just I don't even know if that's possible for anything and if that's the case then what percentage is consensus like can you know secretary to fine in it as 80 percent but I just I don't even know kind of like you know how you figure out what what that even how you define that word well let me let me start with one minor correction Segway wasn't released just based on hash power consensus or based on miners supporting it before the Segway was put in a formal release several contributors to Bitcoin core reached out to every major ecosystem company they could find every single one some of them didn't respond but of those who did not a single one was negative there was not a single response that said no we don't want this there were some responses that said things the effective like yeah you know it'd be nice if it happens or it's not a massive deal for us but it would be good but there was not a single negative response okay just as a reporter I will tell you that I definitely there are two major companies in this face the two biggest who privately complained to me an unsafe way because I guess on their site they have to do a lot of changes to their code to implement it so I do know that but and this was all back in 2016 this is not a recent there were summits there was someone back who responded that you don't think it will happen quickly or that it's not a replacement for other changes and that they still wanted to see other changes and that they would have to make significant changes their code to adopt it but they and thus they might not adopt it quickly remember with seg wit companies and people writing software can adopted over time there's no kind of requirement that they make this changes right away but there wasn't there weren't any responses that said no and maybe some folks who just had such a strong opposition didn't bother to respond I don't know but there weren't any folks who mout strongly against it and even some of the most vocal voices against seg wit from people who have now often migrated to Bitcoin cash viewed it as just not a replacement for other changes and thought that it was the wrong focus well I actually to that point I want to ask do do the core developers think that the block size should ever be increased because wasn't the the one megabyte limit was introduced sort of arbitrarily and it was only put there to prevent spam but Satoshi felt it was you know just like a temporary measure so is this something that you guys think you can ever increase well I mean remember that segue does have the same effect as a block size increasing easy blunted increased blocks are now larger than 1 megabyte well but I mean actually raising the block size limit well it did raise the block size limit right there are blocks greater than one megabyte on the network today no but I'm talking about the actual cap on the blocks rather than do you know what I mean years yeah I mean I we're talking past each other it's a misnomer to say that segue is not a block size increase segue is a backwards compatible block size increase which has technical implications but it is still a block size increase now that said I don't think there are many if any two core contributors or members of the broader technical community in Bitcoin right the technical community in Bitcoin is much larger than Bitcoin core it's a lot of people who believe that know the block size should never be increased but again I think the focus of many if not most of folks do contribute to Bitcoin of a technical level view that changes to the block size and changes to bitcoins core consensus rules in the rules that govern everyone who uses the system should be done only with broad consent of the users who are going to be affected by this change and so it was important with Segway to reach out to a lot of people who is important to ask people at meetups and ask people online and ask companies and then also require adoption for minors just like I think it should be important for any changes to Bitcoin to meet similar thresholds and I do hope that in the future we will reach those thresholds for changes to further increase bitcoins Unchained capacity but we certainly haven't reached those yet and I think a lot of changes to how proposals like Segway to X both get made and are implemented are going to be required for that level of agreement across the community so I'm gonna keep each of you in the hot seat a little bit longer but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsor on-ramp if you're starting up a new project or need some design or branding help on an existing one unrep has you

ramp to learn more and see how they've helped passionate entrepreneurs achieve their dreams go to think on-ramp comm thanks on ramp for being a supporter of this podcast and all of our listeners I'm talking with Segway tours developer Mike Bell she and Bitcoin protocol developer Matt Correll oh so Mike what do you say to the accusations that segue to X represents a corporate takeover of Bitcoin and that this turns what is a decentralized project into a centralized one well I don't think that has any truth I don't think that anyone really can say that with a straight face if you look at the folks that are behind that support said with 2x I mean you're gonna find folks that have helped build the ecosystem you know everybody in the Bitcoin world helps make Bitcoin better the businesses help make it better the exchanges help make it better the payment processors help make it better the folks that want to run funds help make it better so if you think that Barry Silbert or you know winces casares or Steve impaired or you know Peter Smith these are the the leads of major companies Brian Armstrong coinbase if you think these guys are trying to take over Bitcoin I mean you're you're accusing them of exactly what they're against we're all completely in favor of the Bitcoin ethos we believe that bitcoin needs to be more decentralized than it is today not less said with 2x does nothing to change the centralization properties of thick point so actually we are going to be working in the future on making it better not the opposite so I don't know where that comes from I think it's just all part of trying to attack all segments 2x is is a proposal and proposal how to increase capacity on chain Matt says that you know Segway was there and supported is there you know it's been active for three months and two months I guess and it's got all of about you know a five percent increase on chain today that's good I'm glad Segway Serpico was one of the first to implement Segway across all of its wallet so there's a lot of work to be done but you know we think we can do better and we think we have to do more so it's not a corporate takeover by any means and actually it is completely open so this is just an argument to try to try to sway things from a dramatic in a dramatic fashion is just not true I just wanted to agree with Mike here like I think like you were saying earlier about the IETF you know no matter how many people you send to a conference people are still speaking on behalf of themselves and whether the people who are pushing for Segway to X are primarily some CEOs of some Bitcoin companies or whether they're other individuals shouldn't really matter what we should be looking at is what is the level of support from all of the individuals across the Bitcoin community like you said everyone who is interested and who works on Bitcoin in one capacity or another or even just who supports Bitcoin is helping make it better and we should be looking to all of them for changes to Bitcoin and not just some a few individual well I'm so glad that I got a moment when you guys both agreed on something I'm gonna turn that into a little clip and put it on Twitter so that I'll be um nasty at Twitter a cryptic Twitter going on right now maybe I'm gets a little bit nicer um Matt what do you say to the people who contend that the only reason we see such rabid support for one megabyte blocks is due to a long history of censorship on the main Bitcoin subreddit our Bitcoin which they say shuts down any dissenting views I mean I guess I have two answers to that first of all it's somewhat of a joke right the our Bitcoin subreddit had huge issues with spammers and very blatant vote manipulation and BOTS that were just posting the same thing over and over for those of you who are unfamiliar reddit is a platform where comments which appear and comments which appear near the top of the page are the ones that are most voted on by users of the system but it's also very easy to manipulate by getting a bunch of bots and automatically uploading comments you support which results in significantly changing the context of conversation going on and so they tried to fight back some people thought they fought back much too hard some people thought they didn't fight back enough whatever honestly I think it's not all that interesting of an argument because most people I talked to stopped reading read it a long time ago just because it became a mess right as you point out in your article the both ready s are full of people just denouncing the other side and declaring that they're guaranteed to win and they don't care or even bother trying to understand the views of other people all right everyone here is trying to make Bitcoin better everyone is trying their best to push Bitcoin forward and the thing people need to be focusing on is understanding where other people are coming from understanding why hey they're pushing for certain changes in certain ways and trying to work with that and come to some agreement instead of just attacking the other side and so most people I talked to in person at meetups and most the developers I know just barely if ever read reddit because it's just not it yes but I think like I think new users who don't know much about Bitcoin who go to reddit but they're obviously just because of a name our Bitcoin is just gonna attract more of them so I do think some people on the bigger block side feel like oh they're only being presented one view which you know it's just I mean it's just an interesting thing if for any listeners who have not checked out both our BTC sorry our Bitcoin and our BTC you should definitely look at them both because they are just completely different it's it's it's actually somewhat hilarious to see just how different they are um and I guess like in a way maybe it's just because it's so unpleasant maybe to go to a forum where you're just gonna get in fights all the time so there's like a natural kind of like divergence to find your own like-minded people but um but it is quite the sight to behold uh Mike I want to ask you why has minor support for CeBIT 2x been dropping in recent weeks when I began reporting my huge story on psych went to X it was at 95% support my minor support for a segue to X and in the two weeks that I was working on that story it dropped down to 80% and this morning is actually have 77 percent you know you'd have to ask the miners to get the answer that question I mean you know one of the struggles we have with getting consensus is trying to figure out how people feel and then you know trying to understand if they're gonna change their mind or if that could change their mind so you know often you hear criticism saying that like these types of events are or these types of signals are not valid because people can change their mind and of course there's true to that but does that what make you worry at all about pulling off your okay because I know you've you secreto X is like an upgrade to the network so it doesn't this reduce the chances that you're gonna be able to pull it off in that fashion yeah I mean absolutely right if you don't have minor support like you know then this isn't this isn't an interesting thing to do so I mean at 77% you don't have to have to to look at a little bit if it goes way down then eventually you do have to say okay this isn't gonna work of course I mean I keep part of this is bringing everybody together and getting them to signal in the various ways we can the problem is until it goes active you don't know what people really vote is there some threshold at which you would call it off like if it falls below some certain percentage you would say okay we're not gonna do this hard fork I don't know what call it off means for me I mean so what happened here is we put together a package which was segments plus two megabyte which people agree to you know to two months ago and that's what got seg wit turned on and now you know this is the two megabyte part so we put it in a disjoint time activation because we recognize that the two megabyte hard fork portion required more prep time so that's fine now people are that gives people the opportunity to change their mind which is an you know an undesirable consequence from my perspective but it's the right thing to do so I I don't have an answer for you in terms of like what's the what's the magic number at which point it makes no sense but certainly if you don't have minor support then it can't go through so at some point it just it just doesn't work that way and in terms of call it off I mean it's already activated with the folks that have turned it off so they're changing their minds and these are right they're gonna change it they're gonna not going to follow through with the second part of the process then that means they're actually changed their mind kind of midstream and that's always been one possibility for this proposal so well remember at the risk of getting into the weeds too much I wanted to add one more clarification I mean Mike you characterize this as miners changing their mind but remember that mining has become a specialized industry so the people who are signaling for Segway to X and the people who are responsible for the day-to-day operation of selecting the thing to mine on are the pools but the pools very rarely if ever are actually the people who own the hash power many of them own a small fraction but not enough to matter they're not the people who can actually make the decision of what to mine on if they really feel strongly so we saw this with the Bitcoin cash for and I think this is maybe more of the reason why people argue that signaling is less interesting and less because people could change their mind we saw with the Bitcoin as for what happened was it became briefly more profitable to mine and after a day or two or three or five the miners themselves the people who owned the hash rate and are responsible for making a profit on that their investment pressured their pools and said look if you don't activate this you mine on the thing that's more profitable if you don't optimize for the amount of money I'm making I'm gonna go elsewhere with my ASHRAE sorry and one of the major one of the CEOs of one of the major pools out there told me that he had 30 percent of his hash rate threatened to leave if he didn't implement automatic switching based on what's more profitable immediately and so there's there's more nuance than just people can change their mind Oh interesting okay well this then gets us to sort of what might happen after that fork so let's just assume just because we have to pick something that the too much gene has 85% hash power and that 15% of the hash power remains on the original chain what are all the ways that a block chain with only 15 percent of the current hash power can be attacked I think there are many ways but they all cost something right so even if you want to say okay I'm gonna attack this 15 percent hash power chain and I'm gonna make it unusable you have to have SS hash powers you have to take 15% of your half of the hash power globally that you have and attack this chain instead of mining something useful and I assume if your attack works that all this effort all of this money you spent on mining these blocks is useless and that is a ton a ton of money to just throw down the drain to make your voice heard and make a decision here and I if you're looking at 15% and especially if you're looking at 15% of hash rate which is gonna follow price this after a few days or after a week and things might not look the same after a few days it's not clear to me any attacks are usable at kind of the 15 20 30 percent threshold as much as they would be at the one or two percent fresh whole and but what about um like can't you make a lot of money in the short term before the price drops and do you know and I'm saying like well you could make a lot of money just right off the bat and then you know later people might realize like oh there was an attack on the network and then the price would drop but at that point you've already made your profit like if you exchange right well not quite there's a few things which kind of slow you down there first of all people would notice that there's an attack going on immediately when the attack occurs and I assume I know at least several exchanges I assume any changes what they know well a civil attack is very different a civil attack doesn't allow hash power to do anything the civil attack is purely at a non hash power level and and most people would relatively easily not have this issue and so for listeners who don't know what what a simple attack is that's where you are one person but you make up um you make it look like you're a whole bunch of different people but but couldn't you make it look like you're a number of different miners and and into you know I'm saying so you make yourself look like you're in like ten different mines it doesn't matter if you pretend to be 10 different miners or not if theory is a reorg which happens and a large amount of hash power just by the amount of hash power happens and triggers a reorg then you know there's something going on and there's the systems in place some exchanges to just pause deposits and withdrawals of something okay in a reorg is where basically the previous transactions that had been mined in blocks get undone or or just like a re reorganized is that it yeah pretty much and there's one other thing which is kind of important to realize at least from the point of view of exploiting these kinds of attacks all of the mining reward that you would be getting on this chain is not immediately expendable so you can't take a mining it's mined in a blog and immediately in the very next block or in the same blog go into positive at an exchange you have a pretty significant waiting period that's enforced by the Bitcoin network and then on top of that many exchanges require a few extra confirmations and so once you start talking about these kinds of big attacks it becomes very obvious and people can pretty quickly shut down until things are looking more stable and in fact we see the exchanges and pause deposit from the drives okay Oh like on the exchanges but the chain itself would keep going sure the chain would keep going but all of these people who would be subject to these kinds of attacks would simply not be because they're not accepting new payments at the time and we've already seen many if not most if not the vast majority of startups and Bitcoin exchanges announced that they're going to pause deposits and withdrawals right before this hard fork until things have stabilized and are clear irrespective of whether or not there are any obvious attacks and then what about people who manage their own private keys and user controlled wallets does that mean that they also are likely not to lose money in an attack I would recommend that they also follow the guidance that the exchanges and many businesses are giving and not transact during that time it's just easier gonna be safe that way but there are warnings and many clients that would notify them in cases of these attacks some clients don't and this you know wait three days wait seven days wait a month look at what's going on and figure out when things look stable before you start to be very active and accept payments from people you don't trust okay so this is interesting because I just was thinking like Oh a chain with only 15% hash power is gonna be so prone to attacks that it's gonna be very unsafe and unstable to use but you're saying that in a way the economic benefit you could possibly get from that is just like immediately negated because people will realize that there's an attachment so the value of those coins will drop and so that's sort of like kind of undeterred people from doing an attack in the first place that's a huge part of it I mean look at Bitcoin cash the corn cash has the same group work algorithm but is significantly significantly lower hash rate than Bitcoin on most days and hash rate could easily switch over and attack Bitcoin cash and allege raise but a it hasn't and be if it were to the price would probably almost immediately drop to zero and people would stop accepting it because it has been made clearly unusable this is why I love what people call crypto economics although I did see someone on Twitter was like crypto economics is just economics anyway okay so actually let's go back to something that you brought up earlier which is how people are defining Bitcoin I wanted to talk about how some of the exchanges and services are deciding to handle this and how they're naming the chains I did see that coin base topo and Gemini they all stated that they're gonna give the name Bitcoin to the chain with the most accumulated difficulty which as I mentioned earlier seems to follow the Bitcoin white paper which several times mentions that Bitcoin is defined as the longest chain or the longest proof-of-work chain there is a line in the abstract of the white paper that says the longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power although right now I guess that would be a Singh power because you know we don't sorry the the white paper does not define Bitcoin in the context of changes to the consensus rules by hash power it defines Bitcoin in the context of if there are no changes that consensus holds that there are no changes to the rules if there are no hard Forks or specifically they need is defined by the largest hash power in fact that the white paper also goes on to talk about how all clients should be rejecting blocks which are invalid according to the rules of the system but more importantly I don't think that's an interesting debate right this is something that was written however many years ago now and it's like trying to read way too much into something based on a time where we just didn't know anywhere near as much about how Bitcoin operates and how people want it to operate and how people use it than we do today yes so that was the other side that I wanted to bring up which is that because of these chains but tokens we see that a lot of users or or rather yeah that a lot of users going into this believe that the chain that is the real Bitcoin is probably the one that won't be the longest chain so what do you think is the way that the different exchanges and services should handle it so the longest chain is the ones that though the largest amount of hash borrowing behind for supporting some set of rules and that's a unified set of rules so what Mac said is right that you know the overall system is resistant to folks changing you know critical rule sets in some ways and for the most part that's the that's thought about is like selfishly changing things in this case what's happening is if the longest chain gets on the 2x side it means that the bulk of these guys think that actually that is the right consensus rule that they would like to support so um it's still adhering to kind of not kind of exactly the original original definition of what what Bitcoin is I think all of the businesses out there the exchanges payment processors wallets etc in terms of what happens at this fork they've currently got software which has something called Bitcoin and it follows this longest chain that we have today what's happening after this fork is that there's going to be two different chains and these software programs out there need to pick which one is called Bitcoin and which one is not and it's a tricky tricky problem I think this is gonna sort out really quickly it'll initially be based on longest chain but the market value is going to speak and that's going to influence who's the longest chain so at the end it's going to be market value and I'm pretty sure Matt agrees with this is not really much controversy so if if markets say if the market is signaling strongly in favor of the 2x chain and the chain is the longest it's going to just have this magnifying effect multiplying effect I should say where it's going to just take it even more dominantly forward yeah but in this case we're most likely what's gonna happen at the fourth is that the the hash power and the markets are gonna be the exact mirror opposite of each other where one has 85% hash power and the other has 85% value and then what happens well that's if you think that this turn signals are perfectly accurate I mean we just went through how some of these signals change right so you know a couple of months ago we had minor signaling in a particular way and then we talked about like what does it mean why did they change their minds have they changed their minds these are the pools is it something else all of us can can speculate on what that is the futures markets which just came up are pretty thin we talked about that we have different views on it but we'll see but what will happen is at the time of the pork these things will get very concrete and very quickly we're gonna figure out which chain is valued yeah I have to agree with Nick there I mean it depends on how you define very quickly but absolutely I think we'll see over the first few days over the first week there's a pretty good shot over the first few hours but I think that is very likely to change over the first few days we'll see things pretty clearly stabilized we'll see Hatchery try to follow price and then people try to discern which way things are gonna go in the markets as well it'll stabilize in some way so the other wildcard that I want to throw in to all this is Bitcoin cash you've got Jihan whoo the CEO of bit Maine which is the largest Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturing company and he's also the head of the largest mining pool operator ant pool touting Bitcoin cash and right now bit Maine is actually only accepting Bitcoin cash as payment for its latest mining equipment then you've got Roger Vere who he's one of the earliest Bitcoin holders there bitcoiners and also one of the largest holders who owns big and he's saying that Bitcoin cash is closest to the original version of original vision of Bitcoin which is actually true in a technical sense because it doesn't have Segway it which it's not really how Bitcoin launched without segments and it also has eight mega byte blocks which is plenty of room for current transaction volume which of course when Bitcoin first launched there was plenty of room for transaction volume so these two guys are running around saying that this is the true Bitcoin are closest to the true Bitcoin so if the one extreme prevails but continues to have stealing issues do you guys think that Bitcoin cash should be the ultimate winner I want to push back very briefly I mean I think this this highlights maybe the difference of how people interpret you know people try to define certain things about Satoshi a vision for Bitcoin and the early vision for Bitcoin and and people strongly disagree about what those are people who got in at the same time people who spoke with Satoshi all have different agreement all have different opinions about kind of what the early vision was but as to your point I think the the Quinn cache is frankly kind of a side thing at the moment right it's so small in terms of market value in terms of hash rate and in terms of support from businesses from the community from users there is some traction in it but I am skeptical it makes any difference in the Segway 2x context and Mike what do you think so they took a different approach I mean they just created a new coin which is not compatible with any of the software out there today so everybody had to go do a mad dash to change everything and that's not what Segway to X is trying to do seg with 2x you know we some people say it is trying to change things but it really it's not it was designed not to change the transaction format so that's compatible with the vast vast majority of existing systems everywhere from exchanges to to wallets so anyway I consider a Vic Rowen cash just to be something different I would not want to put words in the mouth of Roger or Jihan have you spoken to them Laura I was spoken of Roger and Jehan would not talk to me for this particular article but Roger you know he like I don't know if you've seen those things on Bitcoin calm but they he has like all these charts comparing Bitcoin cash to the coin in its early days and then there's this like little evolutionary tree that they've got going where he tries to show that the coin receptacle in cash is like basically an extension of Bitcoin and that bitcoin would suck would is like a totally different animal and it's very it's very interesting yeah you guys think that will do better is to not not try to answer for for other people obviously the things that he posts are the things that cause I mean he's very interested in that coin I just consider it to be a different coin it's got its own set of properties and it's divorced from Bitcoin so when I want to ask a little bit of a different question now so I was wondering are there any women that have been involved at the center of the block size survey and if so do you think that things would have gone differently if we're had been more women involved yeah I think it would have gone differently though there's a few there's a few folks who have been involved probably maybe that the most obvious is Elizabeth Stark who's the CEO of one of the companies implementing lightning and has their implementation in beta right now intestine and I believe they're looking to do a beta on main net relatively soon and and support people using lightning for instant and small value transactions and and I think yeah there is as I kind of mentioned briefly early on there's so much of the community right now that almost in the sense refuses to try to understand the viewpoints and the kind of where people are coming to these different conclusions based on and try to get to the heart of where people are disagreeing and try to really understand what people's thoughts are and there's a lot of that I think that is ego driven there's a lot of it that is this is a community primarily of upper middle-class white men from similar Western background who all have a pretty strong ego and often that gets in the way of having a good understanding of where other people are coming from and taking their position sometimes at least to be able to sympathize and be able to come to some agreement instead of just arguing past each other all the time well I think the Chinese miners would disagree with being characterized as middle-aged white men but that's I mean there's plenty of studies that have shown that you know women make great managers often better than men you know we have a problem and it's not specific to Bitcoin but I mean the technology field it doesn't have enough enough women so I think that yeah if we had more women on the teams we probably would see more more even-keeled nurse I think some of the aggressive traits of men that are debating can be amplified if it's only men in the room and if we had women as part of the team I think it probably better I wish I could a true or false but that'd be great and then it's so let's do predictions what do you think is gonna happen at the time of the hard fork good Mike you can start with this you guys are like oh man like people are gonna ream me forever if I'm wrong yeah I lost my crystal ball at home sorry yeah I think this I think psychic 2x is gonna go through I think actually there's a lot of folks that have been standing on the sidelines where you come in obviously I've spoken to a lot of folks in the industry the vitriolic language on social media is problematic it makes a lot of people does not want to participate I think that's a long-term thing that the Bitcoin community needs to figure out how to address I think as we get past this some of that will resolve itself kind of like as I refer to with the own previous heated intense debates but I think the economic power is going to come out in a massive way to make to make this happen and I think although there's a lot of activity on Twitter and reddit it actually is a small piece of the ecosystem I know if you go to China and you ask them about Bitcoin and they're not participating on Twitter that much which is mostly a Western thing you know they feel a strong pride about their contribution to Bitcoin and how they feel about it if you go into Europe you see a lot as well so this is a global effort and while Twitter and and reddit seem to indicate one thing I think that actually is kind of the centralized Western view but the global view is going to come out and we're gonna initially start with a lot of hash power behind it so so by default it'll be the longest chain the value is gonna go strongly in favor of seg with 2x that's gonna reinforce the miners and then it's gonna go even farther there will be a long term chain it looks like there's some folks that that want to stay with the one megabyte block and I think they're willing to do that basically forever and then you know for the folks that are pushing for Sega 2x we really just want to help this thing scale better I hope that the noise about like corporate takeover or things like that goes away the process you know if you look at the core process they've been around for nine years and you know they've got a good process I would say I think they could learn a lot actually from IETF I think they're kind of recreating structures and trying to figure out similar things about how to get decentralized voting to really be good and also to have it be open I know that they're open to improving that process so I'm not trying to criticize you know the the Segway to exercise BTC one really I think the best thing would be if everybody just kind of pulled it in figured out how to how to make it happen on Bitcoin core as well and we didn't get sidetracked with these other debates but it's really just a technology proposal it's it's nothing else so and that that's list we can figure out how to scale it for the long term too and yeah I think as you as you mentioned early that I think we will see and as Mike mentioned I think we will see hash power start on the Segway to exchange and we'll see you know 80% or whatever - power start on the Segway to exchange but I think discounting the futures market and the community to that extent doesn't really work right anywhere you look in the community the the most vocal and the vast majority of voices are strongly in opposition to Segway to X and it's true there are a number who aren't but you go look at these meetup groups you look at you know people in person you go ask them like as I mentioned earlier there's what four or five Bitcoin group between meetup groups who have never taken a position on anything you know meetups try to avoid alienating any members and yet they still felt it necessary and possible for them to take a strong position denouncing Segway to X and declaring that it shouldn't be the Bitcoin or it is not the Bitcoin right and you look also with the futures market if there were people who were really gonna come out strongly in favor of segue to X on the markets at the for and I think you know Mike mentioned earlier and I and I agree I think we're gonna see the markets play a very strong role on where things go a week or two weeks after the fork maybe not how hash power votes or how have hash power Minds for the first day or two but the the pressure on pools to mine the thing that is more profitable is going to be immense and these futures market you can make tens or twenty million dollars if you think that things are gonna go the other way but we don't see that we don't see the Chinese community participating on the Chinese exchanges which have futures for this we don't see anyone in the Western community voting strongly in favor with their dollars of Segway to X there are very few people who are staunchly in support of Segway to experimental who are you know okay if it happens that's I will use that or it doesn't also fine but I am highly skeptical there's going to be many people who are willing to put their money where their mouth is as it were and risk all of their capital in Bitcoin by cell Bitcoin for Bitcoin to wax or by selling the legacy token for Bitcoin to acts in order to shift the price enough to really make a difference whereas there clearly who are willing to do that on the other side well we'll see how it plays out this is going to be the most as I truly think it's actually the number one most interesting thing to happen in Bitcoin since its inception but this is all the time we have for today so how can people get in touch with you I'm at V blue mat on Twitter
