novogratz Arthur Hayes and 200 others will hit the stage joining over 10 000 attendees visit token2049.com for 65 off with the code Unchained Link in the description today's topic is ERC 6551 a new token standard for nfts on ethereum and also token bound wallets here to discuss are Benny Yang co-founder and partner of Future Primitive and Jaden Wendell founding developer of Future Primitive welcome Benny and Jaden great to be on the show thanks much for having us it's not every day that people seem super excited about a new token standard but erz6551 has really peaked the interest of a lot of people why is that what does it enable people to do yeah so erc6551 came from you know a question of what if we had a project that was an NFC project that had a character and sometimes we call this a pfp project right but our main question was like why can't you change the clothing or the aesthetic of this pfb character why is it that the shirt you get is the shirt you're gonna have forever you know until the end of time so we kind of asked this question about nine months ago while we were working with Jeff staple on the stapleverse project uh since Jeff Staples been in streetwear for the last 25 years uh he's collaborated with hundreds and thousands of Brands over the last decade or so multi-decade we decided all right let's blend digital fashion with an of cheese with a Twist and so that led us down this rabbit Hall of okay there's a really really hard problem right now in the nft space uh the hard problem is when you want to add state to an nft or you want to have a dynamic nft you want the aesthetic to change uh you start to ask yourself a few questions do you pursue the off chain way where you build a database and you have all this kind of centralization where you could render the nft or you go the on-chain way which is like everything that you put on every every item is an nft and it can be equippable on chain as a transaction so through this kind of Journey as we were feeling in the dark in the last eight or nine months we realized that there was a potential solution and the solution is if we link every single nft with its own account or wallet if it had that then the nft itself can actually own other tokens it could own eth usdc could own erc721 nfts 1155s and so so that was the sapiens project that came out of this it's live now uh it's been live for a little while but you have these characters that you can equip t-shirts and hats and Aesthetics it's all on chain and it's gasless on each magnet yeah and so you referenced a few other of the nft token standards so Jaden why don't you explain how the different standards so erc721 ERC 1155 even soul bound tokens I probably would put in this category so if you could explain the differences between those and six five five one that would be helpful for sure so there have been a number of standards that have come along uh the kind of standardized ways that we own things on ethereum you know we've always had Ethan you can own that in your wallet and then we had erc20 tokens that let us represent fungible money like tokens you can own balances of something and then we had ERC 721 which came along which created non-fungible tokens tokens that are individually unique that can be traded and bought and sold as unique assets that you own and hold in a wallet and Lim 55 kind of mixed those two worlds of fungible and non-fungible and so you have all of these different token standards ways that you can represent ownership on ethereum with soil bound tokens being tokens that you can own but never leave your wallet they're always permanently tied to your wallet we have all these different standards and ways to represent ownership on ethereum but erc6551 isn't really a token standard it's not a new type of token what erc6551 does is it gives every single existing ERC 721 its own wallet so every nft that you already own every nft that's been launched since ERC 721 came into existence and every nft that ever will be launched using the erc721 standard has its own wallet attached it has its own unique smart contract wallet address that means it can own assets like a regular wallet it means it can take actions on chain like a regular wallet by giving every single nft on ethereum on any evm compatible chain a wallet we unlock a whole new layer of compatibility for nfts and I believe that there are also own assets or like I saw somebody tweeted at me about Luxo that does something similar can you describe some of those and talk about how that those differ from this for sure so there have been a couple of uh attempts in the past to standardize nfts owning assets you know erc6551 isn't the first attempt to do this there's been others there was ERC 998 that came shortly after erc721 was launched there have been others since um and there's also things that are not token standards but ways that certain chains are configured so you have chains like flow or some of the move based blockchains where nfts owning other assets is kind of a native Behavior but to focus on the evm world for a second there have been a couple of standards that have tried to give nfts the ability to own things but usually they've fallen into a couple of different pitfalls one of which is they require custom logic in the nft smart contract so every nft on ethereum exists as a smart contract and when you trade nfts what you're doing is you're interacting with that smart contract and most of the standards before ERC 6551 required you as an nft developer or an nft Creator to choose at the time you launch your nft exactly what kind of utility you wanted it to have you have to choose which kinds of assets it can own uh write the custom rules around that and as a result it meant that most nfts don't support that behavior most nfts can't own things and the nfts that can own things can only own a certain small subset of assets a good example is ERC 998 so within ERC 998 you can only hold nfts so prc721s and fungible tokens erc20s you can't own ERC 1155s which are kind of semi-fungible tokens and the reason is ERC 1155 came after ERC 998 was written and so those tokens didn't exist at the time that erc908 was written and that kind of highlights one of the key problems with writing all of this logic into your nft smart contract which is that it's immutable right if you choose to support a certain set of rules around what assets your nfts can and can't own when you launch your nft you can never update that and that means that you'll always be limited in what your nft can own but Wallets on ethereum are not limited every single nft or every single token that's been launched every single token standard that ever will be launched will likely be owned by a wallet or will interact with a wallet in some way and so by giving nfts wallets we break out of the limitations that are inherent to these nft ownership standards we allow nfts to really own any asset chain nfts get the same rights as user on ethereum as you do with your wallet they can own any asset and take any action so Benny mentioned some of the exciting use cases for this like the sapiens and being able to change the outfit of your pfp which obviously makes so much sense it just feels like that should be a thing but what are some of the other applications of this standard that you're most excited about you know I saw some chatter around like messaging or about connecting with AIS Etc so talk us through some of the other exciting options yeah so I'll start with like what is here present day and then we could kind of then float to the their heads in the Clouds of like where we think this is going I mean there really is like four big categories that are forming the first one being gaming or some sort of gamification that's where staple versus sits in other projects that are in this area are fuel world so from few oceans there were manifold which is one of the the co-authors of this 6551 they're working on field world it's a very similar concept to CBC collecting Digital Arts inside of a backpack parallel trading card game they are top 20 nft they're building a AAA web and mobile gaming and they're using this whole idea of like these characters that have their own wallet and can perform actions inside of the game autonomously uh we have folks you know from all sorts of different blockchain gaming on-chain gaming that are using uh 6551 because it makes a lot of sense for like a decentralized game inventory the second category are dowels so we have companies like station dial house and what they're doing is exploring the idea of you know a lot of these communities they need some sort of membership right that could be like a pool Suite or FWB or you know a bunch of refraction dial they all have these membership cards or nfts and the issue with a lot of these dials is that they want to figure out who's the most engaged in this community who did the most amount of work who contributed the most and usually that results into so mobile tokens that are put inside of the same wallet like the metamask badges credentials all these things they're all sit on a single layer right now and the problem is when you sell your membership card nft everything else kind of stays inside of your meta mask while with 6551 with companies like station and Dao stir reimagining like you have a membership card and you have all of this reputation all these tokens inside of the membership and so now this could account for you know you're standing within the community the third category is infrastructure and tooling so manifold is one of the teams that are working a lot of that iyk they are specializing in NFC chips and clothing and so they're building a few modules around 6551 the more notable one was a signature module where you could go you know tap your phone on let's say Jeff Staples hat and then Jeff stable can actually do a digital signature with his finger and that minson nft inside of the Hat nft we have projects like diagnosis Guild Rabbit Hole who are looking into this as well we've been talking to Alchemy airstack as well Zora a lot of infrastructure Marketplace we're also of course the number one question is we are talking to openc and the seaport team uh they are aware of the standard and they do believe that there's a lot of potential with it we could probably get into that later the last category is social so social kind of encompasses a lot of the other things that are not really games so lens protocols there tribes collab land you have cr3 Labs song Camp a story verse so a lot of these projects are exploring the idea of like a decentralized social network or web3 Messengers or token getting within Community Solutions so yeah definitely a lot of things being built in these four categories and this is present day we even have a developer working group that has nearly 750 developers from all of these projects that we mentioned we have a weekly Dev call now if we float above all of this into you know heading to Cloud 10 000 foot where we see this going is it's a natural evolution of nfts so nfts have primarily brought the idea to the market of what if there's a picture that's digital that you can buy sell trade and that's recorded on the blockchain for the last six years that's been really amazing it's kind of started this whole like ecosystem around collecting jpegs and nfts but we think the next layer of this is something we called networked playable characters or NPCs which I'm sure we're all familiar with played games but there's two things that we see number one is a lot of these metaverses that are out there it's a they what they have is an empty world problem uh nobody really hangs out it's like a ghost town in these digital worlds regardless if it's arvr or on the web and so our mission with all of this is to populate these empty digital worlds with NPCs and humans the second second thing that we think is super fascinating is when you have an nft that has its own wallet the next thing you could add to it is something like an AI model or an llm then you could start to program your nft or MPC to perform on-chain actions for you that's kind of a really really amazing future of all of this imagine you can talk to your Doodles and you're like hey do the daily Quest on rabbit hole and imagine for you Laura you go tell your crypto coven to be like hey I want you to collect the coolest music nfts from this week and your cryptocoven goes and and buys the nfts you have to give it a budget but it can kind of perform these actions for you so we really think the NPC is the natural progression of nfts and just to Define so Network playable character like I don't know exactly what that means it just means like that you have this nft that can do these things on chain is that what that means yeah that's a very good question so for us uh how we kind of break it down is Network means like it's connected by a community that could be like azukis are all a part of a community and also buy like a shared Collective state so that could mean the blockchain right ethereum mean that polygon optimism and every single action taken by the NPC should be recorded on a public record of History so The Ledger right so that's what network stands for playable for us stands for you know the unique roster or the different uh playable actions that you could perform so that one chain that could be rapping burning it could be curating it could be purchasing it could be trading selling all of that and that usually results in the playable sense usually results in like a sense of control and like emotional delight and then lastly characters so characters can be fictional non-fictional it could be an anime character it could be a cartoon and usually the character it could be controlled by human like we log in as the nft or we can link it with an AI model and kind of Let it Loose and do its own things so that's what NPC for us stands for and so how did the tokenbound account exactly like do you need a special wallet to initiate these transactions like you said like now any ER seat 721 can do this so can I just open up any wallet like it doesn't matter which wallet or yeah talk about how all this works for sure so the erc6551 proposal is pretty simple a token bound account is its own type of wallet so your nft gets a unique wallet address and that wallet address can own any assets and wait does that mean that then I need like wallets that are built to do this like I can't just whip up a metamask or a coinbase wallet like their specific wallets to do these types of activities yeah so talking about accounts are a specific type of wallet themselves you can use a tokenbound account using your metamask because it's kind of like having multiple wallets inside a single wallet your metamask wallet owns all of these nfts right and so your metamask wallet now also owns or or temporarily controls all of the tokenbound accounts for each of those nfts so it's like having wallets inside of your wallet and you can control those wallets as long as you own the nft by the way so I just want to um break it down like on a technical level because we keep saying wallet but technically every wallet is associated with one ethereum address so what you're saying is that you can have an ethereum address that has an nft inside of it and that nft can have its own nfts inside of it and the nfts inside of that nft can have their own notes inside of them is that okay got it that's right yeah it gets pretty fractal pretty quickly and so it's actually it's it's cool and we've seen some really interesting use cases that folks have come up with utilizing this kind of hierarchical ownership of nfts but yeah what 6551 is every nft gets a unique wallet address and so that wallet is owned by the nft it's a separate smart contract it's separate from the nft it's separate from your metamask wallet you can use any ethereum wallet metamask rainbow nose is safe whatever you want to control that nft's wallet but that nft wallet that tokenbound account will always be owned by the nft so wherever the nft goes ownership of that tokenbound account follows it and so you kind of have tradable wallets in a sense when every nft has a wallet that comes with it that means you can buy and sell and trade wallets along with their contacts on existing nft infrastructure you could buy a whole portfolio of nfts using a single nft transfer on openc and so under the hood all 6551 does is by giving every nft a wallet it gives every nft the ability to hold these assets the ability to take actions and it gives you as the nft owner the ability to hold and manage multiple wallets inside of a single wallet that you own okay and so at the moment like what are the names of the wallets that allow you to you know engage with tokenbound nfts or token by wallets I guess for sure so so they're the wallets exist as smart contracts so anybody can interact with them you can go on etherscan and interact with them uh you can go on the token bound website and interact with them any wallet can show you these token about accounts and let you interact it's not specific to any one world as far as we know tokenbound.org is the only place that has a fully functional tokenbound account client view so you can go and you can see all your nfts you can interact with their wallets but those wallets are smart contracts they're totally separate from whatever wallet application you use so if you use metamask that's a wallet client that lives in your browser but the tokenbot account lives on chain of the smart contract okay I could have sworn five minutes ago or two minutes ago you said that you need a different kind of wallet and you can't just use your your metamask I could have sworn I asked you this and you said that I was correct so tokenbound accounts are their own wallet but they're smart contracts so your metamask wallet is a private key that you hold in your browser or in your mobile app right that's your wallet your wallet lives on on your device it's a private key that you hold it's 12 words that you've written down somewhere that's your wallet okay but there's a different type of wallet it's different from the private key based wallets that you're used to it's called a smart contract and that while it lives on chain as a smart contract it doesn't live on your phone or in your browser it lives on chain and so talk about accounts are smart contract wallets they live on chain and can be interacted with via any any wallet any normal metamask they're called eoa externally owned accounts any wallet that's based on a private key can interact with smart contract accounts so talking about accounts are smart contract accounts they live on chain you can use any wallet you want to interact with them because ultimately it's the wallet that owns the nft that owns that smart contract account if you own an nft in your metamask wallet you can use your metamask wallet to control your tokenbound account for that nft if you hold your nft in a Nosa safe you can use the gnosis safe to interact with the tokenpat account for your NFD so that account that wallet it lives on chain it can be interacted with from any wallet but it is a separate wallet right it has a different address than your metabaster okay it's basically a smart contract that you've set up to function as a wallet yeah so okay okay okay now now I'm understanding the confusion it does exist and we we see it in a lot of people because we're interchangeably even in this conversation using wallet and account and smart contract and I there and you know like there's smart accounts smart contract accounts smart contract wallet um wallets so it's kind of like you know a lot of people are who's on the same way exactly right but for us like the correct term is an account to token bound account or or smart contract account that is like the correct terminology usually when we refer to wallet nowadays because of the history of wallets they usually associate with seabirds and eoa wallets and and like uh private key and all that so it's important that all of these token Mount accounts they don't have public private keys they don't have seen words that now that you have 100 nfts you gotta remember I don't know how many words there are but hundreds of words um you don't have to right they are smart contracts that are linked to nfts all right so you know in the world that we live in where rug pulls happen extremely regularly you know you often see people talking about how they were fished and they were in OG and they never thought they would fall for something like that Etc I gotta ask like how secure is this you know it feels like if you just throw like a bunch of possessions at your nft and are just like I want you to own all the things like I'm not sure like what could happen yeah so at the end of the day wallet security is really important on ethereum right it doesn't matter what kind of assets you own or where they're stored that wallet that owns them the security of that wallet is really really important and if you're holding a bunch of valuable nfts and those nfts have assets inside of them it's kind of the same security model whether you own a thousand nfts in one wallet or a thousand entities spread across 100 joke about accounts that core wallet that owns all of these assets the security of that is really important and a lot of the times you see these hacks happen you see these issues happen because people don't take a lot of care with their wallets right uh people will use eoa wallets people use metamask to hold really valuable assets and then it's just one private key leak away from all of your assets being caught and so if you have an nft in your metamask wallet and your private key gets stolen you'll lose your assets whether it's a tokenbound account within your metamask or whether it's just nfts so wallet security is really important and as always the best practices is usually to use a hot wallet cold wallet setup where you have one wallet you use for daily transactions that doesn't hold a lot of value and then another wallet to Hardware or even better a multi-signature smart contract wallet that has Hardware back signers to hold your valuable assets so wallet security is really important on ethereum talk about accounts don't make that any more or less secure right token bound accounts are as secure as any other smart contract wallet now if you're familiar with things like gnosis or Argent or things like that those are smart contract wallets we've used smart contract bullets for ages they're they're pretty proven model and wallet security is what really matters at the end of the day oh interesting okay because I thought you were going to say something like oh these need to be used more frequently so we understand kind of the surface us at the attack surface area but you're basically saying like since it's really just a wallet that a lot of the ways that these can be attacked or already known is that oh okay so basically you would say that people should feel secure using these like right out of the gate yeah and so obviously as this becomes a more popular model and more applications get built on it that trust is built over time right knows to say if it's really trusted because we've been using it for ages and people have have seen it people understand that security model well tokenbound accounts don't change the security model in any significant way it's still owning assets it's just kind of adding an extra layer of ownership right instead of your wallet owning a single asset your wallet now owns an asset that owns an asset that owns asset so the security model of it is not too different but there are a couple of things that you know security conscious folks should keep in mind uh one of which is you know if you're holding your tokens in a cold wallet but you still want to use those token bound accounts and applications then you're going to need to use some form of Delegation right you're going to need a hot wallet that acts on behalf of your cold wallets and one of the nice things about smart contract walls is that's very easy to do you can have a smart contract that's owned by a hardware wallet or a Nosa safe but has permissions delegated to a hot wallet so you can use your tokenbound account day-to-day without worrying about the nft that owns that account being lost and that ability to delegate permissions either to a hot wallet or to an AI that controls your wallet for you or you know to give temporary permissions is a really powerful feature of smart contract accounts the other things to worry about there are some other things that come up it's not so much related to asset security like losing assets that you control but this model of things being tied to an nft see a wallet being tied to an nft and that wallet holding its own assets does open up the door for certain types of fraud on marketplaces right this has been a problem with any nft that has state for as long as we've had nfts right anytime you have an nft that gives you the right to claim an airdrop you'll see that you know people will claim the airdrop and then try and sell the nft really cheap and somebody buys it thinking they're going to get access to the airdrop and then all of a sudden they buy the nft and they didn't get access to the right they they thought they were getting an asset they didn't get and the reason that happens is because most marketplaces treat nfts like stateless assets like as long as you get the nft in your wallet at the end of the day that's the only thing of value that they really care about but anytime you add something Beyond just the nft itself anytime you add the ability to claim something or add some some change to the artwork or you have like a merging of two nfts into one that's a change of stage and marketplaces have historically had a hard time dealing with that and so the same thing applies to talking about accounts right you can have an nft you could put some really valuable asset inside that nft somebody could come along and place a really high bid on your nft because they think they're getting that really high asset in the token dot account and then before you sell them the nft you take the asset out you sell them just the core nft and then that person is not getting what they expected to on the marketplace and this is just a problem with any nft that has state right talk about accounts really just brings this problem to the mainstream it makes this every nfts problem not just the problem of a couple of nft Collections and marketplaces are going to have to adapt and in fact have already been doing some really good work to support the concept of stateful nfts because if you're building really Innovative nft projects you get into stateful nfts very quickly as soon as you want to do something as soon as you want to add any kind of utility or any kind of extra value you're making your nft stateful so marketplaces are already adapting to this we've been working pretty closely with the C4 teams as they've been building out some tools around this to build some specific things for erc6551 but long term this potential vectors for fraud which there are many in the crypto space this just being one extra will largely be mitigated at the marketplace so talk a little bit more about how the marketplaces have been adapting like what do they need to do in order to be like a kind of a full experience of what it is that you can do with these tokenbound wallets for sure I so at the moment C4 is a really widely used Marketplace protocol and we'll focus on that because they've been really leading the way in a lot of these if you read to the seaport documentation they've already got sections in there talking about stateful nfts and the ways to handle them within the context of Seaport there's a thing called a Zone and what a zone is that's a smart contract that adds some custom validation logic whenever you place an order you can create an order on Seaport and say hey I only want this order to go through if X Y and Z things are true and then C Port will validate that logic when the order goes through and make sure those things that you wanted to be true when you placed the order are still true when the order comes through on the other app that's one of the key mechanisms that Seaport has been working on to allow for stateful nfts you can kind of set a list of rules that you want to be true so in the case of 6551 you can have a zone that says Hey I want these content of the tokenbot account to still be there when I buy the nft I want to make sure that when I buy the nft there's no existing approvals or existing listings on openc that somebody could go through and buy on that nft that I wasn't expecting and so by giving kind of this General framework for being able to set rules on orders it sets the groundwork for being able to build things specifically to protect 6551 accounts to ensure that the contents of the account stay the same that no additional transactions have been made from the tokenbound account when you buy the nft that owns it and so we're working pretty closely with the C4 team on some zones to support that and that will likely end up being a pattern that's adopted pretty widely throughout the marketplace ecosystem we were just at the hackathon in Waterloo recently and one of the teams built erc6551 native Marketplace that had this concept of nfts having accounts right out of the box right so when you buy sell list and trade nfts on the marketplace that they built they would handle all of these all of these security concerns out of the box and I think that's where this will be shifting is as marketplaces deal with nfts that are more complex that have more state that have more things attached to them will get better and better tooling around that and seaport's really been leading the way all right so in a moment we'll talk more about how this all works but first two week word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 000

the description so one other thing that I was wondering about is as you said you know the nfts can have their own nfts is there anything that's more complicated about how you pay gas or what the fees are for when you're doing these types of transactions yeah so the answer is no right because uh if you had an nft that had I don't know 100 nfts in this to the site you sell this nft on open C or you transfer it uh you'd be paying the same gas of transfer of one rather than 100 so it's the same amount that you would you would normally pay if you were transferring an nfts okay well that makes it simple so your company Future Primitive obviously you know is working a lot on this tell us more about Future Primitive how it's using tokenbat accounts and what else it is that your company does yeah so Future Primitive was started about a year and a half ago after I left Dapper I formed feature primitive with Steve Chang who's based in the Bay Area and a partner of Kinder Adventures uh and so me and Steve came together and we kind of came to this conclusion that there's so much more to do in between the web 3 and culture space and combining it together so for the last year and a half we've been working with streetwear Brands uh launching really interesting unique experimental nfts the first events or startup is with the Jeff staple the stapleverse project and that whole idea was re-envisioning what it means to be storytelling on on chain using a 25 year old history staple pigeon brand uh emerging digital fashion and fashion together so that's one of them and then the second one is with Billionaire Boys Club which is another Street where Brad that's been around for 20 years and they formed a new uh web3 team called BB3 and with them we experimented with nft to nft decentralized chat uh we did SMS minting we're currently exploring NFC chips that are in the bracelets that can mint and gamified that experience and so along this pathway of feature primitive and investigating all these different consumer experiences these tooling that we built internally that's kind of what led us to to Primitives so the whole idea of Future Primitive is that we have this triangle right where consumer experiences are at the top that is everything that we do we want to ship things that make people happy smile or feel angry but least feel something and then down below that triangle is tooling and Tech and that could be stuff we use internally stuff that's open sourced and then Primitives is where we have erc6551 token on the count and so the whole idea of it feeds for primitive is basically the spin across this triangle as fast as we can and go through iterations and and launch New Primitives that are pushing the boundaries for the rest of the space all right so I feel like we've covered what erc6551 could mean for users maybe not incredibly extensively but you know by and large that's what we've been talking about a lot but what does it mean for creators what's some new things that you think will appeal to them yeah I think this really opens up the exploration space when building with nfts right previously if you were a Creator and you were creating nfts it was kind of like being limited to 2D artwork versus 3dr right you can launch an nft you can have some cool artwork you can have some utility to it but there there wasn't this kind of broad flexible way that you could add a lot of really interesting things to your nft it was kind of like you launched the nft people will buy sell and trade it you can build a community around it there's kind of some very like a very like fixed list of things you can do with nfts but with tokenbat accounts that list becomes unlimited because really the functionality of wallets is unlimited if you have a wallet you can go and use any doubt out there today you can go and trade coins on uniswap where you you can go and mint nfts that are up and coming or you can go and trade nfts you could like you could do a ton of things with your wallet you can message other wallets and so by giving every NF to your wallet we've given every nft the ability to interact with the whole ethereum ecosystem with any dap out there and that means that every nft has a whole bunch of features a whole bunch of things it can do now that it couldn't do before and creators can use that in really interesting and unique ways you know when nfts can own other nfts you can have you know not just game mechanics on chain but you could have artwork where the nft that's at the top level changes like the artwork changes or the experience of that NFC changes based on what's in its token valid account based on the contents of it you know you can imagine like a nft where you you kind of assemble like a whole Army of sub-nfts and they all show up in interesting ways in the artwork at the top you have these this the building blocks for composable nfts where the nature of an nft is made made up of what it owns and so you have all sorts of interesting ways you can do that for creators also means that creators can build really interesting things that their nfts can do you can have nfts that you send on scavenger hunts on chain or nfts that are competing for a prize anche or nfts that are doing any one of a number of actions and that changes the nature of how you relate to these assets relate to these pieces of art if you're creating something you have not this whole of ethereum at your disposal to create your artwork with to incorporate into the way that your art functions or the way that your art looks and so this opens up a huge incredible play space for creators to build with and that's one of the things that we value really highly at Future Primitive one of the reasons we put erc6551 through the proposal process was because we want to see this for all creators right we're really excited about the things that we get to build on top of the rc6551 but it shouldn't just be something that we at Future Primitive are building on it should be something that everybody in the space can build on and by going through the proposal process we can gather everybody who cares about nfts that have extra features or doing super creative things with nfts that have sub assets that can go and do things and so yeah there's a whole wide play space that opens up and I can't remember we talked about a bunch of different use cases but did you say that it's possible to use these with soul bound nfts too okay yeah totally walk me through some examples of that like what could you do with that combination there are two ways that solvan tokens work with this one is that every soulbound token you've received if it's an ERC 721 has its own wallet too and so you can have a soul bound token that owns other assets it just works the same as any other erc721 would work if you flip that around a little bit you could have an nft that collects Soul bounds tokens so your nft can collect soul-bound tokens to its tokenbound account which means you can never transfer them out of the tokenbot account but you can transfer the nft that collected them and so you can have like you know a bunch of immutable stamps in a passport token bound or sorry uh Soul bounds tokens collected by an nft that can still have value because you can transfer the nft that owns them and so both of those ways there was some work was sold out to us yeah I feel like that will be the way everybody will want to use their stillbound nfts because I remember when I learned about soulbound nfts I was like wait there's got to be many scenarios where somebody would want to move they're still about nft so I feel like now everybody's just gonna send it to an nft that they know they'll never depart with like Laura shin.eth my domain I would just send all my soul-bound nfts there and then would never have to worry about yeah and just for listeners in case you can't tell in it for whatever reason you don't know what they are or missed our episode on them there are tokens that could not be transferred so once you receive yours it's with the address where you have them sent to you for life so and I think it's so interesting because in some ways we're kind of like on Soul bounding like so for example the Louis Vuitton treasure trunk that they recently sold for a really high price so that's a soul-bounded nft to your Ledger or metamask you know it's kind of scary that you have such a high value nft and if you just minted it on your metal mask like you know I hope you never that wallet never gets hacked or you never lose the private key but actually if you minted a nft or you had an nft like a nazuki or Doodles you could have minted the LV treasure chunk into that nft and now it's kind of unsold bounding it because you can move it around right you can sell the pfp character that has the LV treasure trunk right so uh there's definitely a lot of permutations here on where you could you know what should be tied to it and what shouldn't be tied to it there's also another Center that people are talking about erc4337 describe what that is and also how it is that erc6551 can interact with it that's a great question erc4337 is proposing a system for doing what's called a count abstraction and we're all familiar with private key walls right you have your metamask you have your private key and that private key has an ethereum address so as long as you hold that private key you can use the ethereum address but the thing with private key wallets is you can never change that address and you can never change the private key that owns that address they're always tightly linked so if you lose that private key You've Lost That address forever whoever holds that private key can take things out and so because they're tightly coupled it introduces a lot of security risks what account abstraction tries to do is it tries to abstract the two of those things away means that your address is now separate from the key that owns it and what account abstraction what four through seven the proposal for it does is it specifies a way for smart contract accounts to act kind of like private key based accounts too where they can originate their own transactions the smart contract can be Auto deployed so you don't even have to worry about it being a smart contract it comes up with this kind of decentralized system for making smart contract wallets which we've had for a long time right we've had no safe we've had Argent we've had some other ones smart contract accounts are new but what four through seven does is it creates a way where smart contract accounts can function similarly to eoa accounts while still having that feature of be it not being tightly tied to the cider and so there's a lot of people working on erc437 Smart contract accounts now because there's so many cool things you can do that really increase the user experience right you can pay for gas and things other than eth you can have other people pay your gas for you there's lots of just things that smart contract accounts open up that were previously really really hard were impossible to do with private key based accounts and so with this kind of coming wave of smart contract accounts one way you could think about erc6551 is we're giving every single nft an abstract account right we're giving every single nft the same capability of being able to use a Smart contract account in the ways that erc437 allows and so you can use erc4337 within the context of erc6551 these tokenbound accounts can be compatible with erc6551 can take advantage of a lot of the tooling that's being developed around erc4337 and in fact the smart contract account implementation that we've released under tokenbound is compatible with a smart contract level with erc4337 and so by giving every nft an abstract account it means that not only do users get all these benefits with this new type of wallet that you can use nfts get these benefits out of the box as well how do you see the existing nft collections particularly the Blue Chips uh reacting to the existence of 6551 yeah I think a lot of them have looked into it they're really they understand the standard they understand what it could do right if you're a blue chip project the most easiest thing is that now your existing collection which has a really strong Community you know the existing collection of nfts have their own token Mount accounts like for Doodles for zookies for board Apes for Moon Birds paji Penguins so that exists and they're aware right again these are different methods in pursuing uh strategy right um there's an area that we call Value accrual and then there's another strategy that's value dispersion right so value accrual in our using token Mount accounts is that you have a core collection and if you want to add more utility or more value you would add things inside of the existing collection right that helps with a narrative perspective that helps with the lore that helps with like imagine you put like some sort of magical gemstone inside of your nft collection and then now your your character like you know turns into fire or something like that right there's a lot of amazing things you can do when you put things inside of the nft using the tokenban accounts this strategy We Believe will actually you know make the core base of these Blue Chip projects the the owners the collectors a lot more happier and we've proven that this is buildable it's super easy something like sapience is a good example but currently from what we're seeing in the market a lot of the blue chips are pursuing value dispersion right um and we totally get why they're doing it right number one is when you have 10 000 tokens at a certain point you are like man we should have 50 000 tokens or maybe we should have a hundred thousand token the problem is that when you keep releasing tokens there's dilution that's gonna happen uh the people who bought the original collection did not anticipate that there was going to be 500 000 tokens in the span of five years right of course that's not the case but you know being on cryptokey there's been two million kitties and it's been really a big pointed topic of like wow the kitties just keep breeding right so when we go back to the blue chess and they pursue a value dispersion model what they're effectively doing is they're continually air dropping tokens that are in the eoa so they're doing snapshots which you know snapshots now should be totally out-ruled because they they're like outdated and you're still chasing the owner of you have to set a timestamp if you shoot it inside of a blue chip nft like airdrop it's deterministic you already know the 10 000 addresses so you know for sure that all of the the characters all the the core collect action gets it right so when they airdrop what we're seeing is that it's really in favor of the whales of the community the whales of the Blue Chip projects they ultimately receive all these extra air drops that they can flip onto the the secondary right so it starts to disperse the communities to disperse the value it starts to create this really huge tension uh within the project so from our opinion like obviously both of these things can be taken uh however way so it's definitely you know up to the projects to pursue but we do feel strongly that value accrual is the best way for most of the Blue Chip project occurred to me other than security issues is that there are probably risks of kind of just unleashing these token bound accounts especially if they're kind of combined with an AI because then it's like these Bots that you know not only have economic agency but are also kind of tied to different people's identities where do you think things could go wrong um and are you thinking about different kinds of guard rails that could be in place to prevent those and if so what would those be yeah yeah that's a great question and we are organizing NPC day in late September uh to Rally together you know folks from the AI side from nft side from account obstruction to gaming engine slide to really have those conversations of the ethics what could go wrong why is this good why is this amazing and really like start start that dialogue of defining these things the truth of the matter is is that you know if you think about it from an online social network perspective or even on the blockchain there already are Bots or algorithms or scripts that are running right performing Mev on chain and all of these things so this already exists even if we like it or not right we can't get rid of them and so the question is it's like well is it better that these things exist these Bots uh these exist without like some sort of identity or some way to recognize it where they kind of operate under the table and kind of affect uh all sorts of things or whether or not we can bring it to the surface and maybe redefine what NPCs can do maybe NPCs can be for used for goods it could be used for that as well right obviously we we prefer the good side that you could program your nft to to collect really cool things do daily quests but uh we really see NPCs as the combination of like well now there's a visual that represents the bot and also there's a factor of Personality too right when you think about Bots and algorithms they don't really have a personality they just have a single track functionality they execute that and then they don't really have feelings right but several experiments that we've done plugging into AI models like for example we did one at if Waterloo we had a cryptokitty that had all of its genes right that were the metadata we fed that into openai API and actually created a personality for the kitty and so you can imagine these NPCs like as a Twitter account tweeting funny things and memes and jokes while it's minting nfts while it's buying nfts and also performing at tasks or actions right so I think that's going to vary a lot and over the next six to eight months this is going to be a big topic for sure all right well I also wondered how you expected erc6551 to affect the development of the metaverse because it just feels like a relatively undefined space and Benny I think you mentioned a little bit about that before so now that we have this what do you think will happen to this thing that people have been talking about for so long but just feels like it hasn't really gone anywhere yeah I mean metaverse is a big topic I'm I'm highly opinionated maybe this is where it gets hot and the funny thing is is in 2018 snow crash I was doing presentations I think we were talking as well and at that point I was like the metaverse the future and later down the road like I think all the VCS hopped on that and they were like oh metaverse company here metaverse company here that reality started to become like highly capitalized and it started to launch all these companies that were metaverse companies and the problem is that they focused entirely on like game engine and latency and the graphics and and all of this thing right and the way I see metaverses are they are a social consumer app social consumer apps are very difficult you look at something like Clubhouse you look at Blue Sky you know you look at forecasts or all of this like any new social consumer app it's very hard to change existing behaviors and network effects let alone now it's like you have a social consumer app later with all these visuals and game engine and unreal and like latency and all these things and it's like the core problem is not solved and social consumer apps have the empty room problem right that's really commonly known in the startup world metaverses or these metaverses have an empty world problem it's even worse because now you require all these humans to coordinate to meet in a metaverse all at the same time across all time zones and hopefully you'll have a great conversation but that doesn't really happen right so our thinking is that well if we can't coordinate you know all these humans to be in these spaces what else can we do you know in the gaming world since the 80s you have the new Zelda game that came out imagine playing Zelda where there's no creatures and there's no characters to talk to you're just walking aimlessly in this beautiful world but doing what are you doing in this world and so in this same context we need to populate these empty worlds these metaverses these autonomous worlds with NPCs that can talk have personality can perform on chain action that's what gives liveliness of these worlds it makes it alive right so that's kind of where we see you know 6551 or talking about accounts or NPCs filling in that Gap and another way to think about it too is you know when you log in to a metaverse and you go and experience this and you're playing in it you don't want to log in with your social security number right no nobody's like playing these game worlds with their like their driver's license as their their profile photo right people play as a character people join these worlds because they get to experience something new through the lens of a character and they get to play through they play as this kind of embodied identity that's a little bit separate from them that they have a little bit more expression with and nfts are kind of that perfect representation of that second identity where you can play this game as your nft you can embody this space as your nft and what erc6551 does is it gives those characters those uh embodiments of your identity a real on-chain identity that wallet is a real wallet it has all the functionality that your normal wallet does but you're not collecting all these all these things in like your you know your garage you're collecting them and you're not your Nintendo switch the thing you play the game with and when nfts have wallets nfts can play the game too they can either be a character that you interact with in the game that's autonomous it could be a character that you embody but this tying of wallets to nfts lets nfts play the game too all right so um as we've explored we have this new technological development which you know sounds really cool but it's still relatively new and I imagine there are certain limitations that you're already bumping up against that you'd like to overcome so what are some new developments that you're looking forward to working on uh when it comes to erc6551 I think we already talked about security and marketplaces uh the other area is infrastructure right so a lot of the existing infrastructure or indexers or token gated you know solutions they only look one layer deep right whatever you want to go to one of these uh cool nft parties they usually do like a token getting where they check your not a mask or Ledger and they're like deal on the nft so they only go one layer deep but we're gonna need indexers that can really like go all the way you know if you have like 500 nfts that are in all these this token graph that it needs to be able to index all of that display all the information to the user so that is something that we're really pushing the boundaries of and we're currently you know talking to air stack and Alchemy uh and getting that infrastructure set up and it's a lot it's a lot more complex and it's it's something that will enable all of this Jaden you probably have a few more in terms of things that we would like to have for sure I think infrastructure is a big one right anytime there's a new way of interacting with things on chain it takes a little while for the tooling to get up to speed right we've had nfts for a long time but it's only recently that the tools for interacting with nfts and doing token getting and things like that have become really robust even you know a year and a half ago when we started launching nfts under Future Primitive the tooling was much less mature we've come a long way since then we were kind of hand rolling our own tools to do something as simple as give me all the people who own this nft right now that we've got more robust infrastructure it's really it's much easier to build on top of ERC 721 tokens built on top of nfts you know the same thing will happen with the rc655 one right now there's not a lot of tooling around it we're spending a lot of our effort building tooling and open sourcing it and the community is building a lot of tooling around it as well but this will become more and more easy to use for developers and creatives and people who want to build on it in the future another thing we're thinking really deeply about is what does it look like for nft accounts for token bound accounts to live across chains right because as ethereum scales you'll be interacting more and more on these layer twos on things that aren't mainnet ethereum how does this concept of an nft this concept of a token fit into that world as as we scale and you know there's lots of different ways that people kind of think about this problem but we're thinking really deeply around like how can you have an nft that lives on one chain right because nfts kind of have a single native chain available on a single chain that that's their origin how does that nft interact with a game that's on another chain or interact with a application that's on another chain we've got some early experiments that we're building around but I think as the usage vrc6551 walls as more layer to spin up as that's you know the the onboarding to these chains is easier and easier as more and more traffic moves there a volume moves there how do erc6551 accounts fit into that world and uh so we've got we've got some stuff that we're working on there uh the token bounds implementation of token that accounts uh has some stuff built in to handle cross chain things but I think this you know cross-chain world that we're living in is going to change very rapidly like how do you interact across chains as a problem that's not really solved yet we have a lot of solutions that have a lot of trade-offs and a lot of complexity but kind of that end game of living in a cross-chain world hasn't been achieved yet and I think seeing that through the lens of 6551 will be interesting is folks build on it but you're saying that that cross-chain interoperability will only be possible with other evm based chains for 6551 accounts specifically okay yeah for erc6551 it's very evm specific right it doesn't there are other projects that are working on other chains like if you're building on Solana I think there's some projects working on what they call nft Escrow which is a similar idea nfts having accounts if you're building on a blockchain like flow or a move based blockchain they kind of have this concept of nfts owning other tokens as like just part of how the blockchain works it's just a native feature and so this is the era c6551 is evm specific if you're building on an evm compatible chain you can use erc6551 okay yeah I was just wondering about that because I feel like the three chains that I've seen probably the most nft type activities ethereum Solana and Bitcoin and so I was like hmm um but anyway all right well you guys this has been a fascinating discussion where can people learn more about each of you and your work yeah so uh my Twitter is Benny Yang featureprimitive.xyz tokenbound.org I I tweet non-stop so uh I think that's the area to follow me if you want to read some weird tweets about 6551 and all that and if you want to reach me if you're a developer or want to just DM about some of the crazy technical stuff behind erc6551 uh at Jaden underscore Wendell on Twitter we also have a developer working group if you want to get involved so you can track Benny or I down to join that we've got a whole bunch of devs from a lot of different projects all contributing to the spec all building on top of it and it's a really good time there additionally if you are interested in the EIP process as a whole if you want to contribute to that whole process which is a real core thing in ethereum The ethereum Magicians forum is the place to do that if you really want to dive into the nitty-gritty of how does this proposal work how can we push it Forward how can it be improved I would love any comments there perfect well it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained thanks so much Laura for having us really uh it's been a thanks again thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Benny and Jaden and erc6551 check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin with that from Kevin Fuchs Matt pilchard Zach
