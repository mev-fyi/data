according to the block the crypto execs and congress covered topics such as stable coin regulation and issuance the idea of a crypto focus regulator and the overarching theme of consistent crypto regulation across government regimes overall outside of a few straight comments from representative brad sherman the crypto execs were met with apparent curiosity from most members of congress web 3 can empower anyone said representative anthony gonzalez for example the meeting which took nearly five hours seemed to be a success bankman free the ceo of ftx tweeted i came in expecting some hostility and grandstanding but instead found the discussion to be by and large productive and helpful however not all is rosy with regulators coinbase whose ceo brian armstrong has expressed unhappiness with us crypto regulation and who did not attend the hearing is launching a d5 platform that will allow users to earn yields on die deposits customers in 70 countries will have access to yields fluctuating between 2.83 and 5.39 however the us will not be one of those countries as the sec recently threatened to sue the exchange if it were to launch a yield product in related regulatory

different approaches bitmart a centralized exchange lost 196 million dollars worth of various cryptocurrencies on saturday sheldon zia bitmart's ceo tweeted that the security breach was caused by a stolen private key that had two of our hot wallets compromised which led to the loss of 100 million dollars in ethereum assets and 96 million dollars in binance smart chain assets according to zia bitmart will use its own funds to compensate victims to protect against a future breach bitmart replaced all of its deposit addresses for all tokens the aftermath of last week's badger dow hack in which the d5 protocol lost roughly 120 million dollars is a bit more complicated the exploit was a front-end attack that allowed hackers to change user transactions made on the website to steal funds celsius network a centralized lender was one of the addresses affected by the badger dow hack we are working with badger to recover all those funds we are collaborating with them on the investigation ceo alex mashinsky said in a live stream last week confirming celsius's involvement on twitter there is speculation that celsius lost roughly 50 million dollars in the exploit the insurance protocol used by badger dow nexus mutual will most likely not pay out funds to compensate users as its insurance coverage does not cover front-end attacks that being said celsius network's twitter account claims that no celsius client and user assets were affected the account also says the celsius network has traced the attacker and reported that information to badger openc is not ipowing in an interview with bloomberg on monday openc's newly hired cfo brian roberts made a comment about the nft marketplace holding an initial public offering or ipo when you have a company growing as fast as this one you'd be foolish not to think about it going public explained roberts he added i've seen a lot of p l's profit and loss statements but i've never seen a p l like this community backlash on crypto twitter was swift as many had speculated that openc will be the next big airdrop to be released on tuesday the cto set the record straight on twitter writing there was inaccurate reporting about open seas plans there is a big gap between thinking about what an ipo might eventually look like and actively planning one we are not planning an ipo and if we ever did we would look to involve the community roberts previously worked as the cfo for lyft where he led the ride sharing app to a successful ipo a solana bug was patched saving 27 million dollars an hour in the process a bug in the solana program library an integral collection of open source code for solana programmers was patched this week after sitting unnoticed for months according to neodym an auditor the bug could have resulted in 2.6 billion dollars in total value locked being at risk with hundreds of millions in potential profit for hackers in a blog post neodym explained that one of its auditors initially found a seemingly innocuous bug in june however on december 1st neodime noticed the vulnerability was still not patched the team then calculated that the seemingly small exploit which looked like a tiny rounding error could be harvested at a rate of 7 500 a second or 27 million dollars an hour neodime quickly contacted the at-risk solano projects and got the bug patched a task that proved tougher than originally thought due to many solana projects being closed source crypto adoption roundup every day web 3 crypto blockchain technology whatever you want to call it seems to move another step
