of when the article would come out i used round numbers of three thousand dollars for the ether price forty thousand dollars for the bitcoin price and thirty dollars for the ether classic price and now for the article exclusive austrian programmer and ex-crypto ceo likely stole 11 billion dollars of ether who hacked the dow in 2016 diverting 3.6 million ether we identified the apparent hacker he denies it by following a complicated trail of crypto transactions and using a previously undisclosed mixer cracking forensics tool ethereum the second biggest crypto asset is worth three hundred and sixty billion dollars its creator vital booteran has more than three million twitter followers has made videos with ashton kutcher and mila kunis and has met with vladimir putin all the most popular trends in crypto over the last several years launched on ethereum initial coin offerings or icos decentralized finance or d5 non-functional tokens or nfts and decentralized autonomous organizations or dows and it has spawned a whole class of blockchain imitators often called ethereum killers ethereum is also the subject of a great mystery who committed the largest theft of ether ethereum's native token ever by hacking the dao the decentralized venture capital fund had raised 139 million dollars in ether by the time its crowdsale ended in 2016 making it the most successful crowdfunding effort to that date weeks later a hacker siphoned 31 of the eath in the dao 3.64 million total or about five percent of all eth then outstanding out of the main dow and into what became known as the dark dao who hacked the dao my exclusive investigation built on the reporting from my new book the cryptopians idealism greed lies and the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze appears to point to toby honish a 36 year old programmer who grew up in austria and was living in singapore at the time of the hack until now he has been best known for his role as a co-founder and ceo of 10x which raised 80 million dollars in a 2017 initial coin offering to build a crypto debit card an effort that failed the market cap of those tokens which spiked at 535 million dollars now sits at just 11 million dollars after being sent a document detailing the evidence pointing to him as the hacker hoenish wrote in an email your statement and conclusion is factually inaccurate in that email honish offered to provide details refuting our findings but never answered my repeated follow-up messages to him asking for those details to put the enormity of this hack in perspective with eth now trading around three thousand dollars 3.64 million each would be worth 11 billion dollars the dow theft famously and controversially prompted ethereum to do a hard fork where the ethereum network split into two as a way to restore the stolen funds which ultimately left the dark dow holding not eath but far less valuable ether classic or etc the proponents of the fork had hoped etc would die out but it now trades around thirty dollars that means the descendant wallets of the dark dow now hold more than 100 million dollars in etc a high dollar monument to the biggest whodunit in crypto last year as i was working on my book my sources and i utilizing among other things a powerful and previously secret forensics tool from crypto tracing firm chainalysis believed that we figured out who did it indeed the story of the dao and the six-year quest to identify the hacker shows a lot about just how far the crypto world and the technology for tracking transactions have both come since the first cryptocraze today blockchain technology has gone mainstream but as new applications arise one of the first uses of crypto as an anonymity shield is in retreat thanks to both regulatory pressure and to the fact that transactions on public blockchains are traceable since honish won't talk to me i can only speculate about his possible motives back in 2016 he identified technical vulnerabilities in the dao early and may have decided to strike after concluding his warnings weren't being taken seriously enough by the creators of the dao his 10x co-founder julian hosp an austrian medical doctor who now works in blockchain full-time says if hoenish he is a person that is super opinionated always believed he was right always looked at from that perspective this is also a tale of the big brains and big egos that drive the crypto world and of a hacker who may have justified his actions by telling himself he simply did what the faulty code baked into the dao allowed him to do in early 2016 the ethereum network was not even a year old and there was only one app on it that people were interested in the dao a decentralized venture fund built with smart contracts that gave its token holders the right to vote on proposals submitted for funding it had been created by a company named slockit which instead of seeking traditional venture capital had decided to create this dao and then open it up for crowdfunding with the expectation that its own project would be one of those funded by the dow slackett's team thought the dow might attract five million dollars yet when the crowd sale opened on april 30th it took a nine million dollars in just the first two days with participants exchanging one ether for 100 dow tokens as the money poured in some on the team felt queasy but it was too late to cap the sale by the time the funding closed a month later fifteen thousand to twenty thousand individuals had contributed the dow held what was then fifteen percent of all ether and the price of the cryptocurrency was steadily rising at the same time a variety of security and structural concerns were being raised about the dow including one that would ironically later prove to be crucial to limiting the hacker's immediate access to the spoils that problem withdrawing funds was too hard someone wanting to retrieve their money had to first create a child dow or split dow which required not only a high degree of technical knowledge but also waiting periods after each step and the agreement of anyone else who moved funds into that child dow on the morning of june 17th eth reached a new all-time high of 21.52 cents making the crypto and the dow worth 249.6 million dollars when american griff green woke up that morning in mit vida germany he was staying in the family home of two brothers who were slacking co-founders he had a message on his phone from a dow slack community member who says something weird was happening it looked like funds were being drained green sockets first employee and community organizer checked there was indeed a stream of 258 eth or then 5 600 transactions leaving the dow by the time the attack stopped a few hours later 31 percent of the eth and the dow had been siphoned out into the dark dow as awareness of the attack spread ether had its highest trading day ever with its price plummeting 33 from 21 to 14 soon the ethereum community pinpointed the vulnerability that enabled this theft the dao smart contract had been written so that any time someone withdrew money the smart contract would send the money first before updating that person's balance the attacker had used a malicious smart contract that withdrew money 258 eth at a time then interfered with the updating of the contract allowing them to withdraw the same ether again and again it was as if the attacker had 101 dollars in their bank account withdrew one hundred dollars at a bank then kept the bank teller from updating the balance to one dollar and again requested and received another one hundred dollars even worse once the vulnerability became public the remaining 7.3 million each in the dao was at risk of a copycat attack a team of white hat hackers that is hackers acting ethically formed and used the attacker's method to divert the remaining funds into a new child dow but the attackers still had about five percent of all outstanding eth and even the rescued ether was vulnerable given the flaws in the dow plus the clock was ticking down to a july 21st deadline the first date when the original hacker may be able to get at the funds they had diverted into the dark dow if the community wanted to keep the attacker from cashing out they would need to put tokens in the hacker's dark dow and then in any future split dows or child dows the unknown hacker created under the rules of the dao smart contract the attacker couldn't withdraw funds if anyone else in their split dow objected bottom line if the white hats ever missed their window to object the attacker would be able to abscond with the funds meaning this informal group would have to be constantly vigilant eventually after much bickering on reddit on a slack channel over email and on skype calls an ethereum founder booter in publicly weighing in and after it seemed that a majority of the ethereum community supported the measure ethereum decided to hard fork on july 20th the ethereum blockchain was split into two all the eth that had been in the dow was moved to a withdrawal contract which gave the original contributors the right to send in their dow tokens and get back eth on the new blockchain the old blockchain which still attracted some supporters and speculators carried on as ethereum classic on ethereum classic the dao and the dao attackers loot in the form of 3.64 million etc remained that summer the attacker moved their etc a few hops away to a new wallet which remained dormant until late october when they began trying to use an exchange called shapeshift to cash the money out to bitcoin because shapeshift didn't at that time take personally identifying information the attacker's identity was not known even though all their blockchain movements were visible over the next two months the hacker managed to obtain 282 bitcoins then worth 232 thousand dollars now more than 11 million dollars and then perhaps because shapeshift frequently blocked their attempted trades they gave up cashing out leaving behind 3.4 million etherclassic or etc then worth 3.2 million dollars and now worth more than 100 million dollars that might have been the end of the story an unknown hacker sitting on a fortune he couldn't cash out except last july one of my sources involved in the dow rescue a brazilian named alex vandesant aka avsa reached out saying the brazilian police had opened an investigation into the attack on the dao and whether he might be a victim or even the hacker himself vandisand decided to commission a forensics report from blockchain analytics company coinfirm to help exonerate himself though then the police closed the investigation he said in case any similar situations arose in the future he went forward with the report examining those cash-out attempts in 2016. among the early suspects in the hack had been a swiss businessman and his associates and in tracing the funds vandasand and i also found another suspect a russia-based ethereum classic developer but all these people were in europe or russia and the cash-outs mapped onto an asian morning through evening schedule from 9am to midnight tokyo time when the europeans were likely sleeping the timing of their social media posts suggested they kept fairly normal hours but based on a customer support email the hacker had submitted to shapeshift and the lead up to the attack i believed they spoke fluent english jumping off from the coin from analysis blockchain analytics company chainalysis saw the presumed attacker had sent 50 btc to a wasabi wallet a private desktop bitcoin wallet that aims to anonymize transactions by mixing several together in a so-called coin join using a capability that is being disclosed here for the first time chanelysis demixed the wasabi transactions and tracked their output to four exchanges in a final crucial step an employee at one of the exchanges confirmed to one of my sources that the funds were swapped for privacy coin grin and withdrawn to a grin node called grin.toby.ai due to exchange privacy policies normally this sort of customer information would not be disclosed the ip address for that node also hosted bitcoin lightning nodes ln ln.toby.ai lnd.ln.tobi.ai etc and was consistent for over a year it was not a vpn it was hosted on amazon singapore lightning explorer 1ml showed a node at that ip called 10x for anyone who was into crypto in june 2017 this name may bring a bill that month as the ico craze was reaching its initial peak there was an 80 million dollar ico named 10x the ceo and co-founder used the handle at toby ai on angellist beta list github key base linkedin medium pinterest reddit stackoverflow and twitter his name was topee honish where was he based in singapore although he was born and raised in austria honish is fluent in english the cash out transactions occurred mainly from 8 am until 11 pm singapore time and the email address used on that account at the exchange was name of exchange at toby.ai in may 2016 as it was finishing up its historic fundraise honish was intensely interested in the dow on may 12 he emailed hosp a tip profitable crypto trade coming up to short eth once the dow crowdfunding period ended on may 17th and 18th in the dao slack channel he engaged in a long conversation in which he made depending on how you count 52 comments minimum about vulnerabilities in the dao getting into various aspects of the code and nitpicking over exactly what was possible given the way the code was structured one issue spurred him to email slockett's chief technology officer christoph yench its lead technical engineer left harris karapatsus and community manager griff green in his email he said he was writing a proposal for funding from the dow for a crypto card product called dow.pay and added for our due diligence we went through the dow code and found a few things that are worrisome he outlined three possible attack vectors and later emailed with a fourth yench a german who had been working on a phd in physics before dropping out to focus on ethereum responded point by point conceding some of honesh's assertions but saying others were false or don't work the back and forth ended with honish writing i'll keep you in the loop if we find anything else but instead of further email exchanges on may 28th honish wrote four posts on medium beginning with the dao risk free voting the second the dao blackmailing withdrawals foreshadowed the main issue with the dao and why ethereum ultimately chose to hard fork if it did not the only other options were to let the attacker cash out his ill-gotten gains or for some group of dow token holders to follow him forever into new split dows he created as he attempted to cash out tldr if you end up in a dow contract without majority voting power then an attacker can block all withdrawals indefinitely he wrote the third showed how an attacker could do this cheaply his last most telling post for the day the dao a 150 million dollar lesson in decentralized governance said dow.pay decided against making a proposal after uncovering major security flaws and that slockett downplayed the severity of the attack vectors he wrote the dow is live and we are still waiting for sluggett to put out a warning that there is no safe way to withdraw on june 3rd his last medium post announcing block ops blockchain hack challenges said block ops is your playground to break encryption steal bitcoin break smart contracts and simply test your security knowledge although he promised to post new challenges in the field of bitcoin ethereum and web security every two weeks i could find no record that he did so two weeks later came the dow attack the morning after the attack at 7 18 a.m singapore time honest trolled ethereum creator vitalik buterin by retweeting something buterin had said before the doubt was attacked but after it was known that the vulnerability used in the attack was evident in the dao's code in the two-week old tweet buterin had said that he'd been buying dow tokens since the security news over the following weeks honish tweeted anti-hard fork posts like one titled too big to fail is failure guaranteed curiously on july 5th a couple weeks after the attack ponish and carapetsis exchanged reddit dms titled dark dao counter-attack though the substance of the messages is unclear because honish has deleted all his reddit posts haasp recalls that honest told him he had deleted his reddit account after an altercation with an idiot on reddit over the dao honish wrote sorry for not contacting first i got carried away from finding it and telling the community that there is a way to fight back in any case i don't see any way the attacker can use this after cara petsas told honish of the white hat's plan to protect what was left in the dow hoenish replied i took down the post carapaces responded i will keep you up to date with what we do from now on honish's last message in that exchange i'm sorry if i messed up the plan on july 24th the day after the ethereum classic chain revived and began trading on poloniex honish tweeted ethereum drama escalating from dal wars to chain wars ethereum classic now traded on poloniex as etc and miners planning attacks on july 26th he retweeted barry silbert the founder and ceo of the powerful and well-respected digital currency group who had tweeted bought my first non-bitcoin digital currency ethereum classic or etc upon hearing the name toby honish without knowing evidence indicated he was the dow attacker karapetsus a usually good humored greek software developer who was one of the dow creators and had engaged with him by email and on reddit said he was obnoxious he was quite insistent on having found a lot of problems after hearing that the dark dao etc had been cashed out to a grin node with honish's alias karapatsus observed that if honish had instead remedied the situation while the dark dow funds were frozen the ethereum community would have given him huge kudos for finding the weakness and then returning the eath similarly griff green whose current projects lean towards helping non-profit and public causes grow in the digital world believes the hacker missed the chance to be a hero says green he really screwed the pooch reputation is way more valuable than money ironically in a 2016 blog post honish wrote i'm a white hat hacker by heart 20 days later was the dow attack as i noted earlier after being sent a document laying out the evidence that he was the hacker and asking for a comment hoenish wrote that my conclusion is factually inaccurate he said in that email he could give me more details and then did not respond to four requests for those details in addition after receiving my document detailing the facts i'd gathered he deleted almost all his twitter history though i've saved the relevant tweets in may 2015 honish and the co-founders of his crypto debit card venture first known as one bit had some success at a mastercard masters of code hackathon in singapore they started making the card available that year on an invitation-only basis because as honish explained on reddit we don't want to launch a half-assed bitcoin wallet that gets us in trouble for violating kyc or know your customer laws and yes legal is the main reason we can't just ship it in bitcoin magazine article at the time said honish had a background in ai i.t security and cryptography in early 2017 just months after the presumed dow attacker stopped trying to cash out their etc honish's team by then operating as 10x announced it had received 1 million dollars in seed funding from among others fanbooshi capital where ethereum founder buterin was a general partner then came the 80 million dollar ico in early 2018 things started to go south for 10x when its card issuer wavecrest was booted from the visa network meaning that 10x's users could no longer use their debit cards on october 1st 2020 10x announced it was sun setting its services because its new card issuer wirecard sg had been directed by the monetary authority of singapore to cease operations on april 9 2021 10x posted a blog called 10x meet memo it outlined a new business that would offer a euro pegged stablecoin which kept its value pegged to a fiat currency such as us dollars or euros or japanese yen the market cap of 10x tokens which spiked at 535 million dollars now sits at just 11 million dollars 10x has rebranded itself as memo capital and is offering holders of 10x tokens mostly worthless memo tokens instead at a rate of 0.37 mimo for each 10x hosp who was the public face of the company while there was booted by honish and another co-founder in january 2019. this occurred a couple months after some crypto publications reported on hosp's past affiliation with an austrian multi-level marketing scheme however before hearing that evidence indicated honish was the dow attacker hosp said his feeling had been that honish had perhaps pushed him out over jealousy that hosp had sold bitcoin at the top of the bubble in late 2017 netting himself 20 million dollars meanwhile honish had kept all his crypto as the bubble and his personal net worth deflated he came from a very poor family he had no experience in investing and he was in crypto in 2010 but he had literally no money nothing when we were in las vegas together in the summer of 2016. he had nothing and i was doing really well with my investments he would always push for getting more salary for having something nicer hosp also mentioned honish had to send money home to his mother who had raised him as well as to his sister and brother as a single mother upon hearing that hoenish was the likely dow attacker hosp said he was getting goosebumps and began recalling details from his interactions with his former partner that now seemed to take on new significance for example when asked if honish was into grin the privacy coins the hacker had cashed out to hosp said yes yes he was he was fascinated by that i lost money because of those stupid coins i invested in them because of him because he was so fascinated by them he said that honest was also obsessed with building a bitcoin to monero atomic swap or a way to use smart contracts to swap between bitcoin and the privacy coin monero at the time hosp was confused by that because he felt that there was no market for such a product later hosp pulled up chats from august 2016 in which honish seemed excited about the price of etc the coin held by the hacker after the ethereum fork when trying to recall the incident that he believed prompted honish to close his reddit hosp began searching on his computer and muttered to himself he always used tobii ai he confirmed that one of toby's regular email addresses ended in at toby.ai recalled a still astounded hosp for some weird reason he was quite well aware of what was happening he understood more of the dow hack when i asked him what had happened than i had found on the internet or anywhere stay tuned for steven ehrlich editor of forbes crypto asset and blockchain

asking uh asking you the questions for a change yeah it'll it'll be fun for me as well yeah i mean the article itself was was great i mean forbes is very proud to have been able to publish it and i'm sure it's going to make a lot of waves so i'm interested to dive deeper into it with you and and kind of help the audience understand the bigger picture surrounding the dow and and sort of what it's long-term aftermath it will be and is so why don't we just dive right in first and let's level set here especially for some of the some of your audience members that are a bit newer to this entire space i mean at the time can you just paint a picture what was ethereum's level of development what was the price of ether at the time i mean this is well before things like d5 nfts and even icos were a thing so so what was actually happening in the space and like what was sort of the climate that the dow came into existence at this point ethereum was not even a year old the network had launched in the summer of 2015 july 30th 2015 and the dao began to gain some traction and get some interest probably in march of 2016 and then the group creating the dow eventually launched their crowd sale at the end of april 2016. and at the time ethereum was still a pretty you know new blockchain it didn't have a ton of traction however at that point the price had reached double digits and it was still in the low double digits but the dow actually probably boosted the price of ether because after the dow crowd sale began a lot of what we would call normies and crypto non-crypto people became interested and so the price began to climb in the early part of the dao crowd sale and i think in the book i think i said something like by the end of the dow crowd sale the price of ether had gone up somewhere in the ballpark of like 60 since the the start of the dow crowd sale and so this generated a lot of interest one thing that fascinated me was that a number of exchanges enabled people to buy into the dow using fiat so you know this that was not a thing really even in the subsequent icos and i think that capability enabled a lot of as we were saying earlier normies to get in and that basically yeah brought a new people to the ethereum ecosystem yeah it helped them skip that step of having to buy ether and then transitioning into or converting into the dow tokens i mean just just one click everything today is one click so so exchanges like uh and i know kraken for one is one that you mentioned in the book that that made it possible to do that certainly helped make it accessible to to people that had never done any coding in their lives didn't know what a smart contract was etc exactly yeah and christoph yench one of the creators of the dao noticed from the messages that he was getting that a lot of non-crypto people were buying in because they really did not understand the basics even from the way their emails were written or the kinds of questions they were asking he really understood oh wow the level of understanding here is far below that of a typical crypto person yeah i think in your book you mentioned how a lot of people sort of conflated the dow and ethereum together they didn't recognize that they were two separate things and that the dell essentially was a smart contract platform built on top of ethereum and also just the development of the ecosystem i mean was the dow the only application out there at the time i mean were there other dapps running or i mean it was this sort of a a one horse town uh when the dow launched there were other dapps but there just weren't that many uh for in you know there had there were previous crowd sales on ethereum prior to the dow crowd sale for instance digix dao was one i think there are a few others i'm just oh kr agar agar was another but the dao really was the first major one i think some of the others might have been capped which might have helped keep them a bit smaller but certainly this just had a much wider appeal than those others which really were you know more limited to the crypto community so let's introduce the readers to some of the key players here you mentioned one but with the dow came a company called slackit and and a few other key figures that weren't involved necessarily in the launch of ethereum itself so so maybe just um let people know who they need to know to understand the story of the dow so the three main creators well actually that there's there's more but um but we'll limit it mainly to the coders and i'll mention some of the other people working for socket so well i'll actually start with the co-founders of soccer so the co-founders of slackit were christophe yeonshu i mentioned before and he had previously worked at the ethereum foundation he was the lead tester for ethereum during the period when they were building the network which meant that he basically was tasked with trying to figure out how the blockchain might accidentally split into two and thereby create a second chain which is very ironic obviously given what happened um yeah and then um i mean but obviously the purpose of that was to prevent that in the future and then um one of his other co-founders was his brother simon yench who was the ceo of slacket and christoph was the cto and then their third co-founder was someone named stefan twall who also had previously worked for the ethereum foundation and his role had started kind of around community building and communications but then there was a moment when some of the leadership changed and so at that time he became chief communications officer and then people will read in the book but yes he eventually left and so or depending on how you look at it he had to leave and then he ended up at socket and then the other people who were involved in the dow were lyft harris karapetsus who was one of the lead developers at socket and uh interestingly at this time because socket wanted to request funding from the dow and that was how it was going to pay itself rather than attempting to get venture capital funding he was not actually paid um you know a salary at that time he was kind of making just a minimal amount of money and then the last person is griff green who was the community organizer for slackett and the dow yeah i know they all feature prominently throughout this section of the book and some throughout the the entire book uh so a couple things really come to mind i mean i guess first before i get into that maybe just explain what slack it does or or what it intended to do and sort of why it made sense in their minds to build sort of a crowdfunding mechanism on top of ethereum they were trying to build a decentralized sharing economy and their main way of doing that was a device called the slock which was basically like a lock that was smart and so it would unlock with an ethereum transaction at defcon 1 kristoff gave a presentation with the sloc where he used an ethereum transaction to basically turn on a device which creates for a fun scene in the book people will definitely want to read that and so i mean just to kind of help bring this home for um for some newbies that that are going to listen to this is it sort of like a city bike type of application that runs on a blockchain and can be used to unlock like the home or anything that's a great analogy yes okay great and it also it's curious i mean venture capital back then in crypto is not nearly what it is today but it did exist there were some some major companies that that got their seed a b rounds etc from from some of the more prominent firms that are still around today so why do you think they chose to to go this route and and just given how cutthroat it can be to run a startup i mean you hear the stories about people basically these companies run their own lives i mean why do you think they felt it was proven to take time out of building the company to build the dow when there was no guarantee that they were actually going to get funded from it i mean at this time you know there was just a lot of talk and excitement about decentralization and so this would be the decentralized way to get funding this way rather than from a vc which is very centralized and i think you know there was just kind of a lot of idealism and almost a little bit of a naivete too about the promise of the technology or at least its capability at that time you know whether or not it you know remains naive in the long run to believe that these technologies or these smart contracts could do these things remains to be seen but definitely for the development at that time yeah it was more kind of probably an optimistic idealistic hope so one of the things that i found really interesting in your book was how the founders sort of coalesced around a term called illegal which i think is a way for like decentralized autonomous organizations like the dow to sort of exist outside of traditional regulations and and law enforcement jurisdictions could you maybe talk about that term and sort of the importance that it had to to to daos and the dell yeah so this was a term that gavin wood used in a talk and kristoff did tell me that it kind of inspired him like he he talked about this as kind of a moment when he just had you know sort of an epiphany or just it was like a concept that stuck in his mind and the way that gavin described it was that in kind of like a centralized world there's things that are legal and illegal but then when you create something like bitcoin that is decentralized it's kind of running on its own and he was calling it a force of nature meaning you know you you launch the software and then it's just going to go forever right it's similar to how if you launch a smart contract on ethereum that's that's what's going to happen and so he was saying that you know these are forces of nature and they don't care about human laws and jurisdiction and all these things and so that was why he was saying that they are illegal like they're just out of this whole system of what's legal and illegal this is gavin who is pausing this he is a coder not actually anybody with any kind of legal background so you know whether or not this this is a concept that any legal person might agree with or think is valid is a totally separate question but yes this is what gavin was talking about and what inspired kristoff it does seem like a lot of people that have built d5 protocols and and the lake are banking on something similar to uh to this term a illegal and i guess we'll have to see how the sec and other regulators around the world feel about that but but that did strike me and and i'm also i wanted to before we get specifically to the hack there's some interesting debates that kind of went into the construction of of the dow which ended up having significant implications or or ramifications for for unwinding what happened later um one was the decision not to cap the dow which could have limited the damage and and i know that you discussed that at length in the book and then two i think they tried to create sort of um different levels of thresholds for for quorums and and um for quorums necessary to allocate higher amounts of the funds within the dell um i think they needed uh what was it 53 in order to to spend all the money in the dow for for a given proposal and that ended up biting them because when it came time to try to fix some of the issues with the half they couldn't get a quorum necessary to do certain things so um maybe just briefly touch on on those two topics because because i do think that they're important not just for the dow but also for some of the issues or obstacles facing dallas today yeah i mean it's certainly at that time just the level of sophistication that these systems had is nowhere near what it is today and so when the dow was actually launched and the crowd sale was over and then it kind of went into how are we going to use this dow suddenly it became very apparent that all the tools that you would need to do the voting and to have these proposals and have them approved and all that like none of that existed and so then when in the beginning people were realizing hey there are flaws here we should try to fix them then it was like oh well we would have to get people to vote but since not it is since a lot of people who participated are not even crypto people and then we have this minimum quorum that's pretty high you know it was going to be extremely difficult to actually make that happen so yeah it actually seems very similar today where i mean if people buy defy tokens on coinbase or kraken or other exchanges they can't vote on proposals then they're either even today so so back then um it would have been just like unfathomable to have that that capability yeah and then also the the capping of the doubt or the decision not to cap it because i in your book you do detail and i don't want you to give out any spoilers but you talk about there was a discussion um it wasn't just hey let's see how much money we can get there was a reason why they chose not not to cap it and maybe you could just touch on it briefly here yeah i think it depended on who on the team you're talking about there are different people and socket who had different views on why they didn't want to cap it they all had their own reasons but yes the various people who were most in charge of the dow all for different reasons did not want to cap the sale i guess people should read the book to find out but it wasn't just because of greed like there were other reasons beyond um just just that um which i think was was interesting for um for me to read and for other people to find out so let's go to the hack um just in a very brief explain it like i'm five type of overview could you just please explain what happened and and how quickly it happened so on the morning of june 17 2016 suddenly a stream of transactions were taking eth out of the dow and it was 258 per transaction and they were happening very very quickly so this is why you'll hear people often say that the funds were siphoned because it was you know this small amount just over and over and over and over again for hours and the way that this worked was that it would be like if you went to a bank teller and i do use this analogy also in the article and in the book if you went to a bank teller and you had 101 dollars in your bank account and then you went through 100 and then before the bank teller updated your balance you were able to force the bank teller to then give you 100 and because the balance again was not updated to one dollar you would be able to then withdraw 100 again and this was going on and on and on and on and yeah it caused a lot of pandemonium once people realized what happened but then after a while it stopped and by that point 31 of all the ether and the dow had been drained who were some of the key players in the response what was the mindset i mean what were they what were some of their first instincts well first of all they wanted to figure out how is this happening what is going on so they you know all jumped into a group to try to do that but they also were trying to figure out how are we gonna prevent this person from cashing out and there was a very tense scene in the book people will have to read that where definitely not everybody agreed about how to handle that and it definitely caused a lot of tension and yeah certainly certain players really felt that they weren't being listened to i would imagine and there was also you know just frankly talk about potentially needing to do a hard fork and that really came out kind of like probably right in the very beginning i don't want to um again not give out any any secrets in the book but but vitalik is someone that everyone in this community knows and and was a key player during all of this i mean can you just briefly describe kind of what what he was thinking right then so he did mention the hard fork as an option in one of the first calls at least that is what some of uh at least one source from uh recalled i don't remember if there were more than the one person i'm recalling at this moment but you know i think he had an awareness that oh if this has this vulnerability then it might be that that might be the only way to resolve this issue so okay now that it's interesting because there were some competing priorities i mean for one it was like how do we stop this and because of the way um the dell was constructed um and we don't have to get into all the details here it was very hard to to do that to actually be able to to safeguard funds without being sure the hacker could follow them into child dials and continue um doing doing what they were doing there were the ethics of whether or not they what they were doing was legal because technically they were going to do the same type of attack that the attacker did but they were the theoretically the good guys and and even if they they did that which was kind of seen as a white hacker type of proposal um i know they're worried about what the sec and other regulators might think about that and then aside from perhaps stopping the stopping the leak stopping the theft then they have to figure out how to roll theoretically give people their money back and and that's where the hard fork discussion comes in for people that aren't very technical they may not realize that hard forks happen relatively often in ethereum and most of the time they're they're non-contentious i mean hard forks are happening even now as they move from proof of work into proof of stake but this one was seen was and is seen as highly contentious and at a time you described the book as a sort of the nuclear option maybe just really briefly explain what you mean by that and why it was so contentious well in crypto anytime you do a contentious hard fork then it runs the risk of creating a second competing currency because the two blockchains at that point will share a history and everyone who had coins at the time of the hard fork will now own coins in the new blockchain and it's long been thought that of course that sort of you know dilutes the brand of the original blockchain and this is why both bitcoin and ethereum and i'm sure other chains but you know those those are the really popular and established ones have these other forks that have the name in them but yeah there's a lot of concern about you know the impact that that will have on the original blockchain at the time when they were trying to figure out what was going on and what happened what knowledge did they have about the identity of of the hacker at all almost none there was an investigation that was being done by someone at one of the exchanges because a lot of people felt oh if you look at exchange activity you might be able to find somebody who profited from the attack and therefore you know that might indicate what the motive might be and it might indicate what the identity and so there were some leads in that regard that people were following and other than that it was pretty i would say just like mysterious like people didn't really seem to know i had all kinds of weird theories thrown at me when i was reporting this but the only kind of more substantive stuff that i found was one investigator in particular who like i said followed a trade that seemed suspicious why do you think it was important to identify the hacker and why did you work so hard to do so this was the most important event in ethereum's history it was the only moment that i would say was an existential crisis for ethereum ever since then of course there have been different hacks and different events but this was the only one where it really caused a massive crisis for the community and resulted in an event that depending on you know who you are and where you sit you might view it as something that sort of delegitimized ethereum or that yeah it was just a blemish on ethereum's history interestingly i did find some other people people will read about this in the book who actually thought the way it got resolved was a sign of maturity uh so that was kind of fascinating to find just a huge range of perspectives in how people viewed it how long i know you spent um a couple of years researching the book but how long specifically did it take you to do the investigation and pinpoint uh toby as the attacker wow so it's kind of hard to put a number on it i definitely spent a very long time following the one lead from that time which was that one transaction and there were other circumstantial details that kind of pinpointed a number of people actually and i ended up interviewing all of them and i was going to present the results of those queries in the book when very very very late in the editing process one of my sources alex vandessand reached out to me to say that he became the subject of an investigation into the dao in brazil which is where he lives and at that point he wanted to get some information to help exonerate him and actually what's funny is that the investigation into him actually became closed even before he ever did his interview however he still felt well in the future if i ever need this information if i ever need to defend myself this way i should probably just commission this report and so he reached out to me saying i think maybe you could also use this data and it was from a company called coinfirm and basically they discounted him you know for the report and then i would also give them credit in the book and we used that to go over the cash out transactions to kind of try to get any details we could about this person and we could see kind of things like i mean we didn't know exactly what this meant but we could see at least what hours the transactions typically occurred and that was informative because they weren't necessarily the times when the people that i had been looking at were awake and so i mean the one thing is they did match up against the times when the people who worked at shapeshift which was a denver based company which is the exchange that this person was trying to use to cash out those were the hours one shape-shift was not basically you know it was not official working hours so i did think well it could be that someone was specifically trying to target those hours when shapeshift wasn't at work but even then it still kind of seemed you know it that it was just a conjecture but yeah i then sent the information to chainalysis and i did not know that they had this capability but this is what we mentioned in the article where they have the ability to de-mix wasabi transactions which was not something that was known before and so it's quickly for people that don't know could you just uh explain what a wasabi while it is and what it does so wasabi uses a technique called coin join to mix a whole bunch of transactions together sort of like in a washing machine or something you could imagine i mean well actually it's a good analogy because of course this is used uh for laundering money and when the money gets spit out on the other side it's not always easy to follow the trail because it could be you know any one of these other number of people that whose coins got mixed with yours and so that was you know kind of a crucial step and then of course that money then got tracked to four different exchanges and from one of those exchanges the you know those details were what helped us identify toby i know you mentioned this in the article but but what what happened with toby when you kind of presented him with this information so i initially tried to reach out to get an interview multiple times and when i didn't hear back i decided to send all the fact checking for the book with all the details we were going to put in the book and i sent it as a google doc and when i did so i then saw him in the google doc reading it because you know a google doc will show you if there's an icon so and he didn't use one of those anonymizer random animal i mean i don't remember that part but i sent his exact email address the document then yes it was it would have showed that it was him yes because nobody else also had that like it was like just for him i got you you know at that moment i had a lot of adrenaline running through my body but it was also good because then i knew okay at least now i know for sure that he has seen everything even if i don't get a response at least i know that he knows what's coming so that that just felt good like on a process level you know just to make sure that all the eyes were dotted all the tees were crossed and then later he did send that email saying that my statement and conclusion was factually inaccurate or something like that and he offered to send me more details if i wanted them but when i asked for them multiple times he did not respond and i want to ask i'm just going back to to absa and the the coin firm report some people some skeptics may look at that and say well of course someone's going to pay someone to produce a report saying that they're not the hacker when they're being investigated by by a law enforcement agency in another country for this issue obviously you're you're a credentialed reputable journalist so i'm sure you understood a potential motive behind that with essa so how did you take that into account as you were doing your research after had was one of the people trying to rescue the money so i mean i guess it's sort of possible he could have been the hacker but i had no evidence to indicate that he was and when i looked at the report it was definitely just the brazilian federal police even just trying to figure out what ethereum is and what the tao is there was like the wikipedia page for ethereum printed out and people you know there are like handwritten notes they definitely were very confused by the whole thing so it wasn't necessarily that i thought that that was something that cast suspicion on him and also frankly i mean he was telling me about it which would have been another you know i i think if he really was a suspect then he probably wouldn't have gone telling a journalist that he was now the subject of this investigation have you heard from any law enforcement agencies about this i mean do you think regulators etc might read your book and and start trying to find toby and investigate him further and kind of follow the lead that you've set up the news is not out now when we're recording it's not out but by the time this will come out it will be out so that remains to be seen it is it is noteworthy though that the sec did come out with a report several years after the dow hack i think it was in the first month or two when uh jay clayton gary gansler's predecessor at the sec took office and um it was something like an 18-page report that basically said they're not going to prosecute but the dow was definitely the dow token was definitely an unregistered securities offering why do you think they the sacs decided to to issue that paper do you think it hit the mark and how has that impacted the sec's i guess behavior towards crypto in the years since so i think that they did want to make some kind of statement about what by then was a pretty rampant i guess initial coin offering spree that was going on across the world and was getting a lot of u.s investors interested in throwing their money into these initial coin offerings so i think they wanted to sort of put their stake in the ground and make a statement look these are securities offerings and show what their viewpoint was and i think maybe they did it with the dow because since the dow had you know ended i guess you could say since people got their money back and so nobody in a sense was harmed depending on you know how you look at it but from the sec's viewpoint since it wasn't going on anymore and they had the opportunity at least to get their money back then i think they felt that that was a way to get their point across without necessarily having to do an enforcement action right away so the sec's dao report was definitely probably correct in the sense that the dao tokens probably were security simply because they were to invest in a venture fund which is pretty much literally the definition of of security because you in the us have to be an accredited investor in order to act essentially as a venture capitalist which is what the dow really was structured to do and you know in terms of whether or not the dell report was effective um i'm not so sure because obviously after it got published there were still so many icos just raking in tons of money you know billions of dollars worth over the next year year and a half two years and so clearly not everybody got the message or they might have realized well the likelihood that they come after me is probably low something like that and so yeah it was you know there were like small little things i found that that the sec didn't necessarily get correct but i don't know if that really affects anything about the total statement around the report as we're recording this as you're coming out with your book and publishing this article dallas are very much in vogue again i mean forbes just published its latest issue with it with a big feature story on on the growth of of investing dials a lot of it enabled by syndicate which uh you had their co-founders on your show a couple weeks ago so i mean not the dow's ever went away but now that they've really sort of uh sort of captured the zeitgeist of of crypto again how does the legacy of the dow fit into all that well i think for sure a lot of people have learned a lot of mistakes from the dow so for instance i remember one of the first dows to really get some traction after the dao was something called molok dao and molok dao was structured so that if you wanted to remove your funds you could just do it there was no you know there were no waiting periods there was no voting it wasn't this whole kind of like time locked gated system it was just very simple you could as they called it rage quit and i think a lot of dows nowadays also have the benefit of having all the infrastructure needed to have a functional dow in place um you know just even things like doing the simple voting and taking these snapshots that was not possible during that time and you know i imagine it just i don't know if it's necessarily that those were built because of the dow i think people recognized even at the time of the doubt that those were necessary things to have um but yes i i think all of that infrastructure does make these daos probably more likely to succeed but in some ways too i mean maybe a little bit of that like like the ability to dream a little bit could be gone i mean i know for a lot of dallas right now they're capped at 99 investors many of which have to be accredited investors and and some of the magic behind the doubt was that theoretically anybody could participate anonymously or or synonymously and perhaps to make certain dowels a bit more palatable regulatory compliant they've had to make certain concessions on that front so that's just one interesting at least in my opinion one interesting sort of like sidebar to to this whole discussion is there a way to to make these types of um opportunities safe and secure for for ordinary investors yeah is there a middle ground in some ways here i think so i think right now there's definitely a lot of experimentation where people are trying to figure that out these new web 3 investment clubs that synagogue tao has launched probably are going to to go a long way in determining that but i would imagine so you know i don't want to i tried not to like make projections because i just want to be open to whatever actually really does happen in the space but i would be surprised if people didn't figure that out well well laura i'd like to thank you for coming on unchained um thank you for having me yeah but this was a great discussion i really enjoyed reading the book and diving deeper into this really sort of uh critical chapter in ethereum and and crypto history in general so i hope everyone enjoys reading the article listening to this podcast and and reading your book thank you thanks for interviewing me steve it was really a pleasure it was so much fun chatting all right so
