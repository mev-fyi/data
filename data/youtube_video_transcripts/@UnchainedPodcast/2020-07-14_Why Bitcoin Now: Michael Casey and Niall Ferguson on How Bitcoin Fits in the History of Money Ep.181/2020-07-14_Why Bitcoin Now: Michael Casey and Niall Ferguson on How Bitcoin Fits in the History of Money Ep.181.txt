why Bitcoin now which looks at Bitcoin in this macro environment the topic well dive into in today's show is the history of money here to discuss our Niall Ferguson Milbank family senior fellow at the Hoover Institution of at Stanford University and the author of numerous books including the ascent of money a financial history of the world and most recently the squaring the tower networks in power from the Freemasons to Facebook the other guest is Michael Casey chief content officer at coin desk and the author of two books on the co-author of two books on crypto the age of cryptocurrency and the truth machine welcome Neil and Michael alright good to be with you thanks for having us both of your paths to the world of cryptocurrency have been quite different why don't you each describe how it is that you came to both have a background in the history of money and then also get involved in crypto and Neil do you want to start sure well I'm a an historian as you said and I've spent much of my career working on financial history which is really my core competence many years ago too many to count I wrote a doctoral dissertation on the German hyperinflation of 1923 and subsequently wrote histories of a couple of of banking dynasties the Rothschilds and the Warburg's so that was really my path into being an academic historian and and in 2008 I tried to not nip together a lot of my earlier work in a book called the ascent of money which you already mentioned and that book started I guess as a Harvard course in international financial history and by 2006-7 I'd come to the conclusion that it should become a book and that that was going to be in an almighty financial crisis and it would be rather good timing if I could bring it out around about the time of the crisis and sure enough by the time I had finished I also did a TV series called the ascent of money the crisis was well underway though the book came out a few weeks before Lehman Brothers blew up but if you were paying attention it was really not the Lehman bankruptcy that signaled the beginning of the crisis you'd actually seen the beginnings of the crisis in late 2006 so of course the ascent of money came out in the same year as Satoshi's paper on Bitcoin that meant it couldn't be included in the book but of course I was intrigued when I heard about Bitcoin brief anecdotes my then teenage son who's now 21 said to me one day hey Dad I rethink you should get into this Bitcoin thing and I gave a very pompous response along the lines of my dear boy if you had read the ascent of money would know that it is impossible for money to exist without the backing of a state so do not waste my time with this obviously doomed innovation well by twenty six twenty sixteen seventeen he was having a laugh at me and I was admitting that I was wrong and one of those academics who's capable of saying I was wrong so roundabout 2016-17 he and I together began really seriously thinking about crypto and he helped me to really up my my level of knowledge along with one of my former students Manny Rincon Cruz who's become a co-author so over the last three years I've I've really been self educating and I came to the conclusion on the tenth anniversary of the ascent of money that I'd been very very wrong and that this is part of a really extraordinary financial revolution so I updated the book added a chapter on crypto and the new edition is available at all good bookstores so that's my story Wow great we I guess we owe a credit to your son especially name-check Lackey Douglas Ferguson who called it and if he'd only been empowered by his father to do some investment would probably have retired by now so Michael I know well it's not quite similar but I do he'll so you have to thank Neil's son because if you remember Neil I badgered you in fact you called me a first-rate nagger and I eventually caved and wrote a blurb for the age of cryptocurrency and it was a fabulous blurb it was it was if you think I wish I was actually trying to call it up but I don't have my bookie right come what exactly it was we referred to if you think that Satoshi is a type of fish or a Japanese form of sushi and it was it was brilliant and and so I thank you for that now but I imagine that your son you know was was was helpful to me in that regard as for my journey in this area it really comes down to having lived in Argentina so I think somebody wants to describe to explain to me that Michel Foucault who who covers you know he wrote about madness and and how really the study of madness was actually the study of what we call normality and I tend to think about Argentine or a little bit like that when it comes to what money and the functioning of ideas don't get me wrong I absolutely love Argentina and I love Argentines deeply but there is a dysfunction about Argentina that is extremely illustrative about what it is that that kind of makes the intersection between government and money function in places where it is supposed to function the dysfunction illuminates things and so I just became fascinated with this breakdown of the social covenant that was evident in the 10 year cycles that Argentina has every ten years or so the entire system breaks down and it doesn't matter whether it's hyperinflation as they had in the in the 80s or deflation as they had once they tried to peg the currency and control that at the end of the 90s going into the 2000s and there was a massive breakdown then it's part of the same problem and you start to I start to think about trust I had no idea how to frame this but that's what I was I was doing I wrote a book called the unfair trade that sort of drew a little bit on some of that but should have looked more broadly at the financial crisis that was as emerging as after I came back from Argentina I was the bureau chief there from 2003 to 2009 I came back to the US the crisis was in in full swing and that was my beat basically as a the Wall Street Journal and I was writing about currencies and about you know this this incredible moment in in our financial history reading books by Neal and and really digging into these things and then at some point and I said you know it wasn't that earlier the process I wish I could have seen Bitcoin for what it was you know earlier but it was around mid 2013 I think it was the time of the the Crypt it was it was in Crete where was it it was there was a there was a blow-up in Cyprus in Cyprus yeah and the there was a banking crisis there and Bitcoin to suddenly sort and I wonder what the hell this thing was and wrote a pretty ordinary column saying you know this is crazy minting money your computer how on earth would that work and it wasn't I was interested and clearly I knew there was something sort of profound about this concept but I just didn't really get it and then I was taken out for dinner with a bunch of other journalists and by a few people who were really quiet so you know that they came from a normal background it seemed to me one of them is now actually is the owner of the company that owns coin desk Barry Silbert there was also Jeremy a layer there from circle but most interesting to me was was Raj data was there and Raj darte at that time had just completed a role as the interim head of the CFPB the you know Consumer Financial Protection Board that Elizabeth Warren had champion and I was like hang on a second these what's a guy like that hanging out with all these crazy libertarians and then around the the sort of course of the conversation I think it was Barry but somebody just pointed out to me how valuable this concept could be to emerging markets to places that do have don't have where the institutional management of money is a bigger challenge and I just wanted to news that it's not necessarily their fault it's I think I see these problems as systemic and it's a global problem as much as anything else but in these places the capacity to control their money has been a challenge and therefore you know it's this problem for individuals and the Bitcoin and and you know some of the ideas around it could be really valuable and I just thought at that point it clicked and I soared all through the lens of my Argentine experience and and then I was in I that that's when I went down the rabbit hole and started thing I was very interested in property rights I had a lot to do quite a bit to do with Hernando DeSoto met him and written about things with him and I was very interested in this idea that we the records needed to have an environment in which they would not be corruptible by some central party and it just all started to come together went down the rabbit hole wrote wrote the age of cryptocurrency with Paul vineyard entry figured that this was too big a thing to just have as a little sideline dalliance and dived into a stint at MIT the digital currency initiative now Here I am finding my way back into media but yep it was it was very much a developing world framing that made me realize that this was a this was a big deal yeah so you know as I mentioned at the beginning the series that this show is gonna be a part of is looking at Bitcoin in this current macro moment and I think like a lot of the threads that you guys pulled out are things that we will discuss kind of in a moment I actually just want to lay a little bit more groundwork so people kind of understand better how the pandemic might change the environment for cryptocurrency but in order to even understand you know that let's talk a little bit about what led us to the financial system we have today so even just coming all the way back to the basics like what would you say like what is money or historically what has made something money or how have people decided that some things money well I once tried to explain that to Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report and if memory serves what I said was well well Stephen money is just the realisation in some usually tangible form but not necessarily of the relationship between a creditor and a debtor and the first money was clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia thousands of years ago today we can represent the relationship between a debtor and the creditor digitally it's something that appears on a screen but Steven anything can be money you could use an enormous shell or a piece of stone and Colbert replied can I be money and I said yes Steven you you can be money if you want so I think that's the the first building block one has to realize that we've represented over the ages the relationship between a creditor and a debtor in all kinds of different ways and it hasn't always been coined and it certainly hasn't always been banknotes most people still even in 2020 have in their minds eye a banknote a dollar bill when you say money and it's quite hard to persuade people that actually a really small fraction of the dollar US dollar money supply takes the form of banknotes and asks for coins it's a rounding error most money today is in fact created by banks the central bank plays a regulatory role but ultimately it's actually the banking system that generates the bank accounts that that are money in our system and I think the key point I would make is that the system we have today is of relatively recent origin it could really be traced back to around 1971 when Richard Nixon then president ended the link between the dollar and gold you could go all the way back to the late 17th century if you wanted to find the origins of the gold standard of the link between money and gold and even further back if you just wanted to find the link between gold and silver and money but we ended that in the early 1970s with the collapse of the system known as Bretton Woods which had been created at the end of World War two and this asurs in the era of fiat currency an era in which money is essentially what a government determines and to be precise a particular government authority a central bank so the era of fiat money is is actually shorter than my lifetime as I was born in 1964 and I think to understand why cryptocurrency has become the object of so much fascination you have to recognize two things about the era of fiat money the first is that as has already been pointed out by Michael for many countries in argentina's just one of many cases managing a fiat currency has proved extraordinary difficult there are powerful political economy temptations that did base the currency and those existed even when we used coins it's easy to debase the currency if you have a central bank with what we usually refer to as a printing press it isn't that anymore it's just the ability to create money out of the ether that that temptation has led many countries down the path of very high if not hyperinflation and so the obvious argument for something like Bitcoin is that you are creating at least a store of value and maybe not a particularly efficient means of payment but a store of value that you will be able to rely on even if the Argentine government or the Zimbabwean government or the Venezuelan government decides to create a the currency with extremely reckless time and consistent monetary policies the second point to notice which is generally missed by the people I know in the crypto community is that the argument you're solving the problem of inflation works much less well in the developed world because in truth countries like the United States most European countries and Japan ceased to have a problem with inflation some time ago that the inflation spike was in the first decade of fiat money in most of those countries since the beginning of this century the problem has in fact been deflation not inflation and the recurrent headache of central bank's first in Japan and then in the United States in Europe was that they couldn't in fact keep the inflation rate in positive territory that became acutely scary after the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers because it seemed as if the world was going to be plunged into a second Great Depression with debt deflation driving us into a dire tailspin as in the 1930s and the central banks had to work extremely hard to avoid that by using all kinds of unconventional monetary policies of which content of easing is the best known but there were others to zero interest rates forward guidance a whole toolkit of new techniques which have not been inflationary in fact they've underperformed in terms of inflation targets so I think when once thinking about the need for monetary innovation it's really important to recognize that what Michael described in Argentina is a problem for only those parts of the world that we call emerging or developing for the big economies of the northern hemisphere this is not the problem that you're really trying to solve I'd like to keep off that actually because you know and I know that there's a lot of people in the kind of I would call them the metalist hard money kind of crowd that had drawn to Bitcoin who would think that the cut this this news that's not new but modern monetary theory that is is out there is is sort of heretical I'm reading stealth so this is like a confession I'm reading Stephanie Kelton's book at the moment the the deficit myth and I don't know that I buy into in any way the prescriptions that the modern monetary theory folks come up with about just forget about deficits just just spend because you can from a government's perspective but I do think that the way that they frame what money is is very interesting when I and it relates to how I came into to Bitcoin it took me the way I saw the world but cut because I came out of his eyes and Tina experience to recognize what Neil started out talking about which was the the the relationship between debtor and creditor the idea that the real function of money was this ledger keeping roll and that allowed me to understand that Bitcoin could be money that it that it really was it was the blockchain that mattered it was the record-keeping function but I think a lot of people who are George a bit corner obsessed with with the scarcity function which is a key component of it really you have to have some form of monetary policy embedded into the algorithm but I don't think it is fundamentally just scarcity that matters right it's because of the many things that Neil's referring to here is a deflation or inflation what is your problem to me it is about can you trust the governance of the monetary system whatever that system is can we trust that it is being operated in the form that we that we want so I what I do accept from them mmm tea crowd is that I recognize the reason why I'm going to accept a dollar rather than a shell as currency even though as Neil pointed out it could be either one is because this particular form of money comes with this imperative that the government imposes upon us to pay your taxes in it and so the MMT crowd tell us that that's what makes the dollar the dollar is but it's not then that's why taxes matter not because it is a way to actually extract resources to then make payments but rather to impose a compulsion to actually use this particular currency and if you think about it from that perspective then okay so if if you were to create just imagine if you could create a modern monetary theory model which is to say you just don't worry about about the deficit per say you don't have to balance the books as the government because you're an eternal being but you do worry about inflation and if that is the case then the key most important feature of the monetary system is trust in that in that government because now we're handing over to them and that's where I don't think their theory is particularly practical because there is an enormous amount of mistrust in in these entities but it is it does bring us interestingly to questions about the role that blockchain solutions can have here and not necessarily on a sort of a national or even international scale but around communities because it's about the governance of the type of money that my particular community and I can live in multiple communities in a digital era right is is being is being managed and so I see these two pieces coming together that is the the role of the ledger to keep track of our debits and credits the the debtor and creditor relationship that is a fundamental part of money and in fact that the the transfer of notes as I see them is a kind of a physical representation of the ledger if you like and now of course the digital version of that it has to be kept as a ledger but the fact that that ledger cannot be tampered with is a critical point but then it is what what is the actual governance model of the the monetary system underneath that and is it something that cannot be corrupted that is where I think we see this really interesting intersection between the solutions that the Bitcoin blockchain world has come up with and the challenges that both those governments fighting deflation and those fighting inflation in the developing world have had to grapple with which is at its core a fundamental trust challenge between the users and the actual you know the government those who are governing the monetary system themselves yeah and actually so is something that I find really fascinating about this part of the conversation is you know as Neil pointed out Minoo it's pretty obvious in emerging markets kind of what the appeal of bitcoins monetary policy would be and maybe less obvious in developed markets but what's so fascinating to me is that obviously we know that in the Genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain Satoshi put the message The Times 3rd of January 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks so it appeared that in that instance well why don't you see what wasn't what message do you think Satoshi was sending in that moment and you know how does it reflect on your point about what the benefits are to different economies well I think the key issue is is the timing that the Bitcoin was created in a relatively early stage of a massive banking crisis that extended right across the Atlantic and in fact was as a serious if not more serious in the UK and an European Union as it was in the United States now I think one way of coming at this is just to try to get the sequencing right which I don't think the proponents of modern monetary theory do there's something wrong with that whole theory from historians point of view you have to remember that for most of history the state does not play a particularly big role in the economy it's really quite a small thing and the terms of the monetary system in say Renaissance Italy aren't set by governments they're set by merchants there are multiple competing currencies in the early modern world and as the world becomes more globally integrated and it was already remarkably globally integrated as early as the 16th and 17th centuries there are flows cross-border flows on really large scales that determine where money is most readily available and this carries on being true right into the 19th century with the role of the state actually shrinking so that it reaches a really low level in most places in the 19th century whether you're looking at your report or China so the monetary system for that period is essentially a function of the needs of of merchants and and ordinary people and Tom Sargent has written a really interesting book on this the big problem of of small change which is well worth the read then second phase which really doesn't get going until the 18th century is the discovery by governments that they can finance large-scale warfare through the issuance of bonds bonds had a prehistory in the Italian city-states but they don't really take off as as a form of security until the 17th and 18th century and it's in fact Britain that pioneers the idea of a bond market is a major source of financing for government with the advent of a perpetual security nolde known as the console meanwhile equity finance is still it's a relatively early stage of development there had been an experiment with it in the early 18th century principally as a means of again financing government warfare and it had gone rather horribly wrong in the South Sea Mississippi bubbles and and for at least a century after that equity finance is kind of frozen and it doesn't really take off again until the 19th century Railroad era this is the right sequence of events to think about a series of financial innovations only some of which are propelled by the government it's not until the 20th century with the world wars which were on an unprecedented scale that the government really becomes the dominant player in the financial system and it becomes apparent that central banks which had originated is private entities are in fact agencies of government debt management and the system revolves increasingly around the problem of government debt that was the central problem of the period from really 1914 right through until the period of the 1950s managing the huge stocks of debt that people accumulated when they fought wars if you lost the war ask any German it ended in disaster the government didn't just default on its bonds the money in which they were denominated became worthless that happened twice in German history at the end of the two world wars so I think what is missing from much of the modern monetary theory is a recognition that the financial systems evolutionary and the state has not always been the driving force we now arrive at a time the early 21st century when the relationship between the government the central bank and the banking system more broadly becomes highly unstable and that's really the the story of 2008 it's not really fully resolved in Europe to this day the fundamental problem was that the banks of say Italy had on their balance sheets great quantities of Italian government debt if there was uncertainty about Italy's ability to service the debt and be to remain part of the monetary union in whose currency the debt was denominated then the banks themselves were in mortal peril and that's why it proved and still has proved so difficult to solve the problem of the relationship between the sovereign and the banks in southern Europe because they lost their monetary autonomy when they joined the euro when they became part of that monetary union now that problem doesn't exist in the US and let me make one final point because the United States is choose the fiat currency the dollar that most transactions around the world are conducted in because a huge proportion of international trade is in dollars and because the dollar also happens to be the most popular currency in central bank reserves there is almost no visible limit to how many dollars the United States can print or how many bonds it can issue and as long as the demand for those currents that currency and those bonds remains as great as the supply then in fact we exist in a strange and very unusual era in which there is no difference between money and bonds because the interest rate on the bonds is zero or close to zero and that is the strange world we currently inhabit to believe in modern monetary theory I think you have to believe that that world is a permanent state of affairs or if that's not the case then implicitly you are basing future policy on fiscal monetary method in that you will use taxation to avoid inflation now I personally don't regard the present era as likely to continue for very long I'm happy to go into why that is in a minute and therefore I think we need to recognize the MMT is only credible for two reasons a people know virtually no financial history B they take the erroneous views that the present state of affairs of zero or near zero nominal rates will continue for the indefinite future I just jump in if it's okay Laura because I yeah yeah it sounds like universe fun and after that we'll take a commercial and I think that I think that is the core issues this idea of the permanent state of the status if the state itself is always operating this world I think that the notion of a country has this kind of permanent state but how what its governance model is is something that is it's constantly changing and fragmenting and I think Neil's point about the fact that money has always been through this evolutionary state and it's only so recently that government played the central role in it is is is critical I pick up on the your initial question about that's a Oceania's comments in the banks but before I do that I think in it this is I think will lead us into a different conversation about this potential post COBIT era as we're talking about but that there is almost this Evan flow between the power and the centralizing power of the state and how it then wanes over time when the system can't sustain it and I feel like that's what we it may be that we're moving to a fragmented role a fragmented situation and therefore what type of money we have is going to have to kind of basically comply with that which means the state's role in it would be would certainly be diminished and therefore any kind of mmt theory about how this is all going to be managed with this sort of taxation as an inflation to land and everything so spending it just seems it seems impossible because things are getting fragmented but in terms of satoshis commentary in that moment when the release of Bitcoin in 2000 2009 you know it is about the sort of centrality of the banking system to the money as far as I see it none of us contain to say what was going any in his head but you know is the problem fiat money or is the problem the fact that we've we are completely dependent upon this fractional reserve banking system and and that interconnection between those banks and the state the the too-big-to-fail problem that became the defining feature of the crisis to me you know when I was writing about it then I just saw this as the banks holding the citizenry hostage that their their their own kind of they were given this you know moral hazard allowed them to take as much risk as they could and then there would always be a bailout of those banks because if not there would be a systemic breakdown and why did we care about systemic breakdowns why didn't we just let the whole system collapse because our monetary system was dependent upon that so the idea that we could disintermediate the banks and and and create a model that was you know whoever the issue was whether it's the government and algorithm or gold you know the earth whoever the issuer didn't didn't have this powerful gatekeepers in the middle who could essentially dictate the terms that we would now have a sort of a more direct relationship between the users we the citizens and and the issuer of the money that's to me one of the most powerful things that sort of Bitcoin has brought this disintermediation and it's the essence of decentralization right so so that's where I see it I I think in many respects Bitcoin attacks banks it doesn't necessarily attack governments and and that's that's I think what's important meetings on this yeah I don't know if a lot of bitcoiners would agree with well I mean they would agree with maybe both but certainly there's that libertarian sentiment there so in a moment we're gonna actually just continue kind of this line of thinking around maybe the transparency of blockchains and Trust but also a shift to something more decentralized and basically user owned but first a quick word from the sponsors

hear from next sign up and learn more about the virtual series at t quorum comm back to my conversation with Neil Ferguson and Michael Casey so there are actually a couple of different strands from what we were discussing that I want to pull out and one it was just like throughout financial history there have just been so many bubbles you know you have referenced what happened kind of in the very early stock markets obviously we've been talking about the housing bubble and I just wondered so you know as Michael mentioned when you have this ledger it's more transparent like do you think if we were to switch to some kind of future of blockchain based money or financial assets then that will mean like the end of bubbles or where do you think that could lead us in terms of a new financial order well Laura I think the idea of a world without bubbles is only plausible if you replace the human race with some other species isn't susceptible to our many cognitive biases one of the arguments I tried to make and the ascent of money was that this evolutionary financial system ultimately is subject more than anything else to to the human psyche and I'm not talking here just about your greed and fear story it's a more profound point than that ultimately the the price of any financial instrument whether it calls itself money or a bond or or a stock is is a reflection of expectations more than anything else the expectations of the future price level in particular and historically expectations of inflation have in fact fluctuated quite widely right now in the principal developed economies they seem remarkably stable and low but that's an odd state of affairs and quite unusual for most of history there have been big fluctuations in the price level and periods of high inflation which have often taken people by surprise because Wars are not predictable and wars have been historically the principal driver of unexpected moves in the in the price level so history is really a kind of learning process people periodically suffer from amnesia were going through one of those phases now and they forget the time inconsistent policies by governments regularly produce bursts of inflation or even defaults as as Michel rightly said the idea of an infinitely lived state is entirely Rods with historical reality because in fact states come and go and most of the states that currently exists in the world the clear majority didn't exist a hundred years ago just to make one very obvious point Germany which we think of as a sort of pillar of fiscal and monetary stability has been through multiple currencies and to hyperinflation episodes and default episodes the thing is that revolutions happen as well as Wars again we can't predict when they happen they nearly always take people by surprise that were bankers American bankers wandering around Petrograd and Moscow in 1917-18 thinking that probably it was quite a good thing there had been a Russian Revolution they didn't see it coming that Leon Trotsky was to go to default on the entire Tsar as Russian debt one of the biggest defaults in all of history so I think the key here is that expectations are based not on some kind of supercomputer that we carry around in our heads that constantly maximizes utility expectations are based on what we remember of history and we keep on being surprised because of this unexpected in incidents of warfare and revolution now that brings us to the question of whether you can kind of create an instrument that is is somehow immune to these fluctuations and sentiment and the answer is you can't a gold isn't a solution because remember our gold has fluctuated tremendously in in its dollar price over the past century and that you could never be entirely sure the gold would continue to be available to you as a store of value one of the things that Franklin Roosevelt did in the 1930s was to make it illegal for Americans to hold gold as private citizens the idea that Bitcoin can somehow solve a problem that gold couldn't solve that nothing has been able to solve was never to me plausible and the volatility of Bitcoin as as a financial security which is how it sometimes appears - to behave is the proof of that what you're seeing when bitcoins price fluctuates wildly as it's done in the last five years is not variations in the supply of US dollars these are fluctuations in expectations of investors about the future of Bitcoin and as we all know as everybody listening to this podcast knows those those fluctuations have been enormous because there's great uncertainty about the future of Bitcoin it only seems like the other day that an influential economics Nouriel Roubini was calling Bitcoin coin and predicting that it would go to zero it's not that long ago that the Nobel prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman was dismissing Bitcoin in much the same way that he once dismissed the Internet as a kind of nothing burger and so there's all kinds of confusion uncertainty and downright error about the future of this particular instrument that's why we will have another Bitcoin bubble at some point I can guarantee that and during that whole cycle which will be what the fifth I've lost count as the big Bitcoin bubbles there have been they'll be the same debate that we had back in 2017 between the people who say it's going to the moon and the people who say it's  point it's going to zero and both of these views will be wrong over time I think Bitcoin will cease to behave like an option I think it behaves like option on digital gold right now I turn that I owe to my friend Matthew McLennan at first Eagle gradually over time the longer it survives and the more useful it appears to be a Bitcoin will behave less like an option on digital gold and more like digital gold I take the view and I'm probably going to annoy a majority of listeners now that Bitcoin isn't going to become money in the sense of the means of payment i think bitcoin is a peculiar kind of power of digital gold that people will want to hold in their portfolios because it has behaviour different from other asset classes and it's not closely correlated with them and I think the more people who take the view that bitcoin will live that Rubini is wrong the more people will hold it in their portfolios and that's a preference for Bitcoin as an asset with diversification quality will push up its price its price will not go up gradually it will go up in steps and each step will look like a bubble and each time the bubble bursts Nouriel Roubini will say you see you see and yeah Nick tomato of one conformation he's one of the venture capitalists in this space or or no sorry I think it's um Adam Draper another VC in the space he says that bitcoin breathes so it like takes in an X an inhale and there's a bubble and then it exhales and then inhales so Michael there was so much in there you you can feel free to respond but actually one other question I just wanted to throw in was like you know because it just fascinated me that the way Neil was going it's it's it started to sound like he didn't think it was gonna be digital Gold's but I guess ultimately he thinks it actually could take up that mantle and but one other aspect that I wanted a drought is like in relation to my question about the bubbles is also like you know I feel like maybe this is a shift back to like if you think of Bitcoin as a user owned system or any of these blockchain networks as use their own systems then this is maybe a reverse to previous kinds of money that like we're not the kind of government run so I just was sort of curious also to to make me throw that in the mix because we're far into the episode yet we still have so much material to cover okay so yeah as always whenever I talk to Neal I hear from Neal my brain starts going because he's he inspires so many just interesting trains of thought look on the bubbles especially I just think also I love this this idea that it price levels are always a reflection of this kind of I suppose waves of expectations and we go through these cycles where expectations are very bullish and then expectations are very bearish and that sets the price level so I mean it's actually to think where we are in this place where it's purely when we're not seeing a inflation in money but we are certainly I think seeing it relative to what would imagine the undertow underlying return on stocks right now there is has been significant asset inflation certainly since the bottom of the post kovat you know moment if you like in March you know because there is this expectation that somehow this return on assets is going to be higher at least denominated in the money that were that that's being issued against it so but the thing about bubbles that I find also important it is we had Carlota Perez who's a very interesting thinker around innovation cycles and bubbles as a speaker at consensus Neel was also a speaker at consensus back in in May and and she I think takes this did a big step back view of what a bubble is and it's this it's this perspective how about that whereby you unlock innovation by by bringing this sort of this the speculative moment actually then could it gets invested into these moments of kind of I was but technological paradigms and there are different moments when a particular type of technology becomes the driver of this innovation wave and therefore the driver of all the speculation a rabbit so we saw in the dot-com bubble we've certainly seen it in blockchain we've certainly you know and we've seen it in lots of other so bubbles almost necessary evils this idea that you you unlock all of this value you actually create a framework in which the underlying technology can be developed with a cheap currency which is the high level of the of the equity attached to that particular thing so I don't know that that's a bit of a tangent but I think it's just an interesting way to think about things like expectations with regards to to sort of Bitcoin and digital gold I actually just generally agree with what Neil said I've I've never really thought that Bitcoin could be money I'm not a metalist I don't I don't I really don't think that for one just this sort of hardly hard-baked scarcity function okay no but this is going to annoy a lot of a lot of listeners but I don't think it is the most interesting innovation here the most interesting innovation to me is that is the governance of a vape of a ledger system of a monetary system for how we manage debt debits and credits so the the idea that Bitcoin could become a global the global medium of payments strikes me as as very challenging in terms of its limits I very strongly believe that it is you know almost ideal to become a reserve asset for the digital age that it becomes essentially yes digital gold because we are living in a decentralized we have two worlds we have a centralized real world and a decentralized online world and we just have to look at how Twitter and Facebook grapple with who is actually governing this conversation right now to understand that that is the biggest challenge we have is this is this decentralized architecture for our online existence and and bringing order to that just means censorship and control in a way that the internet doesn't want right we is that we as the citizens of the internet do not want censorship in control so what is our money going to be in that system right what is the underlying reserve asset for that system which we then build other other payment vehicles on and I think that bitcoin sits there as as something that as the anchor potentially for that so you know digital gold at least if you go back to gold and it's you know in its in its role as some inspectors at underlying a base layer for money is one aspect to this I also think though that it's just gold is persistent throughout the millennia as as as if if because it is a digital option on gold gold I see is an option on on chaos on the breakdown of of a of whatever other monetary system exists so I see Bitcoin is kind of transferring into that world that it's always there as a backstop to to a breakdown in in the otherwise you know previously functional monetary system why don't we be dressed I use this as a jumping-off way to kind of talk about kind of the current I guess global landscape when it comes to the financial world because I think there's just so many interesting forces at play obviously we're in the situation where the US dollar is the dominant global reserve currency China would like that to not really be the case probably and they're kind of maybe perhaps gaining a first mover advantage with various different types of digital currency whether you're looking at the dcep or even what they're doing with their different payment apps which are becoming used you know even outside of China and some of these emerging economies and then meanwhile you know I do agree with you our digital world is just moving faster than our analog world and so at the same time we've got things like Facebook's well it's not Facebook sleeper but livre which is coming out and will you know be accessible to Facebook's platform which is that you know has a bigger user base in the population of China and yet at the same time then here we are talking about how you know Bitcoin is an option on perhaps chaos erupted in some fashion which it really does feel in these times like it's a distinct possibility and you know I don't know if you have heard but chamalla Hypatia who became a billionaire from working at Facebook and now as chairman of Virgin Galactic and does social capital he basically that's why he believes in Bitcoin it's like pretty much all for that reason so I just wondered how you thought all these factors were gonna play out like what would happen to the US dollar and the various kind of central bank official currency efforts amidst all these other you know movements that we're seeing with other kinds of digital currencies not from governments well it was writing the new version of a cent of money which is two years ago now I tried to give as much space to the the various Chinese innovations as I gave to Bitcoin aetherium and the crypto world because in terms of scale actually the Chinese payment platforms Ali pay and WeChat pay are more important they are gaining market share more rapidly and big and that is very simply because they are very easy ways to pay for things and in fact when it comes to means of payment that China has in fact moved ahead of the United States largely because a great many Chinese citizens were ready to make the leap from conventional means of payments to using their telephones there are smartphones for more and more transactions and this is an enormous T important development because it runs counter to the trend towards decentralization and libertarianism that we've been talking about so far the key defining feature of the payment platforms that have emerged from China is that they are highly centralized and they exploit the fact that you can deploy artificial intelligence on vast databases of transactions and use the insights that you you gain from that to create essentially a financial services platform in a two-sided market that brings together consumers and people offering financial services that's the essence of the ant financial business model Erich Jing who runs ant is one of the most interesting players in the world of this financial revolution because in his mind's eye you're creating an optimal payment platform very appealing to small businesses through emerging markets and as you rightly say Laura the interesting thing about the the alley and and Tencent platforms is the speed with which they're expanding in the rest of the world it's also fascinating to watch those companies invest in variety of different FinTech platforms in South America and in South Asia that this is really the the frontier of the financial revolution and it's a completely different business model from the one implied by Bitcoin and the conversations that that happen in Palo Alto are so different from the conversations in Hangzhou and Shenzhen that they are essentially being conducted in two different financial worlds so the argument I would make here is that it's quite difficult for a Bitcoin or aetherium or any other crypto model to gain global market share against Chinese competition because China is offering a payment solution that six it's just much much easier and much more readily adopted so this in this is important if China is successful it does pose a threat to the dollars dominance because ultimately all of these different platforms do link back to the Chinese financial system and therefore the Chinese currency it's not a convertible currency the remnant B is a deeply unattractive alternative to the dollar which is why it's not about to displace it because the Chinese Daren's have a convertible currency there would be such an outflow of capital from China to the rest of the world that it would destabilize everything but particularly China so the only way that the Chinese can challenge the dollar is just by making their payment platforms super convenient and super attractive and that's what they're doing if the volume of transactions on those payment platforms grows large enough then I think the dollars dominance over a five to ten year time frame will be threatened it particularly troubles me that in Washington whether you are at the federate the Treasury the mindset is so small see conservative they really don't want to do anything new they're very suspicious of Libra then pretty suspicious of Bitcoin when you ask them but what about digital currency they say well we already have that the dollars already digital and so this is I think a sign of a very profound pathology that the United States is no longer at the cutting edge of financial and monetary innovation and so at the end of a sense of money the second edition I say two things number one the u.s. is losing its leadership in terms of financial innovation and that means ultimately will lose its predominance because there's such a close correlation between being the financial innovator and being the dominant power - and I got this right I said the next big crisis will not come from the West it will come from China granted I didn't say it would take the form of a novel coronavirus but spread a highly contagious and dangerous disease but I certainly got right that the next crisis would emanate from China and I'll add one final point in the final analysis what we can't predict as I said before is where the next revolution will happen where the Knicks and when the next war will happen but it will be the dislocations following from the pandemic that determine which money is the dominant money at ten or twenty years from now and which asset is regarded as the safe asset if let me just give you one hypothetical the United States and China went to war over Taiwan in September when the next US sanctions directed against Huawei kick in these are the measures by the Commerce Department that would cut far way off from tsmc semiconductors if there's a war over that which I don't think one can completely rule out and the u.s. does not win it if aircraft carriers are sunk in the Taiwan Strait that will be one of those moments in history than turning points in history which determine a steep depreciation of the dollar but just in the same way that major reverses military verses suffered by the United Kingdom ultimately doomed the pound to lose its dominant status because remember the pound was the international currency for reserves and for transactions really right up until the outbreak of world war two so that's the way we need to think about this the present situation is not a steady-state you are not going to have a dollar dominated world ten or twenty years out and you're not going to have a zero or very low inflation ten or twenty years out because history will happen and history always happens and it happens with the biggest impact when people are most complacent and least expected well so actually I want to ask you now to follow up questions so in that scenario let's say that there is something like this kind of war between US and China and we lose well then what do you think would happen because you already said that you know people would not trust that Remini they wouldn't want to put their money there and yet right now the main alternative is the US dollar but as we were discussing we also have these new digital alternatives that don't require us to place our trust in government but they are so small it seems weird to imagine that they would become dominant out of those so I'm curious to know what you think would happen well I think it's likely that in the scenario I'm describing you'd get quite a steep depreciation of the dollar but that would be probably principally reflected in the appreciation of the euro which is a much more attractive alternate currency to to the room NIMBY or or any other currency that you might want to hold but I think the key thing is that people would want to rebalance their portfolios and reduce their dollar exposure in that scenario because they would reasonably expect there to be inflationary consequences imagine a Biden administration struggling with the aftermath of a strategic debacle or imagine let me give you another scenario that the result of the u.s. election in the early hours of November the fourth is unclear that in fact it looks like a tie they can't call it five or six states result to challenged and we're plunged in two weeks or months of constitutional crisis that's a perfectly possible it didn't happen in 2000 when the result was really close because I'll go conceded without really much of a fight but I think this time around you could end up in an absolutely hideous domestic political crisis in the US and once again I think this would be a very negative signal to investors in the US and outside the US and what would you want to do in that situation and I think the conversation would go roughly like this well there isn't a kind of perfect alternative because you still have to worry about the euros long term stability and you definitely don't want to have a large holding of RMB that you can't exit from when you want to that's when Bitcoin I think will be a very attractive asset to hold and gold to those things will be bound to I think to rally under those under those circumstances so I think what I'm envisaging is a period in which expectations about the future dominance and stability of the United States undergo a step change we radically reassess our expectations of domestic stability and global predominance and when that moment comes there will be a kind of rush to diversify portfolios and it will be quite heterogeneous because there there won't be this obvious alternative when Britain declined and fell there was this obvious alternative called the dollar english-speaking Empire better Hardware bigger domestic market was a no-brainer actually but there is no no-brainer if the u.s. enters a period of domestic and or foreign crisis and that I think is is a pretty upsides scenario for for Bitcoin holders because that will suddenly look like a very very smart thing to own in a world where there isn't any longer a dominant superpower with a rule of law system the dominant superpower is the People's Republic of China which is run by the Chinese Communist Party which doesn't believe in the rule of law in that world you really would want to have in your portfolio more than just 0.2 percent or 0.3 percent in the form of Bitcoin yeah we say one thing before Michael responds we're at one hour and so I just want to make sure can you guys go over a little bit we're still in the middle of this discussion and we'll try to maybe wrap it up right now but Michael do you want to respond and you know just kind of looking you know what we were saying these different macro conditions and where Bitcoin might fit in or how it might fit in yeah and I think you know where Bitcoin fits in I just again tend to agree with Neil what I would like to do is though is paint a different scenario around which the dollar gets challenged as a result of Chinese activity I hopefully it's a more peaceful setting for change it will nonetheless be a massive challenge to us power because of course the dollar is and and its role as this gatekeeping instrument within global finance gives the u.s. enormous power to impose sanctions to basically set the terms by which it wants the international order to function that will get that under a diminished dollar role would go away now how would we get there though in a way that would be less violent I think it comes down to the fact that China is creating programmable money Bitcoin is I would call programmable money other forms of digital bearer instruments are programmable money but the money that is currently being used by we pay and Ali pay is not programmable money there's money that still sits within the banking system at the middle of it so you have banks as intermediaries that are therefore basically almost like a blocker in the capacity to have two computers transact with each other right that the notion of programmability that i can just literally transfer to you a digital and a digital unit of value that then triggers a corresponding response of some sort by the other computer is as dependent upon that digital unit being truly a digital bearer instrument dcep because I feel like that's good okay go ahead I'm going okay BP is really important it's not just that we have the wheat that we pay and Ali pay infrastructure for the payments that's a very important piece of this but now China is going to create a programmable form of the money itself that essentially disintermediate the banks the banks may play some role in terms of the district but the that is not a fractional reserve system ultimately if I'm receiving that dcep I know that it is that's what the unit's going to be called Manette is like a claim on the People's Bank of China just as a dollar as a claim on the fence so I treat it as a bearer instrument now I've got something very powerful it can be it can be used in supply chains to turn on or off pallet movers and so forth and you can start to so I think one of the biggest challenges to the US by the way is that this programmable form of money is going to create phenomenal efficiency in the Chinese economy particularly around things like smart cities and all these other you know innovative industry 4.0 solutions that they're building for the infrastructure of their economy and that will just be literally a competitive challenge to the dominance of the US economy but the thing that I'm really fascinated by is the prospect that other digital bearer instruments let's say there is a digital ruble and now you have these two currencies able to essentially talk to each other there is this programmability function that is now you know if you bring in things like atomic swaps and here we start to dive into the nerdy worlds that have the cosmos as of this world that are created in cosmos by the way is participating in China's blockchain what's it called the DSN via census track the blockchain services network so atomic swaps essentially allow you to lock in and these two these two assets can now be locked in a certain way to create a space in which over time those those smart contracts can distribute at a later date according to whatever the terms are the the outcome of that smart contract so imagine to me the most fundamental role of the reserve currency the dollar other than just to be a place to have a store of value is to sit there as an intermediary in trade so one country is importing them whereas exporting the the time lapse the fifth the 30-day 60-day 90-day whatever period for that payment leads both sides vulnerable to to a change in those exchange rates and so there is a gravitation toward some centrally understood you the dollar as the denomination for those that risky period but if I can create a programmable structure an escrow environment that locks in the value of the import-export contract at the very beginning and then in 30 90 days whatever the terms are the the value is as was set at that time is distributed to me in in the currency of the exporter at that value or it isn't it reverts back because I've locked this through a decentralized structure to me that is a very very powerful way to start chipping away at the dominance of the dollar that yes you still have these concerns about where do I hold my assets and so the capital flows into the dollar exists but the underlying sort of purpose if you like the functionality of the dollar is this intermediate of trade starts to go away so I think there's a there's this this programmable money and the emergence of it this is why when you know Neil was talking about US lawmakers saying we've already got digital dollars you don't have digital dollars they have to be have to have this program will bear a capacity that that makes it that that what's what makes it really powerful and that's why I agree that the u.s. is far behind in terms of this innovation because China is building that functionality now how does Bitcoin fit into this it still gets back to everything we've been talking about it's if China or Russia are now you know creating this kind of programmable space between themselves to engage in global trade I'm still having to trust in either of those environments either as a citizen of one or the other the you know the terms as set by those non rule of law trusting entities Bitcoin still becomes this very important store of value that protects me against that that the risk that money itself gets debated or destroyed or used against me in some way actually maybe then look at maybe I don't know short to medium term but then because no like if we're so you know Neal already said he thought I think he said within 5 or 10 years he didn't think the US would be intolerant but it so in the interim and Neal I had a specific question for you about stable coins because apparently you are pretty skeptical of them but I don't actually see that we would just shift from where we are now to Bitcoin even if all these things were to happen and that's why I do feel like there is gonna be some kind of enemy intermediary step like you know stable coins or perhaps could it be Libra I mean is Libra gonna be that convenient user friendly answer that gets people into this digital currency world gets them used to using it and understanding how to use it and then that ends up being the Gateway and so you know what are what are your thoughts on that well there are two issues that we haven't touched on which are extremely important ultimately a world in which Chinese forms of electronic payment or the central bank digital currency predominate is the world without any privacy it is a world in which all transactions are directly observable by the Communist Party of China and it's a world in which there is no possibility of recourse to a real rule of law courts in the event of dispute between a creditor and a debtor in fact the last real vestiges of rule of law and the Chinese system namely Hong Kong's common law based system suffered enormous fatal blow in the last days with the passage of the new Chinese national security law for Hong Kong which essentially ends the same autonomy of Hong Kong and indeed has an extraterritorial dimension to it and that it will apply to nan-hong Kong residents to visitors from abroad who happen to be in Hong Kong if they should fall foul of the Chinese authorities so we need to be very clear that this is not a world that we want to end up in what what is the alternative well the u.s. alternative currently suffers from a defect which ever form it takes if it takes the form of Libra all ultimately it is as you said Laura not not Facebook's currency but it wasn't exactly dreamt up by anybody else it's a it's a Facebook devised enterprise and part of the problem with Facebook's a business model is that it is also centralized it's not Xi Jinping who would have access to your transactions in that world but Mark Zuckerberg or at least there would be that suspicion no matter what institutional architecture was developed yeah they're saying the subsidiary would keep access to the data and Facebook would have it but pointing ask yourself how credible are Facebook's commitments over a four year time horizon the answer is not very and that's why ultimately it was unfortunate that of all the big tech companies it was Facebook that took this initiative atma shout out to wences kazar is here because it was it at his birthday party before Libre was announced that I gave a talk and at which I said the obvious solution to the the Chinese challenges for one of the big tech companies to come up with a new form of digital payment but please don't let it be Facebook and everybody in the room laugh because they all knew what I didn't know namely that it was going to be Facebook so here's the way I would try to think about this ultimately blockchain does offer us a way in which we could meaningfully decentralize not just payments but all the Associated data and moreover would create an environment in which ideally there would not need to be recourse to locals because the transactions would come with their inbuilt contract the contractual terms it needs to be a decentralized alternative world to the world that China is building or there's no point to it I think it was Peter Thiel who said that in the end AI is his communist or totalitarian and crypto is is libertarian I think that's the key insight here what we're failing to do in the West and I think this is as much a problem for Europe as it is for North America is to build an authentically decentralized architecture that will protect individual privacy and and that will also have some kind of rule of law credibility so I think my sense is that we haven't yet solved this problem and and that Libre will probably turn out not to be the answer because it isn't meaningfully or at least sufficiently credibly decentralized okay interesting I'm actually maybe well I don't know I'm not gonna express an opinion actually so we are well over time but I do want to just maybe wrap it up by bringing it maybe to the near short-term just to say how do you think the recovery from coronavirus will go and how do you think that will affect the development of the crypto space in the near term - like Neola myself Oh doesn't matter okay so I think one of things that's most compelling about the coronavirus situation you know is is how it has really it is global right so there is this every single country is is suffering in some way from this every single country is not immune from the either health or economic fallout from this and and therefore in terms of how there is a response to this it requires some sort of global coordination but we do not have any system for doing so so there is the solutions are only decentralized they are only working at local levels and that is a critical component of this how do we actually coordinate that in a in a global way because of the need for that is this sort of the core tension I see in terms of that that aspect of it now how does money come into this again because the dollar is the is the reserve asset it is also a medium of exchange in countless developing countries and where there is a great fear that the shutdown of the global economy is going to expose the massive amounts of debt that is sitting on you know the books of banks and others in Europe and elsewhere and and so much of it in dollars then you have this sort of crisis around the demand for dollars right so one of the reasons why the dollar you know is is far from being knocked off its perch right now is because everybody wants it to it's a command call if you like on on the risk that I would I would face as it as a debtor I need dollars to pay back my debts and so there's a huge demand for dollars and the Fed is obviously trying to meet that with an incredible amount of unprecedented quantitative easing but what does this mean for say Nigeria or or Zimbabwe or so many places around the world in which the dollar is there now means of payment and you're seeing it like never before if you look at paxville right which is this peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange if you look at local bitcoins which is long functioned as a means of people to actually exchange Bitcoin you're seeing rises in demand for Bitcoin across the developing world because the the instrument that they were using the dollar is globally in a shortage despite all the feds efforts it's plenty but sloshing around US financial markets but there's not much of it sitting in the hands of merchants in places like Nigeria Nigeria has always been dollarized because of the other its oil trade so so you're seeing this kind of meltdown in the in the economic fortunes of the world that's exposing a debt problem which is creating a demand for dollars which is creating therefore all of these dysfunctional problems for those who've relied on it to actually run their economies and crypto suddenly works its way in there as a as an interesting alternative take a look at what's happening in Zimbabwe right now where the Zimbabwean government has just banned digital payments so you know which was covering 85% of all transit in Zimbabwe and you are definitely seeing an increase in demand for crypto as a result of that so I see it as as this you know shock if you like to to this this global system and and therefore all of these kind of localized solutions starting to emerge because of that global shock I know we're nearly out of time Norris I'll be very brief and in just adding a couple of points a pandemics at least two-year affairs and we we have had I think the delusion that there was just one curve that we had to flatten in practice there nearly always several waves when a new pathogen spreads around the world we've seen that in multiple cases through history so this ain't over and even if there's a big breakthrough in vaccines by the way I hope you're enjoying the vaccine bubble that we've been witnessing even if there's a breakthrough there isn't going to be a generally available vaccine until well into next year that means that governments are playing various games of whack-a-mole there are two variants you can play with a blindfold or without without means you do testing and contact tracing you exploit the data that you can garner from from apps and smartphones as they do in Taiwan if you decide not to do that and the United States has decided not to do that I think for rather spurious reasons then you play whack-a-mole with the blindfold on there's going to be a good deal of disruption as we as we play this blindfold whack-a-mole the economies of the United States and its peers are actually recovering faster than people expected but that's partly because we decided to have a second wave this summer and it's not clear to me how far yet that's going to derail recovery but somewhat in this context I think it's important to notice that the dollars preeminence was successfully reasserted by the Federal Reserve from the very earliest phase in in March and the Fed did not only as you've mentioned a massive balance sheet expansion Michael more importantly I think it used its international swap lines and a new repo facility available to nearly all central banks to satisfy the demand for dollars in that dollar squeeze that we saw back in in March if you look at say m3 growth rates the dollar is is growing in its supply at an extraordinarily rapid rate far faster than any other major currency and that's why ultimately one can see trouble ahead but right now in the first phase the first quarter of the pandemic you'd have to give it to Jay Powell and the Fed they successfully played the part of of the world's central bank but you're right Michael that what you see happening in unstable countries Argentina was where this conversation began maybe it's appropriate to end there is is one of the places were demand for Bitcoin has let upwards because in countries especially in South America where citizens have reason to be fearful not only if the competence of the public health system but fearful of the banking system fearful of the domestic currency they there's no doubt that our Gen Tina's headed for another period of crisis it was already in default negotiations before the pandemic struck my involvement with voilá one of the Neo banks in South America has given me an insight to this and we can see the demand for Bitcoin we can see the way it's jumped up during this this lockdown period so I'll conclude by saying that as we're at a relatively early stage of the pandemic and this is going to be with us into 2021 with considerable divergence in economic performance I think the onus is on the alternatives to the US dollar to show what they've got and it will be I think an enormous ly important time for every innovator in financial technology we'd be given a great chance show that near banks worked better than traditional banks the lockdowns forced people away from traditional branch banking and forced them to adopt the new technology so that's phase one I think phase two will be how well the Chinese experiments go and how far the Chinese platforms are able to gain market share in rest of world and then finally I think let's see what happens was Libre 2.0 it's been radically modeled and in some ways reduced in its in its scope and the new variants the opportunity is there for financial innovation to accelerate in this time of crisis as I said in the ascent of money it's an evolutionary system we see periods of great divergence of variants of speciation new entities come along and we see great dying's of older institutions and I am NOT capable of predicting who the winners and losers will be in this grade even lucien ree period of disruption but that's why it's a financial revolution we're in it now and i think there are huge possibilities enormous opportunities for financial and monetary innovators precisely because the world has been plunged into this crisis korea this has been such a fascinating conversation and i just feel like we could go on forever because there really is just so much change happening right now and so much to discuss and I think the only last point I'll make is I think in that way that I framed that question earlier about Libra you know I was thinking of a comparison to the internet like AOL where at that time you did need something to get people used to the Internet but frankly I guess now like people already think of money digitally anyway and so if on the back end its blockchain base like I mean granted that there are certain things they want to learn about security and behaviors around that but still I do think you're right that the this stepping stone for it isn't as great and so in that regard perhaps we could see people going directly to cryptocurrencies as you say is happening in some of these emerging markets so who knows what will happen maybe we'll have to regroup in a year or two and see what panned out okay so in the meantime where can people learn more about each of you and your work well I have a website Niels Ferguson comm spelled ni a Double L I'm not the epidemiologists from King Ephram Imperial College London by the way and you can find on your Ferguson comm all my journalism interviews there's a YouTube channel if you've if you haven't already had enough of me personally my preference is not for you to read my tweets or you in my journalism but to read my books and my books are available in all good bookstores as well as inevitably on Amazon right and you can I have a website as well Michael JK C comma though it's a little out of date it needs an updating obviously coin desk is the place to find like much of what I do money reimagined is the weekly newsletter I'm putting out that it's directly with a lot of these themes and and you can find that at coin desk comm do subscribe to that newsletter because it arrives in your email but inbox every Friday in fact it's just about to hit right now I can't say that it it is that money reimagined you can find details there there's there's also you know various other aspects of what coin dusters and corn desk comm
