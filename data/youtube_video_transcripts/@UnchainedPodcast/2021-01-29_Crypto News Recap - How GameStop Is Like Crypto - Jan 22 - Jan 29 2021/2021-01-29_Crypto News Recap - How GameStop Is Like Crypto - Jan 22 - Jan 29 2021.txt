[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline as revealed in mid-december coinbase will go public later this year on thursday the crypto exchange stated it intended to do so via a direct listing rather than an ipo in a direct listing instead of new shares being created and sold to the public only existing outstanding shares will be sold this is not only a less expensive process but also enables coinbase to avoid certain restrictions that must be followed with an ipo such as lock-up periods that keep insiders from selling their shares next headline more institutional investors pile it into bitcoin bill miller of miller value partners and the former chairman of leg mason wrote for miller value partner's q4 2020 letter that it had purchased shares of microstrategy's 0.75 convertible bond after a detailed analysis of why it believes in bitcoin's promise as well as a rebuttal of common criticisms of the cryptocurrency he writes that the microstrategy bond offered quote very little downside and an almost free call option on bitcoin meanwhile coindesk reports that the harvard yale brown and university of michigan endowments have been buying bitcoin directly on coinbase and other exchanges a fact that was alluded to in coinbase institutional's 2020 year in review because of the institutional demand for bitcoin exposure pantera capital one of the oldest funds in the space is launching a new fund in the next few months for institutional bitcoin investors the block reports next headline ethereum 2020 year in review transferring more value than bitcoin josh stark of the ethereum foundation and evan van ness of the weekend ethereum newsletter published a 2020 year in review for the second largest blockchain by market cap the first takeaway was that 2020 was the year was the first year in which ethereum transferred the most value point six trillion dollars worth of assets sixty percent more than bitcoin's one trillion dollars worth of assets transaction fees on ethereum at more than six hundred million dollars were also almost double that of bitcoins another trend cited was the growing creator economy on ethereum with crypto art volume totaling 23 million dollars which sounds small but makes it about five percent of the 500 million dollars paid out by patreon to its creators in 2019. the report also noted the rise in decentralized exchanges with volumes averaging between 17 billion dollars and 26 billion dollars in the fall coinbase's institutional 2020 year year in review report also saw an increased number of institutional clients investing in ether which will also get a boost next month when cme launches ether futures contracts coindesk quotes dennis vinokurov head of research at digital asset prime broker bequan who says that many see eth as a way to get indirect exposure to d5 protocols he says quote not everyone is comfortable with the risks that are still associated with d5 but the hyper growth of these projects boosts activity on the ethereum network and thus supports capital appreciation meanwhile the ethereum foundation in reddit announced a partnership to quote help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like community points on ethereum next headline files for several new trusts including some in d5 on wednesday grayscale investments the largest digital asset manager filed for five new trusts for crypto assets ave cosmos polkadot monero and cardano over the weekend coindisc reported that grayscale had also registered trust for chain link to central and live pier tazos and filecoin it's perhaps not surprising that a few of these are defy related the block reports that otc desks are seeing an uptick in interest in d5 genesis is seeing trades and defy coins such as uni crv and sushi richard rosenblum the founder of gsr trading said quote now that bitcoin has had time to calm down people are looking for the next thing to invest in similarly volumes on dexes hit 45 billion dollars in january more than double compared to december next headline paradigm's guide to optimistic roll-ups paradigm published an in-depth explainer on how optimistic roll-ups work it starts with the problem of the system wanting to scale without losing its properties of low cost and low trust both of which help keep the system decentralized it explains that the root optimistic roll-ups take in scaling is to limit on-chain transactions and to use fraud proofs to cancel invalid quote state transitions or changes to the state of the blockchain since fraud proofs are on chain it also has a method to dissentivize fraud called a fidelity bond that's required from so-called sequencers who store and execute the off-chain transactions and submit a minimal amount of data about them called merkle routes to the ethereum blockchain if a sequencer's data is proven to show fraud then that bond would be slashed and distributed to the so-called verifiers whose role is to watch out for fraud it's a complex system but paradigm does a great job of explaining how it works for those inclined to learn more about what is likely to be the short to medium term scaling solution for ethereum next headline for the math minded vitalik's introduction to zk snarks another potential scaling solution for blockchains is zk snarks which vitalik buterin the creator of ethereum recently cited as the most promising long-term solution as the technology improves this week in a new blog post dedicated specifically to zk snarks he explains how they make possible solutions to two problems that blockchains face scalability and privacy as he describes it quote a zk snark allows you to generate a proof that some computation has some particular output in such a way that the proof can be verified extremely quickly even if the underlying computation takes a very long time to run also he adds and this is the part that makes it a potential privacy solution quote the zk or zero knowledge part adds an additional feature the proof can keep some of the inputs to the computation hidden he says that this would make it possible to prove that you have the right to transfer some asset without revealing which asset you received he says quote this security without unduly leaking information about who is tracking transacting with whom to the public those are the main takeaways but for those interested in the details about how this works he does go into more detail but just a warning that it does require a fair bit of math time for fun bits crypto twitter can't stop with gamestop if like me you can't get enough of this game of chicken between redditors and the 0.1 percent here is a roundup of choice tweets from crypto twitter author and speaker andreas antonopoulos tweeted time to regulate outsider trading lol elizabeth stark ceo of lightning labs tweeted 2008 too big to fail 2021 too small to win jake schravinski general counsel at compound labs tweeted imagine the sec denying a bitcoin etf proposal because of market manipulation concerns after all this tyler winklevoss ceo of gemini tweeted if i was the ceo of gamestop the next move would be to purchase bitcoin and put it on the balance sheet many took the opportunity to promote defy with ryan adams tweeting robin hood just banned gamestop and amc the wrong people are winning so they de-listed the assets here's what they don't know they just recruited another 1 million people into d5 uniswap not robin hood protocols not banks this is why we go bankless and finally suna amaz of volt capital tweeted robin hood isn't fit to be called that anymore alright well thanks for tuning in to learn more about sam ftx and the gamestop saga this week be sure to check out the links in the show notes don't forget we are now on youtube subscribe to the unchanged youtube podcast channel today unconfirmed is produced by me laura shin with help
