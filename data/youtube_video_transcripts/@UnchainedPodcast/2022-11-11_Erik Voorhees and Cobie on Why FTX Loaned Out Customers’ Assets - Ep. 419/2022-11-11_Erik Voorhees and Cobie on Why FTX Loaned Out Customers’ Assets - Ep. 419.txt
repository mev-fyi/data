discussion between Jordan fish AKA Kobe of up only TV and Eric Voorhees founder of shapeshift it's a fantastic discussion unpacking the FTX Fiasco how this could have happened and what it all means one note that there were some technical difficulties so Kobe's portion cut out a bit and we didn't know until after we wrapped he was gracious enough to re-record those answers and we did our best to edit it all to be as seamless as possible after the interview we have a briefer than normal news recap and then a truly special fun bits a stand-up comedy special with comedian and author Ginny Hogan

discuss are Eric Voorhees founder of shapeshift and Jordan fish AKA Kobe crypto investor and host of up only TV welcome Eric and Kobe how's it going hello so let's just start by processing the recent news meaning like what broke in the last several hours to give readers some context since events are essentially changing by the minute we are recording at about 11 A.M on Thursday and to give a really brief recap of events this week for listeners who may have missed the blow by blow which was happening kind of in real time mostly on Twitter this week there was a bank run on FTX SPF himself Sam Pigman free the founder and CEO said that they saw about five billion dollars in withdrawals on Sunday Sunday alone at a certain point it became clear they could not process all the withdrawals which just should not happen in an exchange that just should not be possible an exchange should put your coins in Cold Storage keep some of them in the hot wallet maybe for day-to-day operations but otherwise their job is to keep that  secure so apparently this is not what happened because Tuesday Morning FTX revealed that they did need to ask binance to try to acquire them Wednesday we found out that the size of the whole nftx's balance sheet was eight billion dollars so binance ended up pulling out they said you know the financials and obviously all this regulatory risk was not something you know that was suitable for them to acquire the company and it kind of looked like FTX was headed toward bankruptcy maybe still looks that way um late Wednesday night Justin's son tweeted further to my announcement to stand behind all Tron token holders and he listed a few of them we were putting together a solution together with FTX to initiate a pathway forward as Sam actually did reference that negotiation as well both in a internal slack message which Kobe posted on Twitter but also in some tweets that he posted so who knows what will happen but you know bankruptcy probably is maybe the direction this will go and then like I said we're recording Thursday morning but when I woke up at least I found out that Reuters reported that Alameda got loaned some unidentified amount of money uh from FTX after it lost 500 million dollars due to the Voyager bankruptcy which you might recall was triggered by the implosion of three arrows capital so Eric and Kobe let's just start with all that um I'm curious you know with this Reuters piece actually I'm curious do you think that the Voyager bit and this loan that happened after that was the start of any kind of coming like or do you think that FTX and Alameda had been co-mingling funds previously I don't have any specific knowledge on this co-mingling is an interesting word I'm very curious like what was specifically happening the most likely seems to be that alone was made from FTX two Alameda collateralized with ftt and on the surface that looked sound until you realized that ftt is a relatively small cap token that can go up and down drastically whereas the debt was probably denominated in dollars and that's a really good recipe for a disaster so that's that's I guess what unfolded this week but I think a lot of the specifics are still to come out we don't we don't really know yeah I mean I would have been surprised if there were come England previously but I was surprised that they weren't solving at all like I thought there was a sub 1 chance that that this would be like the outcome when the rumors began so maybe my opinion doesn't uh have that much weight but elevator and Sam used to be the CEO of Alameda right like he Al made a an SPF were kind of the same entity and like SPF and FTX are also the same entity so I imagine at some point there were they were extremely close and then maybe for regulatory reasons they tried to distance them a little bit Sam's stepped down from a CEO of armada and was FTX only and I guess how distant did they ever really get is is the question to answer I would not have thought in a million years that they would be like just slushing the books around together and I think that is likely in the lunar to Celsius to 3ac meltdown Alameda got really hurt and they patched it up then it aligns with like Brett leaving FTX us and Sam trabs leaving Alameda around a similar time to that ftt transfer that Eric mentioned but you know like sometimes people have the confidence to do this because they've successfully done it a few times before so they don't think about it they just go oh we'll just do that thing again that worked for his last time um and get out of the hall so who knows yeah one thing I you know without uh going into names I I would just say let's let's not speculate on why people left let's wait for them to to make those um but I think some of them have publicly said like you know I didn't leave for anything related to this I think um some of the people that you mentioned maybe truly had no idea actually but anyway one other thing though is just what you were saying about how you just never would have expected that FTX would even be in this kind of position I am curious about that like there's there's a few different kind of versions of SPF out there right it's like the one who you know is constantly testifying in Capitol Hill and you know just is sort of coming with the regulators and um you know just like you would imagine someone like that let's put it this way if you're actually doing something Shady you're probably not going to want to get too close to people like that is maybe a way to put it that's an interesting assumption yeah actually right when I said it I just realized because of course people have been tweeting at me that he was like trying to buy himself protection but then you know there's this other side of SPF that everybody has been pointing out in recent weeks which is this is just a real conflict of interest there were a number of situations where FTX or Alameda participated in deals with um projects that were launching and got coins on the cheap and then the exchange might open you know I guess it was perpetuals or something on these like you know coins that really had no volume and then people suspected that Alameda was was trading on that and making money on on these coins that they got cheaply um basically dumping on retail is essentially what a lot of people implied I looked at a number of these things it's one of those things where like it's hard to prove right but there were a lot of insinuations a lot of yeah I think that also distracts a little bit from like the really egregious Behavior here so private parties trying to get good deals and make a profit on the deals with their own property is is one thing and I'm not so concerned about like a conflict of interest between those two firms there clearly was because they were owned by the same people to a large degree the problem here is lending out customer money without telling the customers and then going a step further and acting as though you're not and and um dismissing others in the industry for doing the same thing that was being done at that moment that's that's the egregious Behavior here it is appalling that Sam would be speaking to Regulators about like counterparty Risk and the safety of customer deposits while at the same time being insolvent with his own customers that's like um sociopathic behavior and and is just downright fraud yeah yeah I 100 agree with Eric like the the other stuff you mentioned you know like opening markets so that Alameda or other entities close to FDX like friends um Can hedge these bags that they've got cheaply they can you know effectively proxy sell on purpose coins that they have locked and not supposed to sell for four years to take advantage of you know this High fdv type low float setup is maybe anti-customer or the markets are much more useful to insiders than they are to uh like retail Traders but it's just a totally different degree of thing than just stealing customer deposits and lying about stealing customer deposits and part of the reason I'm I would say this I would never have guessed they were insolvent is they sort of had the game rigged in their favor right so like they were able to do these things with these markets that allow them an advantage over any other Market participants such that they should just be printing so much money all of the time like they had the exchange they owned the venue they had all the data for people's positions on the venue they had markets that they wanted to hedge their own positions like they were off venue and somehow they still managed to lose 10 billion dollars like it doesn't make sense they must have been the worst traders of all time um so that's why I was so shocked if you have an exchange that prints eight to nine figures of fees per day you raise two billion dollars like there's a 10 billion dollar hole but it means they must have lost like 14 billion or something in the last year so that's why I would never have expected it I think a mixture of it is just a it's a different degree or a different magnitude of fraud to the behavior that could have been sent as like you know a bit Sharky and maybe not ethical but you know um welcome to crypto and then literally just like lying and being so incompetent that despite all your advantages you still managed to like lose 10 yards it makes no sense yeah and let's talk about the first bit where when I said that that he was kind of the face of crypto regulators and people like like I tweeted that um it's like the person that you thought was Hermione ended up being Voldemort and to my mind Hermione is like the goody two shoes you know kind of like kissing up to the teachers and whatever and so in that that's why I said SPF appeared like that but I was curious you know what your take was on what he was doing with Regulators if he was actually you know doing what it looks like he was doing it's clear that he doesn't come from the same ethos as many in the crypto world who believe that what we're doing is is antithetical to you know federal regulations and and they have all sorts of um philosophical economic moral reasons for that he was not of that cloth he was and he and he didn't you know lie about that he he was very pro-regulation or as people like to euphemistically say you know pro-regulatory Clarity and he was willing to sit in Washington and invite down these regulations you know with a smile on his face and and um putting forward that the industry supports it because he has this huge exchange he's very well known millions of customers and so he can say like yes the industry will support this The Regulators want that because then to them it feels like they're doing good and they get a bunch of his donation money and in in return he gets to help craft that legislation and what was really worrying a couple weeks ago when I had that debate with him was how how readily he was going to sacrifice uh defy essentially sacrifice decentralized Finance such that the centralized Financial regulations would be more in his favor that was super concerning and I think that's why the community was so outraged with what he was saying there but no one no one at that point thought he was also committing like a multi-billion dollar fraud um so that that's that's new and surprising yeah it's just it's just such an order of magnitude different like I can even understand someone being like having different regulatory opinions and like fighting for the things that they believe are best but I just end up speculating and going too conspiracy theory when I think about these things now like you know his parents are from like a deeply political Elite background they're both like lawyers apparently he's my mum's friends with Elizabeth Warren and stuff and I wonder how much of this egregious fraud that was happening influences what you do in those in those venues like do you fight for what you really believe in if you know you have this whole and you have this thing coming up or do you cozy up to Regulators a little bit more there's this video of him in Congress testifying about um the financial crisis and how though is this opaque debt that was being you know barred against and repackaged and barred against and all these you know this this daisy chain of debt and how that cannot happen on um on FDX that like you know it's impossible it's like transparent and crypto blah blah blah blah blah and at the same time he's doing the exact same thing that he described in Congress as like being bad and not possible with um crypto and ironically is possible with FDX a centralized exchange that acts somewhat like a bank but is not possible with defy this thing that I guess allegedly um I still don't know the details but allegedly he was arguing um to to regulate more strictly and uh and stuff but again rumor and conjecture um so yeah I I don't know man I just wonder how much the fraud influences what you do in those venues and how you behave with um uh regulators and stuff I I don't know I mean if crypto prices had rallied over the last six months this wouldn't have happened right like this would have been covered up and the solvency would have regained itself and it could have been worked out but of course to run a company of that size and to be holding billions of dollars of customer money that could never be your assumption you have to assume quite the opposite and if you wanted to be loaning out customer funds like just tell the customers you're doing it you know and give them some of the yield tell them what you're doing that's all it requires the fraud is in doing it without telling them and then the double fraud isn't doing it and then saying you're doing the exact opposite yeah some of the um the you know stuff he was saying uh you know in his now deleted tweets were FTX is fine assets are fine FTX has enough to cover all client Holdings and it you know it's so interesting to me like if you ever deal with little kids like trying to explain to them how important it is to not lie and then like as adults like all you guys are saying is like if he had been transparent you know if he hadn't lied it's really the lie that is actually what is the crime here which you know it's it's interesting um and I actually this goes back to the theranos comment because I also followed that very closely and just in all the stuff that I learned about what she was doing it's interesting I know it's gonna maybe sound crazy but I don't know if you guys remember her voice is fake like it's it's a normal like she has a normal voice but she like fake made it deeper and you know people who knew her before said like yeah it didn't used to be like that and some employees were like oh like at the company party she's sort of fell out of her voice and we heard a real voice and stuff like that and for some reason like for such a little lie like like that's when you cross the line is just like at any moment that you're gonna like when you're willing to lie then it's like you know then the lies like you can't ever just do one lie because um you essentially have to keep creating stories around the lie and just keep going and it almost feels like maybe you know obviously we don't know all the facts here but it seems like maybe something like that happened um but even when Eric was like oh they could have potentially I trade it out of this or whatever if the price of the coins that had gone up you know it's like just what you were saying like no you when you have that moment where you're like okay one of my entities is in trouble you know you know that you are not supposed to touch the funds of your customers in the other entity but he crossed that line and it's like from that moment forward like you know it and then then all the other lies just go from that one you know and I and yeah like Kobe I feel like you mentioned this earlier like he could have very well been like one company maybe won't be successful the other one like is going to be a great company I can make money off the trades whatever and you know who knows maybe he was like if they're both successful I can give away more to all the you know people that deserve my effective altruism but yeah what I just don't understand is how you can have this exchange which is worth 40 odd billion dollars and prints eight figures nine figures in fees per day and yet risk all of that in order to bail out the failing hedge fund right like you have a hedge fund that you're also uh co-founder of and it maybe contributes more to your net worth than um The Exchange does even but it's failing it's not doing well whereas FTX is doing well FTX is succeeding but you risk the the thing that's winning in order to like prop up the thing that is clearly not able to like perform in the market if it needs you know this bailout um I just don't I can't see a world where a person decides to do that and says well in order to save half of my net worth I guess I will risk everything I will risk customer funds I'll risk this successful business invest a relationship everything in order to prop up a failing hedge fund I I can't um imagine I can't imagine how you end up in that place yeah Eric since you have experience with exchanges I was kind of curious for your take on all on all this you know I don't know if you saw Jesse Powell tweeted he had it was such a great thread but I'm just going to quote one of them he said red flags acting like you know everything after showing up to the battle eight years late nine figures buying political favor being over eager to please DC huge ego purchases like nine-figure sports deals being a media darling seeking out puff pieces which by the way I I don't know if you guys saw the Sequoia thing I mean I know they're they're they invested in him but it was just I was like oh boy this is embarrassing um EA virtue signaling and then the last one was of course ftt yeah I was curious for your your thoughts as an exchange owner or uh previous I mean it's hard to not be super pissed and what I'm pissed about is so like with shapeshift when we created it it was in the wake of Mount gox collapsing which like almost took down the industry they were 80 or 90 of the entire Exchange Market and we were so dismayed because like it had been years of work trying to get Bitcoin credible trying to get people to take it seriously and then the most important Exchange through some combination of incompetence or actually insiders stealing money 500 million dollars is lost and that was that was so much money back then and we build shapeshift to not ever hold customer funds we weren't like oh you know what the problem is um Mark carpelis isn't trustworthy we are so we will take all the all the deposits of customers that's a recipe for just repeating the same mistakes and so we built shapeshift to protect customers by not holding the money at all and and this is some this is like the magic of crypto that you can do that you you could never have a non-custodial exchange system in the Fiat World they can't exist and crypto blockchains come along suddenly you can build these amazing tools that systematically remove risk from Finance systematically and then we we as shapeshift get nothing but hell from Regulators get nothing but hell from The Wall Street Journal get nothing but hell from like the financial establishment that doesn't like us because we actually provided privacy to users and we actually protected them systematically and then FTX comes along donates millions of dollars to the politicians and is like this darling in DC where he then goes and is invited to like speak and craft regulation and the corruption of all of that is so so blatant and and my hope for this for this example and tragedy as bad as it is is like wake up to what crypto can actually do wake up to how defy Works where you you simply remove the need for trust like we don't need a licensing regime because that's just meant to like improve trust we've we've removed the need for trust this is a huge breakthrough for Humanity and the politicians The Regulators do not appreciate this at all and they continue to vilify it wherever they can it was disgusting to see Sam inviting that down on defy and then to see to see what he did with this customer money is so ironic and tragic and I hope it wakes some people up yeah I actually want to ask you two follow-up questions so that the first one is about I mean you kind of reference the Wall Street Journal p Ure piece that ran that implied that um you know I don't remember all the details it was like maybe like terrorists are using shapeshift or people were like money laundering using Championship I I am really curious about this because um I just feel like we see this tension so much in crypto in general where um you know I obviously like I think it's a good thing if criminals don't use crypto to launder their money and and whatever and yet at the same time I totally agree with you about like customer privacy and you know protecting their funds and not creating a Honeypot and all that so I was just curious to hear kind of like what you think is the best way to resolve the tension between those two I think the way you resolve it is to recognize like a first principle which is the presumption of innocence customers are not criminals therefore if they're not even accused of a crime they should be permitted the decency of privacy I don't know why this makes me like some radical this should be a fundamental part of American culture that if you haven't been accused of a crime you have the right to privacy I mean I thought there was like an amendment you know like the fourth amendment they guaranteed that that enshrined it and um it's violated every single time someone goes to an exchange and has to surrender their personal identifying information just because some regulator wanted to capture it The Regulators want to make their job easier and in so doing they are happy to violate fundamental rights of an entire population yeah I think it's you know what is the default because like at the beginning of your statement you said customers are not criminals but sometimes they are but absolutely and so allege a crime and go after the criminal if if there is a suspicion of wrongdoing alleged like this is how the court system works right you you get some evidence and you allege that a crime happened and then when people are accused of crimes there's a reasonable argument that some of their freedoms start getting stripped away while you figure that out that's like a case-by-case basis you you find the criminal you go after them you accuse them and if you have done a good job as the authority you bring convincing evidence and you convict them and we have such a backward system now where the government believes that exchanges that all Financial intermediaries for example should be spying on everyone and Reporting all that information back to the government when when none of those people are even being accused of a crime that's so different and and for all the people that care about Law and Order like where is the law in order in that that's not that's not Law and Order that that is tyranny and um It's just sad that it's such like an extreme position these days and then the other thing I wanted to ask you about was when you were talking about how Sam you know was going to DC and being all buddy buddy with the regulators and lawmakers um I was curious you know you only mention it in the context of the dccpa and how that obviously was going to make D5 not really defy and um I was wondering did you have any inkling that um he was a bad actor for crypto when it came to regulation before that time or or you know either of you are or in general did the crypto Community feel that way I didn't I didn't really know I only got aware of his position when he posted his blog about you know his suggestions for regulations in the industry and there were some big red flags in that and so that's what I that's what I was calling out I mean I I let's just say I was a little suspicious of him when I learned that he's like the second largest donor to one of the political parties that's not good you know like so something was already amiss there but um the degree to which he was causing bad things to happen was not apparent until uh until that discussion yeah I mean I don't know I I don't know I'm like I I didn't think Sam seemed very well in the debate with you Eric I like it was so one-sided and kind of awkward to watch after a while it seemed like you know he seemed like a little bit sick or something um clearly a lot of stuff going on so I I don't really um I don't really know um and I I'm certainly not an expert on the the right stuff and I think is extremely complicated um so that's I don't know what to say Have The Regulators ever actually prevented an exchange from collapsing like is there a single example where they came in and like hey we discovered the fraud and we're shutting these guys down because we are the government we're here to help has that ever happened that there was no there was no um insolvency there no they shut down btce because they didn't like where it was coming from they called it money laundering no no but actually the uh the stolen funds from Mount gox were laundered through btce so I think that's why I got shut down yeah uh allegedly allegedly but I mean it's I think but that wasn't the case that wasn't a case where they were stealing customer money and there was an insolvency so the question is like have have The Regulators ever prevented a collapse of an exchange on insolvency grounds I don't think there's a single example no but theoretically they should be able to do that because you know like like for instance um I did so I did get chain analysis to send me the balance sheets of eth on ftx.com and ftxus and you can see that FTX was in the red on eth actually interestingly it showed that they were in the red on 8th back in January for a short period um and then of course again just in the last few days but when you look at the balance there's a there's a big drawdown in um June and where were the Regulators then too busy taking photo ops I guess I think you know look I mean the charts I have they're not interactive so I couldn't look too closely but um it looked like around the time that Voyager announced that they had the exposure to 3ac and I saw another chart showing that around the same time FTX and FTX us received a huge influx of ftt so um just everything that Reuters mentioned checks out when you look in that regard but you guys so we're gonna take a quick break to hear from the sponsors to make that show possible defy saver is an all-in-one management app for the

conversation with Eric and Kobe so some other bits of news that broke this week are that the SEC cftc and now doj are all investigating based on what we're talking about you know the deleted tweets the actual facts that are coming out versus what he was saying you know am I wrong and thinking this is likely to end in criminal charges I don't know but it seems like CZ did a better job investigating than any of the Regulators did crypto Twitter was aware of the problem based on like service level blockchain forensics yeah operators come in after the collapse where is the accountability here I know but but did you read Cece's tweets because he was just as shocked as everybody else though at least the way he told it in his tweets was that it literally was just like oh alameda's balance sheet looks a little bit risky like we should you know get this ftt off of our balance sheet to cover our risk and then he had no idea that all of this would end up in Sam calling him Monday night or Tuesday being like hey and the SEC cftc and now doj are all investigating and as we were talking about he has these deleted tweets in which what he was saying doesn't comport with the facts that have emerged since so I was curious do you guys think this will end up in criminal charges I mean I I hope so right it's like a egregious fraud if it doesn't what is the point of the system at all at least it was Mount Cox I feel like at least what what I understand about box it was like a technical mistake which Mark then tried to cover up to make users whole right so like a hack or like some like bad code somewhere um which then Mark was not honest about whereas this this just seems to be like we store customer deposits and then we just continually lied about it because doing customer deposits is not good and people would use it not use our exchange anymore so I mean I hope so Eric but for you even answer that I was just wondering like what do you guys think of the fact that you know blockchains and transparency show a lot of this stuff and actually could be used to prevent these kinds of situations and yet most likely at the moment just based on everything that's happened my sense is that Regulators are going to want to do the traditional type of Regulation and not go with this more technological solution and I was curious what you thought of that too yeah it's really frustrating when the technology for complete transparency real-time auditability is here and The Regulators not even like won't adopt it but they actively vilify it and then aren't themselves solving any of these fraud issues like uh what probably happens here is years of court cases and depositors getting some tiny fraction of their money back many years from now and like whether whether Sam goes to jail or not I don't really care like what I care is people learning the lesson to to stop using custodians to stop using like centralized Financial Services where this kind of thing can happen and has happened over and over and over again the solution is like right in front of us these decentralized protocols solve these very problems we don't have to care about people's intentions you don't have to care about human mistakes in the moment like we have to care about code mistakes but that can be viewed and audited and fixed and there's just such hesitancy for people to like step into the actual promise of crypto because they're comfortable in these little walled Gardens um especially when they say that they're you know the safe regulated way to buy and sell Bitcoin um which was which I think was literally ftx's slogan for all of their advertising it reminds me of like that underwater fish with the little light like the light of Regulation the deep sea fish and then everyone's like ooh they're safe and regulated and they go toward it and um it's uh it's just kind of tragic hopefully people learn what do you think of the fact that the ftfc US and in general you know like any of these U.S entities don't have these problems because there are such strict regulations in the US like they also don't have the customers it doesn't vindicate anything I mean the reason that 9 out of 10 FTX customers are in the offshore one is because the U.S regulatory burden is so high that no one actually wants to use the US version I made that I made that number up but I know that the international one I'll disclaim that I made that stat up the number of international customers and the volume of FTX International was dwarfing U.S right so um same thing with binance right there's a binance us how does that compare in terms of volumes to the the real binance it's it's almost insignificant the reason customers go elsewhere is because they prefer those Services because they're not burdened with all the garbage that the U.S regulatory system puts down where's the accountability for that Damage Done by The Regulators and then how do you account for the success of coinbase which obviously is you know mainly us and has what more than 100 million customers or something coinbase is the exception that proves the rule and they've done a very good job over a very long period of time and they've you know they've worked tooth and nail over a decade to to gain that customer base and I know it's frustrating to them that so many customers leave to other jurisdictions I remember back when like all the icos were going on and coinbase felt they needed to be too conservative to list a lot of the assets and so binance would list everything and the customers all went out there because people wanted to trade these things so coinbase has done an amazing job given the constraints of the regulatory system in the U.S but they're at a constant disadvantage let's also now talk about this little news bit which broke shortly before we started recording which is that tether has frozen 46 million dollars of usdt held by FTX following a request from law enforcement what you guys think of that and oh and people were saying that it looked like FTX might have been doing something with a curve pull to try to break the usdt peg or something I'm not sure yeah my hope is that like circular or tether would freeze these accounts based on their own judgment like they they see these flows better than anyone and if they see a big blow up they have at their discretion the ability to freeze these things you know I hope they're not waiting around for some um law enforcement to suggest it because that could come way too late but again it's a good reminder that these centralized stable coins are um not permissionless so everyone that uses them needs to know that um one other thing that we have referenced a few times is the existence of FDT itself and I was curious what you thought of exchange coins you might have seen there was like a little um dust up with you know Alex gladstein saying that this sort of proves like you know Bitcoin versus all the other coins blah blah blah and then other people are fighting back saying like no it's just about you shouldn't kind of have these exchange coins yeah do you do you feel that this vindicates that Bitcoin or notion that when people kind of create this funny money and it's like a little bit more centralized that it leads to the shenanigans and really it just shows the power of Bitcoin or what's your take on it the Maxi's trying to make this into like a Bitcoin versus crypto thing is kind of gross this isn't a Bitcoin versus crypto thing this is a custodian versus non-custodian thing this is a trust versus trustless system thing this is a centralized versus decentralized thing there's nothing wrong with an exchange making its own token absolutely nothing wrong with it as long as they're being honest about what it is how it works all that kind of thing there's nothing wrong with it um and even though ftt now has a huge black mark on it bitfinex created their Leo token years ago and actually solved their own exchange hack through some very clever Financial engineering with their token that whole project doesn't get enough attention but like they basically solved a hack that was existential to them um it wasn't the government that did it wasn't a regulator that came in and made those people whole they did it and they did it using their own token and they they've been you know very successful through that so creating a token is fine like this let the markets be free anyone should make whatever tokens they want and they can Market them as long as they're being honest there's nothing wrong with that what was wrong here was giving away customer money to another party and then lying about doing that yeah the focus though just needs to remain on the the real crime here which was the giving away of user assets and saying that they weren't doing that yeah everything else is is somewhat important details but like that is the real fundamental breach of trust here yeah and actually um while we were talking my assistant put in the document that the Wall Street Journal reported that svf told an investor this week that Alameda owes FTX about 10 billion dollars and that all in all FTX had 16 billion dollars in customer assets so that means that FTX lent more than half of its customer funds to Alameda which it doesn't necessarily mean that no um for example if FTX had a bunch of its own cash the loan could have been part customer funds and part its own cash but point point still stands it's a huge amount yeah yeah so where do you think uh this kind of ends up in terms of contagion issues um are there any other entities that you think might get hit like are there any other yeah because obviously you know this song got kicked off way earlier from other entities and we saw that you know all of these have knock-on effects so I was curious to hear what you thought about that yeah the the answer is like certainly there will be effects the question is just how big and how how bad who who's affected lots of people in the industry I'm sure are like trying to figure out counterparty risk right now and The Echoes of how this kind of thing works and how like the financial crisis happened in 2008 are pretty pretty loud again I sound like a broken record but like in D5 you don't worry about this stuff because everyone understands where all assets are at all times and and contracts execute as the code is written in in Fiat systems in custodial systems there's just this opacity that you can't get around and but do you want a name who people seem to be to be kind of worrying I don't know yeah I really don't know yeah so if you have a financial relationship with Alameda in any way such that Alameda owes you money um I mean those are the obvious ones right so who are the lenders that have lent um money to Alameda um I read somewhere that like obviously animated does a lot of Market making for um for projects so projects will give a supply of tokens to Alameda and um Alameda will use that to create Market depth but they're supposed to give those tokens back at some point whether or not they'll give those tokens back I guess is on the on the cards now um uh a lot of projects seem to loan money to Alameda as well so like project treasuries um similar to the 3ac thing where if you got a if you were invested in by 3ac or Alameda they would also say to you um we'll come we'll take a 50 million dollar loan and we'll give you this what 10 annually or something on that so there was maybe some contagion Beyond just lenders there may be some projects who lose their treasuries and need to raise in a very bad race environment obviously everyone that has you uh money on FDX they saw multi-coin has like 20 of assets under management or something on yeah I think was ten percent on on FDX so there's a lot of balances there probably industry balances and again like crypto company balances so I think those are the main things like the Len a few lenders might go bust people that had a relationship with Alameda like how many of the other big exchanges or user-facing crypto companies will let lending to are made it obviously FDX were because they're really close but Alameda had um a reputation as being like money printers right like a similar to 3ac where there were like oh these guys are extremely profitable so was exchange b c and d also saying they're a safe place to put some uh some of our money whether that's just money that the exchange owns or maybe someone else is also learning out um customer deposits those are the things I think they're worth watching and in these times when something starts blowing up and you don't know what what the daisy chain of who's relying on who to pay back money is I think the best thing to do is just to withdraw anything that you have on any custodial exchange to like something where you own the keys so you know no matter where you have money really maybe coinbase is the only exception because they're like a public company and like you can go read their book like Financial bucks and stuff like that but yeah I think those will be the main places I I also saw something that's solid the Solana uh like wrapped Bitcoin and Solana wrapped assets are issued by FTX or Alameda so there may be even some contagion in Solana d52 yeah great point yeah yeah we wrote an article about that on Unchained that came out Thursday so people can check that out um Kobe you can tell me uh do you have sort of an inside line into what things look like inside FTX because you are the one who posted you know the slack message from Sam and stuff yeah no no I mean I mean Sam was effectively lying to my face right up until the day before this broke because someone um someone was talking to him about this and said will you go on my podcast we've gone up only TVs the podcast to talk about this and he said yeah well I'll go on it and this was maybe the seventh or the eighth so we started a group chat with Sam and we were arranging a time and it's like cool right I'll have a nap and then when I get up we'll do it and then when I woke up it's like oh we're gonna delay it now well we'll definitely do it this week but we're delaying it so um like right up until this whole thing blew up he was pretending things were fine and was I guess gonna come use uh our podcast to like tell some more um tell us some more lies about how things were fine perhaps um but I yeah I like for some reason everyone knows my telegram handle and I tweet information so people just keep sending me um Snippets and then occasionally a couple of uh uh crypto journalists when they don't feel like they can publish the information perhaps for political reasons just say um we verified this what do you think and then normally I just leak those things um which is what happened with the slack thing a crypto journalist sent me it and um I've always said that you had verified that it did actually yeah so Anon was a crypto journalist and I verified it was someone that um uh works at FTX um or like is this like message real basically um but beyond that like no not really um like as in the dark as uh everyone else is apart from reading the rumor mill typically when a lot of this stuff happens there's a bunch of telegram chats of like deeply crypto native people right but so but your sense is what's mostly being reported which is like even that all of this was kept too a small number of people at an extremely high level to the point where a lot of high other high-level people just didn't even know is that what you're senses I'm just made to hear that someone like Zayn would have 50 of his net worth on any custodian like why do people leave so much money with custodians I mean he he's worked at so many exchanges he's worked at okx and binance and or are all the more reasons it's it's depressing how much risk people expose themselves to and and the noob I get right the noobs used to their bank account they'll leave all their money on FTX I'll get it but like come on people we gotta we gotta do better than this do not leave half of your net worth among any set of custodians it's just foolish and it's not at all what the whole point of crypto is if you're doing that you you are you're doing it wrong so that's a good message for everyday listeners I was curious you know we kind of have been addressing what takeaways Regulators should have but I know a bunch of regulators listen to my show so if you want a platform to send them a message what would you guys say to them yeah okay thanks for the platform I'm sure all the Regulators are going to be salivating over this because they see crypto company uh loses billions of dollars and they want to solve that by making a bunch of laws to any Regulators out there who can think about what they're doing before they regulate consider that this is an issue of custodianship that this only happened because a custodian run by people could make subjective judgments about the assets within it this happens in the banking system this happens in the custodial crypto system just the same and if you want to put regulations on those people I get that do not put regulations down on defy assuming it is the same model like defy solves these very problems it solves them at a code level that can be audited by anyone in the world in real time and we have that technology now so if you care about the billions of dollars that was lost from this and you don't want that to keep happening and you're not familiar with the magic of defy you owe it to everyone to go learn about that and understand that stuff and please do not assign a bunch of regulations that just pull D5 back closer to the Fiat Financial system that we already have it it's hard for me because I I had to like Focus the whole time on what he's saying because I have to be ready to address anything and he just went off on these crazy tirades and to me to me it came across as someone who like actually has not considered the first principles of what crypto is all about which isn't surprising for someone who only arrived like three years ago and is in Washington DC trying to get everything regulated but with all this now coming to light I think there is some other stressful things going on under the surface that are kind of obvious when looking at it now yeah and I know you have to go Eric in a minute but it's just the last point was um I actually asked in this when I last interviewed him because when I was doing research on him and I realized he was making all these political donations I asked him oh so when you make your donations is your purpose more of your like effective altruism philosophy or is it more to further the interests of crypto and you know it was interesting when I was like listening to your conversation with him I'm not a video person I actually uh like listen to things mostly and even though yes I had seen the screenshots but you know I could hear in his voice that he yeah sounded kind of agitated and um it really felt like um you're right that he hadn't kind of like thought of a grand vision and already got like two worked up in the details and was trying to figure out so if we use this language and are you okay with this or that like like not just taking a step back and thinking about like okay when I go into this what am I going to stand for what am I not going to stand for but already just like trying to like just you know Mark up the paper without like thinking you know beforehand what he was willing to do so his positions were not based on any consistent set of moral principles and when you get into a debate about ideology and you don't have a consistent set of moral principles you're you're screwed and he walked right into that one yeah yeah um you could hear it like I said just in his voice he was too caught up in all the details and not thinking big picture all right well I know you have to go you guys this has been amazing thank you both so much is there any last thing you want to say about where can people find you or what you want them to know or think about this I'm on Twitter sometimes at Eric Voorhees and um yeah just for everyone who's suffering out there from losses or risks or worries just move through it step by step it's never as bad as you think it is you'll get through it many of us who are OG's in the space have suffered immense losses as well and uh just be strong and use it as a learning opportunity and move forward

October's inflation came in lower than expected by analysts and crypto prices rocketed but not enough to make up for this week's losses all right time for fun vids this week some of you may have noticed that I tweeted that I thought it would be great to have a comedian give their take on the FTX debacle this week I ended up commissioning Jenny Hogan a stand-up comedian and author of I'm more dateable than a plate of refried beans to write and perform some jokes on what has been an absolute Humdinger of a week please enjoy so I didn't follow crypto all that closely until I wound up in a relationship with a crypto engineer he worked in an ethereum startup well I say it was a relationship we were never official and he wanted us to be he would always ask me if I was dating other people and I was always like Josh you of all people should understand the concept of an asset only having value because of how much other people want it okay I saw what happened to Luna I'm not gonna let that be me yes I'm dating other people okay so because of him unfortunately I do still pay attention to the crypto markets crypto winter where we've been for the last 11 months started to heat up the other night whenever I hear about the crypto World fighting I feel like it's that scene in Mean Girls in the gymnasium where Lindsay Lohan realizes that every subgroup has its own drama even the huge huge huge losers I'll say it up top I think it's really fun when the crypto markets act like the regular financial markets I don't like change and it's kind of homey and comforting to know that a rerun of 2008 is coming up it's nostalgic like let's put on the Friends finale so here's to FDX the Lehman of crypto okay let's get into it what we have is a war between two men who both go by their initials CZ and SBF both celebrities in the crypto world and the guy you just swipe left on on hinge in the real world CZ is basically the bad boy of crypto he runs binance which is not as the name suggests financed for bisexuals and he would never talk to DC regulators super anti-regulation he's his mid-40s and left a traditional Finance career to work in crypto which I believe is what they call a lateral move think of him like James Dean without the cool jacket or cool personality or cool anything he's also fun fact partially responsible for funding Elon musk's acquisition of Twitter which I have mixed feelings about I'm mad that he helped Elon by Twitter but I'm grateful that he's helping Elon go broke svf the founder of FDX was the good guy which of course is how women describe men who can't get laid he's super young and was sometimes called a crypto savior that's right like the crypto version of an essential worker he promised to give away his billions of dollars which well he just might have done we'll get to it so a week ago he had 16 billion dollars which is insane because I saw a photo of him and I had no idea that getting a haircut cost 16 billion and one dollars he's done a lot to raise his public profile including a Vogue spread with Giselle who he was told five minutes before the shoot began is a very famous model all of that is to say no one suspected SBF was doing anything shady with money Giselle has never made a bad choice in her entire life it started on Sunday CZ tweeted that binance was liquidating any any remaining ftt the coin issued by rival exchange FTX Finance was once part of FTX but it spun off like a malignant tumor CeCe claimed he had to dump the ftt and listen I think it's nice when crypto guys get to experience dumping things due to Revelations about ftt which we soon Learned was that SPF was getting high on his own Supply and by that I'm referring to crypto not weed they're very different wheat is mostly legal someone discovered that Alameda SBS other firm sometimes called it sister firm making it one of very few women in crypto held a huge amount of ftt its own coin and it turns out ftt was pretty illiquid CeCe said he needed to drop the ftt because he was learning from Luna which is insane I did not realize crypto people learn from their mistakes anyway after binance dumped all this ftt 23 million coins the price of FDT went crazy well it went from 24 to 24.50 to 2228 in just one day which is to be fair not all that unusual for a crypto coin Alameda then offered to buy ftt for 22 each which seems weird like if you're getting in trouble for holding too much of your own currency don't buy another 23 million of that currency that's like when I told my ex he was sleeping with too many women and then he slept with 23 million other women just kidding I've never had an ex who was successful at getting women to sleep with him did you miss the part about dating a crypto guy anyway then on Tuesday Finance agreed to buy FTX yeah it turned out FTX was totally insolvent and people couldn't get their coins out I've dated a crypto guy so I know what it's like when they just can't perform it's not a good situation CZ offered to save crypto for now and SBF got humbled SBF s made his reputation bailing out troubled crypto Farms is now on the receiving end of the bailout he lost 94 of his net worth how's he going to keep himself afloat with a mere 994 million dollars a lot of people who will never have as much money as him are dunking at him for being poor and honestly I'm here for it but even just in the last couple days it turns out that CZ scrapped the whole deal I guess this offer hinged on binance first performing due diligence which of course being a crypto exchange meant they had to First learn what due diligence was he said their problems were Beyond his ability to fix and then he tweeted out a list of advice for crypto users one of which was to ignore the prices which seems much easier to say when you have a billion dollars on hand FDX is now on the brink of collapse and SBF said he needs eight billion dollars in emergency financing I don't understand can he just like mine for that anyway recently Justin and Son announced he's going to find a way to return FTX and Tron users to normalcy but I've met a lot of crypto guys and I find that highly unlikely a lot of people are concerned that this means that the crypto markets will have to follow the same rules as the traditional financial markets but I assure you it's not that many rules don't worry you can still be SEC regulated and melt the entire economy boys the big Banks do it all the time thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about the collapse of FTX Eric and Kobe check out the show notes for this
