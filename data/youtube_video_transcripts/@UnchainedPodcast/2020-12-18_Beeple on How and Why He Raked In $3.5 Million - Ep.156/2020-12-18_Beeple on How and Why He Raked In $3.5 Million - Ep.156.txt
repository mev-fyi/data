nice to have you so you're a digital artist and you've worked with apple louis vuitton nike justin bieber and katy perry and you've been producing one digital artwork a day for over 13 years how did you get into crypto uh so a bunch of people just sort of started telling me you should check out this nft stuff and so really only like two months ago i i looked into uh you know the space a bit closer and saw a bunch of names that i recognized you know in my sort of like motion design area and so it's like oh there's definitely seems like there's something here and so i like dove in and i have a computer science degree you know i'm not a programmer but it you know that piece of it really sort of like interested me so it just the possibilities i thought were just endless and that there was just a bunch of things people hadn't like tried yet that i thought sounded really really fun to like try and you ended up having a big digital art sale last weekend that raked in 3.5 million dollars congratulations thank you yeah it was just crazy to see but i i also think like it truly is like sort of the start of you know people really kind of like collecting this digital art i think you know the the physical token paired with the the nft i think you know makes it something people can really understand and sort of like speaks to their inner sort of like collecting voice and i think it's just the system that you know will be you know the future of sort of like you know collecting artwork so tell us more of the details about that sale what did you offer how did you offer it and what happened sure so the biggest thing you know that i think is different from this sale than previous sales is that each of the pieces included a physical token that was you know a digital screen that was very closely sort of like tied to the like blockchain so it wasn't sort of like you know a prize that could be separated easily from the nft it's something that's very sort of like meant to be looked at as one piece um and so i i made you know people people-collect.com which sort of like houses the the collection and then uh you know there was an open edition uh for that was on sale for just five minutes and then you know which also included the physical token and then there was 21 auctions throughout the weekend uh that sold single edition um you know sort of pieces to the highest bidder and so that was sort of like you know the components of the drop so you know all weekend you know we sold six hundred thousand dollars worth of the open edition in five minutes and then you know the everydays themselves and the auction were going for over a hundred thousand dollars on average and then the last piece went for 777 000 so you know i think it just shows that there's like a huge appetite for you know a tightly sort of connected digital and physical sort of like collectible and there were some pieces that were also available for a dollar as well why did you do that so that was sort of like a promotional thing yeah there's these pieces that are available for a dollar those don't include obviously the physical token um and they're in an addition of a hundred and even those are are going for if you want to buy them you know they sold out absolutely instantly like less than a second they like sell out and so even those if you want to buy them they're like 17 or 18 hundred dollars to like buy just that like you know sort of like video so i think there's there is a huge sort of like demand for like collecting digital artwork and i'm just excited like you know looking forward to first off get these into people's hands and get them like enjoying you know digital art in their sort of like room just like i am able to kind of like do with these um and then secondly you know moving forward what additional possibilities they are to make these like you know cooler and sweeter and so what were your expectations going into the sale you know did you expect to raise this kind of money i knew it could be big i will say that i did not think it would be this big but i knew it could be big because it was like i was just like just having them in my like room it was like these are freaking sweet like these are just really like they make the rule much cooler so it was like i think if i can communicate that to people like people will be as excited as i am and the people i sort of showed beforehand like everybody was just like oh my god like just like you're very very excited so it was like you know and again this is just literally something that like we came up with like my wife and i like in like a month because again i've only been in this whole space two months so uh like this was not something that's like only been thinking about this for the last two years this was like literally like in a month it was like oh man this would be like perfect for the everydays and that's where i feel lucky that i have like this sort of collection of work that's very digital and very like kind of like meant to be collected almost in hindsight yeah i'm gonna link to the instagram video that you did that shows the box and the um i guess it's like a it reminds me of one of those digital photo display things yeah it's like a physical like kind of like video display token thing but it's kind of like got this nicer like glass feel to it that you know makes it feel kind of almost like a little like floating video in your space yeah i have to say it amazes me that you pulled all that together in two months because it does look very nice i'm actually a little amazed myself too and that's the weird thing too about like these auctions which i'm you know very new to it i've been around in the space before like i did before this a lot of concert visuals like i did the last two super bowls i was at like you know it was part of the like concert visuals and stuff so it's not like i haven't like done some stuff but like like the auction piece of it and like how like final and immediate it is like it was like after the weekend it was like i immediately had like you know three million dollars or whatever it's just very like super weird and like totally in public is also like just something i'm you know not used to so prior to selling your art this way how did you make money from the art that you were creating every day so the way any artist there's no real digital artist that makes money sort of or very few that none that i know of that uh you know sort of make money directly from like selling their artwork it's all like freelance sort of like design work like somebody has a design problem and it's like we need graphics for the super bowl so it's like okay i'll do that and like you know work together with them to sort of like solve that problem but it's you know this is obviously more like art sales where it's sort of i did whatever i want sort of on spec and you know somebody bought it or whatever so there's not really there hasn't been a path for digital artists to make a living like as a quote-unquote artist where they're like selling their own work and i feel like that's about to change i feel like this is just the beginning of digital artists being able to sort of like you know like a painter or somebody like that who can sell works for you know significant amounts of money and it's hard but you can make a living like that i feel like you know that's just we're just at the beginning of like sort of looking at that and i look at and like graffiti and like banksy or or cause with final principles and again i think it's it's it's easy to forget that those were once you know sort of uh art forms that people didn't really respect and didn't sort of like you know value in more of like a traditional art sense and so previously like when you were dealing with collectors like how would you make a sale and how how did the payment happen and everything so honestly like it was sort of like anybody else it was sort of it was just like a print i would sell prints and it was not the best way to view my art because it's meant to be you know sort of viewed on like a screen to be honest um and so you know selling them at shows and stuff like that just like any other artist and it was just kind of it wasn't the right fit for like my artwork that is so digital and that's where i think this caught such certifiers because it was you know this is the best way to view this artwork is you're viewing it on a screen it's got like all this extra information it's like you know sort of slowly animated so it feels like you know the best way to view this digital very digital sort of like you know artwork and when you would sell it at shows did you get um i'm sure there was some cut taken out of that and i'm curious to know how that compares to what it was like working with nifty gateway which was the nft site you worked with yeah so there was a cut i mean to be honest i had not done i had done very little shows like again because there's not that much there isn't that much sort of in the art world like there's not a whole lot of outlets for people who are making digital art like this like there's you know if you're a painter obviously there's tons of galleries that will oh you're a painter they will show your stuff whereas if you're a digital artist there's not they're kind of like why don't you use a computer and that's not like well what are we going to do they got to set up a projector they're going to do some you know this or that and so honestly i had very few shows before this i threw one show kind of you know sort of myself almost in toronto not myself but it was sort of it wasn't through like a you know very like established kind of like gallery or whatever um but yeah they put on like we put on like an awesome show and it had like a really good attendance but again it's still sort of it was um not you know it wasn't the best way to view the art because again it wasn't sort of this like digital thing and and i think that now the pieces are together with the blockchain with the physical tokens that you can like you know view in your house and with the like you know website that i think all the pieces are sort of there to kind of make it a much stronger sort of like collecting experience okay this is so interesting talking to you because it just makes me realize that essentially the art you were putting out every day essentially what it seems like wasn't really monetized and that most of you it's almost like it was like free advertisements for yourself for your commercial work all right so exactly what it was well that's that's yeah just beyond interesting to me as a creator myself um so in a moment we're going to discuss how crypto can change business models for artists like you but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's episode is brought to you by block native block blocknative is the easiest way

conversation with mike winkelmann so something i've been so curious about is since people can also just get a jpeg of the art why would they pay a lot of money to own these nfts oh and that was one of the questions i got the most when i was after the first release that i had which didn't really have that much of like a physical component is how is this different from instagram and why would i buy like you know an mp4 a video and so you know those were the two sort of questions i wanted to sort of address with this next drop and so the the first thing is the video itself that you get for each one of these every day is different than instagram it like it looks like a collectible and it looks like different so you can easily just glance at it and see that it's different because yeah you'll be always be able to view these things on instagram like there's just like you can you know pull up a picture of the mona lisa but that's very different than owning the mona lisa like you can pull up a picture of a bunch of different sort of like famous paintings or this or that but you don't own those paintings and if you did own those paintings then it would feel very different than just looking at it on a thing so with the physical piece like that's where i'm kind of like trying to bring it back a little bit more to the traditional world of art of like okay you don't even need to like don't worry about any of the blockchain stuff you own this physical piece and it's signed by me and it's got like you know authentication markers so that you can look at this thing and know that it's like okay i you know you were given this thing because you only have the the nft and so you have this and you can prove you're the only one who has this thing and you kind of almost really don't even need to worry about the like blockchain piece of it and that's where i think like blockchain will be the most interesting and useful moving forward like you look at like credit card uh you know sort of technology nobody understands how that works they don't give a crap either it's like does it work or not when i style my thing and that's i think how nfts are going to be super useful and and the ones that will be the most successful are the ones that make things easier for people like i feel like this is a better way an easier more transparent way to collect art and so that's where i think it could have like a really huge huge sort of like impact on the broader art world so the person who um you know uh bought that final piece that went for seven hundred and seventy seven thousand dollars seven hundred and seventy seven uh sorry so yeah um yes he was named tim king and um i just wonder do you know him is he like a super fan of yours like do you have some kind of relationship so i knew him i had met him earlier in the week and uh i had just sort of like talked to him and we kind of like dm'd on twitter and i like showed him the box and and sort of like i didn't know him super well but i it wasn't like you know totally somebody i have no idea like i definitely talked to a man like you know dm'ing him the whole time and he was kind of like i'm gonna stop it like three hundred thousand and then it was like you might get the you know big like freaking thing so it was like yeah i knew who it was like it was somebody i was like literally dm'ing well well this was like happening playing out like in real time so it's it's super and the other guy too he was who he is damning i had like talked to that guy beforehand so it's like uh you know that's been kind of interesting too like meeting the different sort of like collectors in the space and sort of like learning about that and it's just such a it's such a interesting relationship because like we're sort of like our interests are very much alive like if their pieces go up in value like that's great for me and it's great for them so it's it's the really like win-win uh sort of thing so yeah it was just i will definitely never forget that i can tell you that that amazes me you only just met him but it sounds like he'd been following your work for a while um honestly i don't think head but it's it it just is interesting that a lot of our like sort of like interests and like what we're trying to do and different things we're trying to do like align very well so it was sort of like you know i think we're going to be friends now i will i'll say that i'll say that yeah i just realized actually because his uh twitter handle says tim.eth so he must be an ethereum yes who yeah he's been around ethereum for a while and like you know done doing well for himself and you know he's just very very smart just super nice nice kid lives out in l.a now and like just very very nice i don't know how much i'm supposed to be like telling him this kid he's a good guy we don't have to talk so further um so there are you know a whole bunch of digital artwork slash digital collectible sites right now and so how did you end up deciding on nifty gateway uh the one thing i will say i really like about nifty is that just that you can use credit card payments because again like i'm trying to make this as accessible as possible for people so with super rare to be honest it's it's like loading and eat getting east loaded up into a wallet is a lot of work that i don't think people quite recognize would that have been in the space they don't understand like you got to connect a coin based account you got to fund the account you got to understand ethereum and you got a load of metamasks chrome extension you've got to understand how wallets work you've got to transfer it's a lot and so like if the other option is you just load a credit card in and you're good to go it's like well that's ultimately what it needs to be it needs to be much much easier to like bring in a bunch of people and that's what i'm really trying to do is like okay the space has been on fire but there's a lot of artists coming in we need a bunch more collectors coming in to sort of like you know keep the party going here so that that's where i was really what i was really trying to do with this sort of like you know drop so the amount of money that you took in in 48 hours is actually the same amount that was taken in by all the artists on super rare in 11 months so do you think that this auction went so well for you because you already have an established audience like you know you have 1.7 million followers on instagram or do you think that nfts and auctions are a promising way for lesser-known artists to sell their work i think it went so well because i was offering something different and i was solving a problem i think like since then they just had like you know a little yachty coin on on nifty and i think it's it's cool and i think there's some you know sort of uh like market for that type of stuff but i think like that guy's way more popular than me and his coin sold for like 16 000. uh so i don't think it's just the popularity i think is i was doing something new and different that people were like oh that's actually a sweet thing versus just like he's a popular guy i honestly think it was mostly just because i was like offering this physical token and people could see like oh yeah that's actually a way sort of like better product and especially even with the open edition for a thousand dollars you've got the physical token too that i think that was why it was so successful versus like me being popular that helped but like i i think it was mostly just the fact that it was like oh this is actually you know a product that seems new and different is like pushing the space forward more so you kind of talked about this a little bit but i just wondered exactly how you thought business models would change for digital artists going forward and i also wondered whether or not that you thought this model could apply to other kinds of creatives such as writers musicians actors who well maybe actors it's a little bit difficult but you know writers could they can obviously make e-books or you know whatever and musicians can make mp3s so do you think that this is something that can only apply for visual artists or do you think other types of artists can also take advantage i think it will i think it will depend on if adding an nft to that thing adds more value if it doesn't then i don't know that it will be that popular you know what i mean maybe i'm wrong again i i'm so new to these this space i hate to make oh this is what's gonna happen i don't know like i i really like i don't want to oversell my sort of like you know uh whatever theories here too too much but i feel like the the things that are not like i mean you can add an nft to anything here we go here's this you know chapstick oh i want to get that nfp of this like but what does that do that doesn't make it better so i honestly think the projects where adding an nft adds value i think those are going to be the most successful where it's sort of like you know not really solving a problem uh you know which i think to be honest with some of traditional art it's sort of like you know if there's a painting or whatever and you have an nft well it proves i have the painting it's like but the painting proves you have the painting you have the painting like if you you know what i mean like what i am not sure what problem is solving like the painting itself proves you have the painting why would you need an nft on top of that you know what i mean so i think there's going to be some the things where it doesn't actually provide that much new value i think those i'm not sure they'll last like a super long time i think it will be the things where it's sort of like oh this nft makes this ownership experience better or more valuable or easier or whatever that i think those will be the ones that will be you'll see much more success does that make sense yeah yeah and any last hints you want to give us on what you might do with crypto in the future oh i can tell you we're just getting started we got a lot planned we got a lot planned now you got the whole family activated and the fam is we're hungry all right great well i look forward to seeing what you do next thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed awesome thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick
