so there is this say I forget who who said it could have been Anthony's asano which is that Bitcoin is the idea and ethereum is the execution and one of the things that that Hall uh said you know 13 years ago was that he was looking into um ways to make Bitcoin you know more energy efficient you're talking about HAL Finney yeah exactly and it's widely fought you know that half and it could be Satoshi and I personally believe that is the most likely candidate and here we are 13 years later after a whole Benny kind of wrote this we now have basically a more secure version of ethereum which doesn't consume nearly as much electricity it consumes roughly 5 000 times less than Bitcoin and I'm sure you're aware that also recently in Bitcoin there's been this interesting Trend where a number of previously hardcore bitcoiners have kind of come out against Bitcoin maximalism and I wondered now that eth will likely be deflationary what do you think happens to bitcoin's narrative as digital gold right so from a cultural standpoint what I think is happening is that the the Bitcoin maximalists are becoming more and more extreme in their maximalism and the ethereans are just staying very very open which they have been since the very beginning we have a culture of openness and and welcoming and so what's happening is that everyone in the middle is kind of gradually moving away so I saw that you know vitalik started as a bitcoiner and he moved away I started bitcoiner I moved away and now we're kind of moving through the spectrum of kind of maximalism and the the one by one the the there's a brain drain towards ethereum and away from from Bitcoin now I think that Bitcoin was an amazing you know experiment for the world and it kind of showed us the way in in terms of getting bootstrapped and and with key ideas for for settlement layers but I I really do believe that moving forward ethereum will be the settlement layer for the incentive value and that looking back you know uh a century into the into the future Bitcoin might not have been you know the the the success that it could have been uh had the culture been slightly different if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode available now on Unchained
