guild games welcome gabby hey laura thanks for having me let's start with your background how did you get into games and crypto oh wow so the background actually goes all the way back to the early 80s on a business trip to america my dad took home a commodore vic 20 and yes i know that that dates me having a commodore as my first computer but yeah i started playing games there and my my parents always wanted us to have personal computers not uh like consoles like uh you know a playstation or xbox growing up because you thought that there's more educational value in having computers so even though i was playing games most of the time i learned how to program then and then uh yeah took up a like a computer related course and i really just love games so when i graduated from school i knew that i wanted to make games and then how did you end up finding crypto oh so uh so i was making games um started a mobile game studio in 2014 so we were making games for uh ios and android devices but in 2017 we it was actually through uh ethereum um that i got into crypto of course heard about bitcoin from my friends and some of them had gotten into it as early as like 2014 but the use case in the philippines for bitcoin had always been around remittances which honestly just wasn't that interesting to me because i was a game developer and what really got me in was the concept of smart contracts or when i first took a look at ethereum it was the concept of programmable money and the concept of adding programmable money in games there's always been some form of money points resources and games that gamers are very used to but the idea of having this kind of immutable money that people could could take out of the context of a program or a game and just give to other people without permission this seemed really exciting so we started taking a look at smart contracts to see how we could use them in the context of a game and how it could one day disrupt the game industry and it was during this time that we were experimenting on this that cryptokitties came out in november 2017 they crashed the ethereum network if you remember that and it and they popularized the notion of the non-fungible token or the nfd and nft was super powerful because unlike fungible tokens now you had a unique asset on the blockchain that could represent something and that something could be a game item for example and that was just really so incredibly exciting for me and so then how did you end up founding yield guild games okay so um when we uh when we found uh uh nft so i've been incredibly active in the space we started making a game called battle racers on decentraland and then i started becoming an nft collector so i collect nfts from you know game items crypto art i i have uh land i have an art gallery in decentraland for example and then i started playing axe infinity in october 2018 so um became friends with the founders geo and psych out in the conference circuit it was very very small scene back then and i invited him to manila to speak about actually infinity a blockchain event that i organized and in return he gave me three axes to start playing and that was the start of me playing axe infinity the community then was less than 500 people um and yeah it was a great experience and fast forward to 2020 i was still playing axe infinity i was playing it a lot actually and what had happened was that this was during the start of the covet lockdown and a lot of people lost their jobs around the world but particularly here in the philippines and what happened is that people in the rural area of the philippines started playing the game as a way to earn money because they lost jobs they were they were stuck at home during the lockdown and they found axi and they started coming in and this was the explosive growth that really led to us founding yield guild games or ygg as a way to kind of give access to people around the world to the nfd assets that they can use and play in order for them to get access to the crypto economy and so tell us what yield guild games does and how it works sure so ygg is a what we call a play to earn gaming guild the guild itself is set up in form of a dow so it's not a company there's no underlying equity and it has a treasury wallet and then what we do is that we buy or breed or acquire nfds in different games starting with axi of course but we're in a lot of different games now and then what we do is that we lend out these nft assets to our player community so that you can they can use them so for example if a player uses uh uh axes uh from from our guild in what is known as the scholarship program or a lending program they get to they get to play the game without having to pay the upfront cost of buying axes a good team and actually infinity might cost somewhere between maybe eight hundred to a thousand dollars which is just out of reach for a lot of people who are just starting out to play a game um especially in developing countries such as philippines or venezuela so we democratize the access by lending them uh the assets so that they can play the game they can earn money and we just do a revenue share so 70 of the slp or smooth club potion tokens earned by the player goes to them 20 goes to their community manager and 10 goes to us the guild and so at the moment how many scholars do you have and how much have people earned via yield guild games we have over 6 000 scholars now and we've paid paid out more than 13 million dollars in slp and that's just in the course of a year and we're really going to wrap this up aggressively in the next year so let's talk about you know you have this experience obviously in traditional games what problems do you think blockchain based games solve uh that exist in traditional video games right so something that people haven't really thought of when they play a game because when you play a game you're thinking about you know you're playing it for enjoyment but in games that have virtual economies you're actually putting in a lot of time and effort building up your character getting items maybe getting land in the game and with putting these assets in a blockchain and kind of in a sense imbuing them with a financial value um now the the effort that you can have in those games is something that uh that creates value that you can take out so the game developer makes all of the money from uh from the work that you're doing inside this virtual economy and what this does by putting assets on chain is that you can own that value for yourself or you can trade it with others and this is actually great for the game itself because if i am putting in value in your game and i am getting money or assets out of it that means i'll stay there longer because i'm actually getting something for the uh for the effort that i'm putting in so let's talk a little bit about what this means for somebody who participates in yield guild games how do they start and then what is their kind of like life cycle in yield guild games evolve as time goes on yeah so there are many ways to participate i guess the uh the the one if you're just coming in um without any any knowledge of blockchain you're probably coming in as a scholar which means that you apply to our different community managers one of them selects you and then gives you asset access to assets just axes and you start playing the game but what we really like to do is to kind of have people really find what kind of creative jobs they like to do within the community so people may start as a scholar and then they earn enough money after a few cycles to pay off their debt pay off their bills put food in the table and then their world opens up they can start doing different things for example they can buy their own axes and just play for themselves and get 100 of the slp they produce or they can start breeding axes to sell them for more money or breed axes or become a scholarship manager themselves providing scholarships for other people who might want to play the game some people become streamers content creators or community helpers who are helping other people so that's the lovely thing about it there's just so many ways for people to get involved and can you give any real life examples of different players who have had their lives changed by participating in the old guild games oh wow yeah we there are so many of those stories you won't even believe so one of uh our players who uh who goes by the name young eugero on twitter and discord uh he uh he was a player who really did not grow up with much and he became part of the early community i tapped him as a freelance graphic designer making twitter banners for our uh ygg twitter account and he ended up receiving the founders coin so the founder's coin was an nft that we rewarded um all of our early uh early community members back in january and if you own a founder's coin you'll you'll constantly get uh amazing like freebies nft airdrops special things for life so uh so it turns out that that's uh coveted highly by our members and the value of that founders going just kept on increasing at one point um this free airdrop and we minted 300 of them was worth 30 each he was in a financial rut because he had some fam a death in the family and he had to sell his founders coin for uh half an eighth but that enabled him to kind of pay for a burial of his family member pay down some debt and give put himself in better financial footing and by kind of participating in the different events of the guild he's able to build up his financial life where he's able to buy a house in car and there's just so many of these different stories from people who come from very modest backgrounds who decide to show up and participate in the network and have their lives vastly improved as a result and so people are earning you know as you mentioned things like uh smooth love potion and axe infinity how easy is it for them to cash out especially if they are you know in these more developing countries yeah so cashing out is uh is not super easy i think the the easiest way to do that is via the crypto exchanges that support tokens like slp so for example uh binance listed game tokens like slp so it's relatively easier to cash out but now we're actually working with partners to make it easy for uh you to use the tokens that you've earned and use it to pay for real-world financial services like we have a partner that comes in where you can use the slp or and and pay for your phone bill for example and that's just incredibly amazing to see is that the partner xld or i thought about this oh yeah and can you talk a little bit more about like how are they making that work yeah so uh the the magic there is where uh kind of crypto meets uh fintech and and in fintech you can apply for different kinds of licenses which are kind of varied by country to country but if you have the proper licenses it is just uh similar as making like a bill's payment for your bank so they kind of abstract away the the exchange from slp to philippine pesos or us dollars and then just use that to pay for the bill on your behalf and when it works it's just amazing where you think of yourself as playing a game you're earning tokens and then i'm using that token to pay for phone bill or get airtime load that's i think where crypto has a real use case that helps people in the real world and which countries are they in right now or in general like you know which countries do you yeah have these services to make it easy for people to cash out the so it's in beta right now so it's in the philippines but uh we're gonna roll it out to over 100 countries okay um so i'm sure you're aware and i know you know here we are just talking about this one game maxi infinity but obviously it's kind of the the main one or it has the most traction but as i'm sure you're aware the value of slp has been dropping earlier this year it was like 35 cents and now it's closer to 5 cents how do you uh you know why do you think that has happened let's start there how why do you think that's happened sure so so slp is different from other tokens in that it's an infinite supply reward token so it's not a cap token it's meant for people to uh earn value in game and then uh when when when you breed axes you burn uh you burn slp so that's how the tokenomics work it's important for a game like axi to have some sort of reward token that has uh that has inflation so that new people can come in and start earning value unfortunately when the uh when axis started really growing like mid this year when everything started exploding i think speculation on the exchanges got ahead of uh where the price was of slp or the good range was so it went to uh like really high levels where for example at 30 cents people were earning for example like over maybe 2 000 a month playing the game and it was probably unsustainable because it was driven by speculation and what you want for a game reward token is to be driven more by internal like game economy rather than kind of external forces so i guess that's one thing that all game designers have to think about is that how do you mitigate the the volatile nature of uh of cryptocurrency because it people can and will uh speculate on your token and that might end up hurting the game economy that you have in the long run and are there any thoughts on how to prevent that from happening because i mean you're right if these tokens are basically trading on these markets that are open 24 7 365 then i could imagine it might be difficult yeah it's kind of a tough game design question and i think this is where the kind of game economy designers come in where you have to design economy mechanics where you limit the volatility of token whether tokens are redeemable and the developer takes them at a certain cap price or maybe you're giving out some form of a stable coin or something that has kind of low inflation rate so there are several ways to do this but it also depends a lot on the context of the game one of the advantages that the game developer has is that they almost kind of act like a central bank where they can change the utility of the token itself so for example this week sky maybe is the developers of axi they upped the breeding costs in slp tokens and dropped it in axs tokens which means that it now costs a lot more slp to breed new axes and that means that there'll be a higher price support as more slp gets burned when new axis are created so just in general for yield guild games as you're adding games i'm sure there's a way that you evaluate game economies how do you do that and are there any particular game mechanisms that you think just outright do not work well in general for game economies yeah yeah absolutely so we have a four man team that just does nothing but look at games that might be a good fit for yale guild to invest in so first of all we look at games that have some form of kind of play to earn tokenomics meaning that i play the game i earn some form of reward because that is how our players earn earn something from it um second is that the guild structure lending is very important for us so i want as a guild to be able to buy for example a million dollars worth of assets in a game whether it's like heroes or land items armor and be able to lend them out to players without having to trust them and to return it back to us so that kind of trustless lending is really important and right now it's being done more in an application level rather than from a kind of wallet level um but if if they're kind of a lending or asset delegation is possible then it's easier for us to come in and invest heavily and it's not just us it'll be like other guilds that have pulled their money to buy assets for their player base so we like to talk to developers as early as possible and kind of work with them through like what is important about a guild model how can we invest assets and have our players play them what kind of rewards are are players earning and where's the money coming from what's the utility of for example a token that is being rewarded which gives it value if other people want to buy it so there's these examples of the things that we take a look at and you talked about how one of the features that you need is to be able to trustlessly lend out these assets so how does that work how do you lend them out and not worry about people either losing their private keys and then being like sorry or you know lying about that yeah so there's a short-term and long-term solution to this short term and what is happening now is that the the assets are on the wallets that the guilds own and then we create accounts in games like axey infinity and then we give other players account level access which means they can log in with the username and password but they don't have access to the private key so they can access their assets but they uh they can't run away with them long term what we'd like to see is an extension of the nft of the erc721 standard where you can have uh delegation mechanics right now there's no mechanics in the erc721 standard for me to put for example an nft in your wallet and have certain conditions to take it back and i think that's just incredibly important because if we enable that then you can enable things like uh land rental contracts allowing people to build on land and then be able to take it back when certain conditions are met if you enable this from a smart contract level then it just becomes so much more powerful yeah yeah i could see how that could unlock a whole new set of um different business models um so one other thing i'm curious about is so obviously you know we have these different type of types of games and i'm sure you know some games are more popular than the others which affects us the asset prices but in general like what would you say tends to make a game asset valuable is it something that makes you more powerful in the game or is it something that's simply rare like a profile pic or like what factors are are giving value to these different assets right there there are several uh factors that affect value scarcity is definitely one of them aesthetics is another one something that looks good that is cars may be desired more by other people in games particularly utility actually trumps all of them utility is very important because if you play with things from in a game environment rather than for example like collectibles pure collectibles that just rely on traits utility is really important because it works within kind of a greater ecosystem and what a virtual world or game economy does so uh that this is where really experienced game developers would can come in because they are designing assets with utility for example if i have land in the game what can i build on top of it can i rent it out to someone can someone come in and farm on my land and then can we do an automated rev share so these are things that are being explored in games right now and yeah it's just really interesting to see what experiments people are coming up with because this kind of blockchain games are still very new and i would say that uh yeah we're still very much in the experimentation phase of what's possible yes i'm i'm quite certain of that um so axia infinity is known for being popular in the philippines and i know that it's already started to spread to some other countries but in general um you know and i'm sure yield guild games is interested in doing this in general how how do you plan to spread more of these different play-to-earn games to other countries or economies yeah so we're leaning very heavily in the community model so what we've done was that we rely on community managers who have knowledge in the game and to go out and recruit people in the local community so for web 3 to be really felt by billions of users it has to be hyper local and so that's what we do we we find and recruit community managers in different countries around the world so now we're in indonesia we're in thailand we're in brazil we're in venezuela we're in colombia and we find uh the community managers that we start with axi that no actually want to play it and know how to work with community and then we give them access to our platform and assets and they go out and find the users uh train them get uh we give them access to a wallet train them how to play the game trade use teach them how to use crypto how to keep your private keys how to not get scammed in a community environment so you have a very localized setting on how you are learning uh in your crypto journey so we do a lot of these innovations and content in the philippines where we're creating guides manuals almost like a guild operations playbook and then we kind of franchise it out to the rest of the managers and sub-dials and guilds that we work with across the world so we're primarily expanding now across the rest of southeast asia india latin america we invested in a guild in brazil we invested in a guild that helps students specifically graduate via and afford their tuition via play to earn well wait which country is that in uh they're in southeast asia as well so the companies that the guild is called akkad arena and they're focusing on bringing students to web 3 via platon wow that it's super interesting and so out of those economies or countries which ones are you finding there's kind of more uptake so the the thing about this is that the more volatile a country's currency is i think the better play to earn does so we've done extremely well in venezuela because their currency is very unstable um and from what we've heard from our scholars there people might be earning somewhere between one to fifty dollars a month so so the monthly income is a lot lower even than in the philippines but they have a crypto exchange which means that we can go in there and give people axes they can start earning slp and then turn the slp uh into their local currency and ironically i think slp is even less volatile than than their local currency [Laughter] yeah and in terms of cashing out like i know that you have built that infrastructure in the philippines but is that either being built in venezuela or has it already been built well it depends on country to country but we always look for partners that are able to help us facilitate a kind of crypto the fee up gately so mainly those are exchanges but it might be wallets it might be some of these neo banks so we always look for those kinds of partnerships in the countries we operate in so something else that yields guild games did recently was introduced the ygg token this past summer how does that work and what effect have you seen it have on your community sure so ygg itself is membership governance and ownership token so let's tackle all those three membership in that if you own ygg tokens you have access to different things that that only members of the protocol have so it starts very simply like with other people there's token gated discord channels where there are things that are only available to our players then you you're able to do to get like exclusive nfts as well so we have for example on a guild badge that you can mint from our website that is free to meant you just need to pay for gas and that gives you access to certain things within the guild so that's the idea for the guild itself is that your participation in the guild gives you greater access to things that um are not available to people who are uh who are not as participative so we have the founders coin uh we have token gated discord we have the guild badge the nft sword and shield and we'll be integrating this across the different games and protocols that we work with where you might need to have for example a certain nft uh maybe uh an uh a ygg sword for example to be able to enter a certain part of the game and then for uh for governance uh we're uh we're working towards a progressive decentralization model which means that slowly we'll kind of open up more and more parts of yg towards uh towards governance so right now we have sub-dials which are like dials under ygg that represent you know a certain number of assets in the game for example we have a ygg lok sabda which contains our land assets in the game league of kingdoms it has its own token and now there's governance there's a snapshot page against it and the players themselves are voting on how to kind of direct our assets or our guild in the game what are they gonna do with the yield when are they going to to to play the game uh how is the leadership set up so we're letting the players do that and we're gonna do this for another game splinterlands as well and uh yeah and ownership just uh think of owning a token of ydg as having a slice of all of the activities we do from the assets that we have to the activities that we're doing esports tournaments uh the fees that are being accrued from from gameplay and just one question i wanted to ask about when you were talking about how you could have a ygg sword that gives you access to you know a certain part of a game i mean since you're not creating the games themselves would it be that in conjunction with the game developers that you develop kind of a special part of the game just for people with those special ygg uh you know uh assets or whatever yeah yeah so that's the magic of uh composability in crypto which is very hard to do otherwise where i can have a game asset or an nft that i'm interested then it has utility in a game that someone else developed so for for these games that draw for that is that if they enable that functionality within their game they get our users our player community who would be interested in going to their game to check it out and this is the kind of composability that is actually very hard to do outside of crypto because it needs a lot of meetings handshakes access to each other's private databases and crypto just enables this composability wonderfully it's so cool it reminds me of um those like picket path books you know that you used to read it or i well at least i used to read as a kid because basically yeah yeah because basically what it would be like is so the author writes the book and then they have their own you know different choose your adventure endings but then you the reader could basically be like hey i have an idea for another ending and basically um kind of proposed that and and that's kind of it sort of you know reminds me of that am i right in thinking that's kind of something like that yeah it's an act of co-creation and letting players have their own stories and what that does it gives them a greater sense of ownership in the game that they're playing in the assets that they're owning and also with like the the guild specific assets that are in the game so yeah people just love it when there's kind of content in the game that's just for them yeah so okay i i think it's super fun i'm i'm not even that into games but i would i would want to do that all right so we're going to talk a little bit more about the ygd token but first a

description back to my conversation with gabby so you know as you talked about you distributed this ycg token earlier this year how did you think about how to allocate that supply i know that there's a lot that goes into you know forming like kind of a good economy and stuff like that and obviously with all these um what's the word debates in crypto about things like fair launch coins versus vc coins i'm sure there's a lot of opinions about how much you know different entities get so how did you guys think about that well uh yeah there's definitely more than one way to do tokenomics and for us we developed our tokenomics very closely with the delphi digital team you had you've had jan on your show and he designed both the axs token for axe infinity and the ygg token for yield yield games so one of the things we did actually was that we uh we set aside 45 of the total supply of the token for uh for player rewards for play to earn rewards so that our engaged player community can earn the tokens over a long period of time without needing to buy into it so you're seeing a trend in dallas now that value contribution over merely buying into a token or financial speculation and this is something that we really want to emphasize people can uh have greater ownership of the guild with actions that uh that are good for the gate itself so whether you're a community moderator you come up with a show or you're a top esports player within the guild you have the opportunity to earn ownership in yg itself without having to pay for it with money yeah well you i know that there is this like mining program so how how does that work exactly yeah so we call it a community mining program and it just means that there's a lot of different initiatives that allow you to earn the token and we we like the the team we set up initiatives where if you're in the esports team you may receive a stipend in ygg tokens if you win the tournament you may be able to earn more um if you are a community helper then you may be able to get tokens this way um so yeah so we we just try to identify the points that where people are really giving value to the community and we want to reward that and so i mean so yield guild games is also of course investing in its own tokens and so when the value of the treasury goes up is that is there any direct correlation to the value of the yield guild or the ytg token or are they just kind of separate or how does that part work i guess in the same way that you might view a balance sheet and kind of make up your mind about what a company maybe may be uh valued it's not the dire the correlation is not 100 direct like it's not i would say done from you know an algorithmic perspective but what we do is that we publish very publicly all of the assets that we own we we try to do that every quarter so it's like here we have 35 000 axes we have this many pieces of land here the tokens that we're holding and here's how much they're worth oh by the way here's all of the wallets for all of our different assets and it just gives people a very clear idea of what we do what assets we hold and it and if they can make their minds on how much that is worth right like we're not going to tell them that a token is worth a specific amount of money because that's not what the token represents for us it's about like really being uh an owner and and a participant in the guild but we we have we just publish this information as uh publicly as possible so that people can kind of derive their own assumptions on how much the guild treasury itself is worth and so we did talk earlier about how when you're choosing which games to invest in that you know you're looking at the kind of game economy or the tokenomics within that game but obviously we have all these different games that are sprouting up on different chains as well do you guys evaluate the chains like does it seem like there are certain chains that are just going to be better for gaming or in general for the ownership economy as opposed to other chains sure so every chain makes certain trade-offs right and ethereum has maximum security and programmability and that may be fine for for example artwork which is more static or collectibles that are high value and you want to secure them on a chain but it doesn't work for games because a lot of the time you need high throughput so game assets have mostly been moving to different chains such as maybe a polygon or an immutable or a bsc barcelona we don't take sides when it comes to chains as long as games work there we we we will we will go there and we bought assets in all of these different chains um i would say that the tooling side is not as built out when you leave ethereum so for example we want to have a multisig in every different chain to hold our assets and it's not just possible in all of them yet so the developer ecosystem has to be really strong for us to kind of have things like governance multi-sigs hardware wireless support in in the ecosystem outside of ethereum and so at the moment do you have any particular theories on which chains you think might emerge is particularly good for cha for um gaming or do you feel like right now it's just equal opportunity and you're open to whatever yeah it's so incredibly early i mean you've seen some take the lead such as for example a polygon or a solana but i really wouldn't count anything out at the moment so as you mentioned yield guild games is now a dow or you're transitioning to becoming a dow at the moment i don't i don't know how how decentralized you would say you are um so maybe you could answer that but then on top of that what lessons do you feel you've learned so far in terms of you know trying to go from more centralized to decentralized uh we think about this a lot and the i think there's a lot of people in crypto that uh believe for decentralization for decentralization's sake and for us we have a mission which is like in my head it's a 10 to 20 year mission that we want to build and of course the community really matters and the community's input is something that we look for but we want to decentralize around the economic aspect first meaning that we want to give as much ownership as possible to our player community if we have game assets we want them to decide how uh and when that will be played on what will do with the yield in terms of the product vision it's something that i guess the team is still kind of holding internally and it's something that will be decentralized slower over time but we want to really decentralize the economic aspect first because it what it's what brings freedom to people and then as people get freedom then they have the ability to make longer term decisions especially as we kind of imbue the community with the values that we want to bring over a long period of time values such as you know helping others us being here more for more than the money being able to help people have a better life because of access to crypto and play to earn um this is something that i think is a more long-term journey for us yeah yeah well i'm i think for a lot of these different entities that are trying to decentralize it's definitely a process so we have talked a little bit about traditional video games we are seeing that some of them are now getting into nfts you probably saw that news about is it ubisoft i don't know how they do these off so they are now creating an nft platform i did notice that they're saying that their nfts will only be cosmetic items that have no impact on gameplay and i wondered if you you know what you thought about that choice like why do you think they might have done that and do you think that's a smart move or or does it not really matter well first of all uh ubisoft is actually one have been looking at blockchain for a long time i co-founded the blockchain game alliance with different people in the crypto and gaming industry and uh nicholas of uh ubisoft was one of the founding board members so he's been looking at this for a very long time the the biggest challenge if you're an established company is that you you risk upsetting your current player base or your user base um over something that you might do that may be innovative and you're seeing this happen a lot with nfts where for example adobe is introducing a way to mint nfts and then there's a lot of backlash or deviant art was going to add support for nfts got a lot of backlash and there's just a lot of backlash in general in crypto and nfts among i would say kind of the general consumer market and the way to do this if you're a forward-thinking company like ubisoft is to kind of very lightly touch it in the products that you have first and get your existing customer base to get used to it before you do more of the kind of uh i guess stuff that has more utility so i think this is the track that we're taking they just they chose tezos as the chain which is a proof of stake chain and it shows that they're very conscious of the environmental concerns that people have on crypto and proof of work chains in general um so i think it's a very measured move um for them i know that they're capable of doing a lot more but there's also the notion of bringing your user base with you on this journey and when you talked about the backlash was it due to environmental concerns well a lot of it at the surface looks like environmental concerns i think people are generally or generally don't like things that they don't understand that are new we saw this with new technology free to play games even people thinking internet was a fad 20 years ago it's just a natural cycle of things where if you introduce a concept that is kind of hard to understand and you've seen this lore in crypto right from your entire journey i think this is just an extension of it where if you don't understand it it's easier to hate it than to really kind of try to wrap your head around it but once you do then you go out like you go down the rabbit hole pretty deep yeah well at least you and i did um so for a centralized company like that i just wondered how you thought the you know the fact that nfts enable you to take ownership of your game assets how do you think that will affect those platforms because you know i i guess what it would likely mean is that it gives their users more ability to kind of leave those platforms or you tell me i i don't know that's just what i was thinking so how do you think this will affect centralized video game platforms so i think this will go towards the greater trend of going back to open versus close platforms the web start with very open standards and in the last 15 years we've seen closed platforms like uh a facebook or a google but also in video game ecosystems they all work within their own ecosystem and there's no such thing as kind of like items from a game jumping to another game so i think you need to have a very different mindset in designing these open worlds where you have assets that can jump from game to game but the reason that all of these big game companies are paying attention now is actually because of axe infinity because coming out of seemingly nowhere axias jump to a multi-billion dollar valuation i think their token is probably trade is doing a 20 to 30 billion fdv and it's making like 20 30 million dollars on their marketplace every single day and ultimately that's what gets these big companies to pay attention is that like yeah axi is now one of the largest games in the world and they're doing it with a new model that is not has not been possible and these companies never figured out before so something that you have talked about in other interviews is that earlier before you found crypto when you were trying to create your own gaming studio in the philippines then you felt that creating your own intellectual property in the philippines was difficult can you talk a little bit more about why that was at that time and how you think crypto could potentially change that yeah one of the things that really frustrated me was that there are certain industry norms of you know if you come from a certain place like maybe hollywood you're the ones that are creating the value or the ip and if you come from a certain place like for example the philippines you're kind of the back office or the execution office where just the work gets sent out to by the people who are creating the ideas and you just get to do them and that has been incredibly frustrating for me because i didn't just want to make games that other people thought of i wanted to make my own game ip so that's actually what led to me co-founding uh the game studio altitude games in 2014 and the amazing thing about crypto is that it just democratizes access to markets around the world so you see this for example in uh in crypto art where you might not even know where an artist is because they're anonymous they might just look like a frog on the internet but their work is amazing and they get a lot of value people pay like tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars for art for an artist they've never known pak who is probably one of the best-selling um living artists in the world just sold this last collection for i think over 90 million dollars they don't even know where he or she is from and i think that's just incredibly democratizing and this is one of the things that i love the most about crypto yeah so i actually want you to elaborate on that a little bit because so as you know you said people often talk about how this technology could democratize finance but i'm sure you're aware that there are a lot of critics that say that actually crypto shows that it's just making already wealthy people richer so i was curious yeah to just hear more i'm just wondering do you think that this uh playing field is being leveled in a global way or is it just like within each local kind of uh geographical area or how do you i absolutely do think that uh crypto is leveling the playing field all across the world and i think that people who are kind of criticizing it that the rich are getting richer are just looking at like the top level news and not really looking into communities of lives being changed because i can offer up stories or personal connections of artists who are now self-sovereign meaning that they can do whatever they want because of the art they've sold in crypto because they know they now know how to manage their own money um of people in our player community who are basically gamers ordinary people whose lives were saved and they're able to build better lives for themselves so this kind of uh participation to have ownership in a network is for anyone across the world where you don't even have to divulge your real name or what country you're from um it's it's just amazing and there's just so many stories of this around the world and people sometimes are just honestly not looking hard enough so let's talk a little bit about how you think the nature of work is going to change in the future i've seen you tweet about job openings in the metaverse um so yeah tell me yeah how you think all this will change how people earn in the future or or how they're already earning so honestly i think the i work for one company 95 is dead of course it's still around but the model is already dead what we're seeing is that if you can come in participate in a network or a dow and earn ownership instead of just fees for example then it enables you to create a lot of value and participate in upside by doing something that only you uniquely can do and this enables you to do a lot of different things like we're already seeing streamers content creators who have who are playing on like five different phones at the same time because they may be playing axi and then they run out of energy here they're managing their land there they're they're in a different dial somewhere else and this is i think going to be more of the nature of work where a lot more people will be self-sovereign they may have specific skill sets that they're doing participating in two three four five dows owning your own nfd assets uh yeah i think this is where people are going the future where you're really honing your unique creative talents and finding a way to not just get paid for them but also gain ownership of what you're creating and the protocols that you're interacting with and in terms of like you know when you tweeted about the new job openings what are some new jobs that will exist in the metaverse or that do exist in the metaverse that did not previously exist for example a good friend of mine is the best land broker in axi infinity um so yeah so there's a virtual land broker there are people who are now virtual fashion designers who are creating clothes for avatars and they don't even uh do this for i guess physical clothing um there are people who uh are creating cars in uh in the middle verse and a lot of content so these are just some examples and it just endlessly fascinates me because um we're kind of recreating the nature of work but we're doing it in a very global level and we're not beholden to kind of physical i guess the laws of physics in the real world which means you know i can design a kind of a city in the sky and populate it and have people uh go there the creativity that people are just bringing um into into the metaverse is astounding and can you expound a little bit on what the land broker does because i guess i would have thought that in a virtual world it would be maybe more similar to an open c type situation or like a smart contract you just make a bid and then you know you don't have to deal with humans so i'm kind of surprised yeah what do they do exactly well openc does exist but the virtual land broker has relationships with the whales the big large owners in for example the central lander and axia infiniti that may not necessarily have listed their lands for sale and then when a new buyer comes in and they don't want to tip their hand on the market of how much they have or they're looking for something specific they need someone with deep domain knowledge in the field so that's that's why specialists brokers exist because they have the relationships and they can kind of route people who are finding each other who mean who may not necessarily want to be public about buying or selling something okay yeah well immediately when you said that they have access to whales i was like oh oh of course of course this is not just you know any old regular land i guess that people are buying um so um so speaking of uh you know high-end things you might be buying i noticed that you are an avid nft art collector and i'm sure you're aware at this moment there's i mean this space is so new and so it's kind of confusing to figure out like you know what's going to have value in the future are you buying for investment are you buying for enjoyment and if for investment then how do you kind of figure out what makes a good nft investment okay so the thing is about nfts that is very counterintuitive is that the way to make money in it is to buy the stuff you love right so i only really buy nft art that i enjoy i i like to think myself sometimes as like an angel investor to up-and-coming uh nft artists and the way that i invest in them is to buy their art and hold them for a long period of time and kind of help them gain more exposure to other collectors and the reason it's really important to buy the nfts that you love is that if it goes down to zero it's not worth anything or you can't sell it at least you still love it and it's in your wallet but if you buy something that you love and other people like it for example like aboard apes then it starts to gain financial value and that's how you make money so you have to be incredibly patient in nfts and be willing to sit on these pictures on your wallet for a long time and maybe some of them will be incredibly valuable one day maybe they won't but yeah if you if you love them and other people do then there's a good chance you might be able to make money on them and out of curiosity were you interested in art before the nft art movement took off or did this get you interested in art not in the same way like i don't really have a background in kind of classical art i deal with art because i work in video games and i work with a lot of artists and a lot of the art that's popular in uh in crypto are kind of the the same kind of art maybe fantasy science fiction that is kind of popular with the collector set because a lot like crypto people are just huge nerds and they they buy the art that they like so it's not kind of the same when you're buying a lot of contemporary artists of course that's happening now but it's actually opened up the field to artists that may never have been able to display their art in a in a museum or a gallery but people are buying their nfts all right so we're gonna switch back to games um obviously as we've discussed the most well-known play-to-earn game as axiomfinity but what other play to earn games are you interested in and or do you think will take off in the next year or so sure so we've invested in assets in over 15 games at this point and we like them all but i guess i'll name some um guild of guardians is something that we're pretty interested in it's a kind of diablo-ish like action rpg uh yeah that that is very exciting amber sword is going to be kind of a full like fantasy massively multiplayer game yeah we're very excited about that and on a lot of land in that game as well games like cipher cyborg which is 3v3s uh soccer um this is something it's a 3v3 uh it's a cyborg it's like a three three versus three soccer so it's like axe infinity but you're playing soccer against each other but but yeah there's just so many different games coming out and that kind of variety is great because some people may not like the gameplay of axi even though it's a good game so they can find another game that suits them that they can be good at and are you finding that these creators are from across the world and that they're not in the traditional um areas that you know as you said earlier are the ones that have been the game creators oh yeah absolutely like i think it's really opened up where we are seeing teams from all across like vietnam is pretty strong there are teams in china there's of course a lot of teams in like the la but what we're also seeing is that a lot more of these teams are more remote and global as well and this is a trend that's been kind of blown up since kovitz started where people realize we actually don't have to be in the same office to get stuff done so more and more even though parts of the team for example like ygg a lot of the kind of core community members and the founders are from the philippines but we consider ourselves a global community a global network as well all right so this is coming out at the end of 2021 do you want to make any predictions for 2022 in terms of either nfts or blockchain based games okay so wow for for 2022 i think we're probably going to see over 10 million people playing a blockchain based game every day um yeah we'll see when this happens but i think it's going to happen next year oh okay all right well we'll have to check back where can people learn more about you and yield guild games sure so uh discord dot gg slash ygg is where the core community lives if you want to read more about uh articles about us you go to our medium page healdia.media.com or the website yogill.io and you can find us on twitter twitter.com heal guild and lastly we have an 18 minute documentary called play to earn on youtube that uh documents the the initial community members in the philippines that found axe infinity and started playing the game as a way to escape poverty during the covet lockdown late last year so yeah just go to youtube and look for the player and documentary there yeah and for those of you who may recall the director i believe leah callan i'm just blanking on her last name right yep um she was on the show and so you can i will put that in the show notes so people can check that out all right gabby thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you so much lara thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about gabby and you'll games check out the show notes for this
