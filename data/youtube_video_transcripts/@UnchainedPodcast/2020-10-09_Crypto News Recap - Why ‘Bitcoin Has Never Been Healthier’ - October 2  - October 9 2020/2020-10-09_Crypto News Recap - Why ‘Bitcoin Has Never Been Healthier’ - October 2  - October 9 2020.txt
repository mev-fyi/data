twitter thread mercedes suggests that while historically anonymous teams in crypto are viewed as a risk he says that now identity is an attack vector and that the future lies in embracing decentralization and pseudonymous on-chain reputation without relying on the legal system and social capital next headline 60 employees have taken coinbase's severance package so far in a blog post published thursday coinbase ceo brian armstrong revealed that five percent of coinbase's 1200 employees had so far accepted the severance package offered to those who disagreed with his recently updated mission statement that coinbase was an a political company although the deadline to take the severance was wednesday armstrong said the number would be higher after the company completes several other conversations he wrote it was reassuring to see that people from underrepresented groups of coinbase have not taken the exit passage in numbers disproportionate to the overall population

workplace this company is not for you next headline not ethereum 2.0 but ethereum 1.5 and a post on the fellowship of ethereum magicians forum ethereum creator vitalik buterin noted that ethereum may scale in an unexpected way according to the ethereum 2.0 roadmap scaling for applications is still years away however scaling is already in test net for a number of layer 2 scaling options such as roll-ups plasma and state channels making those a more viable near and mid-term solution this leads him to say that some popular apps use data and applications live entirely on layer 1 such as the ethereum name system should be adapted to have their data such as accounts balances and assets move to layer 2. his conclusion is that if everyone moves to roll-ups then that makes phase two of the transition to ethereum 2.0 obsolete and so ethereum may instead be a quote single high single high security execution shard that everyone processes plus a scalable data availability layer he writes quote this implies a phase 1.5 and done approach to eth2 as quote by that point it will be easier to continue down that path than to try to bring everyone back to the base chain for no clear benefit and a 20 to 100x reduction in scalability whether or not ethereum goes down this path remains to be seen but one other interesting comment he made in his somewhat technical post is that focusing on rollups will leave more space for layer 2 protocols that can fund their own development with their own tokens next headline doj publishes cryptocurrency enforcement framework on thursday the

already in the early stages of moving to phase 3.0 which he believes will be more capital efficient bridging centralized markets with the ever-growing number of d5 markets he says that d phi is disrupting centralized exchanges but that throughput and high gas fees remain barriers to full-blown defy adoption he believes that as layer 2 solutions come to fruition we can expect to see the convergence of decentralized and centralized finance this intersection of d5 and c5 will result in better d5 interfaces institutional support and an attempt by major centralized exchanges to capitalize on cd5 or centralized decentralized finance next headline the growth in d5 in charts the block research has compiled 37 different charts that analyze various metrics across d5 projects the
