whether you're looking for a simple Fiat on ramp or leveraged options trading Kraken is the place for you my guests for today our dog hood deputy director of the monetary and capital markets Department of the IMF and Yin Liu assistant general counsel at the legal department of the IMF welcome dong in Yin thank you let's start with a basic question what does the IMF do okay so that's that's a easy one I think the IMF International Monetary Fund it's basically a multinational organization we are member based organization we have 189 members consisting of government governments of the countries we promote International Financial money and monetary stability so that's basically the function of the IMF we were founded in 1944 so we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary this year actually as part of the Bretton Woods system and there's one thing I want to add which is before the show a dong and Yin explained to me that the views expressed during this interview are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF so if part of the mission of the IMF is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system how has the advent of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies affected the imf's activities thus far well you know this is an exciting time we are seeing a lot of changes in the technological space I wouldn't say it has changed our work so far but you know we are interested in understanding what these technologies are the implications for the financial systems you know in our member countries and eventually how that's going to affect the international monetary landscape so I think this is just the beginning and we are still in the learning mode so were very interested in the issues that are going to that are going to shape the financial systems across the globe I just want to add things many of our countries member countries are very interesting this issue and we are you know complicated in a sense to really understand the implications so that we can provide policy advice and technical assistance to our member countries in this area yeah and I actually wanted to ask a little bit more about that yen because the main ways in which the IMF works with the member countries I believe is through the central banks and so let's before we get even more into watching technologies and digital currencies can you just explain what the main ways are in which central banks can influence the economies of their countries I think well who they're our counterparts are central banks but in terms of our mandate we look beyond just what central banks you know banks do it also look at our countries you know over economic policies and also their financial sector policies to make sure that you know overall the global international system or you know global financial stability will be maintained so we we are engaging with central banks and other entities within a country through our normal surveillance activities which is usually take the forms of Adyar health check-up we called article for consultation also we have other instruments like a financial sector assessment programs we also provide financing to our country through the adjustment program and Carmindy we also engage with central banks and other agencies in the country and finally we provide as a measure more technical assistance to help central banks strengthen their institutional frameworks and also guide them in terms of the international best practices and also on the policy matters so Laura I guess your quest is also about how central bank's affect their own economies right that's the question you had I see basically central bank's the institution the government institution a particularly colleague that issues the currency of that country right so when we talk about the Federal Reserve's I know the dollar cash knows we carry around issued by the Federal Reserve as the central bank of the United States so that's the very basic function of the central bank of course central bank current monetary policy and monetary policy affects the stability of the US dollar as a unit of account all the economic activities here in the US you know are denominated in dollars and that dollar unit of account is really defined by by the Federal Reserve as the central bank does that answer your question yeah yeah and I also wanted to talk about some of the mechanisms that they use like for instance commercial banks as far as I understand at least in the US are pretty central to the way the Federal Reserve manages the money supply here and I wanted to know if that was the case for all central banks that you know in those countries commercial banks also play a key role yes indeed so said the central bank in all countries basically the bank of the commercial banks so we have a modern banking system to have this two-tier structure right the commercial banks provide deposits which are redeemable at par with the central bank liability one to one and the central bank is at the pinnacle of this pyramid you could say so the central bank is the bank on the commercial banks and you know there are various ways for the central bank to use either the prize or quantities of money in the particularly economy so that's that's basically how the system is set up so let's in again you know the topic for today is central bank digital currencies but I feel like it's kind of useful to talk about some existing types of money so let's talk about cash for a little bit what role does casually in a central bank's ability to manage its economy so cash is one component or what we call base money of a particularly economy so the base money is the liability of the central bank it has two components why is cash the other one is reserves kept by commercial banks as I said earlier commercial banks also issue liabilities in the form of deposits right you and I keep our deposits with commercial banks and these deposits are part of the broader monetary system so these are these are also money but these are commercial bank money is not central bank money so central bank money is composed of two components Weis cash the otherwise commercial bank reserves and a commercial bank money is in the form of deposits that's the public cheap wisdom and these are redeemable one to one this commercial bank money is at par with central bank that's the unit of account basically one dollar is one donor so you can you can convert your one dollar deposit in a commercial bank to a one dollar cash provided by Federal Reserve so cash is becoming less used kind of broadly and in that you know this is kind of maybe a function of everything becoming more digital so what is the role for cash or some kind of cash like form of money in the digital age right that's a very good question so globally we have seen very fast ization digitization payments in some economies but it's not necessarily at the same pace in some economies people still use a lot of cash like in Japan but in Sweden you know Cassius has really declined very fast and they're looking forward I think the digital age the demand for cash is likely to decline now cash has certain advantages let me give you an example when you buy a cup of coffee in Starbucks let's say you can you can pay you with cash you just pass a five dollar bill to the cashier and the bad transaction is very efficient in the sense that it's settled it's clear the descent of the instantaneously and also there was a feature that the cashier doesn't have to know who you are she he he or she doesn't have to know the buyers flourishing and you don't have to know who the the cashier is but the other way to pay for coffee is to swipe your credit card now that is a very different payment instrument because you know for that transaction to de settle the finally in the sense that for your bank balance to be debited and for the fodder starbug accounted to be credited it has to be backed by a whole infrastructure so there are banks involved and he takes some time for that transaction to be set up so there are various ways to make payments so there are in the different features attached to each payment instrument now cash also has its disadvantage if we are in different places like you are in let's say travelling in Peru I'm here in the United States thanks very hard for us to give cash to each other too you know so you have to make payments remotely and then cash is not not very convenient then in the bank transfers credit cards would it would be much more convenient so these different instruments have has own their own features you could say strengthen the weaknesses depends on the use of you know what sort of transactions we have we are conducting so let's talk about central bank digital currency you know I've been seeing the IMF has been talking about this and releasing some reports and articles but let's define that what what do you really mean and when you're talking about central bank digital currency so central bank digital currency is basically a digital version of central bank liability which is a widely accessible as I explained earlier the only widely accessible part of the central bank money at the moment is cash right and you know the other part is commercial bank reserves kept by commercial banks so when we think about creating a central bank digital currency you and I will be able to hold sent that central bank money digitally for example in our iPhone if so if it's more like digital cash it's really like digital cash at the moment when we think about the cash that's the only way that in the public can hold central bank money so if we have a central bank a digital currency then we can also hold the central bank money digital form in addition to or instead of holding cash so that's that's one one way to think about this and is that created using blockchain technology or is or can it be created with any other type of technology it doesn't have to be blocked in technology I think this idea itself is technology neutral so you can have more centralized a way of doing this for something a central bank itself is this you know it's the usual so in contrast to Bitcoin for example when new coins and a mind were minted it's a decentralized process on the blockchain central bank digital currently doesn't have to be on the decentralized blockchain it can be issued actually it's it's probably at this stage it makes more sense for the central bank to central control the issuance of the central bank digital currency and at this point why is the IMF interested in central bank digital currencies and what level of interest are you seeing from your member countries that's a they are a good question because as I said the central bank the central banks are in charge of maintaining price stability in importing economies so they are interested and of course the IMF is also interested in ensuring high stability so if in the digital age if a private digital currencies are developed if there's less demand for central bank digital cards for central bank accounts and for example if there is cash is cash is no longer used for economic transactions then you know it's this the public will have no interface or no interactions with the central bank the central bank you will also have more difficulty in influencing monetary conditions in the economy in the sense that particularly in the case that if there are alternative private currencies that are developed in the different unit of account so that would make the central bank's job of maintaining price stability countries much more difficult so we think that you know it's important for the central bank to be engaged to stay in the game in that ister age and that would help the central bank achieve their mandate of maintaining price stability even in the digital age here to answer your second question several central banks in both advanced and emerging market and developing countries are considering the pros and cons of assuring the CBD see for instance Australia Brazil China Denmark Philippines just to give you a few examples and they are really looking very carefully at you know whether it makes sense to issue CDC so I think this is really a topic that really raised a lot of awareness and also you know interest among a membership so earlier we talked about how the central bank is kind of the top of the pyramid it's sort of this lender of last resort and then they work with the commercial banks to influence the economy to increase or decrease the monetary supply so when you introduce a central bank digital currency how does that process change you mean how does the money supply process change yeah I see it doesn't alter that mechanism fundamentally is just another home of central bank liabilities so but nowhere to me research yes well I thought that there was some thinking that it could potentially sort of reduce the role for commercial banks and you know people could kind of just have accounts directly with the central bank so in that sense I see yes yeah that's that's a very good question I think that depends on the design of the central bank digital currency and you know basically we can talk about - you know conceptually speaking work and to talk about two types of central bank digital currency one is a value based or token based is a bit like an object right when you like a token cash is such a type in the sense that what matters is the valley or the was anticipatorily or the object itself and otherwise and that so-called act and paste or claim based money like our bank account our deposits so if you design the central bank digital currency more like cash it's like digital cash and then that doesn't affect the demand for deposits as much on the other hand if you design the central bank leads to currency or like a substitute for commercial bank deposits that would probably affect how we value commercial bank deposits so some of us might move our deposits to the central bank 0 that is much safer to keep deposits directly with with the with the central bank but of course there are different considerations why is that whether you pay interest on this deposit so if you if there's no interest then you wouldn't want to give up the interest you earn on a commercial bank deposit the other thing is that if it's if there's Deposit Insurance then you wouldn't worry about the credit risks or you wouldn't worry about losing that deposit with the commercial bank so you don't necessarily although the interest you earn and both the deposit to the central bank so you know this visa these are the options or design features we have to bear in mind when we desire the central bank digital currency so it's not a uniform impact talking about and we talked about how there are different designs etc for the ways these central bank digital currencies might be issued and I was wondering our central bank's already structured in a way where they can they can issue central bank digital currencies like do existing Central Bank laws allow for that or are there other considerations that need to happen before such currencies could be issued yeah I think really depends on our whether it is and eight to issue the digital currency and also whether they are allowed to do so as their existing central banking law so maybe I just take one step back like what is a mandate and why it's important you know for a central bank is mandate is the reason why it exists and basically a central bank is established for certain purposes and also to discharge certain responsibilities and this purpose and responsibilities are usually explicitly set forth the central banking law and in some countries as bad a fact this could be enshrined in their constitutional law so central banks are really in a way a limited in what they can do based on the specified responsibilities and mandates and difference and central banks have different central banking laws and but there are few general principle which don't explain for instance they can issue currency right they can really set up account but under the existing central banking law general speaking the the currency when they meant currency they're written in bank notes and cash so the digital currency was not considered at the time when Thea existing central banking law was designed so in many many countries we haven't really looked at all their countries central banking law but I think the general speaking the central banks do need to invent I modified their central bank laws the order to provide a very cleaner and certain legal basis for ensuring the digital currency I also want I I read a speech that Christine Lagarde the I guess I don't know if she's still currently the managing director of the IMF but she's at least the outgoing if if if not former managing director of the IMF and she talked about how a central bank digital currency could help bring about greater financial inclusion can you describe how that works right so for example at the moment we still have more than a billion people in the world who are unbanked in the sense that they don't have a bank account so if you want to have a deposit held with a commercial bank to use that you know for payments you need to be banked you need to have you need to have an account with the bank but the cash you know cash is is an instrument that does not require a bank account so in a lot of the unbanked people in the in the world you know they hold cash but it's very expensive right it's also difficult to store it's you know you can easily lose it it's also very expensive for countries they have to spend a lot of money maintaining the hygiene of the cash nodes you know to replace them once in a while to distribute them to secure the de storage so it's a very expensive means of holding the currency now digital cash will make it much easier for these people to to to have access to a means of payments you know in Africa a lot of unbanked people they can keep their cash in in a mobile account and you know that's so it does not necessarily require a bank account you can you can get the stage to cash you know through the mobile phone companies through post offices so that would help these people make economic transactions now in the in the future if these services payment services can be linked with other type of services through these the mobile apps then they can be incentivized to save to you know invest and that will enhance economic efficiency tremendously I think that's one way to think about it but I think at the same time we should also bear in mind that this type of you know virtual currency digital currencies could raise some financial integrity concerns so it's quite important to really strike a proper balance you know right between you know the reaping the benefits to support financial inclusion and the need to safeguard the financial integrity to make sure that they will not be abused by the criminals I think that's really a very important consideration for policy makers when they designing the CBBC you know one way to think about is that you know these days when we you know when central bank's the issue cash the denominations are not necessarily huge rather you can you cannot have a US dollar that you know that's nominated more than five hundred dollars let's say if the largest denomination is $100 so one consideration was in central banks design the denominations of cash notes is that they don't want to create too much convenience for illicit use of of cash notes so when you move to the digital world we have digital cash you have to think what is the amount of anonymity that should be allowed in the use of the of the digital tokens or digital cash so that you need to strike a balance but there are also ways technology Co ways to track the usage of this to cash to ensure that your financial integrity is not compromised that's another way so I think yeah when I referred to a financial tagger I really mean the money laundering and terrorist financing risks how to really manage this risk in order to really safeguard the financial system where at the same time really allowing more access you know to the financial services by millions of people and how do you do that without it being like a totally surveilled system like how do you manage you know privacy against those concerns yeah I think that is a very good question I think that's what don't were saying that there are no panacea right now but I think you know is important to really strike this balance and using the technologists as a donor saying that you know you probably can impose some strict limits on the size of the transaction and you can also use the technology to facilitate effective identity authentification and also tracking of the payments and transfer this technology can really help either central bank or any source entities to ensure that the AML measures are compliant because that's even yeah the requirement that each institution like central bank needs to comply with but I do think that old especially I think that can be helpful but they really need some further evaluation to really make sure there in fact is to address these concerns we're gonna keep discussing this in a moment because actually Christine Lagarde actually wrote or or gave a speech where she outlined a scenario like this so I'll talk about that in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's episode is brought to you by Kraken Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets with all

cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trees is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWC fruit-trees comm / keep crypto clean back to my conversation with Yin Liu and dongja of the IMF so the speech that I referenced earlier in which Christine Lagarde sort of outlined a scenario in which the concerns of privacy versus you know and team money laundering and terrorist financing could be balanced was she said that central bank central banks could design digital currency in a way where users identities would be authenticated through customer due diligence procedures so I'm not sure and then she and transactions recorded so I'm not sure exactly what that looks like so maybe you can describe that in a second but let me keep going and then she said however identities would not be disclosed to third parties or governments unless required by law so she had this example where let's say that somehow credit score companies or you know other companies figure out that if you're the kind of person who purchases frozen pizza and beer then you maybe are a higher risk a higher risk borrower or something like that so she would say so if you do go to the grocery and purchase a frozen pizza and beer then the supermarket the bank and marketers wouldn't have a way of knowing who you were or you know wouldn't maybe know what you bought but at the same time anti money laundering and terrorist financial controls could run in the background and then if there was any suspicion about you or your transaction then there there would be this veil of anonymity that could be lifted so can you just describe how that works like I you know I understand the words that she was using but it's just like on a detailed level like how how does you know what order all the different actors that need to be set up in place and what are the processes you know to make this possible okay so um basically the Financial Action Task Force which is the international standard setter they set the intent wandering and terrorist financing standard you know for all countries I think one key requirement is called customer due diligence which basically requires for example the one who talked about the commercial banks and other entities that are involved in the transaction with either cash credit cards they will basically set up a very robust monitoring system to see some suspicious transaction in your example is somebody engaged in a transaction using for instance you know a drug proceeds and if they have a proper system set in place they can trace the the proceeds are used to you know in this transaction they have an obligation not only to monitor that transaction but also report that suspicious transaction to a relevant authorities and that authorities will take certain actions that may be through further analysis and they will take further actions to trace the proceeds and to the extent you know the proceeds are really identified as coming from a suspicious or a source and they could suspend the transaction that can also you know pink other action creases impose certain sanctions on the the ambulance by commercial banks so this whole sort of the the process you know University for work basically saying commercial banks were you know out the other entities you need to ask questions you need to really ask the person who gave you the cash you know where the cash comes from and if that's a legitimate source or I found the original source and then based on that actor provided by the commercial bank the authorities can take certain actions so that's sort of the normal customer due diligence requirements when we talk about cash is very difficult to retrace as don't mentioned because of the anonymity I think when you use the mobile money and you use for instance your central bank you know digital currency to the extent you use certain technology like this it's tributed ledger you're able to record the whole transaction and you sort of getting a better understanding of the where the money's coming from that really can help you in terms of investigating monitoring and also reporting the cases having said that I do think that as I mentioned before this technology still need to be evaluated because ultimately we need to know the beneficial owner of the money really the ultimate owner of the of the money that get into the other transaction and distributed latter not necessarily helps you really identify the ultimate owner of particular funds or particular you know you know credit where money so that's something you have to look at but I do think that technology offers some promises in terms of you know facilitating the monitoring investigation and reporting by the commercial banks and other entities involved in the transaction so there's a mortise to supplement what what--yeah has said I think you know Wayne technology is going to give us more options to think about these issues or to strike a better balance because you know SX cash is completely anonymous then that creates a lot of difficulties for law enforcement on the other hand in the digital world you don't want to be totally transparent either right privacy is something that we value so you know what christine lagarde mentioned is that you don't want I don't want to have a necessarily customer profiling because if people can tell you tell that you are buying certain products you're a type of person then you know you're at the prices to offer you the type of products they offer you would be somehow dependent on that type of profile that's not necessarily ideal so in the digital age you don't necessarily you necessarily want to have everything that's visible that's transparent so we still value privacy so technology actually offers the potential for us to customize different degrees of privacy you know you don't necessarily have to have a centralized database that has everything you can we review your entitlements for certain things for example you've you walk into a wine store you just need to prove that you are over 18 years old or 25 years old and the store still doesn't have to know your name every time when you make a payment so these are all the technologies that are going to be possible in the digital world so it's only bad as a matter of public policy we need to strike a balance at which circumstances we want to we want to know who is behind the transaction more than other types of situations so I think technology is really very exciting because it allows us to to have this kind of flexibility I just add that you know under the current AML CFT standard this flexibility is already provided there because we are applying a risk-based approach so basically you need to really design the AML safety measures based on the level of risks so in Dawn's example if you go to a store you just pay $50 to buy y-you know the level of risk is not that high compared to use $500,000 to buy a piece of real estate right so the spend already allows the countries to tailor their AML safety measures like the customer due diligence requirements to the level of risk so in some situation you should ask the risk and some quite you know scenarios you don't really need to ask questions so I think you know combined with the technology and combined with the risk based approach I think we should be able to design a very balanced approach that addressed you know the issue of privacy and also financial and integrity concerns and just so I understand from what you were describing earlier essentially there will be transactions that are more similar to cash that happened digitally meaning that I could meet somebody and for whatever reason this person and I you know maybe I send them money or or they send me money and then and that would be very similar to if we met in person and I handed them a $20 bill and that or they handed me one but then when you were saying that there would also be customer due diligence maybe like a transaction or two away from that transaction I might be interacting with someone where they would know who I am like a bank or you know some other kind of institution and then so if for whatever reason there was ever suspicion about what I was doing then you could maybe kind of reconstruct who else I was transacting with for any transactions where it wasn't with an institution that knows who I am is that kind of what you were describing earlier yes very close I think basically after saying that if you transact with somebody threatening for instance if you transfer fifty thousand dollars to your relatives in another country I think that you know the bank depending on their limit you know under their policy they may ask you to fill out a form right so if you ask you what is the purpose of the transfer and maybe they even ask you will you get the money and so you submit this form to the bank and the bank based on their internal control system they will verify you know the your responses and what to the extent they're satisfied you know with the accuracy were there's sufficiency of your information they will make the transfer but to the extent they are not they may either ask you for more information or they will not really make the transfer so that's really sort of the normal procedure for customer due diligence and let's also now then talk a little bit about the other area of money that has been burgeoning I guess is the word which is no assets and dong you wrote a really fascinating article on how crypto assets could one day reduce the demand for central bank money and the way you started article you kind of describe some of the general benefits of crypto assets over central bank money can you describe what you think those advantages are so as I mentioned earlier there are different types of payment instruments right you know cash versus bank deposit and you know depending on the characteristics of this particular payment instrument the information requirement is very different so potentially cryptocurrencies can make it very efficient for payments to take place in different locations for example we have had a lot of pain points in cross-border payments you know that it's very expensive it's slow it's not transparent once you send remittances you don't know where they are is very difficult to trace so some of the payment services based on cryptocurrencies can make this process very efficient you know it takes seconds or minutes for the remittances or cross-border payments to to happen now at the moment of course we know that cryptocurrencies are cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile so this is where really the advantage of central bank money has in the sense that you know modern central bank lunch policy is based on the economic science so central bankers for example the monetary policy committee members they make monetary policy by looking at how the economy functions they look at various shocks that are hitting the economy like a trade wars you know maybe even earthquakes so they see how the economy might be hit by these shocks and they respond by changing monetary policy spans like lower interest rate or if the inflationary pressures are going up they can tighten monetary policy so you have a forward-looking monetary policy making that that allows central banks to maintain the stability of the of the unit of account of the currency and that's you know where the cryptocurrencies have not being able to do they have you know value of these cryptocurrencies fluctuates very widely and they do not provide the stability that a currency really needs for economic transactions to happen very efficient and so that's that's really important because even for modern economies to to function properly we need to have price stability but on the other hand as a muse of payment you know cryptocurrencies have some of the features that are very easy they are very connected with the digital lives particularly of young people right you can on social platforms or apps on your songs you can you can use these currencies very easily so that's why I said early in the beginning that in the central banks they need to stay in again they also need to make their currencies very easy to use for in the digital age that's the note the central bank digital currencies one one way to make that happen and another part of the article that I found really interesting was you said that if people adopted crypto assets that could prompt a shift from credit money to commodity money what does that mean exactly so modern monetary system was banking system in the money is created by on credit relationships right so central bank money is the for example cash is a liability of the central bank or commercial bank deposit is a liability of the commercial bank these are based on claims or credit relationships where as commodity money is not liability of any anybody gold for example is a commodity money it's not it's no longer really serves any military function but you know traditionally in the code for example in the old age in code standard in a code was used as as as as a currency but it's not it was not the liability of anybody now if you think about what the crypto currencies like Bitcoin bitcoin is not liability of anybody so that's a type of commodity money if that's you know it serves some military function so you could envisage in the future there will be multiple private cryptocurrencies or commodity monies being created and they could be denominated in different unit of accounts so that's not necessarily a desirable situation because you know money is really a very important utility that the government should provide to ensure that the economy's functions very well we need to have price stability so if you have a lot of currencies competing and also in payment he caught you can economic so we have the so-called economies of scale so you may end up with a couple of private cryptocurrencies dominating the the payment landscape and it behaves as a monopolies so you don't that's not necessarily a very ideal situation so we need to have a central bank that's the monopoly issuer of the ego tender or the fiat currency and that can maintain price stability which is really for the benefit of the whole of the economy and one other piece of this that I wanted to ask about was you mention that if crypto assets become more widely adopted and you know the scenario that you I don't know you just outlined that could cause central bank money to no longer be the main unit count and then you said that that could make central bank monetary policy irrelevant and a good a good analogy as dollarization in developing economies so can you describe what happens there when a developing economy does undergo dollarization and how you think that would play out if crypto assets became more dominant so you female in the country that's highly polarized it's not only that citizens hold a lot of fair deposits in donnas they also denominates their transactions in dollars so instead of you know paying wages or paying wages in local currency or the prices quoted in local currency if you have a big chunk of the economy like 30 percent that you know the prices are actually denominated in u.s. dollars so even if it's not the United States you would still buy pizza for two dollars instead of let's say you know a hundred local currency units then of course then it's very hard for the central bank of that particular country to influence the inflation level or to insure price stability of that country because a lot of economic activities are outside the scope of their influence they were they they are now denominated in foreign currency so you can imagine that if a lot of the economic activities are instead of denominated in the fiat currency they are denominated in cryptocurrencies the it's very hard for the public authority like the central bank to ensure price stability in that economy so that's that's really what I meant earlier and so do you think that that's what governments should try to do to try to kind of I don't know if prevent is the word but stall the adoption of crypto assets like is there I'm sure most of my audience probably would love to see more adoption so I'm just curious is this something where for the IMF and the different central bank's that for them it's it would be definitely you know something that they should try to prevent so it really depends on the the specific country circumstances no I think across the IMF membership we have control authorities reacting differently right some countries have banned the use or development of cryptocurrencies others you know have ecosystems or laws that allow them to to to be developed but you know you want to have other regulation to ensure for example financial integrity is not compromised in that they should pay taxes you know that's be not some of the basic requirements that would would pre ensure let's say a level playing field I mean I think the basic premise here is really that a currency a fiat currency that's properly managed that has monetary policy that's based on economic science that is really for the best path for the good of the majority of the population right that's something desirable as I mentioned earlier that you know economies cannot be left alone without manager policy because we know that you know in the market economy if you don't have a public authority like the central bank who manages either the price or the quantities of money then the economies tend to fluctuate a lot you have you have financial stability problems you have business cycle fluctuations that are very large so that's not necessarily you know where fare improving so so the basic premise is really public policy has a role to play to ensure price stability so the economy doesn't fluctuate so wildly or financial stability is insured so that's that's why we need a central bank and what about for that goal of financial inclusion because I know a lot of people in the crypto space are one of their missions with the work that they do is to promote financial inclusion and you know they are quite well aware that there's a large segment of the world's population that isn't that doesn't make it good they don't make good candidates for customers like there they're basically not who you know the types of people that banks could make money from and so I know that for instance some of the charitable efforts are around giving people direct access to cryptocurrencies that they can then convert into their local currency so in that way do you see cryptocurrencies helping to achieve some of the IMF's goals around financial inclusion or or any of the other ones in a way I mean the reason why we are thinking that central bank is the currency can help finance inclusions precisely to play you know you know you play that well like if we have a digital version of cash that's easily obtainable not necessarily through a bank because these people are not banked then that would that could help foster Phoenicia inclusion but I guess what we're saying that absolutely we think you can't help with the financial inclusion which is very important you know mandates for therefore the fund but at the same time we do caution the countries that you know when we really designed the central bank digital currency we meet also be careful with respect to a couple of issues that don't mention for example they have to have speaker bases clear and certain legal bases they need to have a proper measures put in place to ensure the financial integrity concerns where risks would be mitigated so I think they kind of go hand-in-hand and I also wanted to ask about Libra in this regard this is Facebook's proposed digital currency are you seeing that that's spurring any interest among the central bank to issue their own central bank digital currency like they see that is competition and you know it's making them realize they need to step up their game so our acting a managing director David Lipton has recently written an article in The Financial Times and our colleagues have also published a new paper it's entitled the rise of digital money so these issues are all being analyzed peering the fund I think a given really the the scale of the proposed cryptocurrency libera by Facebook and the liberal sort of consortium in this is a whole different ballgame because it's a it's a very large enterprise in the Facebook has more than billion users so even though it says well yeah more than two billion so that's this is of systemic importance in the sense that it's going to affect how the global payment system works so we need to ensure that is properly regulated the financial risks are properly managed for example you know whether these are redeemable at in real time in real time to the currencies that back the liberal units so some of these issues are not the details are not yet disclosed but as a matter of principle you know regulation should really be in place to ensure the safety and soundness of of this enterprise but you know overall I think this certainly has prompted a lot of interest for the official sector to understand what's going on but also to respond in terms of the payment system how do we assure that the global payment system will still be able to each the demand for the digital age but do you think that Libra could pose a threat to some of these fiat currencies well for weaker currencies for example for economies that is still suffer high inflation I think that that danger is more apparent whereas for more mature economies we're in a mansion policy has a lot of credibility or the you know price levels price stability is achieved I don't see necessarily very you know large challenge or threat from from from libera I think the challenge there is more financial stability issue in the sense that whether this this whether they are great you know he's suppose it's a very large money market fund and you know whether that would distort how the financial industry works you know that's those are the issues that we you know when one needs to be one is to be concerned about also issues with financial integrity with with privacy protection you know those issues are very much on the agenda I don't necessarily see a threat in terms of you know a new currency that has more credibility certainly in multiple countries that that have that have price stability already achieved and just to go back to that goal of Financial Inclusion do you think that Libra could help in that regard well I mean you know with hard answered question I think in some respect where you have when you have a crypto currency that can be easily obtained it can make payments easier for those non banked citizens on the other hand it really depends on the design of the currency and if the currency is very volatile it's a value fluctuates it doesn't provide a stable stores value you know this you did you know then the demand for that particular cryptocurrency will not necessarily high so we will have to see how how does how they proposed cryptocurrency works so yeah I don't think you can make a blanket statement whether it helps or you know discourages finishing solution yeah plus we're not sure if it will launch so alright well this has been such a great discussion I really enjoy talking with you both where can people learn more about you and the IMF oh you know I've ever what website has you know huge amount of material for people who are interested in in how the IMF works what is it about the work I do you know I am a monetary economist so I work a lot on central banking issues on financial stability issues so have written papers and those those are posted in various places so you know hold for for those who are interested they can always they can always find my my papers yes similarly I think for the work that I am doing so I basically oversee the legal departments work on AML CFT and also syntax I just took over syntax I think as a don't said you can go to taboo taboo that I'm at that aarrg there you can find a lot of you know reports and articles you know issues all right great well thank you both for coming on Unchained thank you thanks so much for joining us
