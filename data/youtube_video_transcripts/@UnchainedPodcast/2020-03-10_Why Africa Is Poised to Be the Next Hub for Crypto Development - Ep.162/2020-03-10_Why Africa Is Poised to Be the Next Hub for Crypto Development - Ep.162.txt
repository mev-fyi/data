hi everyone this week's essay is by Cena Amma's General Partner advil capital and y la boda MOSI founder of microtransaction and why they believe Africa is poised to become a hub for crypto development they give some interesting stats on how crypto is currently used and traded on the continent let's talk about how these factors interplay with the region's unique demographics and the status of some of the continents fiat currencies to create what could be a unique environment for increased crypto activity they end with what they think crypto entrepreneurs should be working on to help further that development this is a great essay that will give investors and entrepreneurs and anyone who is interested in reaching the unbanked a lot to think about enjoy the show cipher trace helps grow the crypto economy by making it trusted by governments safe for consumers and investors and by protecting financial institutions from crypto laundering risks what's the best way to spend crypto the MCO visa card lets you spend anywhere visa is accepted including your coffee shop or the Apple Store all with up to 5% back download the crypto comma and reserve yours now Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets it has the tightest security deep liquidity and a great fee structure with no minimum or hidden fees whether you're looking for a simple Fiat on-ramp or futures trading Kraken is the place for you why Africa is poised to be the next hub for crypto development written by Sunnah amaz and nearly polymer C when you think of crypto development and entrepreneurship you may think of activity in the US Europe or Asia but it's actually Africa that has shown some of the strongest organic demand for Bitcoin in 2018 the top three countries with the most relative interests searching for Bitcoin a South Africa Ghana and Nigeria respectively by 2019 Nigeria driessen's the first place with South Africa and Ghana also around another top 5 unlike the Western Asia where users access Scripture via exchanges there is a significant and rapidly growing amount of activity by a peer-to-peer trades in Africa users in Africa are sending and receiving digital assets to waste at sushi and visioned peer-to-peer not only Africans using cryptocurrencies in their intended manner but the continent also has several other characteristics that make it a prime spot to become the next major hub for crypto development first numerous economies on the continents as seen rampant hyperinflation making cryptocurrencies an attractive option in these countries second there's also a lot of thin tech activity in Africa so much of the financial system already works on digital rails rather than the legacy banking system and finally the population is younger and moderately native than elsewhere making them a natural fit for the adoption of crypto assets that's why we strongly urge crypto investors and entrepreneurs to look at the opportunities on this continent of 1.2 billion people to start investing in and developing with and for them failing fiat currencies steers business is a thoughtful business publication based in Lagos Nigeria that covers Nigerian finance economics and development one newsletter they sent out was endearingly titled why earning naira sucks the article never mentions cryptocurrency or Bitcoin but some other points sound familiar just cleaning a few thoughts from the article we learn one about 30 or so years ago 5000 naira used to get you a new Volkswagen Beetle with a good some left over today it's equivalent to about 13 dollars and 80 cents this is the Cantillon effect on steroids for those who aren't familiar with the concept the Cantillon effect is observed when new supply of money is printed and circulated in the economy for example in the u.s. those who are the first to receive new dollars which are usually banks or government benefit from the fresh supply as they use it in an economy where prices are already still set by the existing supply of money by the time the new supply makes its way to the hands of the middle-class worker prices have been adjusted to account for inflation what this means is that the workers purchasing power is shot and it explains why the banking sector and the government as the first recipients often appear insulated from the recession number two inflation was over 11 percent in Nigeria at the time the newsletter was published meaning that the prices of goods will be at 6 times their current price by 2035 if the same rate is held constant to contextualize this you'd have to earn six times your present salary in 15 years just to maintain your current standard of living number three the punchline states for everyone else don't hold on to your naira x' for too long it will not be worth much in a few years to be clear this is not a country that has implemented a multiple currency system naira is the default method of payment in Nigeria and here is a publication on finance warning Nigerian citizens that the most fiscally responsible thing they can do right now is get rid of it exchange naira for what exactly the team doesn't say it's important to note that the hyperinflation we see in Nigeria is not isolated to the country it's part of a broader trend across the continent South Sudan's inflation rate is the third highest in the world at 56 percent with Liberia following close behind at 23 percent in Sudan the gravity of the problem can be best observed not through the populations eagerness to trade out of the Sudanese pound but by the bank's attempt to stop it as evidenced by their restrictions on US dollar deposits if we look to Zimbabwe we see the country not only has the highest rate of inflation in Africa but also holds the record for one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in history the rampant devaluation of their currency has forced some Zimbabweans to look to alternative currencies in an interview with Reuters Arnold Minzy WA who works for an IT and telecoms company in Harare says I have now changed all my reserves to Bitcoin because that is the only way I can protect my investment if I have $500 in the bank I won't get it back and I'll be losing value as the journalist who interviewed Arnold puts it prison Bob weigh-ins Bitcoin seems to offer a rare protection from the onset of hyperinflation and financial implosion what Africa's FinTech activity can tell us about its crypto future understanding the state of African FinTech today and how it developed is a strong indicator for Kryptos future on the continent the macro tailwind that catalyzed FinTech growth on the continent are very similar if not the same to the macro tailwind around crypto and Africa in fact some even consider crypto currencies to be the last leg of FinTech FinTech companies unbundle all the standard economic functions of banks via more streamlined digital interfaces with one exception of course monetary policy transmission crypto currencies like Bitcoin facilitate the separation of money from central banking FinTech companies attempt to bridge the gap where fintechs economic possibilities end and where Kryptos begin by building support for digital assets we've already seen this with square revolute and Robin Hood among many others thin tech adoption in Africa is soaring according to the Ernst & Young 2019 global fin tech adoption index emerging markets are leading the way in FinTech adoption the top adoption rate is in both China and India 87 percent but right after that is South Africa at 82% adoption this is more than Japan France in the USA which are at 34 35 and 46 percent respectively what's more according to the IMF sub-saharan Africa has become the global leader in mobile money transfer services with East Africa leading in mobile money adoption and usage higher Internet telecommunications and mobile penetration coupled with a lack of legacy financial systems means banks and financial institutions have had to develop innovations like Mobile Money chatbots and digital bank apps to deliver financial services the rapid proliferation of mobile phones in a short amount of time allowed Africans to skip the landline phase of development and jumped straight into the digital age since the market is not plagued by legacy financial infrastructure the activation energy required to get mobile native payment solutions integrated is much lower than other parts of the world many countries in Africa have mobile usage rates that hover around 90 to 93 percent and in context for American listeners u.s. mobile usage is around 96% and the third most common use for phones in Africa right after sending texts and photos is payments by investing in the development of vast agent networks telcos have laid down infrastructure that serves as an on-ramp for mobile money to explode in fact according to the Brookings Institute sub-saharan Africa leads the world in both per capita registered and active mobile money accounts and volume of Mobile Money transactions the number of mobile money accounts in sub-saharan Africa has now surpassed bank accounts products like M Schwar II and M paisa lead the way in terms of mobile money innovation here M pace nm Schwar II are mobile platforms that allow users to store and transfer money through their mobile phones and paste as the market leader in mobile payment services boasting over 25 million users this self-serve behavior around mobile payments allows a more seamless transition to internet native solutions like crypto which is primarily accessed via phones and desktop in order to reach more of these users some crypto companies are acquiring FinTech mobile money platforms for instance a little over a year ago aza an African blockchain payments company acquired transfer 0a mobile payments platform that services over 200 countries overseas financing technical infrastructure is of course not enough to change the existing system at scale in order to effect change you need capital investors are now waking up to the fact that Africa could drive global growth over the next several decades half the population is under 30 and their enterprising not only are they getting actual capital but they're accumulating social capital as well today there are over 81 thousand African students studying in Chinese universities who are coming back to the continent equipped with skills equipped with information and new relationships the Brookings Institute forecasts that over the next five years about half of the world's fastest growing economies will be located in Africa with twenty economies expanding at an average rate of five percent or higher faster than the 3.6 percent rate for the global economy as populations in African countries climb but dwindle elsewhere capital allocators cannot afford to ignore the vibrant burgeoning startup community on the continent this awareness largely explains the change we've seen in China and us financing activity in Africa last year China committed sixty billion dollars in aid credit and loans to Africa some of the largest investments have gone to fin tech startups like o pay which is a platform that enables users to shop and pay for services and products through their mobile or web browser and pompay which is a payments app that gives rewards for spending in aggregate the companies closed something to the tune of 240 million dollars in funding from over 12 different Chinese investors including Hillhouse capital source code capital and IDG Capital historically the u.s. is aligned with Africa as a foreign aid partner instead of investing in large infrastructure projects borrowing a few exceptions if we look at the past few years though we can see that this trend is changing the largest investor is by number of projects in Africa are the United States France and the UK respectively however China is still a large investor in terms of total capital many young entrepreneurs are stepping up to design mobile payment solutions and getting the funding to do so in 2019 234 African startups raised 1.3 billion dollars 41% went to companies in FinTech the largest single sector into which investment is funneled this is 30 times as much than what was raised in 2012 and the trend does not show any sign of slowing down soon given that about half of venture capital raised in Africa goes into FinTech it's no surprise that the sector distribution of blockchain projects also mirrors the traditional sort of ecosystem with 50.3% of blockchain projects falling into the financial category Africa's FinTech landscape if we look to the top 10 African FinTech companies that have been funded in the past two years we can see that they fall squarely into a few buckets lending payments and point-of-sale which are programmed to execute retail transactions at a specific time in place payments includes remittances which is arguably the largest category with companies like o pay sell you lunch and inter switch when we later dig into crypto investing activity in Africa we'll see that some of the top funded crypto companies mirror FinTech investments in that they also largely fall into the lending and payments category today's episode is brought to you by Kraken Kraken is the best exchange in the world for

making virtual assets safe and trusted at site for trace comm why Africa is ripe for crypto disruption constellar moment that the average age of the African population today is 19 years old in 15 years the number of working age people joining the workforce from Africa without number that of the rest of the world combined why does this matter as John King Coco former Kenyan journalist who investigated bribery and fraud in his home country puts it we now have a young generation of Africans below the age of 35 realizing that for them secure livelihoods health education and security for themselves and for the children is paquius and they're willing to challenge the institutions that have led to this reality the desire to adopt new solutions and challenge existing institutions from at least half of the population would zero for frontier tech why cryptocurrencies to be used and developed further one of the reasons for young Africans interest in cryptocurrencies it's because of its potential as a store of value in the last three to four years one of the mega trends and financial habits for Millennials is savings and investment apps such as carry wise and piggy vests with banks offering zero percent interest rates on savings accounts these apps have grown in popularity because they allow their users to earn anything from ten to fifteen percent per annum in interest they able to do this by aggregating the savings of each individual user and using it to buy Treasury bills which are usually out of the reach of Millennials because of the required investment minimum and this effectively democratized access to this asset class however because the rate of inflation in most African countries is low double digits the effective interest rate is about zero to three percent per annum this is widely native African Millennials are drawn to Bitcoin because it's both the hedge against inflation and has outside holidays return potential we have seen an increased optic in the awareness level of Bitcoin Tommy la Russia become co-founder of buy coins a Fiat so crypto app for Africa told us this even amongst Millennials there is increasingly a savings and investment culture they are probably willing to take more risk than the average restaurant because they are more used to the downside anyways the downside it describes is paranoid due to the consistent evaluation of African currencies against the power as well as weak performance of other investment opportunities for instance Nigeria is Africa's largest economy and the all-share index which is the SNP 5 injured index of the Nigerian Stock Exchange has a negative return of seven point eight three percent for the last five years in comparison Bitcoin during that same period are shown a return of three thousand eight hundred and sixty four percent another driver is the low transaction cost of cryptocurrencies compared to the fees and legacy systems according to Elizabeth rasili CEO and founder of as a finance small businesses in Africa often pay nearly 200 percent more than larger businesses and transaction fees the use of the US dollar as an intermediary settlement currency results in transaction fees that can range from three percent to as high as 10 percent and cross-border transactions usually take three days to settle and has worth two weeks where small and medium businesses accounting for 90 percent of all businesses on the continent this grossly impacts intra Africa trade evident by the fact that India Africa trade exports is only 17% of total African exports in comparison intra EU exports and intra Asia exports as 68 percent and 60 percent respectively across the continent access to u.s. dollar is controlled centrally becoming scarce and it's the only available to the largest companies or those who have political connections making it very difficult for small and medium businesses to get foreign exchange needed to transact Bitcoin is fast becoming an alternative intermediary currency that is faster easier to transmit and more accessible to the average more business this transaction is actually per typically done in a peer-to-peer model through informal channels like whatsapp groups with 100 to 200 members run by trusted admins with minimal kyc this behavior mirrors what we see in the FX market on the continent another unique difference is that unlike in advanced economies peer-to-peer Bitcoin market places like factual and local bitcoins are more popular than simplified fiat to crypto mobile apps like Luna Park Zoo reportedly treated 1.6 billion dollars in 2019 with the Nigerian naira being the second largest currency by trading volume and Kenyan chilling around inaud top ten some popular African alternatives to coinbase include but are not limited to lunar Kahn direct and by coins a wisely packed fear to crypto on-ramp however the number of crypto exchanges is on the rise our primary research attracts over 47 exchanges across Africa with at least 15 exchanges been launched in 2018 alone Nigeria's Niger leads the pack with 12 exchanges followed by South Africa with seven and Kenya Ghana Uganda all come in a third with five exchanges each global exchange is also moving into the continent violence launched his first theatrical to exchange in Uganda in 2019 and the very first fiat currency to be added on balance comm was the Nigerian naira one factor that enables entrepreneurs to build these products is the crypto friendly regulation landscape in Africa regulatory landscape and project distribution to date apart from Namibia America that have out rightly banned cryptocurrencies in most countries there is no existing regulation that encumbers the experimentation and development of crypto and blockchain projects on the continents this has been an important factor in enabling the incredible work in a number of blockchain or digital assets related projects our research found hundred and twenty plus projects across the continents showing an increase of about three hundred and seventy three percent in under two years covering of Rodrigues sectors from financial services agriculture education supply chain energy and so many more crypto investing activity overall information on investing activity for blockchain startups in Africa is hard to come by as it's currently not a norm to announce investment deals from private conversations we know that many companies are raise capital usually between $100,000 to $1,000,000 the most investment focusing on crypto inclusion that is on on and off ramps for crypto to fiat such as buy coins and bits occur with other companies fall into exchange category they include coin direct which raised a little over 1 million for mega Dow unblocked become as well as voila which raised 1.5 million from Beatrix lastly various companies servicing remittance corridors such as aza which was formerly known as Picasa raised 15 million dollars requests for products in addition to all of this activity we think there's still a lot of room for growth the crypto community has an especially strong opportunity to do what many entrepreneurs in the space say they care about which in a nutshell is to provide access to better smarter cheaper financial services and help individuals who need it to most to achieve financial freedom starting with Africa here are some of the top products we think teams should be working on Cambridge benchmark study for 2018 q1 to q3 estimated that crypto asset service providers had at least 35 million ID verified crypto asset users and only 4% approximately 1.4 million users are in Africa meaning that the majority of African users are using informal methods like messaging apps to buy and sell crypto in order to onboard a hundred million plus new everyday African users and drive crypto inclusion on the continent we must build applications that feel simple and familiar that's where Fiat on ramps like buy coins come in in addition to Fiat on ramps white label software that can provide the technical architecture to set up a buy coins in every country in Africa is a huge opportunity this plug and play solution will lower the friction to set up digital asset on ramps in various countries which means instead of worrying about technical challenges the entrepreneur can focus on customer acquisition payment integrations and regional regulatory compliance the informal economy is part of any economy that is neither taxed no money taught by any form of government it's a complex adaptive system that eases digital means to trade an exchange value on its own terms in Africa the informal economy is about 85 percent of total employment in sub-saharan Africa and accounts for about half of the of the continents GDP conservatively estimated since the majority of Africans are currently unbanked the informal economy is currently larger than the formal over time the informal economy in Africa will become more formal digitization without decentralization in the wrong hands can lead to an imbalance and abuse of power especially within nation-states where there's a lack of good governance and institutions a weak to counterbalance this you must build a parallel and open the ritual payments infrastructure through Fiat Act stable coins such as Nigerian naira issued on chain backed by another Fiat stable coin such as B USD or USD C these are further along the spectrum of current African Fiat stable points such as narrow token n GMT or Africa stable coin ABCD in order for the average African to use these alternative forms of money they would need very simple and user-friendly non-custodial wallets that make it appear payment seamless not dissimilar to venule or square cash I will probably use Tresor signature schemes that enable non-custodial wallets which don't require a user to write down their private keys on paper finally 95% of all retail transactions on the continents are done by cash one of the reasons why cash is still the most predominant way to transact is that it's currently too costly in terms of transaction fees to move valid Italy for example a large part of daily transactions in Nigeria are on the 500 naira because the length of one dollar that's eight cents it currently costs 52 naira about fourteen cents to send money digitally that's a 10% tax on micro payments for cryptocurrencies to be adopted as a daily alternative is important that transaction fees are negligible and wallets have layer two scalability solutions like seller and Matic they make micro payments of thirty cents visible on chain our future outlook there are a few macro social economic and regulatory trends on the continent they give Africa and in creating a fertile environment for the digital asset ecosystem to grow what this means is there is a large opportunity here for a peer-to-peer solutions to thrive investors and founders need to think carefully about the market and prioritize solutions that are relevant to the largest segment of the population Yeley and i largely believe these solutions will come in the form of digital assets and the intermediaries that best leverage them by coins founder Tamela agrees stating I see more African developers being proficient in blockchain related software development and getting better access to decentralized financial apps for example
