I think that at this point they just want the precedent of getting some type of judgment against a Dao right we don't know what further they're going to do there with that judgment like will they try to find individual members of the Dao and say you're now liable for damages for violating the thing or will they say hey we got a judgment against the Dao um let's go to the ISP for their website and say that their website is facilitating an illegal business shut it down uh let's go to whatever platform the governance forum is run on say look their conduct is illegal shut this governance Forum down I think it's probably more likely what they're going to do than try to chase all these individual people who they you know may or may not know who they are right but it's sort of yet to be seen and it's yet to be seen whether they even will get the default judgment but that's what they're seeking
