Mikado who is back for part two of our dive in a maker Dow where we left off last week and for listeners who did not listen to that episode I highly recommend that you check that out Plus also rune was on the podcast almost a year ago to discuss stable coins generally so if you don't understand stable coins that gives a really good overview of all the different types of stable coins and now in this past episode last week's episode and this episode we are diving deep into maker Dow and how it works and where we left off last week was we had started to talk a little bit about multi collateral tie that episode kind of talked a lot about the single collateral die system so rune can you describe for me multi collateral die and let's do the same as we did last week where you describe the process by which somebody creates a multi collateral die for themselves and then redeems it without their collateral falling below the one hundred and fifty percent threshold yes absolutely so well I mean it's actually the same process right it's just now you have a choice of using many different servants so it would be you know it could be something like you take a toke and ice stuck right so like Apple shares that have been turned into tokens that are available as usually 20 tokens and aetherium in some sort of regulated environment like something a regulated front-end and you then just deposit them into the system just like you do with the theorem and single collateral die and then this system will have some specific risk parameters for that for that particular time of collateral using that depends on how risky it is right so something like stocks is going to have a sort of a medium level of risk parameters to it right so it's not gonna be as considered as risky and as expensive like as expensive to borrow with as something like aetherium or cryptocurrencies but also it's not as stable considered as stable as something like to organized bonds or maybe other stable coins and yeah so you put in your your asset you take out a loan and you can then choose to wait for as long as you want before you pay back that loan and but of course when you pay back the loan you also have to pay and what's in in maker called disability fee which is basically the interest rate of the system right the cost to borrow the dye from the system over time and once you pay it back the system automatically unlocks your collateral and allows you to retrieve your your tokenized stuck out again and the reason why this is entering to do is because it allows you to keep your exposure to the tokenized stock but it's still unlocked like you know it's still access liquidity in it right and actually spend sort of spend the money that's in the stock without actually selling your stock so if the price of the stock goes up you actually still get get the benefit of that and then later you can choose to pay back a debt and then just get your your full exit sort of like take it back into your own wallet yeah yeah I find the system so interesting because it's basically a way to just give yourself alone out of assets that you already have one thing that I want to ask though is so with multicolor multi let's say eventually there comes a point where maybe there's 20 different assets that are allowed as collateral for the maker Dao system so let's say that I own only two of those assets can I create a die for myself with only two or could I even if what if I only have one could I could I make a single collateral die for myself at that point or how much diversification will you require from people who are making multi collateral die for themselves yeah so I mean so let me be clear because the so it's like multi collateral diet doesn't mean that you have to use multiple collateral like as a user when you when you take a loan for the system so it really works exactly the same way it's just you have it you have different choices in what kind of collateral you want to use so if you only have let's say a tokenized stock or you only have let's say auger rep tokens or djx tokens or all bitcoins or whatever even if there's a thousand different collateral types you can still get direct access to the loan just like it the way the system currently works and the reason is because the risk is pulled across all users yeah exactly and like I said the only thing that's different is the actual risk parameters right so if you use let's say Bitcoin as collateral like if you use something like WBC you know like a tokenized bitcoin another theorem that's going to probably have you know a higher stability fee and require a higher level of collateralization than if you use something like you know at organized government bond or something right like some sort of acid that is very stable and very unlikely to crash okay so basically you charge essentially the users for the risk that they're taking based on that asset that they put up for collateral yeah and this actually ties back into the dynamic we were talking about last time which is that when things go well MKR holders get paid right and and m care holders are in addition to the dire holders and like the addition to die in a system that's a stable part right you have the MPR holders which run the governance of the system and who actually decides like makes the decisions on something like how much is the stability fee for tokenized Bunce and what is the liquidation ratio and and so on and they try to set these parameters so they make as much money as possible but also make the system very attractive for users right and as long as everything goes well they keep getting in you know they keep getting money from the system right the stability fee goes to actually buy and burn them care supply so the supply of and care of fault over time but and this is how the risk is pooled right if one of those particular or many like if there's 20 different collateral types and one of them fails something like that right then it doesn't matter which collateral type it is because the whole system is sort of tied together right so as long as any collateral fails anywhere the MPR token and sort of the whole governance community as a whole is is always responsible for recapitalizing that through inflation of the MKR token so MKR is really what ties it all together right because it means that even though some dye is created out of of tokenized stocks and some dyes created out of bitcoins ultimately the thing that sort of fundamentally on the rights the stability and and sort of the guarantees liquidity and fungibility in the system is the fact that all the dye is also protected by MKR inflation right in case that the first line of defense the collateral fails there is that second line of defense which is the MKR inflation that can then step in and make sure that even if your diet was created out of some terrible collateral that soon after failed that doesn't matter because that dye still has the same protection as all other dye from the MPR function so you keep talking about that MKR holders who gets to be an mkr holder also MK is actually the first here's the 20 token as far as i'm aware and it's one of the only gives the 20 tokens that wasn't distributed in ICO but rather was sold in this very you know like deliberate fashion to community members early on so so MK I was kind of like was distributed by the foundation very slowly over time and in a very you know a in this very kind of like till you know deliberately obscure manner where only those who really knew what they were doing and don't and really like was seeking out a stable current project and then came upon maker and found out about it were able to to to buy into this asset how did you find those people and verify their identity and and give it to them if it wasn't through a traditional ICO I mean it was actually just people coming into a chatroom and and basically buying him care so it was I mean and initially it really was like just individuals in the community that it that sort of joined and started contributing and then actually were able to like get like able to buy and care and F at at the very beginning of course at the very low prices because we didn't actually really you know in the early days when we started distributing the MPI token you know we didn't really have much of a burn rate and everyone was kind of volunteers and in fact actually the initial mki distribution was primarily as a reward for those who are volunteering right because there's a very low value asset but people sort of were willing to to put in the work because they could see the long-term potential and then after awhile like the the people who had been rewarded with with MPR as well as those had been been doing those those direct purchases from the foundation then started trading them on secondary markets such as actually Oasis sticks which is our own decentralized exchange that the foundation created and yeah then the the next phase was that when we started selling to institutions so that was kind of when the price of embarrassed act like when yeah when the price of McKenna actually started increasing and sort of crypto static or mainstream we stopped doing any sort of sales to regular individuals but rather started selling to institutions who were then able to do these larger purchases and sort of where everything was properly you know compliant and done so I mean in a proper professional fashion and like Andreessen Horowitz who were some of the other names yeah so I mean andreessen horowitz is probably the most the best example but actually there is that it's a very large amount of institution to this point as well there's also polar change I was very prominent they were the actually the very first institution and what's kind of interesting is that they actually went and proposed like the deal they made was kind of like they negotiated with the entire community and they actually made like a public proposal to the community and had the community like ratify or kind of like agree to that proposal kind of like as a part of the decentralized governance process yeah and if I'm funny cuz isn't that on reddit they remove not read it yeah we also had a forum and and yeah like there was we we had some very like we had a lot of very radical experiments in when it came to like the community participation and kind of like direct democracy I guess you can say and like the right control of the project but in the end that was actually only possible during the very early stage when the community was was basically tell you there came a point where you know the community started so like I started really growing and then it just became like it was just no longer possible to have that kind of total democratization democratization of everything right and and the foundation started becoming more structured and and then I just kept doing the same kind of deals as as the very first one with poly chain when you say that it was because like once once it got bigger you couldn't get enough votes like you know because random people that weren't kind of paying attention everything were you know they had these tokens but they weren't participating in votes and stuff like that is that why well so actually our our main approach to governance is actually I mean so we do use votes and I do talk about voting in terms of controlling maker but when we think about governance in terms of how we make like how the community makes decisions and the social layer you know as like as as the group of people basically rather than then doing it based on voting we do it based on consensus decision-making so it's not really about who approves it's about who opposes you know and and then something can be done if there's no one in opposition though there's no like significant opposition and the problem is basically the like that that works really well when you are super aligned and have like a very defined objective which is why you know for instance it works in science right legen you can you're gonna have scientific consensus on very complicated topics because you ultimately have you know everyone follows the scientific method right but you can't do like you can you like get consensus at scale on some topics such as like how does a start-up navigate its competition or something so like we actually thought it was gonna be possible initially but at some point we started realizing that because we were leading literally anyone come in and join the decision-making process and in fact sort of giving every one of the and amazingly it worked for two years but eventually it you know like it just it just became too big right and it was clear that like we didn't actually have any instances as someone sort of trolling us and and just like abusing the process but it became clear to everyone like the entire community basically it reached a consensus on the fact that it was time to do sort of structure and and in order to start focusing on Xtreme delivering the project the foundation had to become more structured and super more centralized basically right and based on a more traditional process of just having a core team that makes a decision right now is the foundation yeah so that is that is a mega foundation and from there we were then able to actually launch the actual you know maker platform and the dice table point system on the blockchain and then when that happened that's when the real governance started right because that's when the voting actually became a thing on the blockchain and you could use the tokens to vote on son stuff like the risk parameters so essentially now the maker holders that's what their main function is but it's not to choose who else becomes these kind of institutional votes that like the big maker holders that will still be decided by the foundation and then the general population of maker holders are deciding which assets can be used as collateral and kind of how much risk each asset presents is that it yeah so and it's really like and and what's important about how the risk assessment is done is it's it's very important it doesn't become a popularity contest right it's very important it doesn't become kind of like arbitrary rule by MKR holders or even in care wheels because in that case you can very easily imagine that there would be a lot of bias introduced right and ever end up becoming kind of like a contest of like what what other tokens do they always hold MOH stuff because then let's give that one some really good risk parameters so we can pump our backs basically right and yeah that's obviously yeah I mean and that's really the fundamentals like the fundamental issue we've traveled with when trying to design the governance process and what we came up with is yeah it's basically what I was talking about earlier rights consensus decision-making process and it's it's trying to emulate the scientific process right so so it's kind of like a to two layer process where the first the first layer is kind of like is this scientific debate basically unlike a place where people who are actually subject matter experts openly debate based on you know on data and on models and on on theory that all has been you know that all is kind of like known as not known by the community and and especially known by the experts to be you know the this scientifically approved where you do risk management right and and here the key really is to look at existing traditional mechanism pressor so we're not really trying to reinvent the real rather we're trying to you know build an a system where we can apply all that existing knowledge to sue so we can apply it in a more efficient way but we don't you know claim to you know have reinvented math or something or reinvented you know risk various risk models that exist rather we want to actually apply those very rigorously and in a very transparent manner so so we have these various like it is various risk experts who are basically a part of the community and ultimately like the very best of them and the very most dedicated of them they actually end up getting chosen by MK our governance like they get essentially elected into what we call risk teams and actually receive salary directly from the maker system so they actually will receive a part of the stability fee income stream and they will then sort of present the the data and the models and and preside over this scientific debate that ultimately should result in scientific consensus on the things that are clear enough that you can actually reach a consensus on them and their job of the encou holders from a cryptic another point of view is to them as essentially kind of like a very slow Oracle in this process and right now it's it's envisioned to be every quarter so basically every quarter there will be sort of this that there'll be the end of a cycle of the of the risk assessment debate basically and the things that were able to the things that the experts and and the the risk community was able to reach scientific consensus on is then sort of proposed frame care hold us to vote into this like lake you know to to vote into the core of the system and actually changed the parameters in the system and then cow holders then have to ensure that the process was actually followed right and it's not some sort of you know some sort of attack or some sort of like there's some sort of bias in there or something and there's actually like there's it there's like multiple things in play here because there's even the possibility that if you know the the proposal is malicious but then a big MKI will still tries to push it through because you just has more votes than the others despite this this proposal being actually not the outcome of the of the scientific process then there's then other MK holders can actually trigger you know an emergency shutdown by considering that a governance attack and then redeploy the system without the malicious voter in there so there's really a lot of complexity to like wow what like the m careful is have this kind of like very mechanical or kind of like very security focused role i guess you can say that's very interesting it's essentially like hard forking that whale out of the system then this means just does this mean that for the various assets that are added that they will all have different minimum thresholds and points at which they'll be liquidated because of the risk proposed and then they all have different stability fees and etc and also liquidation penalties yeah they should all i mean in theory they will all be a completely unique based entirely around like the exact data for that particular asset and the models that apply to it and then NPR who lost their job is to basically like those of them that that do have the ability to participate in the debate will of course it's dissipate in a scientific debate directly but those that don't then just have to sort of be of servers that you know that this is indeed like this is indeed the result of a scientific debate right and Knutson is not some guy just trying to push something through because he has a lot of mkr and he this is a favorite token or something right that's really the the role that like the the average MK alteplase so even if you have no idea about risk assessment there still are you know there's still a role to play as an account holder because you can still be sort of the you know the final line of security right like this the the final sanity check to ensure that the system isn't getting abused and what with the name of these impaired holders that have these special this special role what was their name again Utah like means of theirs there is this type of of actor and ecosystem called a risk team so these are actual risk professionals that are sort of form these teams and are then elected by NPR holders to actually receive like salary like receive a compensation out of the system to then work full-time on on building the risk models and gathering the data and sort of presiding over the the overall scientific debate right and you guys hired one recently they're not that recently but I guess last year who worked in traditional finance in a role like this correct yeah so and actually and you're probably referring to Steven Baker who was hired as our head of risk but today has actually today is actually the president of foundation and that's correct so he is so so today he is the president and he's very deeply involved in a lot of operations of the foundation but he is also still running what we called the temporary foundation risk team so so well because today is still the very early days you know we are like we're making sure that the bare minimum is there which means the one risk team that actually have risk professionals that can you know that can actually produce these these model and actually produce something that is very sound and and and you know mase based on these made based on these objective scientific idea like models right from the traditional space for mk I'm not sure exactly how well those work I guess well we'll find out but one thing I wanted to ask was so earlier we walked through what happens if someone creates multi collateral dye and then just redeems it without their collateral falling below this threshold but let's walk through what happens if their collateral does fall below their minimum threshold then what happens so what happens is this like you know the the price Oracle's see that the price is now crashed by whatever some some amount we say 20% and they send in the price of this acid is now 20% lower and that change in price then gets your person you know if that's enough to get your position below let's say 150 percent if that's the cutoff point then the moment that the data is pushed into the system that changes the you know that changes the calculation in the system to below 150 percent then the keepers you know the external agents that will monitor the system and and act to to exploit profit opportunities they see in the system they will immediately trigger an auction so a liquidation auction and once and then they'll trigger it and then we'll place a you know they'll place a bit for the collateral and basically the auction just says hey I want to sell this collateral how much do you want to pay for it and people can choose to be zeros they want to but of course that's not really a good strategy right it's better to try to bid something where you can get you you you get a achieved my good rate but but still pretty close so no one else is gonna be a little bit better than you right but then so what happens is I think they try to recoup the amount in dye that was in that CDP but then once they do that then they try to recoup as much of the value of the collateral as possible for the owner right yeah that's yeah can you describe that part yeah so I mean so this is actually really complicated right but yeah so but the the first and main goal of the system is to recapitalize the diet right so ensure that there is enough collateral in system to back the outstanding value of that so first order of business is to basically say this CDP like this loan is now no longer safe so the dye that has been backed by this loan needs to be removed from the supplier so we need to contract the supply to be in line with the fact that the collateral base has not contracted so the yeah so first the first thing that the system tries to do is basically saying well actually just tries like first it actually assumes it's not able to recoup all of the dye from the market so first it just says here's all the collateral how much dye are you willing to pay for that and if someone then bits like and the in this scenario let's say that the debt is 100 and the liquidation point is 150 dollars or like 150% sorry so there's 150 dollars worth of collateral and there's a hundred dollars worth of debt right the system will then take 150 dollars worth of collateral and be like how much like does someone want to buy this basically anyone can submit a bid and a keeper will then most likely submit you know maybe someone's gonna be cheeky first and be like I'll pay five dollars for the $150 worth of collateral but because of the value of the collateral if if it actually is one hundred and fifty dollars or maybe slightly lower than that because it's a process for crashing it's the middle of a crash or something right then soon enough someone will actually say I'm willing to pay you know I'm really like I mean someone will say I'm willing to pay $100 for the hundred fifty dollars worth of collateral and once the system knows that so once someone is willing to pay a hundred dollars then the system has had its you know has achieved its primary objective which is to ensure that it can take in a hundred died to contract the supply right so then the next step is to be like okay so actually I can I know I can sell this collateral for hundred died then actually my goal is to just sell as little collateral as possible for 100 dies so I can see if there's something left over I can give back to the owner so the next like so so the next phase of the auction if it indeed gets this far because it doesn't always get this far because sometimes the value of collateral has just crashed 100 I already you know while the auction is in process but if that doesn't happen then the next phase of the auction is this system that says how like you know who's gonna like people basically who you know I need a hundred diet how much collateral do you want for me to give me a hundred diet so then people will sum then one guy would be it maybe I'll give you a hundred I gave me a hundred forty dollars worth of collateral and then someone else would be like well you know I just gave me a hundred twenty dollars worth of collateral right I'll give you $100 for that cuz it's still a great deal right and if it like eventually this should equilibrate towards just the actual you know like the value of death right so someone is gonna base it basically you know bid 100 $100 worth of collateral like maybe 102 dollars worth of collateral or something right so there will actually be still a decent surplus like 48 dollars if if the CDP holder is really lucky that then is left over in the system and is then given back to the CDP holder okay so now I think we've walked through most of the nuts and bolts of maker Darrell we are going to discuss how all that all the different partnerships that maker Dow has we're gonna

trace is securing the crypto economy back to my conversation with rune Christensen of maker Dow when you expect to launch multi collateral die and with which assets so we've basically excuses they learned the lesson that we're not we don't make any estimations on what is actually going to be done because like we're really like at this stage right we are so like it's so close right I mean the code is already we actually release the code almost half a year ago at this point and we've formally verified almost the entire code base and there's only these very small pieces left that needs to be engineered and most of it it's just in testing at this point and of course there's going to be a very rigorous testing process but ultimately yes like its it basically is really close and it is also really close to the point where we actually you know we can actually we don't have to make an estimate of when it's gonna launch we can actually commit to a you know hard launch date once that's once we reach that point then we'll we'll announce it everywhere but until then basically all we can say is it's very close and also very soon they'll be you know will actually give the community some very deep insight into you know the whole like sort of the project management of the launch cycle right unlike the the milestones and basically you know the entire scope of what's what's still left to do and have you decided on at least what your next asset is that you'll use as collateral yeah so that's the other really interesting thing that's happening in peril right is there the preparation for actually launching with a some new collateral types and so right now we still haven't we haven't published anything but basically the the goal is that and like we just will just launch with whatever it's available at launch right so the goal is that so right now we're looking at basically most of the top like the tub here's the 20 tokens and also the top stable coins on it's like gives you 20 stable coins and at some point the foundation risk team and actually will be relatively soon will then come like release like first release a set of models and then also kind of like propose some some some potential data sources that these models can then be applied to in order to you know in order to synthesize the risk parameters for these different collateral types that we can available at launch but in general like our approach is that you know it's not really a question of what is going to be collateral it's most is it's a question of what are the risk parameters going to be because from a technical standpoint this system can really support like anything as collateral like sometimes if you have a weird token it needs to be to be like there needs to be built what we call an adapter to make it you know actually fit into the system but unless a token is literally a scam or just like like an heart like a terrible project with no redeeming qualities it's actually always going to be included as collateral eventually because it's only a question of technical bandwidth but from there sort of from the risk assessment or like the government's point of view the risk you know the risk process and the risk models are always able to just take into account whatever risk is inherent in that asset so so it's really it's actually possible to be very diverse try to be very inclusive off of all the different tokens in the theory over the long run okay so this is something that I think I had a misconception about so you're gonna once you get the the models then it sounds like you're just gonna allow people to use many many different assets as collateral and you're not going to add them individually because I don't you know you would sort of suss out the risk for like maybe five or ten at the most but it sounds like you're just gonna allow people to to use whatever for collateral at a certain point practice it is going to be the way you taught me and some practices they do have to be added individually and there is like some level of of you know like technical overhead to adding a new collateral type especially in the beginning yes we are you know still kind of getting started and getting the processes up and running so initially it will be like it will be based on what are the most like again right what are the top tiers to 20 tokens and aetherium and one of the top stable coins that greens sort of you know we can get ready for lunch but when you do launch do you expect that you'll launch with like ten assets that people could use or do you expect it'll only be like two or how many launched you expect to have available yeah I hope it's going to be closer to 10 than two and maybe even more than that I mean that's that would definitely be ideal I think and also very much possible all right all right so it sounds like it's undecided so TBD check back here I'm sure I will have updates when that happens so something that's really really really interesting that I was totally fascinated by it was so if we think of liquidations on these CDP's as similar to kind of like defaults on loans digital asset research had this pretty interesting report that showed that across a lot of months defaults were at about one to two percent but then there were a few months when they reached as high as well in one month although the system was really small at this point it was 20% and the report actually only went up to September and I know that there were a large number of defaults in November and December so of course you know making all these caveats about how the system is still small and it's still kind of early do you feel like you have any conclusions you can draw about how people behave when they have this much responsibility over their own loan versus you know if they had taken the loan out in a more traditional way yeah I mean I've been incredibly fascinated by being able to see how like how people interacted with the system in this first year and I mean especially considering the crazy circumstances of just like this persistent aetherium crash right they just kept getting worse and worse and I think the main the main interesting takeaway that we've observed is yeah it's just like this how good people have been at adding more collateral to the positions and in general how people seem to have preferred adding more collateral rather than deleveraging which I actually think is a little bit counterintuitive but it's just but a pen but I mean that's apparently just a preference right of abusers and then like there have been those situations where a lot of people have been liquidated at once and typically those have always been times where there's been kind of like a sustained you know there's been a sustained crash it's kind of been crashing and crashing and crashing crashing and then at the end of like a long sustained period then suddenly there's like a really steep crash that seems to cut like catch a lot of people off-guard because I guess many people they expect after it's been like a long period of crashing then it'll turn around right and then dips and then they're actually willing to go to a pretty risky point in their CDP's there and then can be caught off guard if they're then is suddenly a steep crash yeah so let's talk a little bit more about what you mentioned about how and and this is partially why I was so impressed when I was researching this died has basically maintained its value at around one dollar during this time when the price of ether at its high was 1,400 and then also hit a low below eight hunters right below 100 so how did the system keep that peg yeah it's it's it's quite amazing and actually the answer is pretty simple is that the system ended up absorbing almost two percent of the entire theorem supply so basically as the price of a theorem crashed more and more of the entire theory Ameche system like entered the system basically to make sure that despite the price of a theorem crashing the the supply of died actually kept growing the whole time because there was just a flood of a theorem Toby was entering the system so even though from the beginning the the value of your theorem had you know fallen ten times or even more there were you know there were a hundred times as much if you're in the system at that point so even a 10x fallen price didn't matter because there's just so much it there and put into the system let's switch to regulatory issues I noticed that coinbase has listed dye and it's also listed MKR but I'm here is actually only listed in jurisdictions outside the US which is I'm assuming for regulatory reasons so how do the collateralized debt positions and maker comply with CFTC regulation of derivatives and margin trading yes so I mean so so the question of regulation in crypto is actually no it's a lot more complex than you would think because the fact is that just isn't really legal clarity at all on these things right in fact even when you know the CFTC and the ACC they go out and they make statements they are actually very careful to not really say something that's you know they don't really try to they don't really make very like precise statements and this is typically also the case for most other regulators around the world except like there's a few notable exceptions such as Japan Singapore that have actually been very you know been like here the guidelines this is exactly how it works you know go ahead and innovate basically within this framework but in most countries the approach at this stage is still kind of wait-and-see because on one hand you know they don't want to stifle innovation they don't want to be like you can't do this and then suddenly a bunch of startups move to another country right but on the other hand they also still a little bit scared you know there's still like this is still a bit unknown they're not really sure what actually needs to be done so right now I mean some something like CDP's just is like it is it is way to kind of like there are multiple issues that are kind of like much closer on the horizon that for for the regulators to deal with globally but in general I mean we basically we've done a lot of research right and we're we retain basically all the top lawyers and both in the US but also all across the world right because of course there's a ton of work that goes into dealing with of the legal and regulatory and even political challenges of trying to build a decentralized financial infrastructure and I mean so I mean in general it seems like because you had like as long as you have something that is fully decentralized that really you know that in a lot of jurisdictions including the US that seems to be one of the big sort of factors that decides whether a regulator feels like they're compelled to step in to protect people because you know in it traditionally what rate like the spirit of the law and really what regulators all about is kind of like you know protecting honest people and maybe slightly naive people from you know smart and dishonest people right so so like no confidence schemes or whatever like scams or pumping dumps and that kind of stuff right where it's there's a guy who's saying dude you know buy this because I'm totally gonna make it rich and then after you buy it is like oh I'm not gonna make it rich after all right but you can't do that because when you told them they should buy it and then we're gonna make it rich or whatever right like the you know they're that actually created it's in like effectively a legal claim in a sense right and that's kind of so that's the basis of the whole thing about ICO is being securities right that if you sell a token and you go out and say buy this to me it's gonna make you rich you actually suddenly fall under a good part of the law and wait but in this case where it's more about derivatives and that involves the CFTC not as you see yeah and then like then the question really is like in a legal sense in you know under the the common law precedence of the u.s. is like does a CDP fall into the bucket of being a derivative so that so anything like the thing that's really critical to to think about in this context is like it's very it's very much about the transaction so it's not so like the the concept of like a smart contracts are like a piece of code on the blockchain that holds some money and wholesome you know wholesome assets and and has like as debt that you that doesn't really like that that fundamental it doesn't really make sense in in a regular sense because there's no such thing in like the real world right because the way derivatives work in the real world is it is you know it's kind of like you it's a transaction where you basically you know you you sign a contract that says like I'm gonna do you know I'm gonna or rather like we're gonna post some collateral and then at some point we will will will sort of share it according to what we put in this contract and then when you you know when you enter into that legal relationship that is when you again like you get into that situation where it are you know are you actually like you know you can't like derivatives for instance right you don't want to just have written like random people do that kind of stuff because you don't know what are they like what are the full implications and what you're actually doing there right and again it's just a smart country just isn't the same thing right I mean there's no you're not actually doing answer any sort of legal transaction you're not even dealing with a counterparty at all right you're actually like dealing with yourself in a way right you're like so making a deal with your your own assets and ultimately it is just an ongoing like I said right there's no clarity on this yet and we're in touch with like most of the regulators and like what I think could happen right is that I think there are some places that are going to just say for instance SCDP years I mean it could be sadp it's a derivative it could be CDP is alone it's a whatever could be all sorts of stuff right but the important thing is it still wouldn't like it wouldn't impact maker itself it would impact those that you know create like those that actually enable those transactions right so it would be a question of what kind of front ends you know what what does a front end into the system look like so if we for instance mean that that that some front ends would block labels say if if the US for instance decided it falls under some sort of regulation right then you would see kind of like you're seeing with a lot of decentralized exchanges the US will get blocked from from non writ like from interfaces just give direct access to the you know this exposed to regulate the underlying system and then you'd only have these more fully compliant interfaces that maybe even had a license or something that would actually enable users to use the system and then at the same time of course you would have like proper sophisticated investors right and institutions and so on be able to completely freely use the system right because this kind of regulation really only applies to to like end consumers and their access to financial services yeah right so I'm not I think you're right that it's not entirely clear what their regulation is but I did see that the SEC has a document and it appears to I guess be put out by some lab at the CFTC but it talks about its it says you know here are examples of prohibited activities and it says derivatives contracts including those that are smart contracts deployed on a decentralized blockchain must not be traded or in and there's like a list of them but the one bullet point that stuck out at me must not be traded or executed by individuals or firms that are required to be registered with the CFTC but are not meaning are not registered and also do not have an exemption or exception from registration so yeah it's not clear you're right that in a way they're using the system to take out a loan from themselves but presumably you're right these people would not be registered or would it would it be interpreted as you know they are using the maker system to do it and the maker foundation or whatever entity is not registered with the CFTC it's not clear so I guess we will someday find out you probably before me so tell me how people have been using dye yeah so I mean that's a really sort of broad like it's it's very interesting because actually it adoption of dyes so far it's not really that that great right compared to if you look at something like you ACC which is a much newer stable coin but then actually already now has a much bigger supply but and and I think it's because what we're seeing with like the way that the eye really is positioned is kind of as you know it's it's more like a platform it's more like a tool for others to build something on top of rather than being you know like a product in of itself so like basically what we're seeing is very like there's really as really that has really been used in a lot of different ways but still at relatively small scale and at the same time there are a ton of different projects that are building on top of it right so there's a lot of different projects out there that are right now in the process of building some sort of system that uses dye as is decentralized stall value and I think if I shouldn't like probably the best example to mention of like a a serial a kind of like a very useful and very interesting use case is that there are a lot of startups around the world that used I the payroll to international employees right because actually doing payroll as a start-up is very difficult actually and it's been done like it was done a lot with Bitcoin in the past and now it seems like a lot of the companies that have been doing that there they've actually started to use die for it because this allows them to even avoid the volatility of doing it right but still getting that incredible convenience of being able to just pay salary directly to this you know regardless of where the person is and then in addition to that there's also just a lot of trading and decentralized exchanges right in fact I think pretty much all the volume on the decentralized changes in mysterium is mostly what I owe meaning that's used as the for app it for trading pairs yeah so do you like you know if people for instance want to trade you know if they just want to speculate in the price of aetherium with the 0x protocol you know they'll like you know then they might go on radar relay and trade dye against teeth right it's a little going to die where they want to hedge their exposure and then they'll take the die and they'll purchase a wood when they want to speculate the price and and that actually generates a lot of well some demand for dye right because there is a whole ecosystem or like a whole economy around trading eath against against iron across these various decentralized exchanges yeah I was looking at the maker tools website which is amazing for people who haven't seen that I'll link to in the show notes but one thing that stick out at me is that dye has a pretty high velocity which I think indicates that it is being used as a medium of exchange sometimes it's as high as 3 to 6 which I tried to find this out for Bitcoin and I did find it a chart and it showed that at least especially more recently in Bitcoin trades or sorry bitcoins velocity is in the 1 to 2 range or even sometimes below 1 so um so I think you're right that it is I mean I guess as this table coin it probably makes sense so something else I want to ask you about was you know you kind of described how everyday people are using it but I know that me Gordo has also entered into some business partnerships such as with wire which is a blockchain money transfer company can you describe some of those different business partnerships and how dye can be used by businesses yes I think one of the things that really sets like the maker project apart from many other creative spaces how we've managed to really like penetrate and both into the real world and in some cases right but and also just like create this momentum of many different crypto projects that kind of get tied together by all adopting die or adopting CDP's and integrated with maker in some way and I mean it's really a lot and I think we you know we have partnerships with almost all kind of like the the major decentralized Cryptologic at least on particular on the etherium in particular but yeah so wire is a really good example of something I think is really like it's a really it really makes sense I mean is really useful both in the in a sense that it's very good for the maker ecosystem to get access to this kind of service because not only is wire and unwrap right so not only is wire a point that's gonna interface between money in the bank instead of the fiat world and then the crypto world through dial but also die actually provides a lot of utility to wire it because wire is also you know why are also powers remittance services right like some money transfer and die is really used like that's one of sort of the the top use cases with die is to use it as a liquidity backbone for remittance so there so actually wire is just one of many that that are doing that using Dyer and and again like I saying like it most of the partners and most of the the projects of the integrating diet they're still working on it like a lot of it is still not live yet another really cool example is our major partnership with trade shift the trade shift is one of the biggest supply chain platforms in the world they actually have more than a million companies on the platform that use trade Schiff can of s they're like almost like Facebook for business or something so it's like a software like it's a it's an internet platform that the companies used to kind of like maintain all the relationships with each other and especially small businesses it's really important for them to have access to this kind of system so they don't have to do so much paperwork but the other other problem the small businesses have is that you know when if you're a small business and you sell some you know some product to a big buyer that that buys let's say it's a million dollars of products from you the way it works in the international like an international trade is they'll buy those goods from you and you'll send it to them but they're not gonna pay you until like three months later or sometimes six months or in some places like in Asia it's even like they'll pay you whenever they want to which is kind of crazy right so that's really like just like an example of how the global economy is very unlike it's kind of like built to disadvantage to the little guy in many cases right like the well you'll see big companies kind of like squeezing out these kind of terms out of small businesses because they just have no other choice they just have to do it and so any when you when you're this kind of situation where you've sold your product but you're not gonna get paid until several months later what you can do is you can get what's called trade finance so you can actually access financing that sort of gives you a bridge loan basically like you can get some some credit during this period where you still haven't get paid but you still want to do more business right you want to buy more materials so you can build more stuff and you can sell it to even more buyers and so with trade shift what we're doing is we're building we're actually using blockchain technology to build a new kind of marketplace for this kind of service where we'll actually be able to really put the small business at the center and and create something that is you know really really has the efficiency and also like transparency and just like the really it's like built with the right values to create something that just improves you know the conditions for small businesses and it's all based around the fact that you can actually tokenize you know you can't organize an invoice right you can take an intake so you can have a small business that is going to get paid you know a million dollars from its big buyer three months from now you can actually turn that sort of future million dollars into a token and then you can have people buy that token at a discount so the company gets paid up front but to gets paid slide lists but but then the good news is they get the money straight up right and so what we're doing with trade shift is we're implementing this kind of tokenized system using die as a settlement currency so you can you can buy these tokenized invoices with diet and then when they sort of mature and and the big buyer pays out you'll get paid out and die and that just makes it very convenient to access and also means that we can actually open up this market like the market for first for trade finance to the entire you know the entire financial world and the entire blockchain economy yeah there are whole companies now in the FinTech space that do this and it is a huge business but you're right that it depends some of the companies do take kind of a big cut like they they really are pretty aggressive with the discounts but you're right that I think this could potentially be even more liquid than it is now if it were in a blockchain based cryptocurrency so so we'll see what happens there but it's already kind of a big business and there's a lot of FinTech companies that are already working in that space I also wanted you to walk through examples which you sort of mentioned briefly that dye is being used in the decentralized finance system and listeners will know at least some parts of that system because I've interviewed Dharma dy/dx compound 0x like like just a bunch of these decentralized finance protocols so what are some examples of how dye is being used in that system yeah I mean I think that once you mentioned uh probably some of the best examples of that I think compound is maybe the first one that blew up a bit where people because so what compound does is actually kind of like a more generalized version maybe also gets a most simple version of of the multikill analyzed system actually where there just isn't like there isn't a native stable coin but rather there is kind of people who can who can deposit as its into the the platform a kind of like lend out those assets and then the others can come and deposit other types of collateral to then borrow those assets and they actually held a poll where they asked like what stable how and should we add and most people then voted to add died so they added died as this is a stable current on the platform and that meant that you were now able to if you had like if you either had bought died or even if you're using a CDP in the in single L die you were able to lend out that died on on the compound platform and people would then use assets like order rep I think actually primarily it was the the main asset that was that was used to then take out sort of a like compound CD piece basically and borrow that that died the people lending out and the the interest rates they were really high so at first it was really popular like you could get something like 10 percent per year or something for depositing your die into it so um that's all a lot of activity and it's an interesting example of how you know the you know like how you have two projects two platforms and actually synergize right because in a completely permissionless manner right because basically what that meant was that the multi collateral functionality was now built on top of maker already right because now you could actually go and you could put in rep and you could borrow die just like you'll be able to do a multi collateral die and yeah and 0x is another great example right and of course it's well I mean it's obviously that's the that's the first big example right because it's a it's a pretty old project it's been alive for a long time and I actually not sure which serie extra layer is the biggest nowadays but but at least radar relays I think it's one of the oldest and I think it's actually the only I don't know what you call them I can like it's the only kind of like pure zero extra layer that like that does the 0x protocol kind of like the the og way that it was meant to be done where they directly exposed the orders in the blockchain and since the beginning they've they've primarily been about trading ething against AI and I think it's really cool right because that meant that the people have actually been able to like like you blocking users have been able to go to this platform and and speculate on the price of aetherium just like they would do on on any centralized exchange but just without having that centralized exposure right so you can do it without any risk of getting guards well yeah this this whole thing is just so fascinating the more that I learn about the whole thing and you've been such a trooper for powering through this super long interview but as listeners can tell there is just so much to unpack but I do want to circle back to something that was mentioned at the beginning of the first episode that we did on maker tau which is you talked before about how you felt like there was a cultural shift with maker tau and something I had been thinking when I was learning about this whole system you know about how people have to put up their own collateral the management of the smart contract is their own responsibility they have to manage this risk that their position could be liquidated etc so I used to cover personal finance and I know that a lot of people don't even understand the basics of budgeting and saving let alone something maybe this complex I like I used to be one of those people there's no judgment there I for a long time really was terrible with my money so how much education do you feel like you've needed to give people for for them to use maker correctly and do you feel like that's some kind of barrier or hurdle to adoption I mean that's an interesting like subject right because I think actually that and this in fact sort of ties into the whole question about regulation as well right I mean the thing is in the end like they've the view we've had in maker for a long time was actually that we didn't really want to go out random people in because because you really got to know what you're doing when you start playing with something like a governor's song like NPR that can be inflated to infinity or similarly if you you know if you start opening a CD P that can be liquidated and give you a thirteen percent penalty right so we have like we do a lot of education and it's and it's basically it's it's really focused on taking people that already are sort of pretty smarter have been able to learn a lot on their own and then really getting them into the core of the community and get them in and kind of try to get them prepared to actually participate in the governance and the risk management of the system but ultimately you know we haven't you know we're not really like our goal has not been to to you know have the tag this take this beta and then go out and how like push it out to the regular people or how I push it out to the mainstream I mean it we build it it really still as a technical demonstration of what we were able to do right and so really like I would say regular people currently I think only really dye the dye functionality is what's available to them right I mean because pretty much anyone would be able to actually obtain the I in the wallet by you know by like I mean actually it's not even easy to and she's not even that easy to buy diet currently but well okay I guess you can buy it in kind based nowadays but I mean you could at least receive it in your wallet from your friend right like anyone can do that and and that I think that's really good right because I mean diet that's kind of the thing that I mean if you don't know what you're doing and you kind of play around the crypto you should play around with a stable horn right don't play around with something crazy volatile I mean so I actually think that's that works pretty well right that CDP's are quite difficult to use and then MKR is incredibly difficult to understand and and and difficult to even obtain and in the future all of this stuff will be made you know we've really be made very easily available to everyone but but it has to be done in a way that's safe right and in many cases that we'll be in in collaboration with you know with like you know with regulators or institutions and and basically like you know that exists to protect people who don't know everything about finance whenever from themselves right from and and and off from like crew good salesmen that hits them a little bit too much on the advantages and when I write and I'll convince some innocent guy to over my crazy CDP or something like a and I think also actually tied back to what really what the regulator's again really looked for right is and again because there's this like in this especially in this current element of they're still not being any clarity and still not really being any clear clear guidelines right it you know there is this concept in in in securities law that's them called a manner of sale right like so it's like it's not just what your your cell like it's not just what transaction happen but it's like what kind of marketing and communication happened before right and there's a very big difference between someone you know learning just someone being able understand finance and learning that they have access to let's say go and use CDP's right and they can actually use that to take a very favorable loan for themselves and then versus someone going out and being like you know creating some Google Ads and being like hey by my car and or something you know or like use my interface and and gamble with them CPS or something right that's a huge difference between that and and definitely what like the one ways of aggressively going out and getting people who maybe not exactly what they're doing to get into some complicated financial contract that's when you know like it's that kind of like you know I would call an aggression right that I think it's going to be what like where the the question of the regulation will really apply right because it really becomes a met like it becomes a question of protecting people who may not be able to protect themselves hmm yeah that makes sense I think that at least we've seen so far with the enforcement actions that if they detect that there was some kind of exploitation I guess that was going on in the way that the promoters were trying to get people into the system then that definitely plays a role which is why we saw some of these enforcements I got celebrities and stuff like that but we will you know as we've discussed on this episode there's there are a lot of question marks that I mean about regulation of this kind of thing however at least in this short period I think I think this is a an incredible always commenting on Twitter and other places that I say interesting a lot but I really do think that this is an interesting project and that's why I use the word interesting because when I say that I actually mean that but one other thing that I noticed is before we recorded placeholder VC noted that it took that maker issue to about 200 million in loans in the first year and that for perspective they said that Lending Club took five years to originate two hundred and fifty million dollars in loans although they did concede that wasn't it's not totally apples to apples so um certainly there is a certain amount of traction that you're getting and yeah I guess we'll see how it plays out well it's
