minds of everyone in Bitcoin over the last few years and that is how to scale Bitcoin in the last two weeks this has become a much more urgent question will Bitcoin split into two versions and if so which coin will become the dominant one heads up that this is a longer intro than normal but some background is necessary so we can dive into the meat of the discussion for the last two years the community has been in a debate over how to increase the capacity of the network which currently caps the data in each block of transactions to one megabyte that works out to about a handful of transactions per second blocks have become increasingly full sometimes delink transactions who are making them more expensive than they have been in the past the Bitcoin core developers who've been managing the protocol for the last several years want to keep the limit at one megabyte but make the network more efficient they propose a technology upgrade called seg wit which stands for a segregated witness that would reorganize information in blocks effectively enabling a greater number of transactions per block the reason the debate has hit a fever pitch has to do with another proposal called Bitcoin unlimited which would do away with a one megabyte limit in favor of a flexible cap this winter it had been gaining support from an increasing number of computers on the network then in mid-march Bitcoin core supporters perceive that the team behind Bitcoin unlimited would soon be bringing online a significant amount of hashing power that would enable Bitcoin unlimited to achieve what's called a contentious heart fork basically they would be able by brute force rather than community consensus to create a second version of Bitcoin it's not necessarily a bad thing if the majority of miners decide that they support a certain version of the Bitcoin software but in this case the conspiracy theory went that it would be a small number of people and if they control the network then Bitcoin would no longer be decentralized as one of my sources said it would be no different from a financial system that was controlled by say bankers or high-frequency traders in New York or a government however as you'll see from this episode this is only one interpretation and not necessarily the truth it took me a while to decide which guests to put on the episode the debate has become so politicized I didn't want to do a show where listeners would be prejudging the guests comments or where my podcasts would just rehash the finger-pointing that we've seen on Twitter and reddit but I believe I found a couple guests who will be able to have a thoughtful discussion about the debate Jeff garsik is the CEO and co-founder of block a blockchain enterprise company whose co-founder Matt Rose AK was an earlier guest on the podcast Charlie Lee is the director of engineering at coinbase and also the creator of litecoin welcome Jeff and Charlie thanks Laura it's great to be here yeah thanks Lauren Jeff let's start with you tell us your history with Bitcoin how did you hear about it and what has your involvement been over the years well after spending ten or fifteen years in the open-source community with one of the world's largest open source projects Linux it was a very natural and interesting to jump on this new cryptocurrency bandwagon in July of 2010 what I call the great slash dotting of 2010 there was a story on a website amusingly labeled news for nerds which described this currency which had no central bank there was no company running it it was not a product from a company it was a you know something totally new and totally different a set of disorganized decentralized computers all collaborating together to create a single currency with a supply that could not be manipulated by politicians bankers users etc and as an engineer I was naturally skeptical I have thought many times how would we create this just absolutely wonderful decentralized not run by one company or government type of approach and I I didn't believe it I thought that there had to be some tricks so I looked deep enough and because it's open source it's open to inspection by any engineer with the knowledge it impressed me it really did work and that's how I got started I got started by contributing more and more changes to the software eventually becoming what they call a Bitcoin core developer one of the more noted developers in that project for several years so from 2010 until present I've been involved in the Bitcoin project watched it grow and seen it through many bumps turns hills and valleys you know are you still a core developer I'm not I'm building a company right now that the idea behind block which you know we can cover in depth at some other time was generally where do we how do we mature an ecosystem that's still a sort of volunteer driven download it's yourself type experience how do we take that to larger businesses that don't necessarily have the engineers on staff with this knowledge they don't necessarily have the ability to support it 24/7 and so really I took a break from core development to take Bitcoin to a wider audience and Charlie what about you how did you hear about Bitcoin and how have you been involved sure I first heard about Bitcoin in early 2011 it was from an I think a wired article on Silk Road the drug marketplace that only accepted Bitcoin alright so Bitcoin was or is a unsensible currency and that really threw my interest because I saw it as kind of like digital code and then in late 2011 I created like coin which is a fork of Bitcoin also popularly known as silver tooth bitcoins code and in 2013 I decided to quit Google which is where I was working at the time and joined corn base as the second engineer and and then I helped coinbase build out G next exchange and also start supporting etherium and like coin and I'm currently the director of engineering at quantis and I should also mention that your brother was the last guest on Unchained and he did talk about how you are the one who introduced him to Bitcoin okay so let's dive right into you know the the main topic of today's discussion between these two choices that are being talked about a lot in bitcoins egg white versus Bitcoin unlimited can each of you describe for me which one of these you support and why or or if there's something else you support sure so I try to have much more of a deeply nuanced view than this or that I think that the the one of the biggest questions that has been facing this community for many years is really how do we upgrade Bitcoin consensus rules and the consensus rules I like it too or draw an analogy to the US Constitution the consensus rules in big coin are the rules that every participant in the network must adhere to otherwise the network considers their transactions invalid and so that is a very big inflection point in terms of governance if you're upgrading to new rules potentially you are introducing new features which changed the currency supply it's it potentially introduces rules that change how bitcoins are spent there's basically just like anytime you change the Constitution it's literally anything can happen both on the benefit side as well as on the the risk side and just like in law it's intentionally set up such that it's very very difficult therefore to change the Constitution the foundation foundational law of the land in the United States similarly you don't want to make it easy to change the foundational rules of Bitcoin otherwise Bitcoin really wouldn't be Bitcoin so it's really been a story of I think how do we upgrade Bitcoin number one in a way that doesn't break Bitcoin and this is why a lot of the sort of Bitcoin core segregated witness supporters have been focusing on the safety of the upgrade is how do you upgrade the network in a safe way and there's also and this is where a lot of the community divide comes in is there's the feeling that if you travel put this upgrade down a particular path ie segregated witness then you're putting Bitcoin down a specific economic path which is potentially not what many in the ecosystem wanted so I think that that's really the the fundamental issue here it's not Bitcoin unlimited versus seg width that's really just the question the day and obviously why we're having this podcast but it's really is it that Bitcoin core path or a protest path and I think that that's really a signaling for a protest path rather than for a Bitcoin unlimited itself and Jeff when you say that you know where you think the community divide comes in is that one of these has a specific economic path with it what what is that economic path yeah basically you know again describing blockchain it's you sometimes you have to use analogies one of the analogies I use is that the the block capacity that we're talking about the way Bitcoin works imagine you have a never-ending line of buckets that are filling up with water and the water that's going into each bucket you have a certain amount of bucket capacity say one liter every ten minutes and that's sort of where Bitcoin is is we have one megabyte every 10 minutes on average and the way the Bitcoin fee market works is that each bucket the space in that bucket is subject to competitive bidding and so I attach a transaction fee to my transaction it's a push style transaction as well as all Bitcoin transactions are and I'm bidding for space in that bucket and if sufficient people bid above my bid then my transaction comes later after those other transactions that bid higher and what we're talking about here both was segregated witness as well as Bitcoin unlimited and some of the other upgrades is are we going to increase that bucket size and what happens when you increase that bucket size it's just like when you wave a magic wand and increase the housing supply in San Francisco is this has market impact this has impact on how much fees are bid up how much transactions appear on the network and as we're seeing today at higher transaction fee prices some businesses are priced out of Bitcoin completely shape-shift and bitpay have both sent notices to their customers indicating that transactions below a one to five US dollar mark are economically infeasible to process through their system and as the transaction fees on the network which are around fifty cents to a dollar depending on when you're listening to this podcast that prices out many smaller economic transactions and so that is really getting to the heart of the debate is more about who is picking this value how much transaction capacity there is how do you upgrade that value what is the governance around that upgrade because just like it was mentioned earlier in this podcast that fear that miners become the the FOMC the Federal Reserve of Bitcoin you have the same fear that folks who are authoring the segregated witness are also picking and choosing those economic attributes and so that's the larger discussion I think and what you're seeing here is interesting because early on bitcoin was often praised for the fact that you could send money for a much lower fee than you would over for instance the visa network so you know people would offer or or and it wouldn't even be visa it didn't even have to be these that could be you know any if you compare it to any of the traditional financial services like you know international wire transfers or remittance services or whatever so it's interesting how you're you're saying that some of these choices are actually a resulting in fees that are somewhat comparable but just to get this on the record so you don't really see these two choices as being the choices so how so what would you say is you know what you support no absolutely I think that segregated witness is a great sort of Lego block or foundational set of features for Bitcoin something that I just tweeted out I guess your listeners will it'll be several days old by the time they hear this that litecoin is actually trialing segregated witness on the litecoin network and one of the my criticisms of seg wid is not a good or bad but much more of a nuanced view of it needs more testing and the litecoin network is going to provide that it looks like Bitcoin unlimited on the other side of the scale is very new and doesn't meet many of the criteria for a safe hard fork many of the ancillary pieces of software such as the wallets that hold and manage digital assets the front end client applications they are not in my opinion ready for a an abrupt Bitcoin unlimited style hard fork so I definitely have a much more nuanced view I think that segregated witness as a soft fork has poor governance properties but segregated witness is a hard fork has much better governance properties and but that that sort of distinction is probably a podcast in and of itself but ultimately coming from one of my previous projects which was putting you know specking out a satellite that puts a blockchain in space it was a ulta there plenty of puns around that it you know failed to launch never never got to space etc but one of the lessons learned was that there is a nine step ladder that nASA uses to gauge technology readiness TRL or technology readiness level and since NASA deals with so many new unproven tech analogies that just appeared in the lab and they have too many years down the line do planning to decide are we going to invest tens of millions of dollars in this in the lab feature in the hopes that five years from now it will be in space flight ready flight proven each feature and blockchain technology bitcoin needs that same evaluation that technology readiness level and so what we have at bitcoin today is we have a capacity solution that increases capacity a little bit and it's a voluntary upgrade that's seg wit but it really is it appears unlikely to address those high fees to a notable extent or we have a another solution that is software is equally unprepared for Bitcoin unlimited and so a pragmatic honest view of both of these technologies I think leaves some room for criticism on both sides so I think that there needs to be a base block size increase along with segregated witness so I think there needs to be both but the problem in sum is that seg wit and lightning Network which is predicated on seg wit as a payments replacement is simply not ready it's low on that TRL technology readiness level scale as a payments replacement and so therefore bitcoin is sitting at a decision point where payments on chain are being priced out by high transaction fees and the proposed replacement is still years away okay before we can to because a lot of this stuff is really pretty detailed but let's just turn to charlie so the way that I originally a phrase this question is Jeff was a choice of Segway versus Vic owned and limited but in a way you could also praised it as Segway versus just bigger blocks in some form which do you support and why I do I do support the Bitcoin core side which is segregated witness it said witness is not actually incompatible with bu or bigger blocks I do think that we should do segregated witness now today because it's safer and in a year or two if we still need to do a block size increase we can do hard for it then to increase the block size so that's my position and I like to talk a little bit about the background about why we're coming we're reaching this impasse today it's because the way I see it bitcoin is initially when people first got into Bitcoin like three four years ago I think four five years ago Bitcoin was like the perfect money right it was everything to everyone it had high security decentralization low fees fast payments basically just worked perfectly for both store value and payments but unfortunately as the block size the block rewards decreases over the years you kind of had to choose pick and choose you got Bitcoin can either be good at store value unsensible transactions or it can be good at payments it can't really be good at everything anymore and I think this is a trade-off that eventually we had to make so for on chain payments and the reason why Bitcoin core supporters are very conservative is because we don't want to lose the decentralization aspect of Bitcoin and with that we lose the uncensor ability so there are tons of payment options out there today Bitcoin is not better than any of the other ones the one thing that makes Bitcoin unique is the fact that it has unsensible transactions and in order for Bitcoin to scale on chain today it would have to risk this feature for it to compete with other payment methods so I think the the strategy the plan for Bitcoin core is to keep this special feature of uncensor ability with Bitcoin and scale off chain as much as possible via lightning or other methods and if we have to and in a few years we'll have more better idea about how much we can scale on chain with about hurting the security and decentralization of Bitcoin and at that time were more able to make a decision to increase the box size okay so just for listeners who aren't familiar with lightning and and some of these you know so-called second layer payment channels and stuff like that can you just describe that in lay terms for someone who maybe is new to this concept yeah sure it's quite technical but I think the general idea is that instead of putting your transaction on the blockchain and mine and confirmed by a miner the transactions will be shared between the payer and the receiver and it's not broadcasted so the receiver if both sides have a transaction of a paying B and if they need to they can broadcast the transaction on the network and it can pay more to B and then they would replace the transaction with a transaction where they pay where a pay is more or the opposite of B wants to pay a money then they replace that transaction with a newer one where a pays be less and lightening that work also allows to have multiple parties so a can pay B but going through an intermediary so it pays someone else and that person pays B so again it gets quite complicated but the idea is that it becomes kind of like an IOU that's off chain but eventually can be settled on chain so we won't use any of the it won't require any network fees until it settles so in the meantime you can move money around with very little or no fees paid to the lighting nodes and only when it settles on chain would you pay what you need to pay the Unchained fees okay one other thing that I wanted to ask you about was your support of segregated witness last year your employer coinbase supported an effort that I guess it's even still ongoing although not very robust right now which is called Bitcoin classic which proposed bigger blocks did you at that time support Bitcoin classic and your blocks I supported it to a certain degree I think if at that time I mean the community is ready to upgrade to two megabyte blocks it's just that it needed to be safe so I needed like more time for for the code to be deployed and tested and then for people to upgrade and make sure everyone is upgraded before the fork happens otherwise you might have a split in the coin so I think it was clear back then that it didn't get it didn't get the it didn't get it didn't have consensus like not everyone was on board so that's why Bitcoin classic or pushed for a two megabyte Horford did not go through so and bitcoins the concourse answer to that is segregated witness which is a soft fork which is a safer upgrade which also gives us effectively two megabytes or close to that and it's done in a much safer way and I do support that today because the code is ready we just need miners to start state signaling for it and for it to activate so it connected me as quickly as two to four weeks and this is the safest path forward today so then and either you or Jeff could respond to this but why is it that we've only seen support for segregated witness at less than 50% it's kind of stalled around like 25-30 percent I think why is that so right now segregated witness is is being activated with minor signalling so we're basically asking the miners to tell the rest of the network when they're ready to enforce segregated witness and there's this whole controversy with bu and some of them the some of the pools and miners support bu and feel like segregated witness will undermine their position so they don't they're not signaling for it so unfortunately Bitcoin mining is is not it's pretty centralized today in terms of a few big pools and most of the miners being in China so being centralized it makes it it makes it such that a few big players can actually decide whether or not to push through segregated win this or our spork for bu okay and then the last thing actually that I wanted to ask you charlie was about this trial of Segway on litecoin how does that work and once we finish the trial how will that affect what happens with Bitcoin yeah so we decided to also adopt segregated witness for litecoin and hoping that miners for like coin would more easily push through segregated witness and just recently f2 pool start it's the largest like coin mining pool started signaling for Segway so it's starting to look more and more likely so once Segway it actually activates on litecoin then people can actually test out lightning transactions on the like run network because there's then you can transfer real value so you can actually test and then there may be people who might want to steal from a lightning Network transaction for example so there'll be real world testing and I think after with enough we were testing people and miners and poles on Bitcoin might feel more comfortable activating segwayed and therefore lightning on Bitcoin also and that's that's what I'm thinking okay great I just want to pause things right here to bring in an important word from our sponsor on-ramp the best companies in the world obsess about branding killer branding will transcend

the future you can learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp com I'm seeking with Jeff garzooka flock and Charlie Lee of coinbase so one of the things I wanted to ask you both about is these potential nuclear options that are on the table in one of my recent stories about the potential heart for guy found that the two quote unquote sides which so someone on Twitter said that here there are no sides in Bitcoin but I think you know we can effectively say that these two teams are don't really have the same vision which are core and unlimited and unlimited nuclear option is that if it obtains the majority of hashing power on the network and splits the blockchain then they could attack the minority chain to make sure it doesn't survive and cores nuclear option is to because you know Korres created is made up of the developers is to alter the Bitcoin software so that won't run on current mining equipment and that would completely cut miners out of the system how have we gotten to this point where both sides are considering or even threatening the other side with these nuclear options well a lot of that really comes down to there's there's just such a low level of trust between the two sides you know rewinding back to 2016 there was a meeting in Hong Kong where the miners met some of the the Bitcoin core team and there was an agreement of there would be segregated witness activation if there was also a base block size increase and you know without going into this or the back-and-forth drama there at least on the miners they their their field that their trust is pretty low they feel that they made an agreement and that was broken by the other side and so things just sort of deteriorated from there in the community there are a lot of companies myself included that are have been trying to build bridges between the two sides such that they can come to the table and avoid these nuclear options that are really to the detriment everyone in the market I think no one really wants to see any of those happen and also it's it's really going to be a case of if that happens the miners potentially segment themselves away from the economic majority and so thereby hurt their own income and there's also the potential for on the other nuclear option segmenting yourself away from where the Bitcoin gets its most security which is that hash power security against transaction reversal and against transaction censorship and so a lot of these I think tend to be chess moves that the vast majority of the market participants the Bitcoin holders they don't really want to see either option happen and Charlie what do you think yeah I mean it's kind of like nuclear weapons in real world right they're not really used and it's just to prevent war right so it's a threat of nuclear option that forces the other side to behave kind of so it's it's a bad idea for bu to fork at 75% start attacking in binary chain and it's also a bad idea for the for Bitcoin to change people work to destroy the value of all the Bitcoin miners out there so it's just two nuclear options that are just hoping to prevent the other side from making a stupid decision of doing something that'll destroy that would be bad for both sides so one solution that's come up both in this podcast and I've seen it multiple times on social media and I've also had multiple sources say something about this to me and this is also something I've wondered myself and this is actually what Jeff referred to when he was talking about that Hong Kong agreement why is it that the core developers are against doing both segment as well as increasing the block size this is as I mentioned just a suggestion I've seen so many places people seem to think it's kind of a good common-sense compromise but why is that not on the table well the dude not hard for today it will take at least six months some people think it needs a year or even two for a safe hard fork so its segment is available today right if you - star signaling we can have larger blocks in two to four weeks so why compromise why spend the work to kind of come up with a segue + 2 megabyte fork that would take at least six months to activate when we can activate separate today and then worry about increasing the block size in the future and also I want to mention that the current core is not a centralized grille right it's a bunch of developers that all work on Bitcoin together and they don't come with to your meeting and make decisions so like the few core developers that went to Hong Kong explicitly said that they're speaking for themselves that they would try to convince the team to hard fork but they can't be sure that the team will agree or that there is consensus consensus among like everyone that a hard work is necessary so it's it's not easy and coming out of the Hana agreement I think there was some misses understanding where the the miners felt that Bitcoin core as a whole promised this and because it didn't happen they are they felt that they got that the agreement wasn't wasn't up but that's not the case because it's it's - Bitcoin core developer speaking for themselves and Jeff how do you see it well there there's definitely a difference of opinion on a few points for example the the claim that seg width will deliver capacity in two to four weeks is something that segwayed supporters have been claiming on social media since 2016 so it's something that clearly is not meeting optimistic expectations number one and number two when you hear that claim the the two to four weeks to capacity it's also misleading because it's a two step upgrade seg wit requires that people who create new transactions upgrade security sensitive code the code that as digital signatures to each transaction this means embedded hardware wallets financial exchanges that process millions in liquidity every day and so that's a big risk surface to upgrade and that's part of the reason why there's a lot of reservation towards seg wet so the the seg wet upgrade is a two step of one miners signal that capacity can be brought online it's not brought online it can be and then that second step is that there's a voluntary opt in upgrade that slowly over time increases capacity and so some of the problems therefore are we have today these high transaction fees some people are running realistic predictions of five dollar transaction fees by the end of the year even if seg wet activates and so we we wind up with this point where we are still not solving the problems that users in the field are actually seeing today yet as was mentioned earlier in the podcast they want to wait until segue does or does not fulfill these capacity predictions and then as a next step six months a year down the line will decide well the segue experiment did not bring the desired capacity online now we have even more transaction fee to bear now let's look at Plan B and so that it's that lack of Plan B and that lack apparent lack of time pressure that a lot of people are fairly critical over this is an optimistic projection after optimistic projection and yet transaction fees are going up and capacity is not coming online so there's that's that's sort of the larger picture that a lot of people are looking at right now is that there's a lot of cheerleading for an in the lab solution that probably is not going to deliver for another year or two in terms of bringing cheap payments online so something that's interesting to me about this discussion is both of you are engineers so I'm sure you are much more familiar with the Bitcoin software code than I or many of the listeners and yet it's interesting to see how two people who are kind of really steeped in that technical perspective have a really different view so I think this actually really kind of encapsulate what is going on in a broader community where you have these pretty strong opinions about how technical decisions will affect the network so even as we're seeing this play out just in the small microcosm of this little podcast and between you two when you look at that and these differences how likely do you think a contentious hard fork is earlier you were saying oh it's just the nuclear option to you know kind of try to get your way but it really sounds like you guys or and the two sides have very different views more immediately I tend to think it's pretty unlikely I think that it's more chess moves and signaling and the vast majority of people on all sides of this debate they they want a Bitcoin that's stable that works that doesn't lose all the properties that we all cherish today and so I think everybody in the room really wants the same thing at the end of the day but if we look at it very very philosophically is ultimately any of these block chains and Bitcoin is not unique in this regard again going back to that analogy with the US Constitution eventually in one of these block chains and a theory Ameet classic as an excellent example you are going to have a philosophical agreement excuse me disagreement and if you have a philosophical disagreement you're going to have a unresolvable fork you're going to have the blockchain equivalent of a stock split where previously you had one coin and now you have two quantities of two different coins and this is chaotic this is awful from a market perspective it's awful from a brand confusion perspective and so I all parties are really working hard to avoid a contentious hard fork that's that's why it's mentioned so much is because the outcome is not desirable at all but from a philosophical and policy standpoint a lot of people do feel that if not this year if not next year then eventually these chains will have a unresolvable a philosophical split and well you will see two communities going two different ways and Charlie what do you think - you think a contentious hard fork is likely or not in the near term I don't think it's likely I mean I agree with Jeff I think slaw chess moves I'm not sure if this all right I'm optimistic that segway would activate and lightning would help solve this problem where lightning or other future technologies will help solve this help make Bitcoin a useful as a payment method as it is as a store value and we can please both sides of the of this camp but if it can't then there may be a split where people who care more about Bitcoin being a gold replacement on one side and Bitcoin as a kind of a payment replacement on the other side and that may be a good thing when that happens but today I don't think that's gonna I don't think that's good for anyone for Bitcoin to split into two coins like if theorem did so since you're both saying that it is a distinct possibility let's just run through this hypothetical let's say that there is a contentious hard fork in which one the chain obtains the majority of the computing power and then maybe you know attacks the other two you know or maybe not maybe there's just two chains which chain do you think will be considered the quote unquote true Bitcoin after that that's that's a what the sort of the the ten billion dollar question isn't it and it is from a social context taking a step back it's really just something fascinating to ponder and watch because you have for example some of the people who are feeling more pain on the payment side they're saying that bitcoin is the coin with the majority hash power that's the most secure chain from a minor perspective and then you have obviously a vastly different philosophical position that says that it's a more about following the the Bitcoin core developers and it becomes a centralized on this party versus centralized on this other party type of divide neither of which is is productive or good for Bitcoin in the long term the user experience you would wind up with similar to e therea Meath classic you're holding Bitcoin one day and then the next day you're holding Bitcoin a and Bitcoin B and equal amounts and you had you and the rest of the market has the subjective task of figuring out which is the real Bitcoin and I don't think they're in it are any easy answers and that's why people are really working so hard to avoid that sort of chaos and Charlie what do you think which one will be will be considered the truth a coin well I think we're Bitcoin really brings value is the sensor ability aspect of it so if one side is sacrificing security centralization for payments I think that bitcoin is not gonna be worth much because if bitcoin is going to be start competing with like Visa then I might much rather use my Visa card than that Bitcoin versus whereas the other Bitcoin the one where for the core supports is the one where we kind of optimize for security and decentralization above all else and that is what I think brings the client real value were I can pick anyone anywhere in the world without risk of being that transaction being blocked by a third party or the government and I'm for that I'm willing to pay like even the dollar to for moving the moving money it's much faster much cheaper didn't up currently a wire transfer is well so something that's interesting to me is I saw that on Twitter and involve rava Conte the CEO of AngelList who is also super smart thinker in the space he said that he thought that chain that would be considered more valuable as the one that was thought to be more decentralized and I think right now people have this conception that the one that like let's see that there were two chains one of which was kind of like run bike or or would be the one that Corps supported and then the other perhaps like the Bitcoin unlimited chain people have this seem to have this perception that the Bitcoin core chain would be the one that would be more decentralized but I found myself when I was reporting this story about the potential heart Fork really questioning how I know which one is decentralized because you know if we're gonna follow kind of the current narrative which is that or at least the one that was popular a few weeks ago where Bitcoin unlimited represents this you know small group of people trying to take over the network but then when I interviewed one of the people who's involved with Bitcoin and limited his name is Jehan Wu and he's he owns some of the mining companies and and also one of the money equipment companies he you know really trying to emphasize to me that he's not forcing people to choose one side or the other particularly you know not his side and you know if I think over the years about all the different developers who've left Bitcoin core because they supported big blocks and found that they they were not able to stay on the team and have that view then I started wondering well maybe you know there is kind of like a small group of people who believe in small blocks who are now in control of the software and then I really just went through this whole thing where you know I just felt like well it's kind of impossible to tell which side is quote unquote decentralized I don't know what you guys think of that is first of all do you agree with Nepal that the more does the one that's perceived to be more decentralize would win and if so how will people determine which one really is more decentralized yeah there are there are absolutely many elements to decentralization and either side of the argument has some centralization aspects to it and so there's a lot of people who believe and I'm one of those that there's a lot of developer centralization as well part of the what we've seen of the debate over the past several years it is there's been a lot of compromise and multiple efforts outside of Bitcoin core but at the same time that that Bitcoin core has not really compromised at all and so there's been that aspect of it the higher transaction fees without having a replacement like lightning actually deployed ready in the field this gets bent back to the technology readiness is this pushes people on to centralized systems and so if you're priced off the Bitcoin network then you're going to be using a much more centralized platform to interact with the Bitcoin network at all and so that that leads to a sort of a negative adoption factor that a lot of people are concerned with where it's a gap between killing the current payment experience which is where the current transaction fee levels are pushing and that gap between when the next solution is going to be ostensibly in optimistic projections available and so that that introduces a lot of centralization on the platform side as well so it's a minor versus dev decentralization argument on both sides of the debate and just to elaborate on what you were talking about here mention it sort of pushes people onto centralized platforms you mean that these second layer solutions that we talked about earlier that those are platforms that won't be run by certain companies and people will interact on those and then those will tap into the Bitcoin network is that what you yeah yeah that's right is you know factually speaking Lightning is not in user hands today this wonderful payment network that is supposedly the hope and savior of Bitcoin payments it it doesn't exist from a user perspective it's not deployed in the field and so if you're looking to do micro payments or small economic payments with Bitcoin your choices are very very limited it's basically you can go to a coin base you can go to a 21 Coe or a blockchain dot info a very limited number of sites and if you transact between two users on that site you can avoid the high transaction fees the dollar per transaction that you're seeing on the network today and so economically these high transaction fees push you off the Bitcoin network and onto one of these websites that mitigates that high cost and so that's a centralization factor that we're seeing today and Charlie I wanted to direct that question to you as well the one about how navall sees this as something where does centralization will be the determining factor and you know I asked first of all do you agree in second how will people decide which is more decentralized well I don't fully agree that like you can really measure the centralization and that determinant school wins in and if there's a split it's more about like who the community or it exchanges or develop wallets or the merchant processor is what they call Bitcoin is and that's Bitcoin right so if all the if all the exchanges and wallets all all follow be use chain and it's called that Bitcoin then that would be Bitcoin so or everybody source if they follow if they keep following the Courchesne and keep calling that bitcoin and it's bitcoin right so it's basically like bitcoin is decentralized so people whatever they want to consider to be a bitcoin is the coin and that's what's gonna happen right but do you feel like there's any particular thing that will make people say to themselves oh that's the real bitcoin I think if there is a contentious fork it's gonna take a while before we really know which one is the real one and I think what would determine that is just market value so if both coins are traded on an exchange people would buy the one they feel like is the real Bitcoin and that would determine what the real bitcoin is so because you're both technical people I also wanted to ask you about other open source efforts how do those tend to decide upon controversial questions like this and what lessons could the Bitcoin community learn from them and what processes do you think maybe the Bitcoin developers should adopt to avoid these kinds of stalemates the other open-source projects don't have a similar problem with Bitcoin where there's a huge network effect right so if there's a split you have to it's without the network effect you're not it's not the same so with other open-source projects if there's a contentious decision people can just split off fork off to a different project and keep and release two different products and there's no issue but with Bitcoin I think it's work it's much more an issue where there's a lot of value in it and a split coin is bad for both sides so everyone wants to stay together but there's also this tension where they don't agree on a certain thing so I think we're seeing something that's happening for the first time and that's people don't know how to how do you kind of wrap their minds around it yeah absolutely it's very different from for example my linux experience where like Charlie said if someone disagrees with the quote-unquote benevolent dictator the project leader leanest Torvalds you just fork off your own software and you're your own new project leader and the market decide which is the better piece of software and adding the economic component in here Bitcoin is what makes that decision points so different is you're really changing not just software but the the economy itself and so number one that has to be done with great caution great care no one wants to break the 10 billion plus machine that is Bitcoin and at the same time it's getting into a dangerous untried new ground where developers are asked to make economic decisions developers potentially are picking winners and losers in the market with the intended and unintended consequences of those decisions and so that's number one new ground and number two quite frankly a position that developers really don't want to be in and so trying to find that governance solution is a ongoing problem to be solved and have either of you seen any proposals that would help deal with this problem I think it's uh getting into how do we make laws in Bitcoin which is something that people don't want to do so it's it's almost a paradoxical question how do you govern the uncover Noble how do you create a how do you make a decision in a decentralized leaderless environment and so that's really boiling it down the problem that we're all facing right now and if anyone had a solution that was workable and obvious and successful I think we it would already be on the table well I happen to be talking to emaan good seer the other day who is a Cornell professor who is also a cryptocurrency expert and he said something about you know kind of running different tests to see how different decisions would affect the network in and the economic system is that something that people have considered absolutely it's a matter of simulation whether you're simulating a technical upgrade or whether you're simulating some of the economics but simulations are by their nature imperfect they absolutely help but it's a economy or market driven instrument and so ultimately how do you simulate the real world how do you simulate market dynamics price dynamics application a running on Bitcoin has a demand and set of actors different from application B and so that's ultimately the difficulty in simulating or analyzing this how do you simulate the real world okay so right now and I'm glad that we brought up the economic question right now when people don't know what's gonna happen in Bitcoin do either you have any particular recommendation for what people should do with the Bitcoin that they own should they sell it should they hold on to it what are you guys planning to do I think they should hold on to it in their own like wallet so that they have control and just forget about this whole issue and come back in like a year or two things will be settled or at least well it'll be in a better shape than it is today and just yeah don't worry about it and the price will be probably be higher Jeff what do you think yeah I absolutely agree with Charlie there is that this will get sorted out I'm very bullish about Bitcoin in general I think it's an amazing invention and you have a ton of smart people motivated to make it work make it continue working so that's really the non technical advice is one of the great strengths of Bitcoin is that you control your own money it's not an IOU and a bank it's something that you can hold control over in its entirety and so that echoing charlie is the definitely the advice I would give as well as hold your keys have a high security environment setup and it will sort itself out in time great well thank you both so much for coming on the show can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you Jeff block comm and we have the we're the only
