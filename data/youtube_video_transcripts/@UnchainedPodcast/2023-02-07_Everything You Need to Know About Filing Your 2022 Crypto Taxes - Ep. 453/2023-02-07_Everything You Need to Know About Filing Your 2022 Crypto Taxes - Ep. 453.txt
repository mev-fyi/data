Professionals in mind visit stern.nyu.edu msft hyphen Unchained today's topic is crypto taxes and hopefully this episode will help the audience through what is likely one of the more challenging parts of their interest in crypto here to discuss our Shihan Chandra Sakura head of tax strategy at cointracker and Lawrence zlatkin VP of tax at coinbase welcome Shihan and Lawrence pleasure thank you for having us yeah thanks for having us heads up everyone this show is all about crypto taxes however the interview is meant for informational purposes only nothing mentioned in this show should be construed as Financial or tax advice please consult a tax professional about your own personal situation I've been doing a tax episode every year about this time for quite a while and I should say that of course as usual we will be focusing on paying taxes in the US sorry for international listeners but this is just the majority of the audience so that makes sense uh given that my audience likely knows at least some of the basics maybe let's just start with some of the new things at an overview level Shihan can you start us off with what's new this year when it comes to reporting crypto transactions yeah sure so uh 2022 uh was a tough year for the industry uh I mean now we're in the tech season uh there are some minor updates uh that you need to think about when filing your taxes first of all that Infamous crypto question has been updated by the IRS we first saw that appearing on the 2019 tax return it went into 2020 2021 and now we're seeing a much more expanded version of the 2022 tax form so make sure you uh answer that question correctly and what is that question now the 2022 question is at any time during 2022 did you receive sell exchange gift or otherwise disposable digital asset so the the major update for 2022 is that in the previous years the question was referring to Virtual currencies in 2020 uh they have changed the term to capture digital assets which is a you know much more broader interpretation so therefore like you know clearly things like nfts and anything that's in the blockchain that that's considered a cryptographically secured asset uh if you interacted with them you will most likely have to check yes for that question so that's one of the major updates other than that there were a couple of uh Chief Council uh memorandums that was issued in the last couple of weeks uh we can kind of go into that in details in the coming minutes but the major update is the question has been updated but yeah make sure you answer that question correctly going forward just to add to what Sheehan said I there's also I think some I don't think there's no more clarity but there's more focus on staking and what staking represents and whether it's taxable the service itself has added sticking to the question and also put it on its website for the first time so I would say there's probably just a renewed interest people in this audience might have heard of the Jared case I think shahana referred to it last year a question about timing of inclusion and so that we can talk a little bit about that and how that was resolved but I think staking itself is front and center the eth merge from last fall September I think all that has played a very important role Dynamic role in 2022. great yeah we'll dive into the details on a number of those issues later in the episode but why don't we now just lay the groundwork for some people obviously lots of meaty things to cover from 2022 including bankruptcies and ecosystem collapses but let's just make sure people understand the general Basics around how crypto is taxed in the US as far as I understand there's one foundational concept that people need to grasp which is capital gains tax Lawrence can you describe which types of crypto transactions are taxed under this fashion and how capital gains tax works so capital gain sex is really sort of a mechanism for taxing disposition of property and crypto is viewed as property that's one of the few things the government told us is way back in 2014 and noticed So when you buy sell or trade or exchange crypto whether in any particular form tokens Bitcoin eth nfts you're going to trigger what we call a capital transaction and that will generate capital gains or Capital losses most people think of it in the form of Securities so when the buy style holder trade stocks or bonds when you trade those then that triggers also capital gains or losses the capital gain system within the US is sep stands apart from the regular system what we call ordinary income which is wage income so you can also do crypto trends that you might be paid in crypto that's a very different concept still triggers income but it doesn't necessarily trigger capital gain income capital gain income is taxed at a different rate it's netted so capital gains first have to be netted against Capital losses that's going to create an issue from what you raised earlier about the treatment of losses which unfortunately has has created more of issues in 2022 than in Prior years we can talk a little bit about that because the answer for losses is a little bit I think less beneficial it can be less palatable for most people but it's a separate mechanism of tracking calculating you net all that out when you end up with net capital gain you pay tax at a maximum rate typically in the US of 20 percent if you're an individual you might be subject to genetic investment addition there's a surplus tax supplemental tax that's applicable but that's it's less than the ordinary income rates which are usually for at least High income individuals in the 30s so it's a separate parallel system and so there's another way that crypto transactions can be taxed which is as income what types of transactions or events would you say are taxable as income so wages so you might receive crypto in the form of wages actually the way the government treats that is you receive wages then you purchase crypto so it's not quite the same way but um if you receive compensation in the form of crypto then that's also going to trigger um you will be subject to income tax staking is also yield rewards other parts of the ecosystem that trigger what we call ordinary income that is actually taxable as well but it's not taxable at capital gains rates it's taxable as ordinary income and that's taxable at a higher rate for most high-ended individuals and Shihan would you have anything to add on that uh again just to to summarize like here uh especially if you're brand new to crypto just remember these five situations uh and if you fall into these five situations you could have a taxable event and a liability so number one just catching out crypto pretty self-explanatory if you have Bitcoin you sell it and made a profit you gotta file taxes uh number two is crypto to crypto trades even though you're not necessarily realizing cash in hand you still have to pay taxes if you're making a game the third situation is when you spend cryptocurrency or an nft to buy a good service that trigger is a disposition event and and you might have a taxable liability there number four is when you earn crypto that also triggers a taxable event that's what you know Lawrence has described you can earn cryptocurrencies to Wagers staking income mining income yield interest type products and Etc and the final the bucket where you could be subject to taxes would be ar drops and hard Forbes are you know airdrops happen frequently in the industry you know I'm not sure if we had any significant hard Fork events last year maybe we can talk about ethereum emerging in the coming minutes so yeah so if you have those five situations uh you will likely have a tax liability and you will also have to file additional forms to report your information to the IRS and pay the uh the taxes all right and then let's quickly clarify which types of crypto activity are not taxable hobbling the mere purchase of crypto and holding it in your wallet the transfer of crypto from one wallet to another wallet is another good example of things that people might do that is non-taxable anything that does not what I call monetize or create something different is going to be uh non-tactical uh stock Fork so the eth merge I think is also viewed by most people as a non-taxable event because it was just essentially the change in the code underlying code it went from proof of work of course to proof of stake but it was essentially the same token so just the reformulation of that token itself is what we view as a non-taxable event um so those are probably the best examples I think of what people might be doing and what about receiving crypto as a gift so a gift is generally not it's a gift is usually taxable on a donor so there are limitations just in terms of how gift taxes is against another system of tax that's apart from the income tax system if you exceed to give tax exemption then that might be subject to give tax but that's applicable to the donor the dhoni does not pay tax it's a gift so it's not considered income in the traditional sense and you actually receive it with what we call a carryover basis so you receive the same basis that the donor had in the asset beforehand so any built-in game associated with that is going to be taxable to you the donee when you dispose of that asset as well and um just in general what behaviors would you advise crypto people to adopt when it comes to transacting to make tax time easier to make tax time easier uh I would say keep track of your assets keep track of basis evaluate what you've actually purchased and sold you can try to trigger gains or losses to net so that you end up in a better position overall within your tax if you've done this if you do this before the end of the calendar year so it's essentially sort of to recognize what assets you've had gains and losses if you have built-in gains maybe have losses that you can trigger the rules for crypto are a little bit more generous in terms of what we call washed sales so you can actually trigger even if you want to hold on to the asset it's not true for the regular Financial Services World Trade fine but if you most people believe that watch sales don't apply to crypto so you could actually trigger a loss to offset gains do net out essentially at zero so you're not taxable on those even if you purchase that asset again afterwards as long as there's a meaningful change overall in terms just the time they're both separate transactions so it's really just calibrating your gains and losses so that you can effectively manage them as effectively as possible while keeping track of those assets what was your basis that's probably one of the hardest parts because unless you're transacting only on one exchange and coinbase we'd love for you to do everything in the coinbase ecosystem so we'll track that for you but if you're doing other things within D5 or transferring it to your wallet or doing things elsewhere no one's going to keep track of that better than you do so and you have to essentially select report gains or losses even if that is not reported on a particular exchanger given to as a transaction report all right and obviously this is a new and emerging area and um you know the tax system is sort of or the tax code is sort of applying a kind of existing situations on a crypto so are the processes around reporting crypto codified to the part where it's obvious which forms you're using to report different activities and if so what are those forms yeah I guess at the individual level uh the forms that you need to file are very clear let me kind of walk you through some of the forms uh we spoke about that crypto question on the front and center of the 1040 so the 1040 is like the the form that you file to report not only your crypto but all of your you know taxable uh income and expenses so 1040 is one form 89.49 and Schedule D are most commonly used forms especially if you have capital gains and losses coming from crypto disposal or crypto and also nfts schedule one is another frequently used form there's a line Z where you can report other income coming from staking income uh mining uh income that you do as a hobby or any type of other miscellaneous types of income that you earn in the crypto space and there could be other forms like you know Schedule C for example if you have like a mining operation that you're running as a Trader business so you can report that income and also you know claim some of the expenses so yeah so those are the main problems uh just to summarize the 1040 489.49 and schedule d uh to report your capital gains and losses schedule one to refer to other income items and schedule C if you have like a Trader business where you do a mining or even could be a staking operation as well all right and then last question before we dive into some of the crazy events from last year and how uh those applying to crypto taxes what are typical mistakes you see that crypto people make when it comes to their taxes I think Lawrence mentioned this briefly if you're dealing with a stock broker uh or like an employer people are used to getting some type of tax form that summarizes your income gains and losses and they're kind of used to kind of looking at that form and reporting that on the form 1040 and and you're done with your tax work unfortunately the crypto roll uh it doesn't happen so the burden of kind of reconciling your transactions across multiple wallets and exchanges fall on you one of the big pitfalls that we see in the space is that you know you're in the tax season and you don't know how much gains or losses you made during the year so not tracking that cost basis uh could be uh time consuming like you know especially if you had to do it right now in a in a uh in a quick period of time so just know that there are like you know certain crypto tax software that you can use to kind of mitigate that and you can kind of automatically calculate the gains and losses so so not tracking your basis and competing against and losses is one of the biggest pitfalls that that we see I would say the other uh misconception that that a lot of some some folks in this space have is that uh they think that crypto is anonymous therefore it's completely invisible to Regulators unfortunately that's not the case there are a lot of ways that the IRS knows that you have something to do with crypto it could happen through this 1099 reportings that exchanges uh do like for example if you receive some type of 1099 form that means your activity has already been reported to the IRS by by that broker so if you do not report that in mind on your tax return there will be a notice IRS also uses uh the subpoenas to exchanges and if your name and information get leaked as a result of disappearance uh then they can audit you and see if you really reported those amounts another way Regulators know about your crypto is through is by using some of this software like chain analysis cyber trades they can you know essentially go through the blockchain activity and assign real world identities to Anonymous transactions and wallets so just don't think that crypto is anonymous I mean it's it's it's publicly available in the blockchain and it's visible to The Regulators so make sure that you report your activity to the IRS and other Regulators in fact I I would reinforce corset so the IRS if it's focused resources on anything and crypto in the last few years it's been on enforcement so it is quite concerned that there's Under reporting related to crypto so resulting in the question that we discussed earlier a lot of focus on John Doe summons which shahan referred to so and the mistake that I think most people make something that is surprising to me but if people don't if they don't receive a form and that form is put in your shoe box and then given to your accountant let's say in March or April if you don't receive a 1099 you think well I didn't earn anything nothing happened so therefore I don't have to report it but the form is nothing more than just a mechanism for providing information to you and to the government so there's a matching system associated with that but it's really just informational so that you can then file your tax return and the fact that we don't really have a 1099 mechanism yet for crypto we're expecting it most likely sometime this year to be introduced in the next year or so you most likely including if you're a customer of coinbase you're not going to receive a 1099 B which is the most typical form but it doesn't mean that you're not subject to tax so you should remember as shahan just I I think made very clear if you have income then you should still report that income and don't assume the IRS won't know about you because they have tried other mechanisms have focused enormously on trying to find out where people are and whether they're reporting income or not all right so now we're going to get into the meaty bit of the show um one of the sad things as I noticed from the script last year that the first major new trend whose tax implications we discussed was nfts but this year it's going to be bankruptcies so for people who have become creditors in one of the many bankruptcies or liquidation proceedings what do they need to know when it comes to their taxes oh boy this one's going to be a hard one because I think um this is where the rules are very strict and they're going to be somewhat painful so losses in the taxes the tax system is essentially predicated on recognition of them and a bankruptcy in and of itself is not a recognition of that so you might have lost a substantial amount of money in Voyager Celsius Genesis FTX and yet you may still not be able to recognize a loss associated with that so you're kind of stuck with where you are itself now if you have built-in losses for crypto assets as well that itself is also not a taxable event so Bitcoin dropped from 60 000 to let's say 60 no um eighteen thousand at one point now twenty so you have a built a loss associated with that until you sell it or dispose it of it it doesn't create a taxable transaction so let's separate those two and transactions in for themselves so if you do something if you recognize a lot because you sell or trade it let's say a coinbase or an exchange that is a taxable transaction that will trigger a loss that loss if you're an individual is limited if unless you have capital gains to three thousand dollars can be carried forward but it's essentially a very small number that you can then use which is why as we discussed earlier one of the benefits of managing your portfolio is you might be able to balance those losses against gains because we manage losses against gains but both of those depend on recognition events the IRS itself released a chief count Council advisory memorandum just actually about a month or so ago on the very point of what built-in losses represent whether cryptos and security whether you can take the we call it worthless Securities worthless stock deduction you cannot I mean I think they've made that very clear you can take a general Capital loss if you trigger a loss but you can't you can't trade as a worthless stock deduction which is another available Avenue for that may have been applicable to crypto now when it comes to bankruptcy that's not as I said before a recognition of that so it really creates I think it will create a lot of anxiety for people about what to do whether they can do anything now in there is a theft loss deduction that you can take this was used in the Madoff Scandal so in the Madoff Scandal the IRS actually provided pretty beneficial and favorable guidance on how to take theft losses associated with the Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff and to the extent that you think that there's been theft for example I will you know with FTX or another platform you think that you've been misled your money was absconded with it was taken away your assets you gave it and thought they were custody and then they weren't they were used for other purposes you might be able to benefit from a theft loss now this is a little complicated because there are very strict rules of how to claim this you have to be it has to be engaged for profit so you have to purchase your your crypto for profit the theft itself has to be a genuine theft bankruptcy is not theft so I think let's get that make that clear but if the bankruptcy is the result of theft then you might be able to argue that there was theft and as I said I I would really love the IRS to provide guidance on just as they did with Bernie Madoff because of the number of people involved if you really were if the iris felt if we have a broad enough number of people who are implicated by this I think something along those lines would be quite helpful overall in providing some support for what I just described but you can read the guide the birdie made off Ponzi guidance is still out there so it's still applicable it's not like that's disappeared so you can still rely on the overall Contours and that involved when to recognize it how to document it how to report it but a theft loss might be available other than that you just simply have the recognition event as I described earlier which is that you have to sell the asset have to do something with it and therefore trigger an actual loss and just so I understand this part that you're saying about theft that would mostly apply I guess to customers of ftx.com which you know technically was restricted from you know I'm not sure exactly how to define it's like Americans or but I'm sure there's probably Americans with like corporations elsewhere or something that participated on ftx.com so maybe some group like that because do you think the theft provision would apply to the to customers of FTX us or again it's very fact specific so you know FTX us also is in bankruptcy we're not entirely certain about how assets were co-mingled with FTX us itself you know we've heard what SPF has said about whether those assets can be sat if the liabilities can be satisfied but I think it's relatively unclear we might still have U.S participants on the fdxu um the foreign exchange based in the Bahamas so that might be applicable as well there are other examples of misleading statements that have been made elsewhere within the crypto economy either with you know I don't want to name names but I think you know there's other examples where people would argue probably that there is misleading they've been misled their assets haven't been used in the way they thought they were being used they can't withdraw them they thought they were just making deposits they were statements made about whether it was fdisd insured and it was an FDIC insured and so when those entities went into bankruptcy the claim is that there was fraud being committed once you have fraud I think again fraud is not theft bankruptcy is not fed I'm simply positing a possibility for someone otherwise I just think we have a very on just on just unsatisfactory answer for most people which is you can do nothing you can sit and wait which is I don't think a very helpful um answer but if you want to explore the Contours of theft I just think there is sort of this Avenue that was provided I think very favorably by the IRS um in 2008-2009. okay so just to spell it out for people like put it sounds like you're saying potentially people might work with a tax professional to find a way to argue that that situation the Madoff guidance applies to things that occurred with Celsius or Voyager or Genesis there are so many bankruptcies I'm wondering if I'm missing one but uh 3ac um is it it sounds like that's what you're saying like it depends on your situation you'd want to talk to a tax professional who knows the Madoff Pro guidance okay okay and she hun you know what do you want to add on on that just to add like uh if you're curious uh you know let me say uh uh Bernie made of guidance we refer to revenue University in 2009-20 so you can actually Google it and it's easy to read PDF it clearly lays out what you need to meet to claim a deduction as a Ponzi loss take a look at the PDF talk to your Tax Advisor and and see if you're eligible to take a deduction under that provision and and also ask the Tax Advisor if it even makes sense for you to kind of explore that Avenue sometimes you know those deductions could be limited by other court section of the tax uh you know your tax profile so it's not even worth considering some of this deduction because it could get disallowed by other things and then the second thing to consider is that is it even worth kind of claiming some of this deduction and opening your tax return to other you know audit risk and Etc so that's where you kind of need to know your specific fact patterns and your overall tax profile and also work with like a good Tax Advisor so then you can kind of Leverage that promption adjustment uh before kind of jumping into saying that oh I want to take a deduction or write-off I mean write-offs uh they also come with you know certain risks so make sure you work with a qualified advisor before looking into these deductions this because it's a summer sophisticated deductions at writers okay and I might have misspoke earlier because I just realized that Genesis bankruptcy wasn't filed until 2023 so for those taxpayers uh is it that like that bankruptcy doesn't affect their 2022 taxes at all again a bankruptcy itself is not a definite it's not a taxable event so you'd have to have a lot so you'd have to have something that was triggered through a transaction the transaction could be you disposed of you I sold my crypto or my interest in you know whatever I invested in um in Genesis to let's say shahan or whatever so I think that again that's that's sort of the defining feature for when you can actually claim a loss so you have to have a taxable event at that point you can then recognize whether it's uh whether you get a capital loss or not um and they're able to use it and then against capital gains if you're going to try to make the argument as I said earlier that there's been theft involved that actually can arise even if you don't have a tax book because that depends not on what you do but rather what the recipient did they stole your assets they did something other than what they said they were going to do with them and what they represented that they would so that could happen even prior to bankruptcy you could if there were some you'd again this is proof so it's fairly complicated you'd have to document have documentation if you had proof or some evidence that was satisfactory to the government then you might be able to make the argument that it's not all right so in a moment we're going to talk about other kinds of losses in crypto but first a quick word from

huge events in crypto this past year was the collapse of Terra Luna how are people who were invested in a coin that went to zero or close to it going to be taxed can they deduct that loss um does it depend on whether they sold um or you know what do you do in that case where the value of what you own just simply plummeted to almost nothing so again I this is going to be unsatisfactory because it's not really dissimilar from what we just described with bankruptcy so the mere reduction in value of a crypto asset is not a taxable event and the government as I said has made that clear in a recent Chief Council advisory memorandum so when something and they actually use an example very similar to what you just described a bit terrible they described an asset a crypto asset that diminished a value to like to not something nominal um even though it might still be traded it was essentially nominal in scope and would certainly didn't represent what what it was what purported to be and they They concluded then a it wasn't a security crypto is not a security under the Internal Revenue code under the definitions of the code so you can't claim a worthless Securities or stock deduction which is what's available so you have to sort of depend on the original lost characterization that as I said requires a transaction so if it's still publicly traded and you dispose of it you will trigger a capital loss if I sell that even if I transfer it to shahan and he pays me whatever nominal value there is for that that would trigger a loss as well again based on those loss limitations that we described earlier which are for most people pretty unsatisfactory as well they're limited losses naked losses Capital losses and that parallel capital gains and law system are deductible only to the extent of three thousand dollars that are carried forward so you can use them in future years but that's not a very substantial on that maybe you know depends on your facts and circumstances obviously but that's effectively limited however as I said if you have other capital gains that you triggered that's that's why it's very useful to go through your portfolio and see what you can trigger at the end of November December and figure where you want to be and whether there are things you can do affirmatively to balance out those to them and if you triggered a capital loss you weren't able to use it in 2020 for 2022 tax year you can still do that for 2023 and then use it for 2023. yeah again just to just to add more color on what Lawrence mentioned so if you read the IRS tax code if you want to have like a capital loss there must be a Sello exchange of one asset with another asset so again you could have coins or even nfts in your wallet that have effectively gone to zero and you might be thinking okay how can I write this out because I don't want to do any activity uh and in in most cases some of these coins don't even have any liquid markets uh that you can find easily so you might be thinking okay I want to take this as a writer to reduce my taxable income now the the memorandum that was used by the IRS uh clarified that you can only take a capital loss uh if you you know have a sale exchange uh so the my advice to you is that if you have coins or nfcs that have gone to near zero values find a market or or somebody unrelated party to dispose of that asset and get something back it could even be like point zero zero zero one dollars uh but that establishes that Capital loss that's allowed by the IRS versus kind of going into taking the deduction as a worthless secure deduction or kind of abandoning it again these are so much sophisticated deductions whenever you are kind of you go into taking deductions or losses kind of other than Capital losses which are very frequent then you you return a new tax profile kind of get uh surfaced uh among other tax returns that they are socs because these are very Niche type of deductions so again if you if you have this situation I highly recommend you talking to Tax Advisor because they can look at your risk profile and your entire tax profile and guide you the right way to take the deduction another comment I would make is that you know you really only have the capital loss mechanism and the disposition or taxable exchange that Jihan described there is a lost provision in the code but essentially it was eviscerated in the tech uh in 19 in 2017 um and so there is no availability for General losses within our existing system right now this deferred until although it was limited by you could put it on miscellaneous expense that's no longer available at least through 2026. all right and you know because this is I also have to ask how would someone who was the victim of a scam or rug pull you know apply that to their taxes uh let's say you know I'm I'm sure you guys probably follow Zac xvt there's a number of these rug pulls especially with nfts so if people put their money into something for the promise of something that wasn't delivered then what can they do with that on their taxes well I think again that raises the question of whether that's theft so the only thing you really can do is if you feel that you've been subject to theft you might be able to take a theft loss deduction along the parameters that we just described in the more probably elaborate mechanisms that may be somewhat more sophisticated mechanisms but scams or scams so um essentially they result in the same they arise from the same criminal activity which is effectively someone has stolen your money what do you do you argue that you had a theft loss if you had the asset for profit you might be able to argue along the lines of the Ponzi scheme guidance that you had a theft and therefore can take a theft lost addiction which is not only available and not treated as capital which is beneficial it's just a just more readily once you're able to claim it actually is a more useful deduction even than a capital loss deduction okay but it sounds like obviously it would just depend on the facts of what happened it sounds like that's not just something anybody can claim they would have to argue for it is that correct yeah so I I think the the sad part of all this is that the rules are actually pretty clear so losses are very limited in our system of Taxation in terms of their usability to offset income and so either you have a capital lost which depends on actually having a closed transaction such as a sale or exchange or disposition or you can potentially in these more extreme cases argue that there was theft so there's a theft loss deduction that is if you can make the case for it can be very beneficial beyond that you're pretty much out of luck like just it's like bankruptcy losing money the tax system is based on income it's not necessarily based on Law at least for individuals like we're talking about businesses and we're talking about netting income for profits it's a very different set of facts and a different animal but if we're talking about individuals who are just investing for profit the system is unless you have Capital gazed offset that you're not going to be able to use your Capital losses unless you have a theft loss you're not really going to have that available to you unfortunately just a just the way the system is built and in a similar vein how should people handle it if they had crypto in say a D5 protocol or in a cross-chain bridge that either got hacked or as happened with mango markets the markets were manipulated and then drained How would how would that um fall or yeah what um how would uh tax the tax code apply in that situation um so that's an interesting one because I think with G5 protocols where people don't realize and this is just a trap for the unwary perhaps when you enter into your D5 protocol and you've pulled or you've done something on the defy itself you might have actually triggered a taxable transaction mostly I think in the prior world at least prior to losses other than the fact that you just described people probably didn't realize that they might have actually triggered gains at that point because I think once you commingle you put it on a different platform you do something else with it you've done something that in our world can is considered to be a closed disposition transaction and that might trigger a capital loss so at that point you might be all be able to argue that the D5 transaction itself constituted a taxable loss and therefore be able to trigger Capital loss that you can use to offset against capital gain income so there's probably more structure than what you just described with Terra Luna which is just this built-in loss that you can't otherwise claim you could argue that the D5 transaction itself gave rise to a taxable transaction that's again pretty exotic and pretty complicated because some people would argue that in more mainstream situations Defy is simply alone alone of your crypto which is going to be restored at a later point with exactly the same attributes so and there is there is generally pretty favorable rules associated with what we call Securities lending and people like to think that crypto could be thrown or at least um put within that system itself so that with lending itself I think most people would argue that the mere lending of crypto is not a taxable transaction so again that's a little bit of a you know there's a distinction between one versus the other but if you're doing something more I think more extensive within D5 as people have done your as I said you're pooling you're trying to generate yields so you've transferred the asset and ownership rights to someone else that could very well constitute a taxable transaction triggering a capital loss all right so a brighter spot in crypto that people will be interested in is how staking will be tax we've alluded to it um at different points but I want to call out one case in particular that saw a lot of discussion in 2022 and it was mentioned earlier in the show it involved Joshua and Jessica Jarrett and they had this case involving Texas token so that that they had created through staking and they fought for a certain position which is that gains made through staking should be considered income only at the moment that those tokens are sold and it just actually ruled the question moot since they'd already been issued a refund um so is there any kind of broader significance for people that they can draw from this case and apply to um there's taking gains uh I would say um my own personal dude I think these the IRS has pretty much told us what they think about staking so I think um you can of course take your own View and consult you with your Tax Advisor you can do what the Jareds did but the IRS is essentially told us and staking is taxable upon receipt when you have dominion and control over the asset itself so if you have received stake rewards they've they're basically um give return to you in the form of staking rewards in your wallet you've staked yourself or you've validated with a with another validator and you've received a component of that that's going to be taxable upon receipt I would I think I would advise people not to take the position that's not taxable most exchanges including our own we would we have a lot of it we we try to offer a lot of guidance in this area as well just over the overall tax system if you receive more than 600 on a major exchange like coinbase you're going to be receiving a 1099 misc which is essentially just a is a statement that tells you how much taking rewards you have that's also reported to the government it's matched if you don't report it it'll be you'll be questioned about it they do have imagined this one of the things the government does very very well it matches those forms against the income that you then report if you don't report it they'll ask you why now you may take a position that is still not taxable you can contest that you can file a refund claim you can do all the things that Jared's did but in essence I think the government views that as taxable I don't think that's the end of the world actually for most people I don't know it depends on your prognosis or your view about the future if you think crypto is bright as I do I don't know that it's necessarily terrible because once it's taxable it's taxable at the value you've received it which presumably will be a lot less than when you actually monetize or sell it now if you treat it as taxable only at that later Point that's taxable as ordinary income shahan described how that goes into other income so at that point everyone agrees there's a tax possible transaction and you've received something but that's ordinary income if on the other hand you receive the reward you report it you then take a basis in that asset representing what that was when you received it and then when you actually monetize it that will be a capital transaction subject to a more favorable capital gains rate which could be almost half of what you actually would have paid otherwise so again it's not no people are built have this predisposition that deferral not paying tax today is always beneficial but I think we probably have to put this in context I think in many cases it might actually be better in the long run to just recognize this smaller component of income and then take it into account as capital gain at a later point she handy when I add anything on that case yeah again as Lawrence mentioned uh this you know recognizing income today is not the end of the world uh it's a timing difference it's a matter of when you report the income versus how much income you report over over uh the uh the lifetime of that asset the other thing I want to sum of an update of is that again still Iris hasn't issued any official guns on staking the only update that we saw this month was that they updated the digital assets page on the IRS website uh now it clearly says that the staking income and Mining income uh is subject to you know tax consequences so that's kind of like the small hint that we have from the IRS uh when it comes to how to go of us taking income and again nasala's Mission and also as a practitioner I would advise anybody to kind of take the conservative question and report income at the time you receive this taking reward that establishes the cost basis and and when you later sell it you pay capital gain taxes all right so what about I mean we kind of said the ethereum merged that's that's not a taxable event um for the earning interest portion is there anything to mention there um or frankly also the uh the eve pow tokens that people probably received at the time and um in most cases probably sold so I have a lot of questions to unpack um all very good so I think if you so let's take eat proof of work um in some instances you might have been eligible to receive proof of work but you did not receive those assets because the exchange didn't uh doesn't support it so if it's not supported on your exchange it might just be sitting out there and you can't really use it in any fashion unless you transfer to yourself to your digital wallet the system is built on the notion of what we call Dominion and control so if you had a right to it but couldn't claim it and couldn't monetize it then you're not taxable on that upon a receipt you'd have to wait until you can actually receive a kind of dominion control over that asset so I think just more broadly I think most people um believe that the eth merge resulted in a non-taxable exchange with mainstreaming so eth whether you call it ether eth2 whatever you call it that if which became proof of work to proof mistake is non-taxable the proof of work which is tour in our view like a chain split and the creation of a new token the IRS has told us that that is a taxable transaction did that actually in one of the few forms of guidance that we have in a 2019 ruling with Bitcoin cash so that's a taxable transaction as I said just like with Bitcoin cash if it wasn't supported on the exchange and you didn't receive it then you're not taxable on what you don't actually own or monetize but it will be a taxable transaction at that point you mentioned interest I I often a little um wary about when people use that term in the in the form of crypto because interest is for a tax lawyer is basically for the forbearance of CAF Fiat it's not not associated with anything related to crypto so if you own an asset that produces what we call interest I would prefer to call it yield or rewards this treat is miscellaneous income it's not really treated as interest in the traditional sense that may make me just the textler talking and sounds like I'm just talking uh gobbledygook and so it doesn't really mean anything it means something and for most people in the system but it's not interest per se but it is taxable upon again upon receipt just like staking rewards yield if you own a stable coin you receive rewards um if you're on the coinbase exchange and you we have possibilities to earn income through coinbase earn those are all taxable to you um when upon receipt it'll be reported to you if you receive more than 600 but it's taxable to you nonetheless all right let's all now discuss nfts just because this was still a major trend for um a good part of the Year let's just walk through all the various transactions around nfts and how those might be taxed so for instance receiving one selling one minting one issuing one as a Creator let's run through all those okay so when you talk about nfts like is there are two parties I mean you could be an investor or you could be a creative so let me kind of go to the investor side first investor set of taxes are very similar to trading cryptocurrencies or any other coin so when you cash out on nft that's taxable when you go from 150 to another and you make a profit that that's a taxable event I don't know any situations where you can spend an NFD and get a good or service but if that's the case that is taxable because you're disposing of an asset and and that could create like a gain if you earn like royalties uh as an investor to subsequent sales you know that's taxable you typically had to recognize the role of the income at the time you receive it and you pay taxes on that so that's the investor side again very similar to trading coins now for the Creator it depends you know it depends on you know how your how you have set up the business if you have a Trader business or Etc but generally when you sell your nft uh to somebody else that triggers older income for the Creator uh if you're in the business of uh you know selling nfts and again you you sell it you recognize income and if you run your NFD create a business as a Trader business you can also offset uh related expenses against the nft income so that might involve your subscription to software that you use to create the nfts could even be gas fees and Etc that's anything that's essential to running that nft business could be a business expense which you can use to offset that nft income you might also be subject to what's called self-employment taxes uh again if you're doing this as an active Trader business so something to keep in mind and and also make sure you pay your quarterly taxes if you run this as a business because IRS kind of assess taxes uh at a high level for income that you make in each quarter so you if you were to wait until the tax day you might have to pay extra penalties because you didn't pay the taxes to ever do at the end of every quarter so something to keep in mind I think most people associate today nfts with art objects like boarded Yacht Club and collectibles and that's I think highlighted that may not always be the case it's a broad term I just had a discussion about this with the Europeans in the context of v18 indirect taxes so an nft could ultimately become a security or a bond on the blockchain um that essentially is part of your portfolio with Goldman Sachs for example so it's non-fungible essentially non-fungible asset um in the context that Shihan just described which is like the one that we think about the stuff the bees painting or the Sotheby's nft that sold for like five million dollars that might be treated as a collectible a collectible subject to a different tax rate when it's sold is subject to a 28 tax rate the legacy of uh of I think uh when the capital gains taxes were reduced in 1998 or so so it's just taxed at a different rate is still treated as capital and nature as Johan described you can dispose of it that's the collectible component but more broadly it might be lots of other things that might be as we know like I just think this is such enormous potential it's going to be one of the great use cases for crypto going forward you might have an nft in the form of I have the right to use a hotel room during the Super Bowl and so I can then enter it into the marketplace exchange it you know decentralized fashion as opposed to going through a Marketplace an established centralized Marketplace that itself can trigger gain or loss right so it might trigger other types of and that's not necessarily a collectible but subject to a different tax rate overall so it depends on the form itself but the way most people think about it just to be uh to be clear about how Collectibles are treated if you have collectible game that's substitute with tax rate of 28 percent last year another big topic was the uncertainty around how the infrastructureville would affect crypto taxes and yes that is a discussion from 2021 that I think is still reverberating uh to today so has any of that been resolved and if so what are the changes what do people need to know about how this affects their taxes the simple answer is no nothing nothing has changed so we actually know now that the regulations that were promised that will introduce this 1099 reporting mechanism that I think shihana referred to as opposed to produce something called a 1099da for digital asset that's pending in front of so it's left the treasury Department and it's gone to what we call the O Ira that's a regulatory oversight body within the Office of Management and budget they have a time frame that they can their their perspective is what is the impact on the overall economy efficiencies is part of the paperwork reduction act so it's in front of them meaning that the regs are really imminent but so and that we got an announcement so the effective date of the statute actually is to start tracking bases beginning on January 1st so for an exchange like coinbase I think where we clearly agree that we are a broker within the definition of those rules so we would have prepared for that and been expected to start tracking bases for our customers that's not an easy thing to do you have to build systems you have to and that's a fairly complicated mechanism um so we worried about what this ultimately meant with the effective date but the the iris actually did announce um right around Christmas time that uh once the regs are issued they would become as fat those rules would become effective only when they're finalized which we're expecting to be sometime let's assume in the fast-paced world of government that that occurs sometime in 2023 probably won't require us to track basis until 2024 at the earliest and I think even that's pretty ambitious overall based on what we're talking about because we're already in February and it takes you know we would argue a year to build systems to be able to do all that um I don't want to bore everyone but when broker reporting was introduced in 1099-b it took years really even though there were fairly accelerated effective dates it took years for the industry to prepare for that and the IRS to build systems to even take that information in because remember it's not just what we build is we have to stem this to someone and they have to be able to use it in a constructive intelligent way so that does take time so the short answer short and sweet nothing happened of any note in 2022 but we're expecting things to happen in 2023. I think what we've be even more interesting in 2023 is not the broker reporting mechanisms that apply to coinbase I actually view that as fairly uninteresting we're Building Systems to accommodate that we understand that I don't think that's particularly interesting and of itself it's the broader ramifications on defy on nfts whether they're going to be included not what I would view is sort of the non-financial components and also the broader decentralized components where there is no centralized exchange and there's not a built-in mechanism for anyone to anyone to point to who can track these assets the government has been the iris has been I think quite reluctant to ex to essentially exclude those parameters from the reporting mechanism but we don't typically have reporting like to say nfts for example they're non-fungible assets they're typically non-financial in nature we don't typically report retail transactions um to the government there's we can talk a little bit about cash transactions and there's a mechanism for that if you have silver ten thousand dollars but broadly speaking if you're buying and selling an nft a collectible there's no reporting mechanism associated with that so to introduce it here is another expansion of the state and about reporting about privacy and D5 is another area so we don't I don't even know how that's enforceable in the current world I spend a lot of time on this issue because I think it's an important one of what we're going to do the full power of blockchain and Defy is really where we think we're going once that happens the built-in systems of centralized reporting don't readily apply and can't be grafted onto that so I think it just presents challenges of how our tax system will evolve with that but we're expecting some guidance from the government about how they think about that and how they want to apply it to the the broader crypto economy and so I recognize that this show is meant to be you know kind of more like um a Service Podcast for listeners but I'm very interested to hear how you think to you know our tax system can be applied to D5 if you just want to go down to that tangent for a second uh well this is a rabbit hole uh so I mean the the rules we talked about earlier are equally applicable like the tax system is not while the broader Tech system encrypt crypto comes as we know in so many different flavors and so many different varieties but the Contours of whether you tax income and whether it's capital in nature or ordinary that's really no different broadly speaking for 50 000 feet so if you're monetizing earning income otherwise earning you know driving gain from Trading disposing of assets on a decentralized versus centralized platform the only difference is that there's no centralized mechanism that's in the established Trad fire world today or even under broker reporting for coinbase for that to be reported to the government so it's just it's a That's The Power of decentralized peer-to-peer transactions it doesn't mean it's not taxable it just means that the existing mechanisms to report it and to collect tax on it in advance perhaps those are not readily available and that's why I think that presents interesting policy challenges because I we have to resolve if if the full power potential crypto is realized and we migrate more towards a decentralized peer-to-peer world and we can spend a lot of times on how extensive that would be how integrated I could be into the broader economy whether the average person is going to be sophisticated enough to do that we can spend a lot of time on that but if that's a significant component of the future of of crypto of digital assets it really is going to test the Contours of the tax system because it's still taxable people are still going to have to report it but I think the government is very skeptical about whether people actually do so they're going to want to introduce mechanisms to then still create taxability or some type of control mechanism so that people actually report those taxes my own personal view is that digital ID tokens privacy tokens things that can be inserted to The Limited purpose purpose of reporting of Ky sting it to use that term business that people react to that type of thing but to introduce some type of mechanism so that we can have some type of enforceability or reporting of those transactions I think that to me is the amp I certainly don't have answers to these things right now but I think we have to have that discussion because the more it migrates off to that the more it becomes for the government something like let's say tornado cash Monero so it just becomes something if it's totally private it's outside it's not subject to any type of centralized control the government assumes rightly or wrongly that there won't be taxes paid on that and that's going to create an enormous shift of potential revenue from the government to a decentralized platform and ultimately that's not viable for the long term I think we probably all recognize that we still have to pave our roads open our schools so there just has to be some answer to these questions these are now we talked about direct taxes which is what we call income taxes this is equally True For What I Call transaction taxes so when you buy or sell you do the trading of nfts on an nft platform um like openc coinbase nft those may be subject to sales tax and so various states have woken well you know they woken up to the sub to the potential Revenue Source well these are basically just like Collectibles and we tax the transfer of Collectibles how do we do that you can't really do that on any decentralized platform if openc if you're doing this through a smart contract with Eve there's no reporting mechanism associated with that so how do you then report that it's equally true for transaction taxes it's something I talk about with the Europeans about VAT a lot to talk about in this space but and a lot of challenges actually just in terms of how government's going to react to that yeah it's it's going to be super interesting to see how all this plays out assuming that what it is that crypto people want to build actually really pans out the way that they hope um but okay so just to kind of quickly go over again you know things that can help the listeners of the show obviously a number of people are probably using different exchanges or other entities so what kind of help or forms or whatever can they expect to receive from different crypto exchanges or other entities they might use well we have a relationship with a partnership with coin trackers so for more I think more advanced trading but if you go to the coinbase exchange today you'll find a pretty extensive set of of modules and guidance associated with how to pay your taxes what everything we just described I think is described very well um so we give people help in terms of how to think about taxes in terms of what they should report how they should report it how they should treat it we also provide them with transaction history we won't provide anyone with a 1099 B that's we don't think applicable to our industry yet so we don't actually do that we will provide 1099 misc for staking rewards as I described earlier for anything over 600 so I think this is true of all centralized exchanges they'll probably do the same thing um so and you can find that on at least our website so you'll find education modules um just instructions on how to effectively do all this guidance in terms of how to report gains or losses if you're just simply trading on coinbase you can easily track your basis through your transaction history you can calculate your gains or losses if you're doing something a little bit more exotic elaborate if you're transferring from Kraken to coinbase and then or from coinbase to Kraken there's no basis transfer in that again that might be the future but it's certainly not the rule today or you transferred it to your wallet and then you did something else with it in that instance I think shahan can describe what he does but we you know we have links to our Partnerships with various third-party providers that can help you go to The Last Mile what we call the Last Mile in terms of reporting your taxes one of which is a service like coin tracker which does that with more they they try to build apis so that you can extract all this information and produce an intelligent and fashion coin tracker is not the only one so I love shahan but there's there are other competitors as well but Jihan can certainly describe what what he does yeah okay just do add to what Lawrence mentioned uh if you're just a single exchange user say for example you're only using coinbase or Gemini uh I would encourage you to go to the tax Center and and see if the exchanges is giving you the right gain and loss report and coinbase is doing a great job you gotta log into actually and then see what kind of reporting uh your reactions has but if you're a multi-exchange user including D5 say for example you have coinbase icon Gemini account and a bunch of metamask accounts a lot of you know cross-sections going in and out of those places you will need some type of aggregation tool like contractor to kind of connect all those places into one place and calculate your basis and calculate your gains and losses accurately so without an aggregation Tool uh the tracking and applying the right tax rules uh is virtually impossible so make sure you uh use some type of aggregation to to figure out your gains and losses on on which you had to pay taxes on uh this tax season and also going forward as well all right and um now let's just quickly talk about uh you know Corporation taxes there are some companies who hold Bitcoin or other cryptos on their balance sheet and the financial accounting standards Ward recently came up with standards for presentation and financial statements and disclosures how does this affect those corporations um holding crypto so I'll take a step at it uh so so far uh under Gap generally accepted accounting principles uh that public credit companies have to follow if you have crypto in your balance sheet it's traded as a indefinite life intangible asset and if you look at the financial statements of Teslas um you know microstrategy you can see how they're trading this way the bad news is that there's big disadvantage for the company uh for following this treatment that's uh you know that's in the Gap rules essentially when you buy or you know passion of Bitcoin you report that as at the cost and later if the value goes down you have to mark it down and recognize the loss of book purposes however if the market value goes up for that Bitcoin or whatever the detail asset you do not get to mark it up so in 2022 we saw like a lot of you know companies you know Tesla microstrategy they were booking like this massive amount of book classes because the market kind of went down and they were never able to kind of Mark it out for book purposes and that kind of affected uh their financials uh how the industry and investors kind of see the strength of the company but there's good news the good news is that the fast speed Financial economy standard board uh is now trying to create crypto in a different way uh when you hold in a corporation so going forward uh they haven't still finalized a rulings yet but going forward you get to keep crypto at the market value so meaning if it goes up you get to mark it up and recognize the loss for book purposes if it goes down you get to uh report a lot so the good news here is that when an investors look at the financial statements they kind of see the true picture of that balance sheet because the the coin there is now marked to the market so that's that's a good news versus having that previous model where you only uh get to mark it down then you don't get to mark it up when the market goes up all right well this has been a really comprehensive discussion but is there anything that we didn't cover that you feel crypto people should know about their taxes I would say just don't make I think we did cover this but don't make the mistake that just because you didn't receive a report or information from someone that you if you had income that you derive from crypto on D5 or elsewhere that you don't have to report that because you actually do and uh so and the most important thing about owning crypto unfortunately is record keeping because it's essentially decentralized it puts more of the burden on you to keep track of your assets that's benefit overall because the better you track them the more you can evaluate when to trigger gains or losses what those gains losses otherwise are otherwise at some point you may receive a report from a brokerage which has a zero basis it's just like a blank because it doesn't really know what your basis is so it's really on you to sort of keep track and keep good records for associate with your assets so don't make the mistake of not reporting it and also keep track of it and don't lose sight of the need to like the shoe box is not really going to be very helpful anymore yeah I guess let me add one more thing to what Lawrence mentioned uh 2022 was a tough year for the crypto industry uh I don't think a lot of people made any gains but just know that if you sold your assets uh you should claim those losses on your tax return uh we've discussed the limitations I mean in any given year if you don't have any other couple games you can only get to claim three thousand dollars worth of capital losses but say that for some reason you have a hundred thousand dollars worth of capital losses so in this year you get to claim three thousand but that entire remaining 97 000 you get to carry it Forward indefinitely to Future years so in the future years when the boom market returns and you have gains you can use those losses to offset those gains but in order for you to carry it forward you have to report those losses uh in the tax return today one more thing so it doesn't sound like Steve Jobs Here with apple and work for apple is that we didn't talk for charitable deductions so you can and the service actually issued I think shahan referred to this earlier there was a chief Council advisory memorandum on charitable deductions so for charitable deductions you can donate crypto to a charity if it's appreciated it works no differently than you don't recognize the gain or loss associated with the transfer appreciated property if it's more than five thousand dollars then it has to receive an appraisal and people had sort of assumed that because crypto is readily tradable and therefore has a rare to leave what we call a readily ascertainable fair market value through a very efficient mechanism of all the various exchanges that you could simply rely on that as evidence or addition of what you're allowed to deduct the IRS in a fairly harsh probably not inaccurate legally but a fairly harsh memorandum said no you have to receive an appraisal a qualified appraiser from a real qualified appraiser and if you don't then you're subject to penalties as well so there's no reasonable cost penalty even though you said well it was traded on X and therefore was worth more than five thousand dollars so yes you can donate crypto good thing please do if you charitably inclined if you do more than five thousand dollars be aware that there is an appraisal requirement well we'll see a new industry starting up of people doing crypto appraisals for charitable donations um all right well this has been just a fascinating show it's been a pleasure talking to both of you where can people learn more about each of you and your work I'm at coinbase you can go to coinbase.com um so um I think that's probably the easiest I'm on LinkedIn as well that's where you can find me I'm at cointrecker.com uh you can find me on Twitter my handle is their cryptocpa so please replying if you have any questions perfect well it's been great having you both on Unchained our pleasure thank you thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Shihan and Lawrence as well as taxes and crypto check out the show
