thanks for having me lightning is having quite a moment with mainstream services like twitter and sub stack adopting it and paxful the bitcoin peer-to-peer service has also brought on lightning give us an overview of the ways in which lightning is bringing bitcoin to the masses yeah absolutely um so you know our what elizabeth stark our our founder has been saying um you know for for years um is that the lightning labs mission is to bring bitcoin to billions um and that the way that we're doing that um is by building developer tools and infrastructure to let companies like you know twitter whose lightning integration is powered by strike from jack mahler's substance uh lighting integration is powered by open node um who are you know both of those companies are lightning ogs um and then pax fuels come online like they're the ones bringing the end users to the protocol right and we're building infrastructure and so this is just you know a a result of many many years of hard work uh of building up this protocol of you know sharpening these developer tools uh documentation etc etc getting it to the point where the protocol was mature enough that these early adopter companies uh are are coming on board and adopting it and i think it's you know we're going to talk about it here in a little bit but i love this one chart arcane research posted the state of the lightning report say the lightning network report this week and they had this one chart that was showing you know the public network capacity and it's two spikes with the first spike being kind of the innovators and the second spike being the early adopters and we are firmly in the early adopter stage of this new technology and it's just like incredible that our early adopters include twitter and the country of el salvador yeah so speaking of el salvador i would say that that probably is the biggest development for lightning recently um el salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender and they've also onboarded people to the chiva wallet there so what is the significance of this milestone um i mean it's just it's it's an amazing vote of confidence in the stability of the protocol and of the network and i think it's really important just briefly you know there's depending on your estimate and like how you measure the numbers there's somewhere between 15 000 and 25 000 public routing nodes on the on the lightning network and like this is like a real truly decentralized network right like lightning labs does write the dominant implementation in lnd but like lightning lab's proper the company only runs like five nodes right like all of the vast vast majority of the network are run by you know hobbyists businesses entrepreneurs developers etc etc who have all you know independently figured out how to get these things running how to manage your channels how to manage liquidity how to provide like a good experience on the network and so i think you know again years of all this hard work culminating in a nation state adopting it and i like i got to tell you from the bitcoin 2021 announcement until september 7th our team was just you know we had big plans for what we wanted to do this summer and instead it was like oh man we got to be ready for six million people um to you know adopt this like right away like we gotta focus on you know a bunch of the back end you know scaling the database and you know um making sure that the nodes were secure and you know all this all this kind of back-end engineering work that goes under appreciated but and we were nervous to be frank with you um this is a big deal right it's a big deal not just for lighting but for bitcoin in general like this had to work uh and you know it hasn't been the perfect launch by any stretch no launch really is but by all accounts like it mostly works you know people are able to they're able to buy food at mcdonald's we've heard through the grapevine that um you know the most popular restaurant accepting bitcoin in san salvador is pizza hut which go figure i guess bitcoiners just love pizza um that's that seems to be a thing um you know and it's just it's incredible that you know this this country has decided to go on a bitcoin standard and that we were ready for him um i think it's it's a it's a it's a testament again to you know of course my colleagues at lightning labs who are doing like a lot of the heavy lifting but again you know open node um ebex mercado out of guatemala the the kaloy team who built the bitcoin beach wallet like there's just there's so many players in our ecosystem who all went hands-on you know bit refill who've gone hands on deck to make sure that this worked and this is the power of you know a decentralized ecosystem really working um and it's it's you know the other thing that i think is incredible is you know obviously i do business development so i talk to companies um all the time about onboarding to the lightning network and integrating and you know giving their users the experience of global payments and now i have this great line that i can use where it's like look like you may think that this is hard or some difficult thing like the country of el salvador figured it out right like you can you can get on your engineers can make this happen right like we can we can get this to work um so it's just a great testament to all the underlying work that has gone in over years and that we were ready to rise to the occasion and so you kind of referenced this earlier but as we've seen the capacity on the network has grown by more than five times in dollar terms and by about three times in bitcoin terms year-to-date and so um is that due to what you were talking about just all these different businesses um trying to get ready for what they knew was going to be a new influx or yeah it's a really it's it's a really good question um it's a difficult one because there isn't like one specific reason why but in general what we've noticed is there is this trend that happens where developers build new applications and like you know achievable wallet would be kind of an instance of this um twitter onboarding would be an instance etc strike you know developers build new applications they bring new users users produce more volume on the network more volume on the network means more routing fees for the nodes on the network and as they start earning more funds they allocate more capital and that as they allocate more capital of course as we all know like the thing that makes the most news in the crypto space is a chart that's going vertically up into the right and that gets more developer interest more developers build new applications and this flywheel just spins we're again heavily in the early adopter stage now of the lightning network as a technology and this flywheel is spinning right we are now in the steps where the capacity is going up and i can tell you like we're getting new developers new people interested new you know this next wave of application developers are here in earnest and i'm really excited for to see what they produce because you know now volume is now like very consistent um and more nodes coming online means kind of margins for these routing node operators start to depress um a little bit and you know they need to find new sources of volume and new users to keep their business going and so i recognize that you don't work for open node or strike um but you know you do work for lightning labs which uh has helped paxful bring on lightning so just in general i was curious um for you know these more mainstream services that are bringing lightning on how has that happened has it just been general interest in bitcoin or is this lightning companies reaching out or how is that adoption happening that's a great question um i don't know if i could say this definitively i would i would i would bet though that in the spring of this year a lot of that was outbound bd it was like hey it's time we're ready there are all these benefits to you as a company by turning this on um but i can tell you from this starting this summer post bitcoin 2021 like the amount of inbound interest has been like huge um it's been it's been really exciting to see that switch kind of flip a little bit and now people you know and this is again like what happens with open networks and network technologies in general is in the early stages like the benefits to joining a network are not great um you know um they're not huge because there's nobody else on the network but as the network goes like at some point you reach a tipping point where the benefits to joining the network are enormous right like if you can plug in a node open up a couple channels and pay to thousands of merchants all across the globe people in el salvador tip people on twitter you can do all these sort of things like the benefits of joining this network are very large and i think that's what we're starting to see now is like the switch is kind of flipped um you know in our our i write our monthly newsletter and our last newsletter was like you know titled um are we reaching the tipping point like are we there is it has critical mass been achieved i don't know if i can say for sure that we're there yet but like we are certainly significantly closer than we were in the spring so a lot of outbound bd you know now there's you know significant inbound interest and you know the other important thing is like yes there are experts companies like lightning labs um and other members of the community that will help onboard these companies but this is all open source software right like you can you can do it on your own if you'd like and there are you know tons and tons of people on our stores that i talk to every day um that are reaching out and like hey by the way um you know we got our nodes up and running and we just wanted to reach out to like hear if there's anything we should we should know before we announce to the world that this is what we're doing and that's like a pretty cool thing to have happen all right so in a moment we'll discuss more about adoption and the future of lightning but

nod l e dot io slash cash back to my conversation with ryan so the total value locked in bitcoin in lightning is 165 million dollars and that gives it a ranking of 35 on d5 pulse and for comparison the biggest ethereum based d5 protocols have uh billions locked in them like in the teens like ave at 16 billion um why do you think total value locked in lightning is still far less than uh in some of these ethereum based d5 protocols yeah you know so um it's very much an apples to oranges um comparison because for one in bitcoin and in lightning in particular this is a full reserve system like there is no notion of debt um it is all bitcoin there's no money multiple there's no additional tokens that are locked in it is it is all a hundred percent for reserve whereas you know some of these other defense like the whole point of d5 is over collateralized lending right so um you are able to kind of multiply your money and and like increase the total value of that i think one thing that's been really interesting for me because i pay attention um to the broader crypto space is it seems like you know d5 has like clearly found product market fit i don't think there's any denying that but all the things that there that the d5 people are interested in doing are very orthogonal to what we're interested in doing right lighting has always been very focused on transferring bitcoin um from peer to peers it's fulfilling the vision of bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash um and so there is no you know like trading is not like a really big use case on the lightning network you know um lending is not a big there is no notion of debt so we're not doing lending we're doing payments right and and value transfer and remittances and micropayments and tips um etc etc um so they are just different i think um and i think it's it's it's fine it's not we're not the lightning ecosystem we're not necessarily trying to say oh you know we're d52 right like we're it's payments it's always been about payments and i think the very last thing that i would say is the whole point of lightning is capital efficiency like you you have bitcoin that you want to earn a return on you're putting it in the lightning network because it's able to make you you think more money than putting it in you know block fire or whatever the decentralized protocol is to earn a yield on your bitcoin right and so it is all about how many times can i turn over my capital very efficiently it's been very interesting to me watching the d5 uh conversation happen especially like i know hayden adams the uniswap talks about this a lot where he's like we're focused on volume as a metric not total value locked right like the total value lock being small and the volume being high is actually the goal um and i think that's been an interesting thing to watch because that's kind of always what we've said about lightning is like well it's it's really like we shouldn't have just like a bunch of bitcoin sitting in hot wallets um and lightning network it should be used it should be earning a return and so you know the goal is to have volume number be high but of course the problem is we can't publish a volume chart because it's all recorded locally and it's private so that's just something we don't have although i think the arcane research report did a nice job like one of the first ones i think to kind of aggregate some volume numbers from different players and try and show at least you know a picture of of what the volume looked like and what what did that show that there was a high volume compared to the amount locked in lightning i don't think they made that exact comparison like what they i remember what was specifically in the report was that the volume numbers they'd seen like had doubled from july to august and then doubled again from august to september um and that i think like there was another report from an analyst kevin rook from like mid-summer or something where he did like you know like a kind of top-down estimation and bottom-up estimation and arrived at you know maybe for this year um the total volume and the lighting network would be like between 100 mil and 500 million dollars transacted which is you know i don't know like i think it seems about right i don't really know um but what's interesting is like uh in 2020 visa mastercard combined did 16 trillion dollars with the payments so like we got a lot of zeros to add um before um so speaking of arcane research their report also showed that payments for online services like trading and gambling have tended to dominate payment volume and lightning but that in september personal transfers and payments for more everyday transactions like merchant payments grew at double the rate of those other services what do you think is behind that shift i mean el salvador right i think i think el salvador for sure but also and like one thing so i was at um earlier this week i was at the ozil freedom forum and put on by the human rights foundation and uh you know we talked to mike peterson who was a bitcoin beach specifically about he was presenting on um like what he's seen in el salvador uh especially you know in the years coming but especially this past month and again it's it's kind of like what i was talking about earlier it's like this technology has been ready um and and has been battle tested um and it was just kind of waiting for its moment and so people that pick up lightning wallets today maybe they tried in early 2018 and were like severely disappointed because it was you know too early they pick them up today and like oh man this actually works like really great um like this is a nice experience and especially for people that aren't in in western countries or in china where there are like very good payment systems like the lightning network now is significantly better than the payment rails in nigeria right like like it is already a better user experience than payment rails for a large majority of the world and so i think we were just waiting on a moment right waiting on a spark to get a bunch of people to download wallets and start using it um but that moment is like firmly here um and i think you know so a lot of that volume is probably happening in el salvador itself but i think it's also inspired a bunch of people all around the world to be like well they can do it so can we what are we waiting for right this is all open source software just requires spinning up a node and um getting some liquidity so where do you think lightning is going next there has been talk about streaming money can you explain what that means and how likely it is that you think it'll become a common thing soon so um i would uh i don't know is it bad form to recommend other podcasts on your show because i there was there was a great um answer to this from um btc sessions um on i guess a podcast that should not be named um there's a great answer you can name another podcast that's right it was uh he was on preston pish's show and i i i heard it this morning um and so btc sessions is a youtuber who produces like tutorials and different videos for using bitcoin products and he was talking about how you know on youtube you know he barely makes you know enough money to get by right every every they nickel and dime him out of ad money on everything but there is already this like pretty vibrant ecosystem in the lightning space that will um while you're listening to a podcast you will stream money to the podcaster and he was like you know and it's generally the way it's set up is you just send them you know something on the order of 100 stats like under a dollar or or you know like on the order of pennies per minute while you're listening and so he was like you know if i have 10 000 people watch my youtube video like you know i can't buy a piece of bread with that but if i have 10 000 people listening to my podcast and each of them maybe pays me a dollar in bitcoin for the duration of the entire podcast that's ten thousand dollars for an episode right and so it is happening already um and podcasting is like kind of the first medium through which like it's really taking off and what i think is amazing about this um is this podcasting 2.0 movement is not only are the podcasters really interested in the um the money that they're earning of course right and they're pushing their listeners they're like marketing the lightning network to their listeners saying like hey don't don't listen to me through spotify or whatever listen to me through one of these independent podcast developer apps because then you can pay me while you're listening and it's working i don't like i don't think it's quite had its moment like el salvador had yet um it hasn't really like exploded but there's you know hundreds if not thousands of podcasts now that are enabled with these kind of lightning tips um and so we're starting to see and this is so that sorry the second thing that's really interesting about podcasting is you know as a podcaster i'm sure you know it's really hard to get data on what your listeners are doing while they're like like when they drop off of the episode et cetera et cetera unless they're on one of these wild garden platforms like spotify but if they're paying you every minute you know like through the data through the payments that you get at what point in the episode they drop off you know at one point in the episode did they really like something and they can send you a boost which is like sending you you know a full dollar and one payment if they really agree with something that was said right so there's all this this like side industry that's popping up now of you know on top of just users paying podcasters for listening additionally like the data that the podcasters are getting in the analytics they're getting about their listeners so it is happening um i think we just need more wallets more integrations we need to make the user experience much nicer but the cool thing about this is that it's the content creators who are incentivized to market this technology to their consumers right which is just you know something that i certainly didn't see coming a year ago um but he's like really amazed and you know it's first step podcasting next step youtube um there's a couple there's a a brazilian like youtube group bitcoin guidos which is heroes who they just released a new website which i'm blanking on the name right now but it's in order to like make a comment on their live stream you just have to pay you know 100 sat invoice um in order to get included as like a spam filter so people don't make nasty comments and so i think we'll see and it's like very user-friendly like you just have to bring your own mobile wallet to make the tip i think we're going to see a lot more stuff like that pop up and it's just you know in the way that this always goes is we just have iteration development you know attempts attempts attempts and then somebody hits it big and all of a sudden it goes mainstream and so i think we're going to see that again here and just a just a matter of time yeah just from what you were talking about i was like oh i need to look into this okay great we'll talk after the show um all right well it has been so much fun having you on unconfirmed thank you so much thank

dollar market cap for the first time in nearly 150 days on wednesday as a publishing time thursday afternoon the price of one bitcoin was up roughly 25 for the week increasing from 43 450 to slightly above 54 000 one explanation for the rising price is rumors swirling around the approval of a bitcoin futures etf nate karachi president of the etf store said he thinks the first bitcoin futures etf could be approved in less than two weeks eric balchunes bloomberg's senior etf analyst agreed tweeting that he gives such an approval a 75 chance pointers reports that cme btc-based futures contracts were trading at a 12.8 percent premium to the spot price on wednesday the largest premium since mid-april many analysts consider cme bitcoin futures a proxy for institutional sentiment on crypto cme is currently the only crypto derivatives exchange for institutional and traditional investors with federal oversight mike buchella a general partner at blocktower believes the premium suggests that institutions could be front running the news of a futures-based bitcoin etf being approved notably as you see chair gary gensler recently lent his support to a bitcoin futures etf twice mentioning that he would quote look forward to staff's review of such filings in addition to speculation surrounding the approval of a bitcoin etf here are a few other reasons for btc's bullish price action based on analysis from kiyongjoo the ceo of cryptokuan it appears that a whale purchased 1.6 billion dollars worth of spot bitcoin in just under five minutes on wednesday coinciding with bitcoin's push up to fifty five thousand dollars both sec chair gary gensler and fed chair jerome powell explicitly stated their respective regulatory bodies do not plan to ban crypto u.s bank the fifth largest retail bank in the us announced that crypto custody for btc bitcoin cash and litecoin is now available to fund managers thanks to a partnership with nydig the ceo of the 27 billion family office of george soros confirmed that the fund invests in bitcoin the ceo don fitzpatrick told bloomberg quote from our perspective we own some coins the compound bug's compounding bug last thursday a buck was found in a recently implemented upgrade to a smart contract powering compound the fifth largest d5 protocol by total value locked which put roughly 280 000 of the protocol's native token comp at risk of being erroneously claimed on sunday compounds bug intensified after an ethereum user called the protocol's drip function adding 202 000 comp or 66 million dollars to the rewards contract almost doubling the number of outsized awards available to be scooped up this brings the total combat risk to approximately 490k of which 136k is still in the controller said robert lesner ceo of compound labs on twitter at the time lester explained that the compound team had hoped to keep the drip function quiet until the next governance protocol could be implemented to fix the bug but nobody had called the function in weeks and community developers were hopeful that proposal 63 or 64 could go into effect before it was called he said on twitter due to the way compounds governance and private key structure is set up it takes seven days to correct coding errors according to banteg a core developer at urine finance the drip function had been known for days and was quote the best kept secret in d5 as a publishing time the bug is on its way to being patched with governance proposal 64 titled fix comp accrual bug passing 1 million 37 107 votes to zero the protocol made it through the week with 129 000 comp left in the controller contract a far cry from a worst case scenario six thousand coinbase user accounts drained via multi-factor authentication error in a letter file to california state attorney general offices coinbase admitted that over six thousand customer accounts had funds removed due to an error in the exchange's security system according to the document attackers took advantage of a flaw in coinbase's sms account recovery process for users who used sms texts for multi-factor authentication hackers were able to receive the sms text messages necessary to gain access to user accounts from there funds were transferred to third-party wallets coinbase believes that many of its customers fell victim to third-party phishing hacks the exchange says that hackers had to have already obtained a user's email address password and phone number associated with their coinbase accounts to be able to utilize the sms recovery flaw coinbase will be compensating users for any funds lost depositing the quote value of the currency improperly removed from user accounts at the time of the incident the exchange did not release information on how much crypto was stolen the doj

analyzing crimes committed by exchanges and mixing and tumbling services along with helping to trace and recover assets lost to malicious actors deputy attorney general lisa monaco explained the new team's purpose as dismantling quote the financial entities that enable crypto actors to flourish and quite frankly to profit from abusing cryptocurrency platforms as technology advances so too must

a key backer of the usdc table stablecoin has been under investigation by the u.s securities and exchange commission since july the company revealed in its most recent s4 that it quote received an

want staple coins regulated like traditional products the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic is looking into whether stable coins may be eligible for its coverage reports coindesk while the discussions are still in infancy this could be very positive news for stablecoins such coverage would ensure token holders up to 250 000 in the case of a bank failure however getting such insurance will most likely depend on the backing of the stablecoin an unnamed insider told coindesk quote this is all part of a process by which they are trying to bring stable coins into the banking system in a responsible manner it depends on what's backing the stablecoins if it's backed by reserves at the federal reserve for cash then i think you just make the argument that it's a deposit if it's backed by treasuries i think you'll have a harder time treating it as a deposit as a publishing neither of the two largest stable coins usdt and usdc are fully backed by cash last friday the wall street journal reported that the biden administration is quote considering ways to impose bank-like regulation on the cryptocurrency companies that issue stablecoins the journal says that biden's administration intends to recommend to congress draft legislation regarding a special purpose charter specifically tailored to stablecoin issuers if congress doesn't act the biden administration is prepared to go to the federal stability oversight council or fsoc which has the ability to designate stable coins as systemically important a process that could lead to astringent risk management standards imposed by the fed the news comes ahead of an anticipated treasury report on stable coins speaking of stablecoins a bloomberg report found that tether the issuer of usdt loaned one billion dollars to celsius network a crypto lender bloomberg's investigation also found that tether reserves held billions in loans to chinese firms the crypto safe harbor proposal gains steam in the house financial committee on october 5th the ranking member of the house financial services committee representative patrick mchenry proposed a new bill dub the clarity for digital tokens act of 2021 which seeks to turn sec commissioner hester person's idea of a safe harbor for crypto assets into actual law under the proposed legislation which would adapt securities laws developed in 1933 crypto companies would be allowed to launch a token without worrying about running a fell of u.s securities law the bill would allow crypto startups a three-year window to fully decentralize and transform their tokens into something that does not resemble a security to get the benefit of the safe harbor startups would be required to disclose information like source code transaction history and tokenomics to prospective investors time for fun bits is elon musk's cute puppy a buy signal maybe it's correlated maybe it's not but elon musk appears to have made a new memecoin a top 20 asset and
