bitwise asset management welcome matt glad to be here laura thanks for having me this week bitwise had big news a company announced that it had passed the 100 million dollars in assets under management mark congratulations thanks so much we're very excited what do you think's been driving the interest in bitwise products that's a great question i think as you know laura what bitwise focuses on is the financial advisor marketplace and that marketplace is really maturing in the crypto space so a few years ago uh they were just kicking the tires of crypto now and i think what this news that represents hitting 100 million dollars is that you're starting to see meaningful allocations from financial advisors for their clients into the crypto market and that's important because they control a lot of wealth in america about 15 trillion dollars so it's a it's a meaningful piece of news and so when you say that you're seeing kind of a change in who's interested so who exactly is driving this new demand for crypto asset-based financial products yeah for us we're seeing two big drivers so the first is financial advisors these are individuals who control the wealth of wealthy americans and i think what's bubbling up is that population is demanding that they get exposure to crypto in the market there are a couple reasons happy to dig into those and the other is hedge funds there is really a a major rise in demand uh for crypto from the hedge fund community and i think we're seeing that at bitwise and other asset managers are seeing that as well and so yeah do you want to dive a little into why you're seeing the interest from the financial advisors for sure i think they're probably uh two or three big drivers so the first big driver the sort of underlying push in this market that's been happening all year is rising concerns about the potential for inflation and people looking for efficient hedge people have watched how governments not just in the us but around the world have responded to the pandemic and the ensuing economic worsening with massive qe massive fiscal stimulus and people want a hedge and bitcoin crypto more broadly is the most efficient hedge for that space uh but the other piece of news that's driving it is just you're just seeing a massive maturation of the crypto market it's now acceptable for institutional and professional investors to allocate and that's being driven by improvements in custody improvements in trading big improvements in regulation uh and then some proof of concept development like what we saw on the d5 market so it's just the perfect market for people to allocate you have these couple of big catalysts and i think we're at the early innings of this happening i think it's it's going to snowball from here and when you mentioned the maturation of the crypto market how would you say that that has changed the customer base of your product since your launch in 2017. it's been it's been huge so the customer base when we launched in 2017 was primarily uh high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals who were looking for an easy way to get exposure to all the or at least the majority of the crypto asset market cap that's what we offer right we're best known for having the first index fund in the space it's a way to get push bus and exposure to crypto as an asset class that's really shifted so those people are still allocating in bitwise but the driver of the inflows that led to the 100 million dollar mark is hedge funds and financial advisors and they couldn't particularly financial advisors couldn't really have allocated two years ago two years ago there were no uh regulated insured custodians in the market now they're a dozen bitwise uses coin based custody and fidelity two years ago trading was uneven in the market uh now bitcoin and other crypto assets trade at pennywise spread two years ago there were massive regulatory risks in the market there is whether ethereum would be dubbed to security there was still a lot of nefarious activity in the crypto asset market that's been swept away i i sort of knew we were in this new market we were in a powerful bull market not just an incidental pool market but a powerful bull market when the bit mex news came out and no one blinked the market maybe waffled like a percent or so if you had had that happen two years ago if if you know they had they had put one of the bitmex executives in jail they had uh fundamentally harm maybe one of the largest at the time derivative markets in the crypto space the market would have collapsed this time it barely went down when bad news doesn't impact you you know you're in a bull market and i think that's just indicative of the space we've matured we've put that sort of old crypto legacy behind us and we're moving into a mature regulated and institutional future and that's going to be meaningful in terms of asset flows and so when you talk with your investors do they ask different types of questions or is it simply that you have you know different facts and figures you can offer them like how have the conversations changed since that 2017 bubble era yeah i think 2017 you had very simple questions what is crypto uh doesn't it always get stolen doesn't it always get hacked now we can answer many of those questions really easily right we can talk about fidelity and coinbase and insured regulated custody and sweep that aside now people are really asking questions about how does it fit in a portfolio does it increase the portfolio's volatility what should i think about particular developments i got a question from a financial advisor today about what the impact of jpmorgan coin will be on different crypto assets within the bitwise 10. that's a very sophisticated question it's a good question it has very different impacts on bitcoin versus ethereum versus xrp but that's a very sophisticated question what we were getting two years ago was you know what is crypto what is this fake internet money no one understood what blockchains were people were excited about blockchain stocks do you remember that people were all excited about investing in blockchain equities and not crypto assets there was the whole blockchain not bitcoin that's been swept aside people understand uh that this market is not going away they understand the importance of public blockchains powered by crypto assets and we're getting much more sophisticated questions now and i'd love for you to expound on that jp morgan note and just for listeners who may not know what matt was referring to jp morgan came up with a global market strategy report that said that bitcoin could compete with gold and one of the choice quotes was a crowding out of gold as an alternative currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term mechanically the market cap of bitcoin would have to rise 10 times from here to match the total private sector investment to gold via etfs or bars or coins so can you just tell us you know aside from that one question what impact do you think this research note could have it's massive in terms of its indication of where we're going uh and it's not the first so just a few months ago bloomberg's senior commodity strategist came out and said bitcoin could trade to a hundred thousand dollars uh and now you have jp morgan saying uh it could easily be two or three x if millennials crowd out gold and it could 10x if it replaced and mixed it these were price targets that people uh were were expounding on crypto maybe in 2017 and getting laughed out of the room by traditional wall street uh now it's traditional wall street that had recognizing the potential size of this market if even a fraction of the investors that allocate uh based on on on reports like jpmorgan and the reports we're going to see from every other major bank in the next six to 12 months saying the same thing if even a fraction of that money comes into the market uh the potential impact is huge one really important thing that the crypto industry needs to understand and i come from the traditional finance industry is crypto is built on retail money uh and retail investors as wonderful as they are control a very small fraction of the overall wealth in america it's controlled by institutions and also by financial advisors and hedge funds 80 90 of the wealth so even if we get modest pickup uh it could be significant one more thing about the jp morgan report it's worth noting and maybe this is a nuance that they they wrote this in one of their flagship publications this wasn't some you know junior analyst uh who had just cottoned on to bitcoin writing their first research report where they figured in a few sentences about bitcoin and crypto this was their flagship publication uh talking about this as a potential uh important new asset class i think it's it's hugely meaningful uh in isolation and as an indication of what we're going to see over the next year uh it's a very telling development yeah and earlier this summer we did see the letter from the occ that that said that banks could custody uh digital assets and you wrote a forbes piece saying that that was a huge deal and in general i feel like we're just noticing so much news about banks and crypto and on top of that other um well-known established financial institutions like paypal and venmo will soon be offering bitcoin ether and some other cryptocurrencies but about that i wanted to ask you so initially paypal users will be limited to just buying um bitcoin and these other cryptos and then uh being able to use those for purchases but the merchants themselves will actually just receive dollars so i wondered do you think the offering of crypto on paypal will be kind of like a novelty feature that few people will use similar to how and i know this is going far back but to how in kind of 2014 2015 you know microsoft and dell began accepting bitcoin as payment but there wasn't like a lot of uptake of it right um or you know do you think this time around is different and we'll see these actually used on these platforms i think that's a great question i think there are two big impacts of the of the paypal news and maybe three actually three so the first one which doesn't get to whether they'll be used at retail and investment chains is just investment right paypal has 200 million us users who will now be able to buy bitcoin with the push of a button in an app that they're familiar with they won't have to decide between a coinbase or kraken account they won't have to open a new account they already have it they have money there they can allocate that that could double the number of investors in in crypto assets overnight before they try to spend a penny of it at a retail location i do think there is uh the retail steps should be seen as a minor incremental step i don't think it's that we're going to wake up in january 2021 and everyone's going to be buying you know their coffee with bitcoin there's still huge negative tax implications you're absolutely right that the merchants will be receiving cash i think what we'll see though is there'll be some niche retailing establishments that favor or or push for people to pay in crypto assets uh and the other thing you'll see is you have to think of this as an incremental step it's actually a huge incremental step uh but do you think two years from now maybe one year and from now certainly three years from now do you think that will still be true at paypal that they won't allow payments to retailers in crypto i think the fact that they're crossing this chasm uh in in a in a big giant leap means that's inevitable inevitably retailers will be able to get paid directly in crypto uh from paypal people who expect them to go from zero to a hundred uh in one step are expecting too much they made a huge jump they went from zero to fifty they could have just done some tiny little thing they didn't they did a big thing but no i don't think uh there'll be a massive explosion in retail use next year there's still a lot of issues to be worked out but we're making progress the third impact is paypal has cleared the way for every major institution uh to enter into the market so i think we saw the paypal news and people people don't realize how big paypal paypal is much bigger than morgan stanley it's much bigger than goldman sachs it's bigger than bank of america from a market cap perspective it's a huge institution you're going to see every other major institution follow suit they now have to uh it's it's sort of uh uh it's table sticks in a moment we'll discuss other big corporate moves in crypto but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on btc and more than 20 other coins once in the app you can apply for the crypto.com metal card which pays you up to eight percent cash back instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with matt hogan so as you mentioned earlier we've also seen interest by corporate treasuries with the purchase of bitcoin by microstrategy and square and i wondered what ripple effects you thought that their pioneering of this area would have and you know have you seen it already come up in conversations with your investors we actually have yeah shortly after the microstrategy news we have a number of advisors who advise corporate clients on their treasury holdings uh and who have been bullish on crypto and we're going to use that as a way to reopen the conversation about whether crypto is appropriate now i don't think most corporations are going to start allocating to the space tomorrow and i think we will all agree that microstrategy's reasons were idiosyncratic square's reasons were idiosyncratic but that's always how the earliest phase of innovation and innovative adopters occur it's always idiosyncratic reasons but it does pave the way for a broader audience so you know a year ago there were no publicly traded corporations with bitcoin on their balance sheet now they're a couple uh and and in a few more years or in a few more months i i suspect we'll see more so i do think it's important but it's not like uh the floodgates are going to open i don't think apple's going to buy a hundred million dollars of bitcoin tomorrow maybe eventually but but it will take a while but it's it's big news and why did you say that micro strategies and squares reasons for purchasing bitcoin were idiosyncratic well uh microstrategy is a unique company right it has a strong ceo who has super majority voting shares he's a deep believer in bitcoin has been for a while they had huge cash balances and they're a not cash intensive business uh so they needed to do something with those cash balances and they had the ability to make that allocation because sailor is such a strong ceo there uh square obviously has had a long-standing relationship with bitcoin sees it as uh the internet currency so it's not it's not the same as you know ibm uh or apple or microsoft making the allocation um but it but it does pave the way for that in the future and we've seen that again and again in the crypto market that it takes brave institutions to pave the way for others so another example uh is fidelity fidelity was really one of the first major u.s financial institutions to put a stake in the ground and say crypto is real and we're going to have to offer custody for institutional clients they were able to do it first because abby johnson was a deep believer and it's a family-owned business and that paved the way for eventually publicly traded companies that aren't family-owned businesses to follow suit so it's often these these pioneers who have idiosyncratic reasons that open the doors and then you will see people follow on so you've alluded to this kind of throughout this conversation but the backdrop to all this activity is that the federal reserve chair jerome powell has said that the fed will now target um a two percent average inflation rate and so we've kind of tackled or talked a little bit here and there uh sprinkled throughout the conversation how this is affecting maybe individual decisions but can you just talk more broadly about how you expect this will affect crypto and the industry in general it's going to lead to massive inflows into inflation-protecting assets uh and that will include things like gold but it will also include things like crypto look no one is going to say for certain that we're going to see significant runaway inflation right druckenmiller came out the other day and said we could see 5 or 10 inflation in the next few years but what is certain if you're a financial analyst is that the tail risk of higher inflation is higher today than it was two years ago there is a higher probability we'll face inflationary pressures and inflationary risks in the future than there was two years ago and even if that doesn't occur because it's a higher probability as a portfolio manager or or a fiduciary you need to think about hedging that risk uh the beautiful thing about crypto the beautiful thing about bitcoin is it's a very efficient hedge against inflation risk we were talking to an endowment the other day they were very worried about inflation and they said look it's really hard with gold because even if i'm the most bullish gold person in the world i might think gold will go from 2 000 to three thousand dollars an ounce up fifty percent that would be an amazing result i have to allocate so much of my portfolio to gold to actually provide an efficient hedge for the hundred percent of my portfolio that's impossible i can't allocate twenty percent to this inflation hedge the beautiful thing about bitcoin or crypto is because this the upside is so much more significant uh because it could you know 10x as jp morgan said or it could go to a hundred thousand dollars as bloomberg said that you can make a relatively small allocation a couple percent and you can hedge that inflation risk in a meaningful way so i think you're going to see massive inflows into inflation hedging assets across the board i think some significant portion of those inflows will go into bitcoin and other crypto assets and i think that will be a really big macro story in 2021 that drives a lot of allocations yeah yeah i do feel like somehow the coronavirus sort of accelerated um trends that were already in place but now with all this quantitative easing and the um you know what we just mentioned about the the target interest rate it sort of feels like what's going to happen is a supercharging of things that were already um on their way uh one other thing so you did mention the bit max action uh by the sc well by the cftc and um doj and i wondered previously bitwise attempted to get pre approval for a bitcoin etf and so given those types of regulatory actions what do you think the odds are for a bitcoin etf in the next few years oh i think in the next few years the odds are extraordinarily good uh this is really becoming an institutional market place right the cme is now often the largest single market in the world in bitcoin uh yesterday i think it traded over a billion dollars that's a fully regulated market uh and the bitmex news is another example that we're shedding the sort of legacy past that kept this market from uh being of robust enough quality to to justify an etf so the next few years i think the chances are are extremely high uh i do think we're still a little ways away from it bitwise continues to work on it um uh and and and i think you could see news next year or the year that follows um so there's still work to be done but in terms of will we get there we'll absolutely get there and the bitmex news is a is a great example i really think something remarkable is happening on the regulatory front which is that the crypto industry is taking two regulatory tracks on the one hand regulators are shutting down bad actors and we've seen enforcement actions since 2018 that have repeatedly uh crushed actors that are trying to skirt the surface and on the other hand you have the thing like the occ letter where they're creating this amazing open positive supportive playing space for this crypto industry to flourish uh you couldn't design a better regulatory outcome than what we've seen over the last few years in terms of where crypto is going so we're gonna come back to this regulatory thing in one moment but i just have one quick question on an unrelated topic i have to ask right now the um new emerging area of crypto is defy it's truly the wild west there have just been countless hacks including two i guess you would call them exploits this week one in harvest and the other involving maker dough and yet i've seen you write uh positively about d5 um but i was just curious you know bitwise interfaces with more traditional investors so i wondered how you thought a firm like yours could capitalize on the trend in d5 no that's great uh i'll i'll start with my general thoughts on d5 which is that i have a love hate relationship with it everything you said is true i think as a proof of concept it's absolutely amazing uh what you're seeing in automated market making what you're seeing in automated lending what you're seeing and the stable coin growth i think it's proof of concept it's amazing but it's still as you said the wild wild west i think we'll see significant blow uh in the automated market making space in the next year i think we'll see continued hacks a lot of these are sort of thrown into the market and become billion-dollar uh projects uh overnight and without the due diligence and scale so it's it's great proof of concept it's showing what the future is going to look like and it's going to be a very rocky road between between now and the future in terms of bitwise i mean we take a two-track approach that's the message we give to investors that this is a very interesting potentially extremely large market and that it's really early and what you're seeing is proof of concept and you have to expect significant issues uh in the next year as that market matures and then in terms of sort of product development it's something we keep an eye on people have certainly talked a lot about tokenization of etfs and things like that uh certainly a lot of conversations around that recently jay clayton said that was something they would look at again i think it's very very early i think the majority of asset flows into the crypto space uh whether the crypto industry likes it or not is going to come through traditional uh regulated products that fit into the traditional architecture at least for the next few years all right so back to regulators um next week is the presidential election and i was curious to know how you thought a trump versus abide and win would affect the industry yeah uh that's a great question i think in either case if you have the the president uh and congress of the same party i think inflationary risks increase because there's going to be a pressure for significant stimulus and the ability to get it done versus the gridlock that we've seen recently so if you have an alignment of both parties in the white house and in congress i think the pressures we talked about in terms of forcing people to find inflation-protecting securities is going to go up significantly uh you know beyond that in terms of the impact uh i i think we're in a safe space either way i think three or four years ago a change in political party a change in regulatory tenor uh could have had a real impact on crypto it could have potentially uh delayed the industry multiple years right they could have cracked down on crypto banking or banking to crypto related companies they could have uh pushed to to regulate them more heavily we're past that we're past that we've we've created such a regulatory safe space we've made so much regulatory progress in the past two years and the the the fundamental growth of the crypto industry has been so significant uh that it's at escape velocity so uh beyond the potential impact on inflation i don't worry about the market being uh being being slowed or being advanced i think every major financial institution now realizes that this market is not going away i think they every major financial institution realizes the future of how money moves on the internet is over crypto and blockchain uh and i think that that ship has sailed regardless of who's in the white house or who's in congress that's a great perspective and it makes a lot of sense this has been such a fascinating conversation thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you for having me laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline jpmorgan is finally bullish for bitcoin after years of skepticism jp morgan is now projecting bitcoin's price could see quote a doubling or tripling assuming current trends hold a research note published by the bank says the cryptocurrency is a valid alternative to gold among millennials while still cautioning that bitcoin is overbought in the near term in addition to demographic trends the company cites positive developments for bitcoin such as the recent announcement by paypal to offer bitcoin to customers as well as the fact that companies such as square have added the asset to their balance sheets jp morgan also had other crypto related news this week the block reports that the bank has been in talks with crypto native firms as it explores how it can offer cryptocurrency custody the plan would likely be for jp morgan to enlist sub-custodians to provide services and it has reportedly reached out to fidelity digital assets and paxos among others amidst all of this jpmorgan blockchain news the

regulators michael del castillo at forbes who i wish i had had the opportunity to work with though he arrived there after i left did a thorough look into binance's approach to u.s regulation and in particular its reason for establishing the regulatory compliant binance.us michael obtained a 2018 document that detailed finance's plans for the launch of the entity that would eventually become binance u.s but was at the time called quote the tai chi entity which michael writes is quote an allusion to the chinese martial art whose approach is built around the principle of yield and overcome or using an opponent's own weight against him michael says quote while the then unnamed entity set up operations in the united states to distract regulators with feigned interest and compliance measures would be put in place to move revenue in the form of licensing fees and more to the parent company binance some of the more startling revelations from the document are a bold bullet point that says quote key binance personnel continue to operate from a non-us location to avoid enforcement risks the document then also says quote license and service fees paid by the u.s service company to binance are functionally u.s sourced trading fees then michael writes but unlike an actual subsidiary whose parent company could be held accountable for regulatory violations the tai chi entity would have little more than a contractual relationship further quote insulating finance from u.s enforcement according to the document michael writes essentially it would be a decoy this article is perhaps the most thorough look into how binance is playing regulatory arbitrage in particular with u.s regulators it's definitely worth a read and certainly offer offers arguments to people who believe finance is playing fast and loose when it comes to u.s regulations as well as those who believe u.s regulations regarding crypto are too stringent next headline crypto friendly bank silvergate
