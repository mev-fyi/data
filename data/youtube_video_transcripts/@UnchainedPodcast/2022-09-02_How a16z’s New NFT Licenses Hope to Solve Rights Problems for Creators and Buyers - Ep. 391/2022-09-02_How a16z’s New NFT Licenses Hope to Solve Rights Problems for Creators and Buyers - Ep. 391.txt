see you this fall at mainnet2022 today's guest is miles jennings general counsel at a16z crypto welcome miles hi laura thanks for having me we've seen that rights surrounding nfts can have a large influence on the success of the project and frankly can also spark some controversy this has been true with projects such as crypto punks board apes moon birds etc on thursday a16z crypto released a set of free and public can't be evil licenses designed specifically for nfts seemingly to address these issues can you describe what problem or problems you were trying to solve with these licenses sure so i think that that there are really kind of there were four problems that we were really looking at uh in the industry the first one was that you know in a lot of instances nft projects weren't using any licenses whatsoever and and the reason that that's a problem is because you know ultimately when you buy an nft there isn't a copyright that automatically comes along with that unless there's an actual license and so when you're getting an nft you're actually just getting a token and you're not actually getting any rights to the artwork and so that raises questions around whether or not you can display that artwork yourself whether or not you can commercialize it and all of these you know fundamental questions and and so users i think expectations weren't aligned with kind of what what reality was right what what they were actually getting and then you know a lot of issues around kind of why people weren't getting licenses is that they're very expensive it requires kind of significant uh time and effort with with uh council to do so and you know a lot of projects are are you know started by artists and they don't kind of have the money to basically you know engage in that kind of activity the second problem was that even when you do have licenses there was a lot of ambiguity around what the rights were that they were conveyed in the license and so as a result of that you know even where you do have these licenses in place it's unclear whether or not they're actually effective third uh most of the licenses aren't on chain and so as a result of that there's a question of whether or not people are actually consenting and reaching an enforceable legal agreement when they buy the tokens and so even if a project has done everything right in creating a license and having it be you know very clear and not ambiguous you know whether or not it's actually enforceable uh is a question and then the final point right is that basically because of all of those problems there's a real lack of standardization in the industry right every single project has their own license and and really you know there's obviously cco which is great and we're very supportive of that but you know not every creator wants to use cco and so as a result right the lack of standard approach i think really creates a lot of risk that users don't know what they're actually getting when they buy an nft and you know that not knowing right what you know we can't expect every user that buys an nft to go read the terms of service for that nft and you know what people tend to do when you know they don't kind of engage in that type of of research right is they basically look to the market and they'll base it okay well this nft must have good rights because the market is supportive of it and people are buying it but that's not always the case and as we've seen in kind of other sectors of this industry right the market kind of behaves in ways that are unexpected sometimes and it you know because people are putting their money into a d5 protocol for instance does not mean that it's necessarily safe and so ultimately you do need to do your own research and we know that there a lot of people won't do it so standard approaches is really the way to kind of overcome that issue so really like what the what the can't be evil licenses are about is basically increasing overall transparency and and awareness for users so that we kind of can address these the you know the problems that we just discussed and earlier when you were saying cco can you just describe what that is for people sure cco is is a license that was created by the the creative commons which you know all of our licenses were really inspired by um and the you know cco is their most permissive license it basically puts the intellectual property into the public domain and what that means is that you know anyone can use the artwork to display it to commercialize it regardless of who owns the actual underlying nft and so a lot of projects have have thought that that is you know the best route to go in the space because it you know one of our one of my colleagues scott commoners just wrote this article about how you know the cco licensing framework really allows kind of for a vibrality and to happen around the intellectual property because everyone can use it and so you see pieces of some materials you know of some copyrighted materials being added to other enft projects and it basically kind of tries to build this whole ecosystem around that idea and and so you know it's just one one approach there's obviously a lot but um it's one that's that's gained a lot of popularity in the space an earlier just you know when i asked you to kind of address all the problems you're trying to solve a lot of what you raised were problems that buyers were facing are there also problems that creators were facing that these licenses can address sure i think one of the the number one problem that some creators are facing is disputes amongst token holders and disputes amongst nft holders in particular against one another but then also nft holders against the creators so wherever you have a lack of clarity and ambigu ambiguity around kind of what a person's rights are right there's more likely to be dispute about those rights and as a result of that you know you see a lot of creators being sued by nft holders and you see nft holders suing other nft holders and so as a result of that right that it's that is gonna overall is gonna act as an economic drag on the entire ecosystem and it's not you know not in anyone's benefit to see that continue all right so let's walk through the five rights that the licenses address the first one is copy display and distribute what does that mean so copy display and distribute sounds like what it what it is right i mean ultimately this allows you to basically display your artwork it would allow you to you know copy the artwork that's associated with an nft and put it on a t-shirt that you wanted to wear and and and that's really kind of a fundamental you know basic right associated with these and it's the right that i think everyone expects that they have when they obtain an nft but they don't actually have unless they have a license and so that's you know again one of the critical reasons why you know more clarity around licensing is necessary yeah i think that was one of the ones where it was like every single license had that the next one is commercial use what right does that give people yeah so commercial use right i mean very clearly i think a lot of people are excited about nfts and the artwork associated with nfts because they can use it in a business so i mean most recently right we just saw eminem and snoop use their nfts in the at the vmas right they're they're very clearly building a brand around you know their specific apes uh and as a result of that right you would expect them to be able to reap kind of commercial rewards for that you know i think we've heard kind of stories of people doing seltzer water branded with with nfts and there's all sorts of stuff really it just allows people to kind of go out and and you know yeah use the the nft artwork in a business that they want to create i think for board apes that was limited in some fashion to um earning a hundred thousand dollars a year from that does this also impose a limit or is this unlimited there's no limits here i think ultimately you know there's a lot of different approaches that people can take uh and a lot of them are defensible and and reasonable minds can you know disagree about how how permissive these licenses should be i think that you know one of the things that that people that are probably new to the field don't get about intellectual property right is is everything is a a trade-off right there there will never be a single form intellectual property license that works for everyone because ultimately you know some creators want more control sometimes nft holders want more control they want to be able to commercialize sometimes they don't want to be able to commercialize and just want you know personal use and so you know one of the things that we did try to do by by creating these six licenses right is not really take an opinion you know what the best license is because that no one can really say that about any given situation right people have to make their own decision about what kind of they want and what kind of community they want to build on top of we'll walk through the last few right so there's modify and adapt what does that allow people to do so modify and adapt is is one of the areas where our our licenses i would say are more permissive than than the creative commons licenses that that we were inspired by modifications and adaptions really are about um you know taking your your nft the artwork associated with your nft and and creating derivative works so for instance if if i wanted to you know create a painting of a you know character that i owned uh through and had and had the you know commercial rights and the rights to modify and adapt to then i could do that so i could take that character and put it into various situations i could create a a television show using that character and and so all of those things really kind of allow people to to really make use of the nft artwork in ways that is not just kind of related to specifically the artwork right so you can you can modify and adapt it you know one of the the problems that that raises in the con in the context of nfts that we don't really see in kind of other areas of intellectual property is that a pfp project right the standard is kind of 10 000 nfts and all of those nfts are are fairly similar and so it's it's not surprising that people might want to use their nfts for the same kind of purpose right so if if i wanted to you know take my my character and put it on my t-shirt right i could do that and it would be kind of nonsensical for me to then prevent other people from putting their you know nft characters on their t-shirts and selling them right and so as a result of that one of the things that we really try to do in our license is is limit the friction that can arise between nft holders within the same community now you know obviously people can disagree around whether or not that is the right approach or whether or not that just results in people copying each other but ultimately our goal here was to reduce the kind of overall friction and the potential for litigation between parties because if everyone is just suing each other the only people that win are the plaintiff's attorneys in a moment we're going to talk about the rest of the

unchained at checkout that's mainnet.events and promo code unchained see you this fall at mainnet2022 back to my conversation with miles so one of the additional rights that you address with these licenses is sun license what does that enable people to do so sub-licensing you know when you think about intellectual property the way they kind of teach it in law school is that it's a bundle of sticks right and this bundle of sticks each little stick represents a different right so it's a right to you know display the artwork in a television show it's the right to create a movie it's the right to put it in a song and and so one of the things that often happens when you have intellectual property is that you'll have you know the owner of that intellectual property will sub one of those rights to someone who will then you know take that right and commercialize it and develop the intellectual property further and so you know one of the things that that that allows is it really kind of fosters a greater kind of contribution to the overall intellectual property that is being sub-licensed because it's being used by you know different people for different endeavors and it's thought to grow the whole pie now one of the the problems that that introduces within the nft space right is that if i were to buy an nft from you for instance i wouldn't know whether or not you had already sub-licensed out certain rights associated with that nft so maybe you took you know you owned the the nft and you sub licensed out to you know someone to create t-shirts and so when i then buy the nft for you from you there's a question of whether or not i can then sub license out the rights to make t-shirts and the problem there right is that i would have had no way of really knowing at the moment with with the technology that we currently have i would have had no way of knowing whether or not you actually sub licensed outrights and so as a result i don't know what i'm actually buying when i'm buying the nft from you so one of the approaches that we took to sub license here which is it's very permissive but ultimately when i buy the nft from you the sub licenses that you had entered into all terminate because there's no way for me to know what sub licenses you entered and you're the only one that really knows that and so as a result of that in order for there not to be an in like information asymmetry between the two of us that you could exploit against me we we kind of terminate the sub licenses and that's another kind of key difference from you know other licenses that are that are out there and we think that that is is one that is is very kind of key to the can't be evil approach yeah and it seems that then the onus is on the seller to to inform whoever they've sub licensed their rights to um that that's right you know now the contract's over um so one that was really interesting to me was hate speech revocation talk a little bit about what that is yeah that's a controversial one and one that i think you know people feel very strongly about on uh you know at least on twitter and i i think we debated this internally i worked with you know great lawyers at latham and watkins and and um dla piper i mean gave my mood and mark uh radcliffe and you know we we kind of wrestled internally about how to approach a lot of these issues and you know with respect to hate speech you know you have one camp that will say well you know that really allows censorship and ultimately it's very hard to define what hate speech is it's obviously inherently very subjective and so as a result of that if you allow creators to kind of revoke a license because someone you know used hate speech then you've really opened the door to you know censorship and and people creators being able to rug their holders and and it's it's hard to refute that because it you know ultimately that is um that there is a risk of that uh in the event that the creators retain that right but at the same time right you can imagine that creators and other nft holders in a community wouldn't want people to be able to use their you know nfts in you know some propaganda that that really kind of reflects badly and so there are you know there's very differing views on on what is the right approach and again we didn't take an opinion on on kind of what the correct approach was and so we have versions of our each of our licenses that have kind of the hate speech revocation as a way to you know really it should be for creators in the community that surround these nft projects to decide yeah yeah i can see how that's controversial and yet at the same time it's one of those things where for the creator you know they could feel that some kind of usage would like harm the brand overall um so in that sense like it does make sense so i want you to you know you you have referenced the descriptor that you guys used when you released these licenses which was that they can't be evil can you talk a little bit about why you chose that phrasing and what you mean when you say that so the the phrasing it can't be evil is is you know a play on on google's slogan of of don't be evil in previous uses what what the words are trying to convey right is is that you know web3 technology blockchain technology uh enables you know computers to make hard commitments which is which which means that it allows people to trust computers because they don't have a person isn't controlling that computer and as a result of that right rather than having to rely on the person controlling that computer to not do something evil the computer can't do something evil it is it is literally programmed to not be able to do that and so what what that does in you know the web three spaces create all of this possibility of disintermediating you know various various services uh censorship resistance and all of these kind of things that a lot of us are very excited about in the nft space you had a disconnect where that kind of ethos doesn't really apply because either you know nft or creators you know aren't putting licenses in place people don't know what they're really getting they don't understand what rights they have when they're buying and so as a result of that they're there a lot of trust is necessary in the nft market currently where where you know holders have to trust the creators to not do anything they have to trust their other the other nft holders within their community not to do anything that would hurt the their nft and so as a result right what the what our licenses try to do is again increase transparency and awareness and and really like we you know we took a holistic approach to try and increase you know the overall standardization that could be available in the market because with increased standardization will come increased understanding on the part of users and as a result of that there should be more clarity and there should be less kind of need to trust anyone within a given community so just like on the sub license theme thing right with the way that we set it up i don't need to trust that you haven't sub licensed it because these these licenses basically make it certain that all the sub licenses are terminated therefore i get the full bundle of rights that i would be expecting so the licenses are available on github you know what does that mean that the rights can be coded right into the nfts like in general how can creators and the buyers enforce these licenses yeah and so this is i will say you know one of my like favorite things about working on projects like this is that we i get to work with you know guys on our engineering team the more technical people who can take the idea these legal ideas and then turn them into actual things that work with the functionality of blockchain so by putting it up on github you know a we've put basic versions of the licenses so anyone is free to and we publish them under the the cco license so anyone can take them they can fork them improve them do whatever they want with them right but then what is what is really fun about it is that we basically we deployed six versions of all six versions of the license to our weave and those are immutable we can't change them and then we integrated those those licenses into a smart contract that we deployed to ethereum and so with one line of code any nft project can basically select the license that they want to use and and incorporate it into their nft project and what what that does is it basically puts the name of the license and the link to r weave in their metadata right and and what's good about that is that it will allow nft marketplaces to display the license that is associated with a given nft and so now what that does right is that anyone that would be buying a um an nft we'll be able to see what the license is now obviously that doesn't solve anything because if they don't go read it they might not understand it but we did try to make the the licenses i mean if you read them they don't read like legal agreements they read they're really designed for people to lay persons non-legal people to be able to understand but still we know not everyone's going to look at it and that's why we're really trying to create a standardized approach here so that you know when you see the name or you know like other people will be talking about it that you'll kind of understand the rights that come along with it so in the last question you talked about how you know there's no standardization etc but there are some previous attempts to standardize licenses for nfts most notably with dapper labs so why do you think that hasn't taken off before and why do you think this time will be different i think that the i think that dapper labs like did a great job i think that the one of the issues was that i think that they might have been too early and obviously those licenses are still around and still and still like definitely viable and and we would be super happy for those also to be adopted in greater forms right because ultimately you know it doesn't need to say you know on an nft marketplace it doesn't need to all be can't be evil licenses they can be dapper labs licenses ultimately what we want is is more standardization but they're again as i said earlier right you're never going to have a single intellectual property licensing agreement that is going to be the supreme works for everyone right and and so but having you know greater standardization where it's not every single nft project has its own license that's just kind of a you know scenario that isn't really workable now i would also say that the you know dapper labs and the timing of it right is i think the industry in general has started to become much more aware of the issues associated with like current practices than they have been previously and so as a result of that i think that that you know this is a a good time and you know obviously the market is is a little different now than it was um you know previously and so i think that there's there's growing desire to kind of solve these problems all right well thank you for illuminating all this because i know this is an issue that comes up so frequently in nft communities so hopefully this will educate a lot of both the buyers and the creators thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you so much for having me this is great don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short

for tuning in to this week's news recap michael saylor and microstrategy get sued for tax fraud michael saylor and microstrategy are being sued for tax fraud in washington d.c carl a racine attorney general for the district of columbia tweeted that taylor is a billionaire tech executive who has lived in the district for more than a decade but has never paid any dc income taxes in addition racine's office claims that microstrategy aided sailor and his intent to evade taxes on his earnings sailor allegedly declared that he lived in florida or virginia where state taxes are lower instead of washington d.c where according to the complaint filed last week he lived in a luxury penthouse and docked multiple yachts on the district's potomac waterfront from 2005 to present both sailor and microstrategy deny the accusations i respectfully disagree with the position of the district of columbia and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts said the former ceo of the company the district of columbia's claims against the company are false added microstrategy in a statement racine estimates that the back taxes and penalties for both sailor and microstrategy could total up to 100 million dollars could this lawsuit put pressure on microstrategy to sell bitcoin this will likely just add to the pressure for them to capture cash on their bitcoin position especially if they have a large tax back bill said adam cochran after the news broke the shares of microstrategy tumbled four percent cloud service provider and forces ban on crypto mining or staking after the office of foreign assets control sanctioned tornado cache cloud service provider hertzner which hosts more than 10 percent of ethereum nodes said that running any miners including ethereum miners or proof of stake validators on its cloud infrastructure is a violation of their terms of service the prohibition could mean that ethereum would rely more heavily on cloud service providers like amazon making it more centralized and more prone to censorship as the ethereum community continued to discuss sanctions related censorship on ethereum martin koppelman proposed a shutterized beacon chain which essentially aims to encrypt key transaction details so they cannot be censored by validators both validators and relays wouldn't know whether to censor a transaction as they wouldn't be able to see its sender or its recipient martin was on this tuesday show with lawyer drew hinckus discussing what the sanctions mean for ethereum as it moves to proof of stake so make sure to listen arrested tornado cash developers links to russian espionage are denied alexi percev the web developer arrested in the netherlands possibly due to his work on tornado cash was accused of espionage for reportedly having worked at a company linked to the russian secret service xenia malik herzeg's wife denied the accusations alexi has never been associated with the fsb of the russian federation and similar organizations she told coindesk we moved to the netherlands in the hope of a quiet stable and free life which is unimaginable in military russia pertzev is still under arrest and there's still no clarity on the charges for which he was brought in is dye going to abandon its usd peg roon christensen the co-founder of makerdao proposed a free-floating model for the protocol's staplecoin die maker lets users mint die after depositing assets as collateral and is considered one of the ogdefy applications at the moment there's almost seven billion dollars worth of dye in circulation concerned about the sanctions on tornado cache and all of its ramifications like circle freezing usdc and d5 front ends censoring transactions christensen wants maker to reduce its real-world assets exposure which would require dye to free float away from the us dollar tornado cash had extremely little exposure to rwa or real-world assets and is highly decentralized but that didn't stop it from being sanctioned he said christensen's justification to dpeg is this as all other currencies pour fuel on the fire of the global financial ponzi scheme that is already deeply in overshoot we can prepare for the worst and focus on accumulating resilient collateral such as eth or even eventually physically resilient rwa and build something that could end up meaning the difference between life and death for millions the proposal sparked a ton of reactions within maker if you're looking for a great recap of the various camps within maker and their positions greg deprisco the former head of business development at miguer dao and the founder of rwa co wrote up a great tweet thread explaining the philosophies of these three groups which he dubs the futurists the centralists and the
