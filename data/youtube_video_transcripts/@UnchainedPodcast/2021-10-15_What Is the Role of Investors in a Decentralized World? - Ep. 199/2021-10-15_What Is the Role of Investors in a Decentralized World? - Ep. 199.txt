hello nick and we also have thomas france to my right co-founder and gp of sydney capital and then um dylan hickson president of arden road investments and at the end is rick willard founder of argentine group and managing director of world ethical data foundation welcome everyone hi thanks so why don't we start by talking about how a decentralized world changes things for investors um so in an ideal decentralized world everything is kind of like user owned and everything's a little bit more egalitarian so how does that change things for investors in you know a world where generally the business model is kind of predicated on things not being super egalitarian i think the decentralized web is is one is an interesting term and concept and i think one of the key things that's happening is that it's enabling more people to be owners of more things of protocols of doubts of assets of you know systems and i think that's really exciting a lot of the early people who've been participating in these networks and these projects are earning the equivalent of sweat equity um and then are going on to launch new things the need for outside capital really is decreasing as you know as the community itself builds up wealth in assets that have been generated here and the role of investors is really changing a lot of projects are launching without any investors at all there's you know projects get forked and project it launched fair launch you know rounds are getting financing rounds when they happen tend to be getting tighter and smaller uh and so the role of the investor i think is really changing i don't think the role of capital in the system is necessarily changing but i think the role of like you know traditional funds is definitely evolving and we're working to adapt to that and so how have you tried to evolve to stay relevant there's i mean i think every generation of investing that we've been through and we've been around for 15 years through up two and now into web 3 and my partner's been investing for longer than that i think it's forced us to cause us to learn new tricks um you know there's some mechanical uh administrative changes to how we organize funds and the kind of activities that we undertake whether we're you know staking or you know participating in protocols using capital in different ways um a lot of the things that we're investing in now look less like companies and more like loose collectives or dows where we're just one of many members and uh the sort of way that we engage and participate in influence you know the project is changing so i i think it's too early to say exactly how but we're learning new moves every day does anyone want to add yeah i think the there's a wide variety of projects that you can invest in in that in that space and it's like generally like some very long-term projects you you believe in so it's it's not solely that you are going to invest like in in daos or in protocols where you're going to actually make a deal with an entity that lives on the blockchain and you're going to receive a token for it but that's a possibility but there's also some some companies that are like equity-based are building like some some pick-and-show or infrastructure play that kind of a bridge the world between uh between the real world and crypto there's some developer tooling so there's also all that variety of um of project that is uh let's say uh acceptable for any type of investors but for everything to do with uh with a pure blockchain organization or pure like uh smart contracts you're interacting with it's true that it changes the world of the investor as well in the type of structure you need to have you need to make sure that you you can invest in non-venture capital assets that you can like uh custody these tokens and and when you once you get like these uh these um these tokens that are not like actual equity you you also want to participate in it so you want to stake you want to participate in in governance you want to provide value and liquidity to uh to to this protocol so this is all set up that needs to be thought in terms of how to best participate in all these networks yeah i mean as a family office we make a lot of venture capital investments we are prepared now to to hold tokens directly and look at alternate forms of investment in terms of the structure um you know we're getting excited about uh about obviously growing big companies and you know some of these some of these interesting new applications but also uh the idea of financial inclusion um even stakeholder capitalism are some kind of new twists on capitalism that are going to be enabled by blockchain and like we actually we have a family foundation we do a lot of work with social entrepreneurs some of what we're seeing in blockchain is starting to overlap with that so so i think capitalism has has a place in this i think it's gonna be modified um and but we're excited about that for return perspective but also from from an impact and did you want to add something please yeah so let's talk about the modification of capital and what funds look like and financial inclusion stakeholder uh capital the the i i think if we're going to [Music] look at what can be with a decentralized democratized web we have to look at what is uh and what is is really a continuation of uh sort of plantocracy economics right plantation economics and i mean that very seriously the the platform let's say facebook in this particular case would be a plantation the workers aren't the people who work at facebook those are the farmhands the uh the actual workers are us and the crop is your data right so if you look at it that way then there's a point at which you have to ask yourself to frank mccourt's mom's point what do you do about that right we're gonna do about that so what we're engaging the business that we're engaged in is about overturning that model reimagining what capital looks like reimagining what structures look like i think that in the case of tokenization and token economies it does actually open up a place for sovereign identity it opens up room for the ownership of data it opens up new vistas for our concept of capital and what that means in introducing human capital into the equation so there are a lot of changes that are going to be happening over the next five ten years uh that will look very different from from i think what funds even look like now uh so i would i would add that a lot of that investment will stop hopefully coming from us as gatekeepers quite frankly because funds will invest in an array of things to see what works and the optimization of a fund is is a return a financial return so we're going to look more at things like outcomes human outcomes and the governance part of tokens is going to help us do that of course if you invest in something you don't want to go broke doing it you want to make sure you make some money but it's about communities making money individuals owning their data owning their rights owning their attribution for whatever they're contributing and then amassing in communities that then amplify and extrude value as opposed to extract it so i think that's one of the major differences that we're talking about here yeah and actually that um leads me to my next question which is in this world where you know we have these tokens launching and they're oftentimes saying hey we're a fair launch token and then meanwhile they're kind of deriding what they call the vc coins are it's very clear that if you are an early stage investor and a vc participating then you kind of almost automatically become a whale in these governance tokens and you have a lot of weight in these votes so how are you guys managing that are you just happy to have that power or are you you know trying to what kind of like shift the way things are done i know that a lot of communities are looking at quadratic voting too which is a system of voting in which the number of coins or number of individual entities that vote a particular way can can increase their weight if the number is greater and if it's just whales dominating on the other side of the boat then their their weight is lessened so curious to hear how that's being managed i think it comes up to to also like the the the style of investing and when you invest in a company and you've got some shares and you've got some rights and you've got like some some potential influence um on the decision of the company um well we see ourself as investors who want to be like next to the for the best interest of the the companies of the founders and when it talks about like now it's the best interest of the community the founding team and all that so we we we try to always stick to the mentor of do no arm and be like uh founder friendly and it it comes back to the to the same thing in uh in uh in these uh these protocols it's about like participating uh whenever you can stake and participate in the network to add security to the network we do that whether it be by by mining by farming by by staking by providing liquidity um but not so much in the role of pure activism and and trying to to uh to use that dominate dominant position to influence you now in our side always trying to think about like the community of stakeholders and act in the best interest of these networks okay so just in the votes you even just basically try not to wield your power so much is that what you're saying what was it like you're not you're trying to not wield the power that you have no exactly do no arm like we review the the governance proposal and and we we don't like uh actively like participate in creating those proposals but we kind of review them uh vote for them uh check the the community feedback and and take the decision from there oh i see i also feel like a lot of firms are just figuring this out and how to strike the right balance and i think um one thing to point out is that most vcs you know historically looking at regular when investing in regular companies are owning maybe 10 15 20 and they have you know with that minority control position which is what we're used to um so we're not even coming at this generally from the point of expecting to have sort of real control uh but now as we're investing more in token networks uh the ownership percentages are way way lower so you know whereas we may just have 10 to 20 of a company now we have a half a percent to three or maybe four percent of a token network and so i think even in cases where bcs uh do have a large percentage relative to any single person um i think everybody is getting accustomed to having much much much uh overall influence when it comes to a project okay so now let's actually talk a little bit about something that rick brought up um which is that i think for a long time in crypto there's been this kind of idealistic notion that it would create a more inclusive world or it would bank the unbanked and i was curious to know what you guys thought in terms of what is actually played out do you feel that the technology is accomplishing those things and if not why not and what could be done better okay so i truly believe let's take bitcoin as a as a case study in that we forget the weight of ownership we won't even go there for the time being but you see all kinds of questionable applications of digital currencies i look at el salvador as a great example um actually adopting bitcoin as a national currency is not only a huge mistake but perhaps a crime um also the stress testing of digital currencies on people of color in africa in asia in latin america is is i think emblem of the kinds of issues that we're going to have to face it touches on all of these things because america doesn't allow for that you know it's sec does not allow us to test certain things they're being tested in other places they're being dropped into other localities and usually that is um with people who don't have much of a say el salvador is probably the most uh egregious example of that but um all in all i think the token economy bitcoin notwithstanding ethereum notwithstanding but with platforms like polka dot or bubbler that's being built and things like that then you're you're actually talking about uh egalitarianism being built into code and i think that's a very important way to look at this is that the trust that we talk about the trustless networks and these are all algorithmic issues now and we have yet to get that right so human factors are always going to wait a little bit towards greed i think that's probably part of your your book i think but it's up to us to determine and to get right these sorts of code issues and not to to test them on populations if they're lab rats i i think that's a big mistake because it always has negative outcomes so obviously bias is an investor i think free market capitalism is a powerful tool but it's an algorithm for allocating resources it's not an ideology and it's garbage in garbage out so we've started to get this idea that like maybe you should consider environmental considerations as part of the allocation of capital not just pure profits maybe you should consider a child labor like obviously we're not doing a perfect job on any of these but they're starting to get baked in what excites me about blockchain is if you get this right you can actually code this in uh and and uh start to steer the direction of where how this blockchain grows and what you know what you set as the goal that the free market is going to optimize for you know we're going to stop climate change by putting a price on carbon because then the free market all of a sudden works its magic and perfectly allocates the resources to reduce carbon because that's that's rolled into the cost so i i think we're not there yet i think we're building a platform that could potentially allow us to address some of these non-financial issues um you know get get stakeholder capitalism at play where where uh you actually include people um kaifu lee talks about what he calls human-centered capitalism that you know you might want to optimize for uh for human happiness plus profits maybe not just profits yeah and so i think blockchain is going to open up a lot of possibilities to start to look at capitalism in a different way i guess blockchain is like one of the most like inclusive technology you could imagine like anybody could get access to it anybody if it's open source it's open to anyone it's censorship resistant it's true like the the infrastructure currently is just not there whether it be like uh fees on the network and in a piece on bitcoin fees on ethereum it's just not there yet simply because the infrastructure is not there yet to to cater for all the type of interesting use case that you can have here so um this coming back to the idea that it's a super long term play and there's always this big infrastructure bed that still needs to be done uh all of this item on the on the actual uh um base layers on the scalability solution the layer two layers that i think of bitcoin and lightning finger pestering and side chain on it i think the other layer one so it's still like a very long-term play where this infrastructure needs to be built out and in that process application needs to start testing the boundaries of this infrastructure as we as we move through the cycles over the years so it seems like you mostly think that as long as the technology becomes more user-friendly then gradually the inclusion piece will sort of solve itself i mean is there anything kind of more proactive now that people either can do or that you think is already working i i think that that what's exciting to us is that fundamentally architecturally the technology is open and inclusive meaning you all you need is some software you don't need a bank account you don't need a credit card um you know there's all the things that you need to join the traditional financial world technically you don't need to join here at the same time if you look at the distribution of capital in crypto right now it's more concentrated than it is probably in the real world because you've got early adopters who've been paying attention and there's a you know big gd coefficient and so on and i think as has been mentioned the a lot of the technology itself is still pretty raw in terms of and puts up a barrier in terms of high fees on ethereum and other things which um are adding to sort of a snowball of you've got a wealthy group in in here that's participating more and earning more and so on um and so in practice it doesn't feel that way that you know one of the areas that feels like a like an opening to me is what we're seeing in play to earn games um so you know you've got folks like playing axi mostly in the philippines and and earning uh and treating that you know like a job and i think you've there's one example where the technology has opened up a window into a financial world that wasn't there before um to a way broader group of people than for instance are participating in you know d5 protocols or mining bitcoin and so i don't i don't think we can declare victory that this is inclusive i think the potential for it to be very inclusive is built into the technology um but i also think it's going to take a while hopefully for for that to become more real to more people yeah yeah that uh feels more right because you know i'm if anybody's been following the yield farming craze that's something that you know you can only really benefit from it if you're a whale and you have a lot of money to invest because the fees to do that are quite high well you have you have to self hunger i'm sorry you have to solve hunger first you have to solve housing first you have to solve certain human issues that allow people to actually have access to the things that we take for granted quite frankly yeah i mean it feels like you know just a little bit of a missed opportunity if it's just a lot of the kind of same inequality that we see and i'm you know it's not like i'm against capitalism because obviously i am for capitalism but i'm just saying here we have this opportunity of kind of people who are already wealthy are just getting wealthier then um one of the things i've been watching in blockchain also is is uh it's a meritocracy in the sense that you don't have to go to a fancy university or work at a big company just you know how good is your code and how smart are you then you rise to the top um so so it's a meritocracy in that sense but those people still have very similar backgrounds and so when you when you try to think about inclusion it's hard for a group that's not diverse to even think about inclusion so i think one of the things that that blockchain and and and the companies being built on and need to think about is how do you how do you get that inclusive mindset not just i want to be inclusive because you know folks like us from the same background have blind spots where you don't even know you're not being inclusive because you don't know what you don't know yeah i think i think blockchain needs to grow in that sense and find ways to bring people from the outside who can who can get those voices to the table dylan does blockchain need to grow or do we need to grow uh well i think blockchain is a great it's a great platform that could be built in many different ways we just need to write voices at the table when it's when it's put in stone or when it when it when it's finished yeah sorry i didn't mean to be the oh go ahead i was just saying one thing that that excites me and i acknowledge it's really early is that you know wealth is the basis for a lot of things right and and a big issue is how do you make it easier to create wealth and what whether you believe that blockchain assets like nfts or tokens or anything else are actually worth anything what is particularly exciting to me is that people can make them uh kind of from from scratch and build value around them and and and what you're starting to see is a a community of folks who are holding assets with value as the basis for creating platforms and creating communities and and a thousand percent acknowledge that this is still mostly techniques you know getting wealthy using computers you know just like the old things but but the idea that you're able to form assets and and bring a broader and broader number of people into ownership of those assets feels important uh the same way that facebook users don't own a cantona face uh sake of facebook and uber drivers can't own a stake of uber you know that model is different in crypto where you only you can start by earning the assets and holding the assets and potentially benefiting you know as as the these ecosystems you know brought in and

code inspire which is a school in afghanistan that teaches girls to code and she began or her school began teaching the girls how to code like solidity and stuff like that and um they were doing other things like creating video games where they decided to make the protagonist an afghan girl um and then there were like afghan boys playing this in a society where you know like typically you wouldn't kind of put a girl front and center so um anyway the the point is that you know like the fact that her organization was able to use crypto and and needed it because western union wasn't like a viable option and paypal wasn't a viable option and so this actually became like a good way for them to you know kind of pay out the students who had earned through like doing gigs for you know different places and and even for collecting their own donations and things like that so um clearly you know what you were saying about how the technology is open like it's it's you know uh reaching places that typically don't have access to financial services um and yet at the same time there is still so much inequality and i actually just want to ask one question which is for people who follow the space a lot you will probably recognize any time you go to a conference that is mostly men and there aren't that many women and i was curious to know just you know what your thoughts are on how to bring more women in the fold if you feel like there is any particular strategies that are effective and you know i as just an observer of this space i feel like even a lot of the outreach currently to more mainstream audiences is still more directed at men like these nft partnerships with like the nba or la liga uh you know i mean i have some female friends who are into sports but um i wouldn't say that's predominantly you know who are sports fans so i was just curious for your thoughts on the gender imbalance in crypto so i mean there's obviously a gender balance in computer science in general um i was a trustee of harvey mudd college for 10 years in claremont california it's a small but extremely rigorous institution it was one-third women it was you know it's been around for about 60 years always a male president we hired the first female president and she showed up she wrote a handwritten note to every accepted female student every year and then in comp she's a computer scientist um in computer science she switched the introductory language to python which was not so well known at that point so everyone learned a new language together it was relatively simple they switched the the uh they switched the kind of projects they would do to be more sort of projects and result oriented than you know grindy tasks uh and brought the number of women in computer science up to around 50 in the major and so you know it was really just about uh uh about it's about an initial structure and sort of who gets in the door like you know if you if you show up as a computer genius as a young guy a lot of these places just just push that through and do you have ideas on how that could be applied here in this in crypto or like a decentralized web so i mean i don't know specifically but like that's the mindset of of you need to open it up and you need to uh you need to explain to the to the potential programmers and participants what they can do with it to change the world more than just sort of the the nitty-gritty aspects of the of the technology but it's i mean it's obvious uh you know you have a trained base that's that's overall email so it's gonna be uh it's gonna be uh hard to shift that uh on a dime tonight can i just add i think that's correct i think that there's an institutional approach to it but you could also stop having crypto bro meetings in strip clubs you can there's a lot of things that we do that that we take for granted you can stop painting girls gold and having them dance at bitcoin conventions seriously simple stuff simple stuff um i'm glad you referenced her she's a friend of mine oh roya her ex-partner where my boob is a good friend of mine roy is also a friend of mine and and i helped them with bitlanders with francesco ruli when they first started in this business so they were helping afghani uh women but also afghani young men but mostly women young women uh hold money through bitcoin in the form of amazon cards because of course in afghanistan at the time it may be the same now um women couldn't hold money their brothers their husbands their significant men in their life would simply take it from them right so the phone produced the opportunity to have a wallet that they could own so this has been a question throughout this space in tech in general but really in crypto it's it's especially important and i forget crypto in blockchain it's especially important uh because we do have these tools to to dylan's point uh you know to everyone's point we have these tools the question is how are we going to implement them it's almost like we have to throw a grenade into our own the seed of our own souls and figure out what's really important what kinds of things do we want to invest our attention in and not having our attention monetized by other platforms but making our attention the platform but is so is there something that you all as investors feel that you can do to address this issue or do you sort of feel like the source of the problem is kind of outside of your scope nothing's outside i mean i think investors can and should play a big role in increasing diversity of all kinds in their portfolio and the companies they back and the companies they work with and the boards that they're on and so on and i think everybody can many firms are taking this on in different ways i know we are um i think it probably starts with at the very least keeping track you know we've been tracking for the last year or you know who we're backing um you know keeping better track of that kind of information we've you know taken it upon ourselves to try and be more proactive in a lot of ways about increasing diversity in our portfolio i think investors are in a position of you know some influence and power and have networks and and have a burden to diversify their networks you know and bring you know new people into the fold um another part of it is like trying to identify leaders and and organizations that are doing good work you know adjacent to the investing so like in crypto there's a group called g256 which is like focused on you know bringing diversity into blockchain there should be more and there will be and there you know there are female leaders of a couple of very high profile crypto projects but that's not enough um and so it's a cliche and terrible answer to say that it will take time but i think it will take time but i i do also think that it won't change unless people focus on it okay so now we're going to really switch tax because this is also relevant to investing in a decentralized world and it's a hot topic right now which is the regulatory environment here in the u.s um i think a lot of people know for a long time there was kind of the sense that there wasn't a lot of clarity and maybe now we're getting a little bit more clarity than it seems uh what i would say people in the industry perceive as negative um so i'm curious to know how this is affecting investment activity uh in the crypto and blockchain space for us investors clearly um it's has always been like a a tough thing to to work in crypto just to get access to bank accounts and uh my produce company back in in 2014 even though we were not touching with crypto directly yet this thing would like uh to get access to bank account and that was always a big struggle and it gets like even worse with uh with like all the regulation for crypto exchanges or protocols that uh that are building stuff that uh that looks like uh security or that uh engage in in trades and and as investors we see that um we're based in the us we're structured as a us venture fund um and we sometimes cannot have access to uh to to some projects simply because uh they they start to uh not accept any us investors so that they they they are outside of the of the scope of the us regulation and um and like you can still get uh back this project by having like some offshore entities but we see that like as investors for for some projects they simply do not accept any more us investors and it looks like um yeah part of the innovation is going to uh to go on the on some other jurisdiction because like entrepreneurs they they need clarity uh that's the worst thing that you that you can have like this uncertainty on the what's going to happen or the regulator is going to change your mind i think what's lacking is we have like some some guidelines and frameworks where you can you know a little bit how you're going to fit in that box uh and if that's not the case i guess like uh entrepreneurs and companies will go the path of this resistance and go in some jurisdiction that are more friendly for there for their business so yeah i i want to hear other people's answers to that but i'm also curious like how does that affect the development of this decentralized web if you have kind of these different silos i'm just curious if you guys are trying to solve for that or if you think it's just going to be like that there will be one decentralized web in the us and another decentralized web elsewhere or you know i i think what some consider a hindrance with u.s regulations i think we're missing opportunities because we're looking at the space as a wall street casino and not as a place where we can actually grow ideas and we can grow access and utility the regulations are clear we can build inclusive structures but we keep defaulting to casinos we keep defaulting to existing structures like wall street now who says that the crypto space has to look like wall street who says that we have to focus on returns as opposed to outcomes this is us saying that the regulators have actually given us a straight path into a different way of looking at this whole thing yet we continue to try to force it into the square hole of wall street so that's really a lot on us i mean we we could change that calculus if we can change the idea of value and make that something that people want to be a part of and we can build other structures that then help us trade and value that way through communities but we keep going to the same stuff and we get the same results and then we start crying about oh what the sec is doing to us does anyone want to add i mean this is one of the most complicated difficult issues in the space i think at the at the very beginning there's a sort of impedance mismatch here because this technology establishes trust in a different way through transparency through cryptographic proofs um through open source code and um and and the and it also enables the creation of sort of these digital artifacts that can look a little bit like money can look a little bit like stocks can look a little bit like commodities can look a little bit like packets of data and so it's it touches on everything and a lot of those are regulated sectors and so i think there's going to continue to be a challenge to figure out what is this stuff and who should regulate it and i think um what we're seeing right now is a combination of every different sort of regulator looks at it through their lens and sees it as the thing that they regulate um and eventually i think and also is whether it's you know on the financial crime side of the security side or other places is looking to regulate through the existing mechanisms which is you know reporting and and filings and so on and i think what i would hope we would see over time are new regulatory structures that are more native to this medium that understand it for what it is um and you know in ways of and by structures i mean like bodies and then also regulatory mechanisms that can really harness the openness and transparency and open source nature of this technology to achieve the sort of outcomes which we want which are safety integrity you know investor protection and so on but but over time i think come at it in a different way and what i hope we don't do is is is sort of destroy the technology by um trying to regulate it in the old way uh before we get to see um the benefits of it at a broader scale and you know we run the risk of pushing more and more offshore uh into other jurisdictions where there's you know less safety and and so on for consumers so it's a really really really hard problem and i think it's front and center for every investor and every project operating in the space so do you think that what might happen is that we'll end up with kind of crypto slash decentralized web for the us and then a different version for elsewhere or and also nick it seemed like you were saying that you wish that there were either a different new agency or at least a new set of rules for crypto specifically like you're saying you feel like the old regulations just don't apply here i'm not saying they don't apply and and i think the concepts of um you know protecting against financial crimes of various kinds and protecting investors and having markets with integrity these are they're important reasons why we have regulations that get at all those things i just think that it will take a while for us to adapt the mechanisms to achieve them that kind of fit with the way that this technology works i think there are a lot of built-in benefits in this technology towards those i those goals which we would want which we hope to keep persisting and take advantage of to harness the goals and i think my guess is that over time that's going to result in new new agencies with new techniques i don't think that's going to happen tomorrow oh no i yeah at the moment it really doesn't look like it's going to happen tomorrow um okay so i i could keep asking questions but if anybody would like to ask a question the panelists you can come right up to this mic here and and go ahead hey everyone my name is alejandra uh what do you see the role of institutions sort of balancing out with individuals um and will this technology sort of just set a new framework for institutions to take advantage of the automation that's going on or um yeah sort of like what do you see the role of institutions in this new decentralized future and and actually can you um just elaborate on what you mean by institutions do you mean like yeah maybe like facebook banks etc will they use this technology to just deploy their services more efficiently um which then you just kind of like reinstitute the same frameworks that we have now or um i guess open up to to a long tail of uh startups and smaller companies being able to take advantage of of this technology using existing frameworks institutions will always get it wrong look at facebook libra look at credits before that we we have to people like us actually have to build new sorts of frameworks that institutions have a place in i i can't answer that question personally i don't know if you guys can i mean i'll just give one example i know a lot of the conversation this conference has been about the role of traditional tech platforms google facebook apple so on and i think one of the directional trends we see here that we're more excited about is the potential for this technology to migrate control of data and and other sort of technical infrastructure away from a company an institutional company and more into the hands of users so for instance the data that you publish you know in a social networking context or blocking context today all gets piped you know through uh these platforms where and that's where they exercise control and ad advertising all this other stuff and i think what one of the many things that web 3 is changing is an architecture where users have more direct control over their data you know signing signing data packets and messages encrypting them storing them in different places re-aggregating you know them in a different way so i think the the role of the data aggregator in web 3 i think is going to be very different than the data aggregator in web 2. um and that's one of the themes that that we think is important it was a technology that was like uh from its beginning as an asset as a technology something that was for retail before institution like for for bitcoin for for like a crypto assets as i said like it was for retail users and and a chapter on the that uh institution came into to to get access to it because they just couldn't at the beginning and i guess with that technology it's similar that it's mostly like new developers that are going to build some frameworks that are going to compete against the the actual institution and um and it's contradictory a little bit for them like they they build their trust through like uh time uh through uh and and with that they can like monetize like uh are aggregated and attention of users within their platform i guess like uh well web free give by freeing this technology gives the opportunity for new companies to you know have their time to trust to be like tremendously faster and build trust within the community and build like new new networks uh based on that and getting accelerating this time to trust is super important to compete against this uh these institutions and get like some some better forms of product that are more like like a concern about data privacy data ownership and kind of thing so i think the the part of the idea of of unfinished labs and project liberty is if you build an open source protocol that's a social graph and you make that available to everybody but you own your data if you like facebook then then hook facebook into it and they'll continue to give what what they give if you want to choose a different one you turn facebook off you turn someone else on if you want to build your own you build your own if you want a a friend to build one for you so i think you know the the facebooks will still exist and i think they'll be great opportunities to build new versions of facebook but rather than being big because they own your data and won't give it back they'll be big because they use your data to provide value to you and if they stop providing value you you give it to someone else so so i i think that that's the goal if you if you if you separate the data from the company then you see what the company really can do and what value they can really give you i mean i i wouldn't think of facebook as an institution i would think of governments as institutions or libraries or things like that uh but i've gone yes go ahead i was just want to ask a question um and rick you know kind of led us to the issue around you know the sexism and and greed and the culture that you know has prevailed in the world led by peter thiel there's a number of articles out today not to call anybody out but palantir has just you know gotten away with murder not paying taxes just building billions and billions of dollars in wealth and uh having just gotten more government contracts than you know could ever be thought of so what is going to change a culture that has been repeating itself i was with drexel burnham land bear the predator's ball is alive and crypto now so it's like you know what's happening it's 40 years later and we're still doing the same thing and expecting different results yeah i i almost want to answer this myself being the woman on the panel even though i'm the moderator and that's to say that you know it's pretty shocking that me too only happened in 2018 it's uh you know obviously very very recent past so it's kind of interesting just how ingrained sexism can be and how difficult and hard it is to change things but it is changing um i do think actually you know crypto has the full range it has uh you know a lot of sexism like we see in a lot of parts of the world um but there's also plenty of lovely people i'm a woman in the space and i deal with men all the time and um you know i wouldn't say i've had like too much sexism i would say though that one thing that is interesting to me that i've noticed is that um people recognize and they will call out racism if women in the space bring up sexism uh there's a lot of denial and a lot of pushback and a lot of things that are said like oh this technology you know has no barriers women just aren't interested and it's like oh wow like really you you don't recognize the barriers like you're you think that this is a true meritocracy here so um anyway but you know i do think that things are changing it's just um as our panelists said that a conscious approach helps a lot and um i think you know a lot of great ideas were discussed here and i think that hopefully we'll see more implementation and change one thing for 10 seconds yes literally i know we have to wrap up i know we have to wrap so look if i want to leave you with anything and i think if any of us want to leave you with anything here it would be that a decentralized web is a democratized web a democracy requires eternal vigilance and so you have to take your attention off the distractions and on to your own self-sovereignty if you're going to make this work because it doesn't work without you we're just people who help fund this stuff or with people help build this stuff but really it's about people like yourselves and if as a whole we're going to let distraction rule us and put our attention into things that don't matter and that's what we're going to get as a people so where we point our attention is what we're going to get out of it that's all i have to say you're here great excellent last words all right thank you all so much for attending this panel [Applause] [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline move over china the u.s now leads the way in btc hash rate according to the university of cambridge the united states now accounts for more of bitcoin's hash rate than any other country in the world as of august 2021 more than one-third 35.4 percent of bitcoin's hashrate which is a measure of the computing power securing the network was located in the united states the figure marks a drastic shift in mining power last summer the us only accounted for 4.2 percent of the hash rate and for 21.8 in may of this year following behind the u.s in terms of hash rate was kazakhstan at 18.1 percent russia at 11.2 percent and canada at 9.6 no other country currently houses more than 5 of bitcoin's hash rate just like the us kazakhstan russia and canada have each seen their share of the global hash rate increase over the past year this upward trend in global hash rate for these countries coincides with an equally severe decrease in hash rate for china which began cracking down on cryptocurrency mining in earnest earlier this year data from cambridge recorded precisely zero percent of bitcoin's hashrate coming from china in july of 2021 marking an abrupt about-face for a country that used to be a mining powerhouse for context in august of 2020 china miners made up 67.1 percent of bitcoin's hash rate as recently as may of 2021 china still accounted for 34.3 michelle raux digital assets lead at the cambridge center for alternative finance believes that the shift in power away from china is a positive development for the health of bitcoin's network the effect of the chinese crackdown is an increased geographic distribution of hash rate across the world which can be considered a positive development for network security and the decentralized principles of bitcoin roush wrote stripes re-entry to bitcoin starts with engineers stripes beginning to assemble a team of crypto engineers to navigate the payment company's journey into web 3. gma ponzine the former head of engineering for banking and financial products at stripe will be heading the team the engineers will be joining a brand new team at stripe and will quote design and build the core components that we need to support crypto use cases as the job description states ponzine says he is looking for engineers and designers to build the future of web3 payments the job posts do not specify which cryptocurrencies stripe will be working on or what aspects of blockchain technology stripe will be attempting to leverage a coindesk report says that the company quote wants to remain tech neutral while building in crypto and perhaps a hint at where stripes focus will be stripe ceo john collison described crypto as quote a very exciting tool in solving the issue of cross-border transactions earlier this year notably this is not the payment company's first time down the crypto rabbit hole stripe was an early supporter of bitcoin and one of the first major companies to accept the cryptocurrency back in 2014. that being said stripe ended its bitcoin program in 2018 saying that customer demand was not there

through kyc check to utilize the nft platform coinbase seems bullish on nfts as an economic force quote our ambition with coinbase nft is to allow everyone to benefit from their creative spark to contribute to a future where the creator economy isn't a small subset of the real economy but a central driver coinbase said according to decrypt over 1.4 million users have already signed up for the waitlist a number that ended up briefly shutting down the site due to heavy traffic in related news set the bees is launching a new platform called sotheby's metaverse to auction nfts for fiat eth btc

commissioner hester purse aka crypto mom is widely known for a more favorable stance toward crypto and has even proposed that token issuers have a three-year safe harbor period to develop their coins commissioner caroline crenshaw made waves by saying purse's safe harbor proposal could potentially be harmful to the crypto community she said quote had a safe harbor been in place during the initial coin offering or ico boom of 2017 and 2018 i think the results would have been even worse for investors and the markets icos and other digital asset offerings raised billions from investors but most never delivered on their promises commissioner purse for her part continues to take the sec to task as she did in this speech at the texas blockchain summit on october 8th regarding the prevailing attitude inside the sec that digital assets already have legal clarity perc said quote the idea that there is legal clarity as to when crypto assets are securities must come as a surprise to the lawyers advising crypto projects that have struggled with this issue for years on the recent trend of americans being geo-blocked from air drops due to regulatory uncertainty purse added quote widespread geo-blocking of americans should concern american regulators even if it does lighten their regulatory load take a look at twitter after one of these air drops the sec is not being thanked and finally after lamenting over the jurisdictional jockeying between regulators purse turned to stablecoin saying quote i believe that we must take strong account of the potential benefits of stablecoins including the possibility that a us dollar stablecoin might support the role of the dollar in the global economy to wrap up our thoughts purse took to twitter writing quote if government
