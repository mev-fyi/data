brookwood pc welcome greg and collins thanks for having us thanks laura so we are recording on friday october 1st and yesterday was the last day of the sec and cftc's fiscal year and i think a lot of lawyers in this space and i also were expecting that there might be some enforcement actions and there were but they were kind of small and not like super worth diving into in a big way we could touch on them but i'm curious greg and collins if you have an opinion as to why we didn't see any big enforcement actions from these regulators well i think from from my perspective i mean the the federal government is typically pretty good about keeping a close lid on enforcement actions as they're going on and in particular where they stand sometimes you'll hear about information sweeps or or things will leak out but it's typically not in the interest of parties who are being investigated or from for the prosecutors themselves to uh to to have things come out in the open um and obviously there are a lot of really complex issues that don't necessarily always fit neatly into a calendar uh i think yeah a little surprised that the closest thing we had to uh uh major crypto action or settlement was a relatively denimous uh settlement with kraken regarding their margin trading program uh as well as a handful of actions that appeared to be only tangentially related to crypto uh from from the cftc so a little surprising it's interesting you say that too greg because i think one of the other things that um you know we maybe don't appreciate as lawyers in the space too is that you know there was some movement one i think on the dmm and dmg case um i think for a lot of us in crypto we didn't view that as that impactful because the view was that's not really you know d5 but at the same time i think you know maybe there's an internal view that that's setting you know some major precedent for them potentially being able to pursue d5 and then i think you know the other interesting thing which you know has obviously been in the news and we probably couldn't talk about specifics here given client confidentiality but just generally speaking i think it's pretty well known that there's been you know a slew of investigative kind of requests um and not necessarily subpoenas but just hey we're looking into this space and i do think that that may uh you know be a bit more of a blitz than what people appreciate um so perhaps it's just that this year a lot of the attention was more privately focused rather than publicly focused is at least one theory i had and nick collins just um to make sure all listeners are on the same page um tell us what the dmm mdmg cases were oh sure so the dmm and dmg cases i think were i think that it stood for decentralized money management or something that was the ticker for the two tokens and it essentially was um you know ostensibly promoting itself as kind of like a yield farming yield aggregation play so for those that are kind of familiar with defy you may be aware of that but for those that aren't in very very simple terms they were essentially telling people that they had a programmatic way for people to deposit money and then have it be essentially managed on a non-custodial basis in order to generate returns um that obviously raises questions generally in in the legal industry but in particular uh the issue here was that one these folks were not actually using you know programmatic enforcement or any type of non-custodial mechanism they were you know just committing fraud taking folks money and then managing it themselves and then secondly they actually weren't actually managing that but the important or potentially important thing is that at least the sec framed it as hey this is a defy offering and we're going after it because we think the tokens themselves are securities one is an equity security one has a note under that reeves analysis i know we talked about that a few weeks ago and we'll get into that um and then they also layered in the in the fact that there was fraud um and or um you know some type of deception so that latter part is what i think was really material but the former part was really important because it suggested you know two really important things one they're obviously looking at what they think is defy and two they're now looking at securities that go beyond just the howie test i think that was the first or maybe second time we saw in a settlement or an enforcement action where they explicitly referenced reeves correct me if i'm wrong i think that was the first or second time in a formal order for digital assets where they uh referenced it i think that's right uh it had previously been discussed at least one of the trio of uh no action letters that came out in 2019 i think it may have been pocketful of quarters uh had a potentially reeves discussion um or turnkey it was one of the two but yeah i think it's reflective of our two definitions of decentralized in name only uh this was an example where i think a lot of people in the space pointed at those at that action and said well this is not really d5 it's it's this is decentralized in name only in that they are uh literally just putting decentralized on the name whereas that same term of dyno uh was used again in congressional hearings i think a couple of weeks ago to refer and i think perhaps by a couple of folks including chair gensler to refer to decentralized projects that perhaps vary on some gradation of actual decentralization but um you know key taking the perspective that these were not really decentralized in significant material ways yeah and i think for the dmm and dmg cases that's those are the ones as you said they were called uh decentralized name only but i noticed that sec commissioner has her purse also called them that and um i don't know if she coined the phrase or not but clearly there is at least somebody at a high level in the sec who makes the difference between projects like that versus ones that are legitimately either decentralized or trying to be you know i'm not sure what her view is on that so we've mentioned this reef's case a few times and i just want to make sure people understand what that is and why that's significant as you said this was brought up in the context as another way to you know look at this question of whether or not a token is a security so after the howie test so can you give us a sense of what that case says and then how it would apply here ernst young versus reeves i should say reeves versus ernst young i should say a supreme court case from uh i think 1990 uh that addressed sort of a fundamental issue of whether or not a note is a security and to put some context in that there are a number of federal securities laws uh the the three that we probably think most about when we're talking about is a what is the definition of a security would be the 1933 act the securities act the securities exchange act of 1934 and the investment company act of 1940 together with the investment advisors act of 1940. the 33 and 34 acts have fundamentally the same definition of security and it lists out a litany of of different types from the standard stuff like equity to the the more flexible definitions like investment contracts that everyone in the crypto space is very familiar with thanks to the howie howie test which uh which is how courts will interpret whether uh a particular scheme is an investment contract reeves takes a look at a different uh set of that definition which is notes and in some cases one some might try and also apply it to evidence of indebtedness which are codified as types of securities and there's a explicit presumption that a note is a security unless it fits certain families of notes that are known to become more commercial in nature than than than investment in nature so in in the reeves case the the court set out uh a slew of categories i it was seven or eight categories that were called families of uh of commercial arrangements and if your specific instrument your your note was within that those uh seven families of commercial non-security notes they would not be deemed to be a security for ones that were not clearly within those seven families the court established a test that looked at four different categories on a balancing test so in in howie it's three or four depending on how you want to look at the definition three or four prongs and all of them must be satisfied to be a security whereas in reeves it's a balancing test it's not quite as algorithmic and those things those those factors that you look at are the motivation of the seller and the buyer in the transaction is it commercial in nature is it investment in nature the plan of distribution of the instrument is it being broadly distributed to the public uh or is it more specific and bilateral or closely uh distributed the reasonable expectations of the investing public would people think of it as a security and the presence of an alternative regulatory regime which is probably the most important one that uh that we look at in a lot of cases uh for for the crypto community is is there an alternative regulatory regime that applies that would make something that might otherwise be a note or a security note rather should say into something that would be viewed as a non-security and so what do you think the sec is doing by now applying reeves a few times here like if you're kind of reading the tea leaves what would you say is maybe the next evolution in their application of existing case law i guess it is to the crypto space well i think that you know let collins weigh in here but i think you know we've looked at where they're applying it and it's often been in these lending type of programs where we've also seen action on the state level and while the initial actions that were targeted at block fi from new jersey and alabama and texas and kentucky or vermont i can't recall which a lot of that focused on howie but a few of the states particularly texas also referenced reeves and i think some of the conversation around it targets reeves in no small part because uh some of these relationships do look a little bit more like a debt relationship than an investment into an enterprise so i don't know collins if you want to chime in on that yeah i mean i definitely agree i think where i'm expecting to see it most applied or most trotted out is going to be in the context of the type of lending or potentially i wouldn't call it necessarily re-hypothecation but rehypothecation-like activities i think those are probably the most prominent areas where they'll look to raise it in the d5 context now obviously for you know centralized entities um and it goes you know to a point that you raise laura i think it's in some ways sometimes easier to make that argument um from at least the government's perspective as i view it because it's a lot easier to say hey you've got somebody who's taking in this capital who may either be managing it or at least be you know subjecting that capital to whatever other downstream flows are in their business and you know like greg was talking about the 33 act the 34 act the 40 acts all of those are you know largely predicated on the existence of intermediaries and how we either want to constrain their behavior or prescribe some type of behavior that they should be uh taking and so when you've got those traditional actors i think you know mapping that framework on is a little bit easier for the same reason i think you start to see why the distinctions that folks like hester and some in the crypto community want to make between kind of a truly decentralized protocol versus a cd5 protocol or a semi-centralized protocol is really material because in the absence of those intermediaries some of the questions and the natures of the questions potentially change and maybe normatively they should is what i think a lot of people want to argue on the policy side okay so let's actually just focus the next part of the discussion on things that are obviously centralized which would be lending products from companies like block fi or celsius or this proposed uh product from coinbase called coinbase lent which they ended up deciding not to pursue because the sec threatened to sue them if they did so when you look at those what's your opinion do those look like securities to you according to um you know this precedent that that we've discussed here or would you say it looks like something different and um maybe it's not a security so i'm gonna preface this just by saying um i i did i've previously worked with some of the folks so i i can't you know necessarily speak on their particular business models but i i guess i i would generally say i think that if there is an argument on the securities law side of things it's not fruitful from my perspective to focus on the notes or certificate of indebtedness or investment contract analysis i think what and i think my public position has generally been shoe horning in these assets into those tests is not the appropriate way to do so at the same time you know i'm happy to concede particularly with some of the arrangements that i've seen and not with these three particular companies but others that i've talked to over the years or seen in their business models i'll definitely concede that i think some of these models will almost certainly constitute securities but not because they are an evidence of indebtedness to a company or not because it's a note-like investment that traditionally falls in those categories and i don't think it even is one of these things where they're necessarily managing people's money in the way that we would expect an equity contract i think the more appropriate way and and this is where i really struggle with the sec's approach right now is to say look we've got like greg said a litany of definitions here i mean it's like 30 or 40 definitions two of which are things like participation in a profit sharing scheme or things like an asset-backed security or a bond those three categories are much more appropriate to discuss and you know participation in a profit sharing scheme have sometimes relied on the howie test which is why i think that it shows why treating those as equity instruments is probably not the right move but i would say it's a harder argument to say something like a central entity issuing you a receipt and that entitles you to some coupon payment in the future doesn't look like a bond or doesn't look like some type of asset-backed security but that's going to require that they build out the jurisprudence in the case law and i think that's important for us to push because if we're saying hey we want guidance we want clarity where are the lines what are we looking to do them saying hey we're going to shoehorn it into this test that doesn't really fit either of these parameters but you guys should just figure it out is not appropriate especially if you've got a large institution that's looking to follow our laws that's registered publicly that's reaching out to them at a certain point you might have to say look it's incumbent on us as the rule maker we have rule making authority to start expanding our previous guidance and start applying you know our frameworks to existing definitions so that's generally my perspective there without necessarily taking a view on any of those three products yeah i think i'm i'm sort of in the same boat with collins as i've done a little work in the space in the past so i don't want to go too deep on specifics at the same time one one thing that i think it's worthwhile to note is this isn't the only scheme out there uh crypto isn't the only industry that has relationships like this for example uh you know within the investable asset market you have securities lending programs that are operated by broker dealers and you have a commodity rehypothecation that's operated by a number of commodity warehouse storage facilities where you do have you know custodians who are rehypothecating and utilizing underlying assets outside of a bank framework and outside of a securities uh framework and i think one of the things that that you do look at there and perhaps it is returning it to reeves is uh what what's basically the purpose of the relationship does it look like a commercial relationship or does it look like a an investment relationship and it's a nice reminder that all of these uh all of these lending programs are not created and structured in the same way so we've got two two prominent uh programs from reasonably well regulated u.s exchanges coinbase proposed their lend product gemini and genesis trading have the urn facility that is uh is actually a situation where gemini customers lend to genesis uh and it's facilitated by by gemini but those are are programs that you could make an argument is a add-on to a relationship that is principally commercial in nature the custodial relationship the exchange business relationship that was pre-existing and this starts to look a little bit more like securities lending or commodities rehypothecation it's a little different when the entire purpose of the scheme and the arrangement is to facilitate this interest bearing account so i i think there are some distinctions which may create some nuance but uh i otherwise agree with collins that it's not apples to apples when we're when we're trying to look at what these products should be weighed at against versus something like an ico where i think howie is is is really probably a pretty appropriate court doctrine to look for and then would you agree with collins and and correct me collins if i and don't summarize your position accurately but it seems like you were saying that you felt that there should just be new legislation to deal with these new types of products that maybe aren't covered by existing regulation well no not even necessarily new legislation like like the definitions that i described to you are already included in the securities act and the exchange act the reason why the sec prefers to default to an investment contract or a note is a there's established case law um and there there are two reasons why that's important one there's a road map for them to follow um that can reuse prior work and that really does matter for lawyers we don't you know aim to recreate the wheel every time but the second is that extending case law or getting new case law can be a bit of a risky business particularly for a regulatory body because if they are wrong then it establishes precedent that many many other people in the industry may want to follow and it may you know incentivize behavior that they may want to dissuade now obviously there's a question as to whether they should you know want to dissuade behavior that a judicial body has determined is legal but regardless you know administrative bodies are still political organs and they are impacted by both political realities but also just administrative priorities so i think that it's not necessarily promulgating new laws i certainly think we should be considering that in some areas but to be frank for a lot of the securities law matters i don't necessarily think that's needed and this is kind of important and again this is i'm assuming we're still all focused on the centralized components here because yeah i think in the decentralized context a bit different but one of the things that we've been talking about and it really frustrates me that it's not more publicly known is that a lot of these exchanges i don't think their problem is hey these are securities and we like we don't want to offer securities for the most part in practice for the end user and even for the exchanges for most of management other than the compliance function it's not really going to be a huge difference for them whether they're issuing like this asset from a bd entity or a money transmitter they're going to have very similar requirements in terms of customer identification now yes there are other obligations that will apply to a securities entity that may not apply to a money transmitter but at the end of the day for the most part your customers that they're not really exposed to that and maybe a little bit more data collection and even internally most of the stakeholders aren't exposed that it's just you know additional compliance costs so what frustrates me is that coinbase has a broker dealer and as does do many other us entities the reason why they can't offer these products right now is not because they're intransigent and don't want to like offer any security like for them would be the same thing at the end of the day right like i come to coinbase or you just redirect me to coinbase securities i sign up same account you have the same information it's not gonna be a huge difference to me either way um and then i can get my lend product the reason why they can't is actually because the sec also won't allow finra to approve crypto custodians as bds so we have broker dealers that are in the crypto business but none or at least none that are currently active that i'm aware of as of this month that are allowed to essentially fully satisfy a certain set of rules that apply to broker dealers that custody securities and so we're in this weird catch 22 where we have people that are saying hey i'm willing to register and be this you know regulated entity go ahead and regulate me and i bought an entity ready to go once you approve the license and the sec is saying yeah hold off we're not sure but also this is a security so you need a securities entity it's a very bizarre situation and i think it's a very important point because i see so many people with these takes of oh these guys don't want to follow the law or something and it's like coinbase brought this broker dealer i think in like 2019 with the expectation of being able to offer a crypto securities and it's just been almost three years with no approval so i think it's a bit disingenuous when i hear gary and many other folks saying hey come and talk to us when it's like hey they haven't just talked to you they bought a bd they put it through the licensure process and now they've just been waiting for two years it's very disingenuous to put it like everyone's shooting from the hip because we're in tech or something like that and i think it wasn't even just one i think i think they actually bought a couple of yeah i think it's a two-year-old advisor yeah it was two or three around all in 2018 or 2019 and i think it's it's been a significant point of frustration you know i'm not a broker-dealer lawyer but uh some of the bd lawyers in the space i think one you know remarked to me that she had something like 50 clients in the pipeline trying to get the ball moved forward with uh with finra and the sec which is not to say that there aren't some tough issues but uh you know when we look at the industry and the criticism of the industry that sometimes takes place the level of intractability of this system to quickly adopt or adapt i should say to what's happening in the market it's not just on on the companies that are building it it's also in the need to have a regulatory environment that responsibly promotes responsible innovation yeah actually just listening to you guys talk it made me think and this is just me guessing i have done no reporting into this other than just talking to crypto errors i i mean i haven't spoken to anyone at the sec or anything like that but just listening to this it makes me think oh it's probably just they haven't figured out how they want to regulate the space and so they're just trying to keep people in a holding pattern what do you think of that theory i mean i think i think it's right but that i mean that's problematic when you're you know publicly saying that people come in or register and do it the right way people go to do it and you say okay we'll get back to you in three to five years that that's it's it's not reasonable and so that's why it's like it's extremely frustrating sometimes to see some of the statements publicly as though everyone in crypto is running around dodging clients and i i can definitely you know uh kind of co-sign what craig has said i mean two years ago i knew somebody saying that maybe it's the same person and they had you know 20 or 30 people waiting so i can only imagine that the list has grown i've talked to finra about this issue i've had people talk to the sec it's not like it's it's it's strange when you talk to them and there's almost like a it's almost like a sympathetic recognition like hey we get it we're working really hard i i would appreciate that if but for the fact that you you know you turn on the news and you've got somebody saying hey these guys don't want to comply and it's like what's going on and and let's not let's not you know understate the reality here oh a significant swath of crypto actors are probably not great actors and we should be cleaning these folks up but that's the thing right if we were focused on them we could do that and which you know what i guess i'll end my little mini rant here which by saying it's funny because sometimes you see people say like 90 or 95 of these are valueless well first of all you know i i don't think the hit rate and regular startup is that much higher but secondly you know at this point there's thirty thousand plus companies that's still three thousand companies that are valid like that's that's a huge amount of companies with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people working for them it's no longer like oh hey you've got 12 legitimate actors and 50 million bad actors it's like even if you want to take the most draconian you know 95 99 of people are bad actors that's still hundreds of companies almost as much as the fortune 500. so at this point i think it's it's a little like i said it's frustrating to have the condescension when people are acting in good faith and there's a wide swath of actors that are trying to make that outreach i was just going to say laura uh first off you know completely agree with what colin said and there is a degree of frustration and uh not not just with the slow progress but also the narrative that's being created around it um what i don't want us to lose sight of is there also are a lot of people who are working very hard uh on both the political side as well as on the regulatory side people working within these regulatory bodies we're taking great pains to actually understand and try the difference is that that doesn't always lead to policy or or affirmative movement uh that that actually allows innovation to occur here in the u.s so one of our continuing themes of concern over the course of 2021 is is this the year that more and more of crypto gets pushed uh outside of the us both on a development side and also on a market side um the number of opportunities for participation in this exciting new ecosystem uh gets smaller and smaller um you know collins can probably speak better to uh to to what we saw yesterday with geo blocking and i know we're still on c5 but uh when we get to d5 talking about what's going on with geo blocking of us ips and um you know it's it's a shame uh and i think it's important that we work to uh elevate the the parties and in the regulatory apparatus or the political apparatus who are working to again try and promote reasonable and responsible regulation and and to be able to foster um a crypto ecosystem here in the us yeah so why don't we discuss d5 actually momentarily because we're already halfway through the show but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible

link is in the description back to my conversation with greg and collins so there's so much more to be said even just about the centralized crypto world but let's talk about deep phy because i feel like that's really probably the major issue here um what would you say is so in a way i almost feel like a lot of this discussion is subtext for what's going on in day five like when you look at what's happening with the regulators and where things are going what do you think is going to be the regulatory stance toward befi i i can start or greg do you want to start since i i've i talked a lot in the last question and and i can concede the group go ahead collins because i know you have opinions on this no i think my my one-liner response is not great bob no i mean i i actually long term i actually am more optimistic than i think one most people probably are to my public posting probably suggests um and i i guess i'll preface this all by saying and sometimes i think people think that i'm like despondent but it's really more so that i think we have a flawed i mean incredibly flawed i mean this is coming from me like my family's history is mired in the flaws of our country so i'm no apologist for american history but while it's flawed i think we have one of the best arguments for constantly aiming to hold truth to power and that's because we've structured a system that ostensibly gives the people as much power as you might see in the modern world now that's probably more loaded despite the amount of caveats i tried to add here but i think i perhaps what i'm about to say with that just because i think there's this view in crypto like all governments are blunt we've got to burn everything nothing will ever get done i'm i'm actually not that guy and so for most people think i'm like a cyberpunk i may lose some some bona fides with them i genuinely think society has been like a pretty good improvement on the human condition and i think american society despite its flaws has been a pretty good upgrade in large part because we've had this strong respect for privacy rights and freedom of expression and so right now we do have a lot of people pushing back there's a combination the confluence of people that are objectively worried the old world is changing on them it seems crazy and novel there is real criticism and concern like you've got a bunch of people flipping god knows what and people running around laughing at people to stay poor probably not a great look um and there's a host of other things that really are causing anxieties about the rise of crypto and i think that's translating into our policy bodies but we're also starting to see like i think i think greg you raised this we're starting to see some of the politicians saying all right hold on hold on maybe we don't have to have a knee jerk on this part of that's because crypto people are starting to wield their political influence but part of it is because i think some of these folks like ron wyden and other people were were around for the dawn of the internet and they said look this was really important to us not only did it help boost our economy it's significantly you know in large part helped with our domestic and foreign policy um you know spreading our foreign policy um and i think in crypto we're starting to see some people recognize the same things and so it's a long-winded way of saying immediately in the near term yeah there's going to be a lot of friction particularly on derivatives lending those types of things because they are both the most disruptive to the traditional system and can bring the most gain to people which means it can displace some of them the traditional incumbents but they do objectively represent some of the more dangerous aspects of things too because as we've seen today right like if you take society general is now you know putting in uh assets to be collateralized on make or doubt it's huge it's fantastic it's like something that we've all been waiting to see for a while even as like a d5 maximalist love to see d5 being able to be bridged into the real life that said you can imagine in the future where you've got that or something like that built on top of spell and then those things are being lent out on something like sushi's bento box and then bento box is being used with cream and somewhere downstream something breaks and suddenly some pension fund is out 30 million dollars because society general invested in something now this isn't to scare them off from their maker investment that's not possible today this is you know years in the making but i think all of those things are now at the fore where people are saying look we've got to address this but i'm optimistic that the long-term view is going to be a lot of pain and ultimately just like the internet decentralized tech will not be stopped and disruptive technology traditionally shapes or forces society to shape itself around it versus the other way around so to me this was always coming you know in 2018 i moved my stuff from centralized exchanges in 2019 i largely tried to stop using stable coins with really options now we've got decentralized options i think people need to prepare for the next two to three years before people realize hey there's a world where at least in america i think america in particular but generally across the world we've got a unique governmental body that respects privacy rights that respects freedom of expression and this technology really helps to codify that if we do it right we can actually leverage it to continue to spread a lot of our ideals which is probably important in a time where like your position as a hegemon is consistently under assault so i think it's a long-winded way of saying it's going to be painful in the short term but i'm not pessimistic that truly decentralized protocols won't have a lasting position in american and global society long term okay so greg give your response and also let's bring up this geo-fencing issue because this is maybe some of the short-term pain that collins mentioned yeah no and first i i want to echo what colin said about the respect for privacy i know the narrative over the course of the last couple of months uh starting with with the infrastructure bill and uh abe sutherland has had a lot of really great thought leadership he's put out about uh 6500i which is the subsection that treats crypto like cash for uh transaction reporting requirements uh and filing forms 8300 with the irs for every transaction over ten thousand dollars despite the fact that our in the post bank secrecy act environment we do have what feels like a bit of a strangulation of financial privacy which is you know one of the the elements that that defy uh and and crypto in general hopes to uh to ensure for its users but at the same time the us government does still have a great history of of respecting individual privacy or at least aspiring to respect it and even if we look at the way encryption is viewed around the globe the us is still a pretty darn good actor at respecting the right to encryption which is in an information era probably one of the most important rights we can have so i i do want to echo that i think that's a a very great point i think that you know collins has talked about it recently i know it's the the tension that i usually point to most in trying to figure out how defy grows in america is when you have a regulatory system that's focused on intermediaries not not just because that they're the best position to be regulated but because they are regulated because they are in the best position to oversee and to bring order to a market it is very difficult for a regulatory infrastructure that has been built up over the course of in some instances basically a century for it to move and adapt to a technology that uh you know seeks to build systems without intermediaries so we've seen you know regulation adopt adapt rather very quickly or reasonably quickly to the internet but this is another step beyond that but it's also not a perfect step beyond that and it gets to the geoblocking point is that defy doesn't exist in a vacuum it is touched and and entered if you will typically through interfaces that by definition are are centrally managed and i think that in the near term is where we likely see the most tension if you're actually looking for an enforcement precedent that directly touched some element of defy the best one to look at is the the coburn enforcement action uh for for ether delta where it was a decentralized exchange uh in the in the in the element that it had decentralized custody the website never touched the assets themselves at the same time it served as an interface and it provided certain oracle functions and helped facilitate the matching the sec entered into a settlement order with the founder of ether delta the operator of ether delta that basically identified it as an ats without identifying what the actual securities that were being transacted but that's a separate gripe along the lines of the broker-dealer arguments but there the sec perhaps appropriately looked at okay there is a centralized portion of this that is controlled that is administered and even if the custodial portion is a decentralized thing that we either shouldn't be regulating or that we don't really understand how best to regulate now they can look at the interface and say okay we we know pretty well how to regulate this and so when we look at how defy operates now there's again varying gradations of how decentralized it actually is on the protocol level uh whether or not there's still administration whether or not there's effective control how we consider governance tokens how we consider multi-sigs but there still are typically user interfaces they aren't the only way to access these protocols but for the normal retail user you're going to go to a website that's controlled by a central party that serves as a gate into this protocol and the question really to me is when we're looking at is their authority to regulate these interfaces are they verizon or are they ether delta is it an infrastructure that isn't providing a unique and important function that is one where you identify it not just as a party that's capable of being regulated but a party that should be regulated is it serving certain surveillance functions that you can't just get out of the transparent nature of a blockchain environment so i think the interfaces are where we're going to see a you know i don't want to say battlefront because i hope it would be more collaborative than antagonistic but i think that's where we're going to see most of the movement i'm going to say something controversial i'm so glad you raised that generally and this always surprises people when i say it i actually think most of those types of plays probably should be like in the long run where i would expect this to go is you've got bonafide decentralized protocols your unit swaps your whatever any anyone can plug on top of it just like anyone can plug on top of https or something else the second you start building a business on top of that is when people are probably going to say all right well maybe we are going to regulate you and so the options are you either just become a business or you say okay look we don't think we need to be a business to offer that same functionality instead we think like you said there's maybe a variety of folks that can provide an interface any of which is interchangeable and the sole purpose of which is just to provide access to this underlying protocol in that world i think it's a better policy argument or a better policy discussion to be saying all right maybe these six people these all six of these people can't be in exchange for the same protocol that this seems a bit strange on the flip side yes if you're the only way that somebody can access a protocol maybe you control back-end storage such that if you disappear people can't withdraw their funds or you have admin keys or keys that can you know take people's capital you start to reintroduce the exact same reasons why we do have securities laws you're becoming an intermediary so for me whenever i've talked to clients or something about that and they've tried to ask them like hey you know what should i be thinking about we're designing this you know i'm always earning on the side of hey can you relinquish that control because if you don't the more of this that you have the more that you start to reintroduce the exact same reasons why we have the securities laws and that's what they mean when they say substance over form so and again i feel like i'm on the on this podcast on twitter i'm like ah gary and here i'm like yeah sec but that's not really it to me i think what one of our colleagues has said is probably the most important thing for i think true d5 maxis to really appreciate which is the sec is probably the best motivator of making something truly decentralized like if you want the best securities law argument you legitimately have to be willing to say look like i don't get to own this entire stack i don't get to own this entire experience and unfortunately a lot of devs particularly silicon valley train devs but other devs they don't like that they don't want to relinquish control they want to be able to control the front-end experience they want to be able to consistently you know capture value from other revenue streams but that's that's a business like that's what running a business is so i think in general and we're starting to see this so i think people are getting it we're gonna start to see people separate their protocol development teams versus some other type of commercial enterprise that's the appropriate move in my mind and i think the way that the sec should kind of recognize that and maybe give a quid pro quo is say okay look that's fine and if the core issue that you all have had before that is yes but we think that maybe the people on the protocol side should be able to be incentivized with some of the assets that they've built without necessarily becoming some securities intermediary but also the commercial entity that's driving value should be able to appreciate that then there's a safe harbor path there in my mind that says okay look to the extent that this protocol team is not doing x y and z and certain things are disclosed we're not going to treat that as security and we're not going to treat them as intermediaries if you are going to do other things commercial entity you may still have obligations but i think that's one path to to at least allow for this bifurcation of roles but still allow for incentive alignment around the underlying protocol because the end of the day that's most people's issues with like being able to separate the business and the protocol is them saying well how do we incentivize ongoing devs who don't necessarily want to be building a business but may just be really interested in zero knowledge proofs or something like that and i don't think we want to drive that innovation away so we've got um you know a path forward here the other thing great that you mentioned which is super interesting and something hopefully i think laura's product is probably one of the better places to mention this is there is optimism that they do have a path forward to integrating technical data into disclosures versus traditional data and i think the best example of that is there's a system laura called the xbrl system it's like extensible i forget whatever the last three things are it's not like hey it's not like hey they've greg's laughing because it's not like they made a super computer but for like a decade the sec basically worked on a standard because you know for like 50 60 years we had all of these filings that were done on paper and obviously computers got big and people analysts in particular were like hey these disclosures are becoming less helpful like you're sending us 150 pages no one's going to read through all of this we have computers now where a lot of this financial information and other disclosures can be standardized and made machine readable why don't you just make a standard and all the companies or anybody else should have to adhere to that and then that way we no longer have to even look in this different places we don't have to have people come up with their own disclosures that's what i would expect for crypto instead of saying hey all of these things are securities we might say to hester percy's point okay look you don't want it to be a security here are the minimum things that we're going to require and here are the things that are going to need to be surfaceable in the smart contract with the standard api call if you're not going to do that then you don't get the benefit of the safe harbor you can still argue it's not a security but if you want the safe harbor your api needs to surface some key things is there an admin key total supply you know inflation whatever that is that's we have experience there so i don't want us to continue to give the commission excuses like oh we have no idea what we're doing they've got examples and i like the commission for the good work that they do but i do think we've got to start holding the fire under their feet to say hold on there are some paths here that also means it's incumbent on us as an industry to come forward with some suggestions like this or some other things but that's the other thing i did want to raise here so i used to live a lot on edgar because i would do a lot of registered product filings um my dear paralegal debbie ferraro actually was one of the testers on edgar when they first introduced it and uh you know i think we we would all have our frustrations with edgar from time to time and when xbrl was introduced uh you know within the last decade probably about seven eight years ago with the modernization uh movement for for reporting filings um it was very clunky and hard to access and really the people who were taking advantage of it were quant funds uh that that were pulling the data because it was it's little literally excel coding of disclosure documents but collins is 100 right because the sec maybe didn't have a product that was particularly useful when it was introduced but they had the foresight to understand that data repositories are incredibly important and in the future they are going to be how we pull information and they times are going to be how we regulate markets because it's easier to see the flat surface of the market and analyze it and and and pull it from the data and the beauty of blockchain is it's particularly when you're looking at cryptocurrencies where everything exists on chain not not calling off chain resources it is a complete set of information and collins is spot on uh there are tools that can be applied to this industry to provide the type of surveillance and market integrity that we typically in the u.s regulatory infrastructure look at those central intermediaries whereas in blockchain you know you do have a transaction record either on layer one or in some instances on a transparent layer two where you have the ability to see the market and to be frank while we haven't seen this emerge quite as much in the sec fincen has been all over this and the success of companies like elliptic and chain analysis is 100 driven by the same concept that you can regulate through data you can you can investigate through data you don't need dragnet the old chicago sitcom or i guess drama wasn't a sitcom funny now but uh you don't necessarily need that you have new tools and these new tools are not just market opportunities they're also regulatory opportunities yeah well so i have to say i'm a little bit surprised that this is actually the direction you guys went when i asked you about regulation of d5 because the way that i'm viewing this is that the regulators want to keep imposing that system where intermediaries are you know a big part and have a big role and that that's who the regulators then regulate and i actually feel like watching this that they are kind of painting a broad brush and often lumping together projects that truly either want to decentralize or actually already are decentralized along with ones that either are centralized or just plain fraudulent and i also feel even you know earlier when you guys were talking about how the us tends to respect privacy you know a lot of like for instance we saw what the infrastructure bill the crypto provision really was going to create a lot of honey pots for um hackers who were interested in you know who is transacting in cryptocurrency so in that regard like you know i didn't feel that that i mean granted i i recognize that a lot of congress people do see the need to change the language in that bill but still the fact that it came out that way and that there was a strong push to regulate in that fashion does indicate that there's you know a substantial segment of government that maybe doesn't really see um the merits of decentralization or just doesn't believe that something can truly be decentralized and so even you know i keep i you guys keep referencing commissioner purse's um safe harbor proposal and you know i think for somebody who looks at the space and says okay there are projects that are legitimately trying to be decentralized or are already decentralized and of course something like what she proposed makes sense but you know we haven't really seen the sec take that up seriously right i mean the fact that she's revised it is great for her and and for everybody who thinks about the space but when you look at chair gensler and kind of some of the other commissioners or even over the cftc we don't necessarily see a lot of people saying oh yes this is the way to go let's figure out how to adopt this you know let's get this in the pipeline so um i'm just curious you know am i just reading things wrong or do you feel like maybe because you want it to look that way that you're maybe painting a rosier picture or or is it just that i'm looking to you short term or or what no no i think i think you're right um and that's part of what i was saying you know i think the next two to three years it's going to be a it's a combination of a struggle and convincing folks but also some pushback um because yeah you're right there's a broad brush brush here being painted and for a while i think a lot of the industry engaged in probably a bit more good faith than was appropriate um not not i mean you should never engage in bad faith but i think i guess we assumed too much benevolence and interest on behalf of the government and it's not that i don't think they're not interested so much as at first it's like hey this crypto thing yeah these people want to make a bunch of money then it became a serious thing and they still treated it that way and then instead of ever engaging it went from hey this isn't serious to you're going to destroy the financial system and your criminals and so it's like well hold on how did it go from this is a joke to her criminals but yeah you're right right now i think there's definitely more of a contingent i'd say i don't know this is not a scientific number you know 70 30 75 25 saying oh yes you know this is just inherently problematic we need to reintroduce intermediaries that's the way we protect people et cetera but like i said you know even six months ago we didn't have as many of the folks in congress actively talking about it as we did we basically had i think it was i hate referring to all these people by first name like i know them but i think it was like cynthia alumni uh uh cynthia and a few of the other uh senators which i only know by first name i have no idea why um and so as we start to see that roll out one of the interesting things i've talked about and it's obviously not a politics show but i've talked a lot about with my friends is i am very interested to see if there's a political realignment that occurs here because i've long suspected that certain crypto people are definitely single issue voters and we're starting to see that uh you know come out in some of the political expressions but ct is also you know much of a an echo chamber so i think it'll be interesting to see in this next you know midterm elections how much pandering there is to this group and also how much that translates into political activity but i think if it does translate into something you'll you'll see a sea change almost overnight as we saw with some of the infrastructure bills but now you're not crazy at all one last thing i wanted to add on this is that i feel like another trend that i'm seeing is that a lot of the pro crypto regulators are just leaving government and going to join different crypto companies and yeah i mean like it's almost like just looking at the a16z crypto regulatory team is like all these ex regulators and you know other people who uh have spent a lot of time in dc and then the people that are kind of negative on crypto they're the ones who are staying in the regulator roles so that's another trend that for me is kind of fascinating to watch and i'm a little bit like oh where is this going to go you know because all the people who've left and now work in the industry are saying hey we need new regulations and the old regulations don't apply here and stuff like that and then the people who are still in uc are like the you know the 33 and 34 acts do apply here and you know the highway test and reeves do apply here so anyway uh just it was just an interesting observation so um one last one last point on that is uh i think you know there's an importance to the the crypto communities and i don't think there's a singular community obviously but the crypto communities to come together whether it's collectively or or in their own little segments and understand that narrative matters it's not just building a better product and it's not just donating money and it's not just being active on twitter a meme game is important but that that's not good what's going to drive thing things it's about creating the narrative on the policy level that makes people remember that it's not simply politically expedient to crack down but that there's a long-term vision for the benefit that this industry can provide the us and the the world community at large and that's a difficult task it's tough to build up a narrative uh it's not something that isn't happening though uh we've seen people shift when they see the opportunity and i go back to and some would probably laugh at me at saying this but 2013 or 2014 uh i recall when ben lawski at dfs first addressed crypto in probably the late summer of 2013 he wanted to crush it because all he had done was read you know stories about silk road and three weeks later uh you know he after actually investigating it uh you know you can have your opinion on on on the bit license and how that turned out but i do think he genuinely said i want to build a framework to actually build responsible innovation in new york for for crypto it didn't turn out that way as a native new yorker i still can't access a lot of services because they can't get into the state but it is reflective of the fact that with the appropriate view he viewed as an economic builder for new york and wanting to to build the right way we should be working on the narrative that story is also a nice reminder that the narrative is not the only thing we also need the proper regulation or legislation yeah well one thing that that actually reminds me of is that a lot of people say that that bit license was kind of too early right that the technology and the industry hadn't really developed enough to truly understand what even should be regulated or how the space was going to look and you know what's been interesting covering this the last few years is that the industry has complained a lot about not having clarity and yet at the same time i think in a way that that has given the industry a little bit of freedom i understand it's a scary kind of freedom but if you think about how ethereum basically had an ico but then decentralized by the time the regulators were paying attention and so at that point they you know kind of realized okay yeah this is not a security anymore i wonder you know so i don't know how long it's going to take for more clarity to come clearly i think we all agree on this episode that the regulators are working on something and we probably are going to see more actions coming out of these regulators but during that time it's like you said maybe this just gives motivation to more projects to decentralize and do it quickly because if that's the case then i think a lot of them could kind of end up like ethereum in the sense that you know as long as they decentralize by the time regulators really come in then um then it may be the case that regulators won't be able to do much but i don't know what are your thoughts on that yeah i i think that timing is obviously extraordinarily important i think you're right that i would argue perhaps timing on the bit license in particular was perhaps not a question of 2014 versus 2018 versus 2021 but more so that the timing and the application of that type of a regulatory regime to companies that were six months old versus companies that were well financed you know well-established well-capitalized financial institutions um you know if you had for example a large regulatory framework in place for people developing silicon processors we wouldn't have hewlett packard because you can't easily develop a financial institution you know in a garage but frankly that's that's kind of how uh how crypto companies got their start it was a couple of people and a little bit of seed funding all right so for this next year what are you going to be looking for and um why don't we just throw into this last question what you think is going to happen to stable coins too stable coins are a good place to start i think uh there was an article today uh again when we're recording from the journal talking about how fsock and the biden administration uh are are looking to create a regulatory framework for stable coins i think quite clearly this is an area where there's going to be a lot of focus in the next year and it's uh you know collins mentioned earlier in the show there obviously are a bunch of different types of stable coins but if we look at in particular the the fiat backed or uh in some cases not quite fiat backed stable coins um you know that's going to be an area of significant focus and potentially near-term regulation probably not legislation but but probably regulation and i think we'll see some clarity i think we've already seen people uh address the the investment company act issues in the space where um you know usdc is now going to only hold uh fiat and treasuries and that's that's paxos's strategy i would guess that's probably gemini's strategy and it's most most decisively not tethers strategy i think we could see some action on that side and that's when we're hearing people talk about money market funds that's what we see i think we could if we get significant regulation on the securities law side rather than on the bank reg side for for stable coins i think one project that will be interesting for people to look at is uh rcoin uh ar coin which was uh done by the the folks at california at arca arc labs where they actually registered a money market fund that holds its shares entirely on the ethereum blockchain and you actually can transfer these money market shares peer-to-peer uh through to white-listed ethereum network addresses this is probably the the biggest product that no one actually talks about because it doesn't have market traction but it's real thought leadership as far as developing something and getting the sec on board with an actual tokenized product registered product that really does live on a blockchain and you could see uh some circumstance where that becomes the not quite where stable coins go but if we do see a lot of attack on on the securities law front on these centralized stable coin issuers um you know i think our coin is something that might get talked about a little bit more yeah that's actually interesting i uh i didn't know they had registered the money market shares on chain um yeah for me i think you know the next year i'm looking at a confluence of i think a segregation between kind of these truly decentralized protocols whether that's you know because they are protocols and made by folks that are known or anonymous or pseudonymous developers kind of building primitives and or potentially taking over previously centralized ones to me that's actually the you know the worst result from the regulator's perspective because then it may just push things into the shadows but that's definitely something and a trend that i'm expecting to see um particularly because daos are starting to you know get back into popularity which personally i find very interesting because it's like everyone tends to forget that the sec like started their entire crusade with the dow report so like i personally look like in terms of like the idea behind dows i love like i think people should be doing i've been doing research on co-op models and the like but i think it is very weird that everyone is acting as they're like the sec is not about to show up next year with all of these dows because to be honest that's the thing that seems the most obvious to me like even more so than stable coins and stuff only because for years basically that was like their demarcation line was like okay we gave you the dow report and everything after this like we're you're not necessarily blessed or grandfathered in but we're not gonna focus on you as much and then it's like three or four years later everyone was like okay it's been a while why don't we just start doing dallas again so i think that's probably the area where we'll probably see a lot more activity what's interesting is i think what will also bring them into the four is i'm expecting one of the first if not more than one major political doubts to become relevant so i think that's going to end up kind of like kind of smashing into each other and it's gonna be one of the major securities law issues to to see next year and then in terms of stable coins yeah i mean i think there's gonna be a lot of focus here for me personally i've had kind of a laser focused on things like you know lusd ryan ust for the past you know almost a year and a half since esd kind of uh empty set dollar one of the first algorithmic stable coin experiments kind of kicked off the imagination of the industry to see if it could be done and i think long term that's kind of important um i i i maybe undermine my prior rant in terms of like american hegemony and the like but being frank if you're trying to use a global permissionless network at least if i'm not american i don't want to have to rely on something that's subject to like another country's random you know domestic and foreign policy wouldn't leave me feeling great it's like as an american it's great if like everyone's you know denominated in usdc but long term if you're saying hey we're building this network that's almost a layer on top of the real world that everyone should have access to you probably want a credibly neutral stable currency that you know not only should not be the u.s dollar you also probably shouldn't be backed by it or peg to it maybe isn't necessarily as problematic but if you're backed by it or you're targeting it you're always necessarily susceptible to it so well i think what's interesting right now is the us is actually focused more on curtailing it at some point i wouldn't be surprised if we actually flip on that and instead we try to make it such that only us dollar denominated stable coin things get priority i just you know and this is bless me as like the crypto anarchist lawyer but more like if i'm going to be a real politic like citizen of the world and we still live in the nation-state system then yeah if my government's going to like be in this great power war i want them to kind of do it right and so for me i would expect at some point somebody says hey guys this is spreading our foreign policy with very little expenditure on our part and very little liability if it goes wrong why don't we kind of let's see what happens not don't just unleash the us dollar on the rest of the world as a weapon but admittedly we've kind of done that before so it's one of those things where it's like i don't approve of it from the humanitarian view but if you're going to do it i would expect at some point somebody's going to be a realist and say hold on if we're going to allow this why don't we allow it in the way that best benefits us so i think stable coins are going to be interesting i i there's going to be a crackdown but i wouldn't like i said i wouldn't be surprised if it gets interesting yeah and collins on that point i mean i think it's also not if we're going to allow it if we accept that this is going to happen in some form why would you not want to have the dollarization of of crypto if you're a policymaker and this goes to the narratives it's it's it's built in and uh as it turns out you know depending on votes in the next couple of weeks we're going to need some people buying some u.s treasuries so yeah it's utterly bizarre it's utterly and like i said i get it if you're like one of the people that don't have the economic perspective that dollar hegemony is good but as a general matter our policy makers do have that perspective so for me it's it's a bizarre situation to say okay our standard you know way of operation is yes we want the dollar to generally dominate in every market it possibly can here's an emerging financial market that may grow to dominate all financial markets let's do our damnedest to stop the dollar from predominating when it has no competition it i i've never i i understand what's happening it's really just like the policy makers aren't you know engaged with the regulators right now because it's not a priority but i it would be a shame if we do lose out and the nation-state system persists and it's just another nation that has the hegemony because then it's like well great we didn't undermine the hegemonic system we just gave it away to someone else yeah particularly because the the bank run concept i mean if you're talking about stable coins that have reserves that are held in regulated financial institutions whether in deposit or custody accounts uh and you're looking at treasuries as the rest of the portfolio you know if we're worried about the systemic risk of a run on usdc we we have a lot bigger problems with the existing existing rails yeah the other thing i just laura just wanted to correcting myself earlier um our coin is is actually an interval fund not a money market fund but its valuation holdings is very similar to a money market fund so just wanted to correct that okay thanks yeah um going back to collins's point about the dollar um so a couple of things i don't know if you guys saw but sam bankman freed of ftx did write a long twitter thread about this and was saying that the fact that the us dollar um is how like pretty much the vast majority of trading peers around the world um are traded in crypto that is to the us's benefit and um chris john carla the former cftc chair um has said that he thinks um instead of doing a cbdc we should just have multiple competing us dollar stable coins and it just kind of let it be sort of a free market um but the last thing about this i don't know if you guys have been following rohan gray i i know he's a controversial figure in crypto um i i so i don't remember his exact title but it's something like assistant professor of law at i think it's lament willamette yeah okay yeah and um he said you know the the risk is that the us government then kind of loses control over its money basically so you know just just wanted to offer that other perspective um but you guys we are over time we have and it's funny because we only really touched on like a few major topics but there's just so much to discuss here so it was super fun i am so glad we pulled this together and it's amazing how much there was to discuss given that there wasn't any big regulatory news this week but we all know what's coming so thank you so much for discussing all of this with me um where can people learn more about each of you and your work uh i'm on twitter um that's probably the the best avenue for me which i never thought i'd be saying in my life and what's your hand just my name collins underscore belton very creative that's the well-known lawyer creative class yeah and for me i've got one of those lucky names where i actually typically am able to get the social media uh user account that just is my last name and you've got to figure out how to spell it yourself notes x-e-t-h-a-l-i-s on twitter and uh multicoin.capital is is our website okay perfect all right well this was so much fun thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you again laura appreciate it thanks thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about collins and greg check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin without from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark murdock thanks for listening [Music] you
