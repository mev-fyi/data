thanks for having me on you wrote a really interesting piece on medium recently and I wanted to discuss it you talked about how crypto currency threatens this state so what are the ways in which it does that well it may not be threatening the state right now but the the point I was trying to make in the article was that that is sort of the whole idea you know that that the crypto currency is manifestly political by its very nature and we shouldn't you know try and ignore that reality instead we should essentially embrace it and prepare for the the battles to come basically and so the article was it was a call to arms so to speak and I mean ultimately I think the way the main way the crypto currency will likely affect states is by making it much harder to impose capital controls as a tool of monetary policy and and we are already have some examples of that there's sort of some early anecdotal evidence maybe that the popularity of tether has to do with Chinese folks trying to escape the capital controls we know that there are Bitcoin markets down in Venezuela Argentina Turkey all these places air inflation is pretty high so you know it's still relatively immature and a lot of tools are required to make it easier to onboard people especially in in these more frontier markets into cryptocurrency but I think it's already beginning to affect the state and certainly central banks have started to wonder a little bit about whether cryptocurrency is going to destabilize kind of the current monetary regime and when you say that cryptocurrency is political and it's like inherently in its nature why do you say that so I mean that in two ways so the first is that just to take Bitcoin for instance Bitcoin is impregnated with kind of political ideas and many people would contend that that's a bad thing you know because maybe that makes it more exclusionary or it requires that you have certain beliefs before using it but I don't really mean in that way I just mean to say that there are certain values that very much underscore Bitcoin and kind of motivated its creation and Satoshi kind of hinted at those in a few places so those would be values like you know creating new units of money should be kind of costly and you know nobody should have an unfair advantage in doing that so there shouldn't be any senior age and you know the supply of money should be really predictable and there should be no kind of monetary discretion in the system I think both of those are sort of political concepts you know and they point to a really definite alternative to the the current system that predominates and on the other way I would say cryptocurrencies political is that these are institutions and as long as there are decisions being made there are decision makers and there is power and the you know the hated G word there's governance as well and so that is a reality that I think many people many of the people that lead and design cryptocurrencies and public blockchains would prefer to ignore and you know they like to claim that these systems are fully decentralized and that there are no no one really has any privileged status within them but you know it basically in the article I'm saying that's not the case there is always power there's all those decision makers and oftentimes the debates are really political and I mean we should probably seek to minimize that but we should definitely acknowledge it as a reality you also see in your piece that Bitcoin has already affected central bank policy how so which central bank's that might have been maybe a slightly utopian or ambitious thing to say but yeah one thing I say is that the currency competition is a lot like outrunning a bear you know you only have to outrun your slowest friend so the dollar is is probably the the soundest sovereign currency and so I would say it's the least threatened by the existence of cryptocurrency but so the ones that are the most affected by cryptocurrency even in its very incipient state are you know it kind of logically follows that there at the ones which are the most inflationary that the citizens want to hold the least and now that we have this online exit ramp from sovereign currencies which is relatively frictionless you know people have a choice of where to to save their assets and so we absolutely have there is some data showing that Venezuelans had fairly vibrant you know peer-to-peer Bitcoin tube all of our markets for sure they might actually have referred dollars in that case but there's definitely been some usage of Bitcoin down there yeah I know so I would say yeah I mean I I spoke with local bitcoins actually I think this was on unconfirmed and they said the behavior they were seeing was that people were yeah converting they're bolivars to USD but using Bitcoin to do so and then again using Bitcoin as a way to convert it back when they needed the Bulevar so right yeah so with Bitcoin being actually the dollarization rails which is pretty fascinating mm-hmm I was reading through some monetary history to find out how other dollarization events had mechanically occurred and I found out that the zimbabwe dollar ization was a little bit impaired because there was a shortage of actual physical dollars because it was really difficult to get you know hard currency into the country because they had limited access to you know those markets you know maybe the situation would be different today if they could have used Bitcoin and then go to a stable coin or something right right or or just convert it into a stable coin directly yeah yeah so that's one of the ways that that yeah the cryptocurrency even if it's not being directly used as the ultimate savings device it could still be a Rails to harder currencies so you know as you mention you're sort of segmenting your answer into the slow friends who can't run around the bear I'll run the bear which like would be me I in real life but anyway I'm then do you think that Bitcoin could be or could affect a central bank policy and developed stable economies in any way it certainly depends on the path that this industry takes while Bitcoin is and just cryptic currency the asset class is still relatively small I think if that worked would really be minimal but the point I do make in the article is that even in wealthier countries that have capital controls the existence of you know relatively frictionless ways to avoid that definitely kind of impairs the the states monetary privilege a little bit so it depends I think Johnny says is characterized it as a developed country there's certainly a reason for their hostility to Bitcoin you know I think I think what's the limit is it $50,000 worth of outflows a year is the maximum I think so yeah I would love to see more data on usage of cryptocurrency on OTC markets and China but I guess those brokers have a very small incentive to actually be public about it yeah honestly with so many of my sources who go there say is that there's a very very very active OTC market and it's sort of like the authorities kind of look the other way that's sort of what people are saying but anyway I'm all right so we're gonna discuss some of the other non Bitcoin coins in a moment as well as kind of wider global events but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher

crypto clean back to my conversation with Nick Carter so in your piece you'll also take what I'm just gonna broadly call altcoins two tasks so are there any coins besides Bitcoin that you view as legitimate or promising well I think that's the question is you know what constitutes legitimacy so I you know I think at this point you can't deny that you know a theorem has a really vibrant community and kind of organic groundswell of usage in development beyond that I would say it's very sparse and that's my you know highly subjective opinion but I mean if you look at the data very few chains aside from Bitcoin aetherium have any real usage whatsoever but the the problem I identified in the article is that there has been insufficient tension given to the legitimacy conferring factors for you know the long tail of all coins and so the emphasis has always been on technical innovation and you know some of which were really marginal technical innovations and really insufficient attention to the things that I believe matter which is like you know how do you ensure that the developers can't abuse their privilege within the system are there checks and balances you know is the monetary policy credible for instance and oftentimes what we actually see in these systems is those credibility and dowing factors are traded off to achieve you know glamour metrics or technical thresholds so for instance not to pick on a particular coin but in EOS you know the the transactions per second was was prided at all costs and the way that that was achieved was by having a much smaller validator set and then it emerged that the validators were maybe colluding or you know engaging in in mutual voting in kind of a collusive way and you know i think that is that that poses a much greater you know long-term threat to the to the legitimacy of the network which is not outweigh by the the marginal and a technical enhancement there so this piece was partly me kind of trying to you know convince people that maybe their priorities needed to be recalibrated one other thing I wanted to ask about was in your piece you had this sentence the only cryptocurrencies worth creating are those that aim to be money and yet just now with your remarks with me you did say that aetherium you know obviously had some traction and was quote-unquote legitimate I guess that was my phrasing but I was just wondering so do you still feel that that's the case because I don't think aetherium is aiming to be money at all so well I I would say etherium probably should content and aim to be money and I think we noticed a little bit of a recalibration where initially it was you know computational gas like the lubricant in the system and then more recently you know certain high-profile parents have have been saying well actually a theorem itself is money you know it's like a high-powered collateral for you know for instance defy applications and so on so my view you know I as someone who's very much outside of the etherium community so maybe this is very much unsolicited advice would be yeah absolutely you know optimize for a thermos money because the value giving thing here is whether people choose to hold the coin for a long period of time you know have a long holding preference and if it's just being used as as working capital the folks using the coin would try and minimize their exposure to it only hold it for the duration of the period that they needed it for so I I guess I have a contrarian beyond that yeah I actually think part of the new are part of the new emphasis on aetherium or ether as money has to do with this transition to proof of stake because I did see people saying there that you know if the chain is gonna be secure then they do need a focus on the value of ether so um yeah right I definitely agree yeah and one other cryptocurrency let's not call it cryptocurrency well same digital currency because I know some people will take me to task if I call it a cryptocurrency that is in the news a lot and probably will affect the development of the whole space has to do with Libra so what is your take on kind of what is going to happen with that and how that will affect the development of the space well I think if Libra launches it'll be a really critical development maybe second only in importance behind the creation of Bitcoin in terms of the history of the industry it's a big if though I I don't have confidence that it will launch and why is that well it's just the you know the team behind it was so they seem to be very brash in terms of announcing their intentions to create a new monetary standard you know a new unit of account and I think the likely effect if they went live in a lot of these developing countries with weaker local currencies would be an outflow from those currencies to the harder currency which would be Libra at that point you know if it was chiefly backed by dollars in theory would be much more stable and it would you know depreciate much more slowly than the local currencies and this was this to me strikes me as extremely ambitious and idealistic so and also somewhat hostile to a lot of these developing Central Bank's if you have you know hundreds of millions of their citizens given the option to store their savings in Libra I think they they would jump at the chance which would make you know make it more difficult to manage the local sovereign currency we I was sorry you but you seem to say that the better route would have been for them to create a digital dollar because wouldn't that have had the same effect well I think it would have been maybe better received in the US you know because they at that point the impression would not have been that they trying to replace the dollar as a monetary standard and maybe that's well I mean you know the history has not been written yet we'll see what happens but I think it would been easier to sell Libra as advancing US interests if they said yeah like this thing is going to be you know a pegged dollar and we're going to dollar eyes all these countries directly I mean I think in effect that's what would happen anyway under their current configuration it's just that you know that they're doing it under the guise of creating a completely new unit of account whereas the dollar is right now the default unit of account yeah I wonder if part of it is because they view themselves I mean they are really a global company and they didn't probably want to appear to be too us-centric well anyway so okay so let's just assume that Libra does go through so then what do you think the effect will be on the coin in the crypto space well I don't know about Bitcoin I mean I I've said that I think they're gonna keep opening the Overton Window of acceptability you know Bitcoin is a non corporate non state money Libre would be a corporate non state money I think the the most meaningful effect is that people begin to realize that money has been unbundled from the state and it's not necessarily part of those services that the state is expected to provide for its citizens which i think is good for all cryptic currency generally ain't as much as that we're just going through this process of becoming attenuated to you know non sovereign money systems so I think that would be the most significant effect I I don't know if they'll be successful I think ultimately they kind of political tack surface is really really big and if I were a developing central banker and a developing nation I would try and shut them down right away yeah well as we saw France already is seeing that and they're not even a developing nation so that's kind of interesting yeah it's I think it's all about positioning you know I guess Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currencies have totally flown under the radar somehow despite people like me saying that they're hostile to the state I guess maybe I a few people reached out to me and said I shouldn't have written this article because I was making our game plan known to politicians okay well in case people didn't get the memo these ideas have been out there for quite a long time so it's not like what you were saying was brand new yeah what you were saying but no I agree yeah it's funny that they did that yeah also because you know it's not like the coin has anybody at the helm being like we're gonna take down the state but it is true that of course yeah there are ways in which this could play out where it could be threatening someday and I mean to be to be clear I'm not advocating for anarchy I just think that it's it's likely that the set of things we come to expect from the state ultimately ends up not including manage a monetary system and I think we've plenty of evidence that they're not as good at that as they think they are with the last decade being really compelling evidence of that yeah well we will see how things play out all right Nick well
