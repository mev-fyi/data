merge i this was a truly exciting event a huge deal in the world of crypto tell us about your experience of the merge what were you feeling beforehand and what did you feel once the transition happened i was a little nervous to be fair beforehand um maybe the day before you know i started feeling hey this is real uh for a long time it was just theoretical and it's been so long that i've been you know used to to thinking that it it's in the future but no it was actually coming in terms of how i feel how i felt in the moment i was i was extremely tired and the reason is that um we almost pulled a whole all-nighter um with the ultrasound.money team we were pushing as hard as we could to get this this feature where you could basically track the supply after the merge and see how much it had decreased or increased relative to the point of the merge and actually uh my partner who's here right next to me uh alex tesla michael you know just pulled a whole all-nighter and so he's kind of the the hero that that we deserve and i am just so so impressed by uh how the merge went just so impressed by all the devs you know as a researcher i'm powerless right because the my job in a way was to help write the specs and that was done you know two years ago um and so now it really all laid in the hands of the client developers and the node operators and both have done a really steady job the merge has gone way better than i expected uh participation rate is over 98 which is really really good we haven't had any disruptions that i really know of um nothing major well yeah it's really quite an achievement and it definitely i mean for someone who's not technical just even you know from what i read it seemed like everything was extremely uh smooth so you know congratulations to you all and i was korea so now that uh ethereum is in this proof of stake world is this sort of like done or are there issues that you and other core devs are kind of watching out for to just make sure everything really went smoothly yeah so we'll be keeping an eye on participation rate we'll also be keeping an eye on possible unexpected forks um so it could be that one of the consensus clients or maybe one of the execution clients kind of starts misbehaving and so we would see some fraction of the validators going off on a separate fork and actually that could if it happens to one of the execution clients one of the minor execution clients that could give us insight into the distribution because it's relatively easy to tell the distribution of consensus clients and actually there's a website clientdiversity.org which gives us that distribution but for the execution clients that's much more hidden but ironically when there are failures it allows us to glean into this distribution of execution clients and so for how long will you be watching that before you guys feel confident that this really went off without a hitch the way that the the lindy effect works in my opinion is kind of logarithmic so the fact that the merge was successful for one second is already a huge breakthrough the fact that it was successful one minute is a huge breakthrough ten minutes a whole day a whole week a whole month or whole year and i think if it can survive the next few days the next few weeks next few months this is a high high high confidence that you know this is this is reliable i must also highlight that the proof of stake chain has been running for a very long period of time it's been running for you know over a year and a half now it's the most secure blockchain in the world now it has 20 billion dollars of economic security and also unlike proof of work chains it has the ability to recover from 51 attacks thanks to slashing the ability to identify and remove attackers if and when there is an attack yeah and just to draw that out it's because in contrast in a proof-of-work system they would still have their equipment so you know it's kind of like harder to keep them off the network is that the implication there that's correct when you are under attack and proof of work you cannot distinguish the good guys from the bad guys all the hash rate is fungible and so you can't just you know target you know the the the data centers of an attacker and kind of remotely burn them down but this is effectively what we're able to do with proof-of-stake because every unit of stick is identified and can be removed from the system either automatically for example in the context of two inconsistent finalized points there's an automatic process whereby anyone who voted on both sides of of these finalized chains will get automatically slashed and there's also a process if required called social slashing whereby as a community we kind of observe for example that there's been censorship on the chain and we can react with a soft fork or a hard fork that removes the attacker from the chain so i'm glad that you brought up this comparison of proof of work because i'm sure you're very well aware that bitcoiners have long said that proof-of-stake can lead to more centralization and as you probably know even ethereum core developer danny ryan pointed out that one of those possible vectors would be the liquid staking derivatives market people are saying that's a market that will tend to be more like winner take all um and obviously people will have a huge incentive to try to get liquidity out of their staked ether and i did notice that already martin koppelman who you know he's obviously an ethereum person he's been involved in the community for years he tweeted that of the first 1000 blocks 420 were validated by either lydo or coinbase so are you concerned about the potential central centralization that liquid-sticking derivatives providers might cause in ethereum so zooming out on the comparison of centralization between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake there are like really big strong points for proof-of-stake specifically one of them is that the barrier to entry to becoming a staker is actually very very low you know it's on the order of one e let's say or even less than one eve on the other hand if you want to be a profitable miner you need to make a multi-million dollar investment and this is because there are economies of scale when you work with proof-of-work and this is actually a second source of centralization because it means that the largest miners get the largest deals on the hardware for example or on the electricity and they are able to gobble up all the other miners and actually this is something we're seeing right now the proof of work miners are in the context of bitcoin now under stress there's mergers and acquisitions happening and the big fish are eating up the the small fish now on the topic of liquid staking it is true that people do want liquidity on on on their stick and so far we've had exchanges that can provide this as a centralized service and we've had uh more decentralized pools so we've had lido as you highlight we've had rocket pool now the the good news about lido and rocket pool is that they're you know very decentralized if you look at lido it's composed of i don't i forget exactly but i think 28 operators um so the stake is actually not controlled by one operator it's distributed the lido itself is is a dao right with a which is uh governed by by by a token and in the in the long run it will be you know especially difficult to attack lido one of the reasons is that the the risk which for example a smart contract risk what if there's a bug in the smart contract will go away over time as the lindy of lido increases and also the the the lido project is setting up this idea of the the staked eve token holders to put forward vetoes to any consensus decisions that are made by the ldo token holders so even if the ldo token is subject to a 51 attack they can't push through bad governance changes because those will get vetoed now we still do want a huge amount of competition right we don't want to be in a position where there's one or handful of these decentralized taking pools and this is something that i've done a little bit of research in and it turns out that it is possible to simultaneously be a solo validator from home and to benefit from liquid staking basically the ability of turning your stake teeth into a liquid token and being able to sell them at any point that you want this is infrastructure that is still at the research level but i expect that over time we're going to have more and more options and more and more decentralized options to have liquidity over your stake all right there's just so many issues there um there's so much we could impact probably it would take another show but there's also many other things that we can discuss about this transition so we're going to cover all those later but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible to swap crypto a user has

a lot is mev or maximal extractable value and i saw that um someone who uh i think takes a certain um kind of more anti-maybe view pimaguin tweeted that post-merge sandwich attacks had actually drastically dropped i'm not sure how long that will last but i was curious um how you thought the merge would affect mav right so right now well pre-merge most of the mev went through flashbots and there was these these private auctions happening and that allowed for you know toxic med like front running and sandwiching to happen post merge i think right now it's a minority of people that are using the flashbacks infrastructure or proposer builder separation and so what's happening is that they're not extracting as much value as they could and in particular they're not extracting some of that toxic mev what i expect to happen is that ultimately the incentives to participate in proposal builder separation will kind of dominate and over time more and more people will play this game of basically proposing blocks that are built externally by sophisticated so-called builders that can extract as much value as possible from the blocks now there's two pieces of good news in terms of the long-term vision of pbs one is that we have this research gadget which is called mev smoothing is this idea that as a proposer you don't get to pick the type of block that you select from the builder market you have to pick a specific block and you have to pick the highest paying block and so that removes the discretionary power that proposes might have to do bad things like censorship the other really exciting gadget is this idea of an encrypted mempool it is that when you make a transaction on chain before you broadcast it to the mempool you encrypt it it gets broadcasted broadcast element it gets included on chain and only after it's been included on chain does it get decrypted and so that removes the vast majority of toxic mev which is only made possible because the sandwiches can and the block builders can see the contents of the transaction so once you remove that you remove most of the mmp and what you're left with in terms of mev is the so-called good mev things like arbitrage things like liquidations uh which are useful for the the proper functioning of of defy and don't directly harm any specific one user oh okay i think this is the first time i'm hearing that that was on the roadmap um is it on the roadmap well one of the interesting things is that it doesn't have to happen in consensus on ethereum layer one instead it could happen for each individual rollup so for example arbitrarium is looking to do something like that where they have these encrypted transactions that get decrypted in a batch after the batch has been included on chain and they have so-called threshold decryption where they have a committee where when a majority of the committee decides to decrypt the batch that's when it happens and so no single bad actor within the committee can preemptively decrypt and front run the transactions inside okay so it's at the moment it's not something that will be built into layer one on ethereum it's something that could be built into layer one one of the things that we want to try and avoid in layer one is so-called threshold assumptions this idea that you need at least one half or at least two-thirds of the actors to be participating in in a specific way the good news is that there is this form of encryption which doesn't have a threshold encrypt assumption which is called delay encryption is this idea that you you encrypt your transaction and then automatically after this period of time it could be 10 seconds or it could be 20 seconds or one minute this is configurable the transaction gets decrypted so the flow would be you send your delay encrypted transaction it gets included on chain and then once it's been included kind of a few seconds later automatically decrypts without the need of a committee or a threshold assumption all right so we're gonna just switch topics slightly uh because i myself just did an interview with a mainstream news outlet and what they were interested in was what this shift meant for bitcoin and i know you started as a bitcoiner you may still consider yourself one and i wondered what you thought ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and its decreased environmental footprint does in terms of pressure on bitcoin to also make a similar shift right so there is this say i forget who said it could have been anthony sasano which is that bitcoin is the idea and ethereum is the execution and one of the things that that hall said you know 13 years ago was that he was looking into ways to make bitcoin more energy efficient you're talking about how finny yeah exactly and it's widely thought you know that how finley could be satoshi and i personally believe that is the most likely candidate and here we are 13 years later after whole vinnie kind of wrote this we now have basically a more secure version of ethereum which doesn't consume nearly as much electricity it consumes roughly 5000 times less than bitcoin and i'm sure you're aware that also recently in bitcoin there's been this interesting trend where a number of previously hardcore bitcoiners have kind of come out against bitcoin maximalism and i wondered now that eth will likely be deflationary what do you think happens to bitcoin's narrative as digital gold right so from a cultural standpoint what i think is happening is that the the bitcoin maximalists are becoming more and more extreme in their maximalism and the aetherians are just staying very very open which they have been since the very beginning we have a culture of openness and welcoming and so what's happening is that everyone in the middle is kind of gradually moving away so i started you know vitalik started as a bitcoiner and he moved away i started as a bitcoiner i moved away and now we're kind of moving through the spectrum of kind of maximalism and the the one by one the the there's a brain drain towards ethereum and away from from bitcoin now i think that bitcoin was an amazing you know experiment for the world and it kind of showed us the way in in terms of getting bootstrapped and and with key ideas for for for settlement layers but i i really do believe that moving forward ethereum will be the settlement layer for the internet of value and that looking back you know uh a century into the into the future bitcoin might not have been you know the the success that it could have been had the culture being slightly different and can you flush out that vision a little bit when you say that ethereum will be the settlement layer for the internet of value what does that look like the purpose of blockchains as a product is to deliver secure block space and you have these network effects at play because the most secure block space is going to be the one that attracts all the applications and we know now with you know research and shouting and rollups that we can have a single blockchain scale to let's say 10 million transactions a second and that's enough for every single person on earth to do 100 transactions a second and so if there is going to be if the scalability roadmap is is it is correct then there should be a winner take all dynamics where everyone builds on top of the most secure blockchain and already today ethereum is now four times more secure than than bitcoin in terms of economic security it has roughly 20 billion dollars of economic security versus bitcoins 5 billion and proof of stake as i mentioned previously it has this a magical ability to identify and remove attackers if and when there is a 51 attack and what i think will happen over time is that as if increases its monetary premium and as the cash flows of ethereum through the fee burn increase the market cap of ethereum will be and therefore the economic security of ethereum will become so large that even nation states are not in a position to attack ethereum and at that point ethereum will become effectively part of the substrate of the internet itself and it will be hopefully settling the internet of value which today we're seeing you know as as d5 but it's also going to include non-financial applications such as such as ens all right so i just have to ask this as you know there was a lot of noise made by this ethereum proof of work team that they were going to fork and launch a proof of work chain today and i was wondering what you thought of that effort yeah i mean i haven't been following very closely but it seemed like the effort was extremely unprofessional they made a lot of like very basic technical mistakes and it it seemed to be like the cheerleaders seem to be some of the less you know savory community members and i just saw on twitter i don't know if this is this is correct but uh apparently justin sun and poloniex have decided to declare the real uh ethereum proof of work token to be yet another chain so now there's two efferent proof of work uh chains that are competing with each other and it's it's a great big mess uh i don't expect any of these proof-of-work chains to really have much legitimacy uh and and therefore much value in the market and will that cause any technical problems for ethereum under proof of stake or the users it doesn't cause problems but i do want to highlight one thing which is that if these blockchains are not configured properly then there could be a risk to interacting with them specifically what could happen is what's called a replay attack so for example if you want to try and sell your eve proof of work tokens within a proof of work token and they haven't properly done the replay protection then you'd also be doing the same exact transaction on the main chain itself so be very careful when you are if you do plan to to sell these these tokens and keep in mind replay protection i you know i like you said you have been working on this for years and the part that you were really involved in is a while back so i was wondering if you could give us some uh highlights of what ethereum's roadmap will be going forward what the next focus areas are and especially how any of those might help users dealing with for instance high gas fees so i think there's two big themes in the roadmap one is this massive feature that we want to deploy which is you know known as shouting or bank shouting and that is going to dramatically increase the scalability of rollups by roughly 100x and then there's this other kind of long tail of incremental security upgrades that we want to do and there's you know about a dozen of those and i think the strategy moving forward is to try and focus on the big feature sharding unless you know we feel like there really is a pressing need to address some of the security weaknesses in in the short term so one example is this is a secret leader election right now on the beacon chain every single validator address and therefore ip address is known ahead of time when you're proposing a block the whole world knows that you will be proposing the next block and so it's possible for an attacker to perform a distributed denial of service back attack using the the networking and we can patch these attacks if we feel that they're they're important but if you know if there are no attacks that that really happen i think the main focus will be proto dank shouting which is the first step towards full tank shouting as we know ethereum development is is fairly slow but i expect that these initial steps will will happen in you know in in the months to come you know maybe six to 12 months and there will be some some some amount of of relief with proto dang shouting now that the devs can move away their focus from the merge to the next big feature which is shouting and the dink sharding is um a way of kind of lightening the data load is that how would you define it yeah so there's two you know resources computational resources that blockchains provide one is data availability which you can think of it as as bandwidth and the other one is execution and really what we're doing is we're dramatically increasing the bandwidth of the chain so we can just put more data on chain and have this strong data availability guarantees around it and it turns out that roll ups the resource that they consume is data availability to a large extent and almost little execution at almost no execution and a firm today provides enough execution for roll-ups so really the focus is primarily on data availability all right well i mean this is just such a great recap of what happened and where things are going and what this means for the space i so appreciate that you took the time i hope you get some sleep after this thank you yes we will sleep a lot and again congratulations this is a huge achievement i think everybody in ethereum should be very proud thank you so much

tuning in to this week's news recap celsius ceo dreams up a hail mary to skepticism celsius ceo alex mashinsky is pushing for a revival of the firm according to a leaked recording handed to a celsius customer who also gave it to the new york times according to the nyt mashinsky outlined the plan in a meeting with employees last week the ceo wants to revamp the company building a business focused on crypto custody and charging fees on certain types of transactions the plan's name kelvin mashinsky compared his firm's bankruptcy to other companies bankruptcies does it make the pepsi taste less good he asked employees delta filed for bankruptcy do you not fly delta because they filed for bankruptcy thomas brazil bankruptcy expert called the plan a joke and encouraged mishinsky to step down he also said delta is not a financial firm that operates on faith or trust that's the big difference between financial and non-financial bankruptcies even though michinski seemed enthusiastic the plan would require approval by federal judge martin glenn in addition the creditor committee has serious concerns about it and also about machinski's involvement with celsius on wednesday the judge approved an order to appoint a neutral third party as an examiner of celsius financials using an examiner in chapter 11 bankruptcies is not very common lastly on monday two lawyers from the federal trade commission requested permission to represent the regulator in celsius's bankruptcy case though it's unclear what the agency's intention is treasury allows recovery of tornado cash funds but leaves open questions on tuesday the u.s treasury department's office of foreign assets control or ofac updated its frequently asked questions or faq document which provides guidance on how to remain compliant with the sanctions against tornado cash as per the updated document american citizens who used the virtual currency mixer before sanctions were implemented will be able to apply for a license to recover the locked funds ofac also provided an update on the issue of celebrities and famous crypto community members being dusted with small amounts of eth from tornado cash and said it will not prioritize enforcement against them however ofac did not address the sanctions compliance responsibilities of various participants involved in validating transactions under proof of stake the exact questions many members of the crypto community have been debating since the sanctions this week crypto venture capital firm paradigm laid out legal arguments against the sanctions on tornado cash the company said we believe that under current ofac guidance base layer participants are not required to monitor or censor these addresses as part of a risk-based sanctions compliance program according to blockchain security firms peck shield and certtic a hacker laundered five hundred thousand dollars through tornado cash on tuesday the exploit happened in august of 2021 due to a bug in the dow maker's smart contract a south korean court wants dokwan arrested the court in south korea issued an arrest warrant against do quan ceo of terraform labs and founder of the failed terra blockchain last month quan said in an interview with coinage that he was not being sought by investigators however after the news of the arrest warrant broke coinage tweeted that quan told the media outlet he has yet to receive any warrant from korean prosecutors the warrant will be valid for one year and authorities expect help from interpal to carry out the arrest of quan and two other terraform lab employees all believed to be based in singapore in addition south korea's ministry of finance is looking to void juan's passport doing so would force him to return to south korea where he would most likely be arrested during the week the price of luna has experienced a crazy ride it rose more than threefold from a dollar ninety-one to seven dollars and six cents and is currently trading at around three dollars after the news of the arrest warrant spread someone created a token called jail quan ticker j k wn inflation tanked crypto on tuesday the u.s bureau of labor statistics reported the consumer price index or cpi for august the numbers came in higher than expected showing an 8.3 percent inflation rate over the last 12 months the news was taken very negatively by the market which started to price a higher interest rate hike by the federal reserve consequently all speculative assets plummeted including cryptocurrencies the price of btc fell almost 10 that day and eth suffered a 7 drawdown as well according to coin glass more than 110 million dollars was liquidated during the hour following the release during this high volatility period crypto exchange ftx's interface froze later founder and ceo sam bankman freed apologized for the inconvenience fidelity investments plans to offer bitcoin trading the wall street journal reported on monday that fidelity investments is planning to offer spot bitcoin trading to retail customers fidelity handles over 34 million retail accounts on its brokerage platform and is one of the largest asset managers in the world earlier this year the firm allowed companies to incorporate up to 20 percent of btc into their 401k retirement plans a day later fidelity digital assets together with other investment giants such as charles schwab and citadel announced the launch of edx a new cryptocurrency exchange this move follows blackrock's decision to enter the industry by partnering with coinbase to offer crypto trading to its institutional customers it appears that despite the bear market and crypto prices underperforming institutions are not giving up on crypto in other adoption news the museum of modern art or moma in new york announced it might sell 70 million worth of art to expand the museum's digital footprint which could include buying more digital art such as nfts the foundation plans to auction a number of masterpieces that were lent to the museum and includes paintings and sculptures by picasso renoir and rodan moma director glenn lowery said of the fact that the museum has so far resisted purchasing nfts we're conscious of the fact that we lend an imprimatur when we acquire pieces but that doesn't mean we should avoid the domain gary gensler slightly changes his tune on tokens gary gensler chair of the securities and exchange commission wants the sec staff to recommend a pathway for crypto tokens to register as securities in a written statement he said given the nature of crypto investments i recognize that it may be appropriate to be flexible in applying existing disclosure requirements the news comes after gensler's recent comments reiterating that he believes the crypto industry fits within the standards of current regulation and that nearly every token in the crypto market is a security as lawmakers are deciding how to regulate the industry coinbase added a feature for u.s users to see the crypto sentiment scores of congress members ceo brian armstrong said that it will help users get educated on the crypto positions held by political leaders where they live will eathpow team make it after the successful implementation of the merge the ethpow team released the main net information of the fork including the rpc the chain id and the currency symbol which will be east w the official ethpow twitter account previously announced that the fork would be deployed within 24 hours of the merge however as justin drake just mentioned earlier in the show poloniex which is owned by tron's justin sun decided to list the coins of yet another fork called ethereum fair which polo has now listed with the ticker etf in its announcement polo said based on the market situation and the consensus of users and the community poloniex has decided to choose the fork chain ethereum fair etf which is supported by the community's majority and more proof of work computing power as the main chain for eth w tokens in related news ether mine the world's largest ethereum mining pool announced this week that it will stop offering proof of work services after the merge also the hash rate of ethereum classic shot up by 280 percent following ethereum's transition to proof of stake which signals that miners are using their resources to mine other coins another network that has apparently been chosen by miners is ravencoin which experienced almost a 100 increase in its hash rate within hours novogratz's galaxy digital gets sued bitco a digital asset platform
