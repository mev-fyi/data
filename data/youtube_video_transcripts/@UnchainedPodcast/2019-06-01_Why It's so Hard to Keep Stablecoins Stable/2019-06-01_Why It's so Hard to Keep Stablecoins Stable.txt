provide legal advice today's topic is stable coins here with me to discuss what has been called the holy grail of crypto are rune Christensen founder of maker Dow and Philip Rosedale the founder of Second Life and the co-founder of high fidelity welcome rune and Phillip thank you thanks very much so before we dive into today's topic I want to have each of you explain your background rune let's start with you you are the founder of one of the more well-known staple coin projects maker Dow how did you get in a crypto and come to head up this project in 2011 I first discovered Bitcoin when I saw a Bitcoin address and sort of followed that trail which led me down the whole crypto rabbit hole then I bought into Bitcoin heavily and really got excited about crypts are in general but during the great cryptic rash of 2014 I lost a lot of money from the really from the volatility and that's what led me on the path towards stable coins as I as I sort of felt personally how important that's going to be for you know Main Street adoption and use of cryptocurrency so eventually me and a number of people from from various stable communities from like from the beginning of the stable coin project as a whole we ended up going through cerium and basically setting up we try to basically make the ultimate stable kind in cerium because we saw this smart contrary ecosystem really as the perfect place to bootstrap a grow and grow and stable current so that's been we've been working on that for the past three years and then finally this December 17th we were able to launch the first consumer-ready stable coin which is now live and being used on a number of exchanges and by businesses and one detail that I love about your story is that you were an English teacher in Asia I believe right when you got into crypto yes that's right I was an English teacher in China and then started an HR agencies that broadly and other English teachers to China and it's basically from from doing that business it was that it was in that context I somehow stumbled upon Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and also I sold my business and invested all the profits into Bitcoin earning a lot of money but then subsequently losing most of it again because of the great bubbles and crashes in the early days and so it was just that experience of losing the money that means you think that a stable coin was needed or how did you come up with the idea for a stable coin it was partly that and then also just sort of the inherent promise of a stable coin so I'm so stable coins were actually invented in the bitshares community the very first design was just like a symbol system where you take some like some some cryptocurrency called airs and you back a stable corn that's picked $1 with this other cryptocurrencies so you sort of have it you know like the collateral behind the currency and then what we made now with die is basically an evolution on that concept where we've made it more powerful and we've solved all of its deficiencies okay and so Philip you actually work in another area of VR virtual reality and founded Second Life and then you left that and have now founded a new VR company and what I thought about your experience that would be relevant on Unchained was what happened with linden dollars so tell us about your background but also tell us what linden dollars which what some people have caught is what some people have called the first real virtual currency tell us what those were thanks yeah well my life has been about VR and virtual worlds and from the time I was a kid I wanted to build kind of open-ended worlds that people could come into from all over the world as avatars and do whatever they wanted to and a big part of that and a big part of second life was establishing a currency because right from the beginning people were building things like clothes for their avatars or you know furniture or things like that and we wanted there to be a way for them to buy and sell them from each other and so out of need we built a digital currency called the linden dollar it was introduced in about 2003 and it grew to today a virtual economy whose value whose gross domestic product total transactions is about six to seven hundred million dollars a year and a few years ago it was even closer to about a billion dollars a year so a lot of people but a million people or so a month exchanging goods and services with each other in a virtual world where they were typically in different countries as users and they needed a way to pay each other and they needed a way to pay each other quickly in small amounts and so we built the linden dollar and we built a monetary policy and we recognized and succeeded in making it stable which was a very important part of allowing people to have real jobs in second life and so yeah a lot of sort of similar stuff to what we're seeing now with crypto yeah and as we'll get into later in the episode you are doing more extreme experiments with died but before we get to that let's first define this term a staple coin what is a stable coin how do you guys to find it I would say a very basic meaning of the word is just cryptocurrency or a coin right that has stable price so typically people they think of it as being picked right and so it's like a price that's like like one dollar or one zero or something like that but I think another definition that is also valid it's just one where it's like over time on average its stable again sort of the price of goods yeah I would agree I think the goal and certainly this was the goal with second life if people are going to engage in trade not speculation but actually buying and selling goods and services from each other they need to have some kind of a monetary unit which when compared to something like their rent or what they think their work is worth changes slowly over time so like what rouen said something that changes slowly over time and isn't wildly driven by you know things like speculation and so why do you think people call them the holy grail of crypto is it because it's difficult or because that will be the linchpin to the crypto world taking off or why is it this considered such an important challenge yeah I mean I really think it's like it right now crypto is it's very much about hype and speculation right and there's a lot of potential and a lot of promise but it's actually limited how much we're seeing in terms of real life implementation and real life solutions being delivered right now and I really think one of the main things that's holding everything back is this pervasive issue of volatility right you're just not going to be able to make some sort of fantastic insurance application or you know derivative or something if you have to design the whole thing around an asset that can change 20% over 24 hours instead once we have a stable coin and there is this stability that can be used in trade for goods or services you know like Phyllis is talking about right like that that is something that you can rely on for the everyday things that you're relating to in terms of what you spend your money on that's when you finally open up the types of products that can actually change everyday lives because they'll no longer be this barrier to adoption in some form of volatility I think another piece to add to that is simply that and we've really saw this with Second Life and we're seeing it with Bitcoin and aetherium if people believe that the future utility of a cryptocurrency of a currency is greater than it is today then they're going to and that currency is limited in numbers they're going to speculate correctly that it's going to increase in value and that's exactly what we're seeing with Bitcoin and etherium but the real world has shown us numerous times that if something is being speculated on and in particular if it's speculated to increase in value it will not be used for day-to-day transactions no one would buy a car or a refrigerator with Bitcoin today given that they know they might be giving up a doubling in the value of that money over even you know the next month or so and so we're not seeing regular transactions happening between people for goods and services which was the original promise of Bitcoin and so we've got to fix that somehow yeah well that's interesting and sort of funny because there have been a few people that have bought things like Lamborghinis with their bitcoins but as Chris Byrne iski pointed out on Twitter he was like why would you do that because then you're trading it for an for an asset that will only depreciate I think the most famous one wasn't it of course I'm not an expert on this stuff but it was that hundred and forty million dollar pizza right the Bitcoin that's it from some years ago right right 10,000 bitcoins were spent on Genesis yeah one other thing I just wanted to throw out there when Arun was talking about how this could be important for things like insurance another application that people often say is staple coins are necessary for is prediction markets which you know that's something that everyone thinks like oh this has this is kind of like an idea that has a lot of promise with cryptocurrency but you know still it probably isn't gonna really go anywhere if you if you don't have a stable coin so there was this recent hacker noon post by Hazim Qureshi who's I guess an engineer at earn calm and he talked about stable coins in it and laid out the three main strategies for creating a stable coin I don't know if you guys were called a post but can you just sort of describe for me what are the most typical strategies yeah so I mean so I agree with his post in general that there are three main strategies in terms of stable coins right and then the most simple one is I guess that's what Linden dollars were for instance right and also what's something like terrorists and a number of other currencies where it's basically you just have you know a backing of some sort and then you have a one-to-one representation of that collateral so for instance if you have like a stable coin that's worth $1 and there are a million of those stable coins upstanding then it means there should be a million dollars in a bank account somewhere and that's for instance what Taylor is claiming that they're stable coin dust right so basically it's really what you're really doing is you're making this sort of like an IOU actually right that can be tracked and easily transacted between people and the advantage of that model is that it's very straightforward right it's pretty easy to understand what's going on the disadvantage is that it's also fully centralized so some would argue is that it limits the the potential of for instance it's used in blockchain technology because it's sort of like if you use that on a prediction market for instance then the prediction market as a whole to some degree also becomes centralized so that's the first and most basic of them yeah if I could add actually what we did with Second Life was not that we did not use a dollar peg with Second Life what we actually did with Second Life was we created new currency and sold it on the in currency market we several other people much like what we see with crypto today there there are a number of open markets where you can exchange Linden dollars for things like the Euro or other currencies there's also a foreign exchange site called the Lindex which Linden Lab has of their own which allows you to exchange Linden dollars for dollars and for euros the strategy we actually used was different and quite interesting it was that as the exchange rate increased gradually as more people as the economy grew we actually printed more money we did this transparently we told everybody exactly what we were doing everyone could see the trades we were making and we sold that new currency on the same open market and we did that with a goal of holding the exchange rate roughly constant as the economy grew and that was very successful the exchange rate of the linden dollar to the dollar is about two hundred and sixty five to one and it's changed by no more than a couple of percent a month over like the last decade so it's been a remarkably effective strategy and it didn't use a reserve peg like tether does huh okay that's actually really interesting but isn't there so there there's no reserves behind it at all what about like the redemption like if people start moving out of Linden dollars so one of the really interesting things is that the Linden dollar went through a growth from a zero zero economy to a billion dollar your economy over the first five years or so and it has stayed roughly flat to slightly shrinking over the next five years or so interestingly enough we never offered to redeem we never offered any promise to purchase currency back from people at any time during that entire phase those two phases growth and then stability is slightly shrinking and interestingly enough and I don't I can't give an answer for this other than just the facts the linen dollar has not weakened against the dollar even though the economy has reduced in size by perhaps maybe fifteen percent or so over the last few years so we Linden Lab doesn't sell that they sell little no currency on the open market anymore so the money supply stays constant but the exchange rate has actually stayed remarkably constant during that period as well and any theories as to why I think there's a psychological belief that because we had stated and demonstrated a willingness to increase the money supply as a result of increasing exchange rate it created a kind of a consensual belief and a treatment of the currency as just being relatively stable so I think it indicates that there are psychological forces as we all know as kind of you know are at least armchair economists in my case it creates there are psychological forces that can be brought to bear that are surprisingly effective and I think the simple fact that the money supply could change as it cannot with Bitcoin created a broad public belief that it was a stable thing and so it kind of made the linden dollar more stable than one would have thought even without as rune said the ability to buy back the currency I also think that just because there is this inherent economy right underneath I mean that's definitely gonna have a big impact on the right so the long term like this stuff like money velocity and those kind of things right meaning that there's just going to be this demand for the currency that sort of keeps it it's being useful over time I think that I couldn't agree more ham yeah and for those of you who want to hear more about velocity that's sort of like how quickly money changes hands in an economy over some period of time Chris Byrne iski went into this in depth in the pockets I did with him in the fall and that was a really really fascinating episode I really urge you to listen to it so let's actually continue with the other strategies for creating stable coins so we have the one strategy that you discussed where it's sort of like tether where you're keeping dollars in reserve and so it should be fully collateralized but I think the the downside is ring pointed out for that is that it's more centralized which as you know in cryptocurrency is definitely considered a big risk so what are the other strategies so I'd say the next strategy and if you if you think about this this recent post describing a three strategies then this was this was described in the like the top right of the triangle and what's called crypto curl and relized stable coins and and I think this is where you would say die and maker falls under however I guess one thing that's important to point out is that crypto can take many forms right and really the way we call like what we consider this type of stable going to be in the sort of the category we would put die and make it underweight it's just multi collateralized stable coins so basically a stable coin that instead of just having like like a one-to-one deposit in a bank account instead it has collateral that is in many different forms and shapes kinda end and diversify it across all these different types it can be in basically and then most importantly it's always over collateralized so so for instance if you if you look at one die and how and what it's backed by currently instead of it being a one to one dollar in a bank account for instance it's something like three to one value of aetherium held in a smart contract so you can so instead of you can go into a bank and then be able to retrieve one dollar for your stable point you can go to the smart contract system and you can retrieve well you can retrieve $1 worth of eath but you know that even if the price of eath falls for instance they're still going to be access East available for you to retrieve and then what's even more crucial is that over time this type like this infrastructure is expanded to support any type of asset here so it's not just going to be cerium that'll be used as collateral it's also gold through various gold tokenization projects it's also like traditional assets like stocks and bonds and basically anything that sort of adds to the overall stability and diversification of like the total lateral pool which then gives you this this hybrid functionality where on one hand the system itself is decentralized in the same way that's something like Bitcoin or ether is right that you it's just like a some code that everybody agrees on that runs the system and that's how the fundamental monetary policy of the stable coin is governed but then on the other hand you do have access to these real world assets and all these various assets that are used as collateral that also upheld in virtual bank accounts so to speak right like all these various places where it's it's like something like you know gold in Singapore or Assyria man a theory in blockchain or US dollars in a US bank account all of this is put together into one system and all contributing to the stability of the stable coin and this means and the crucial difference between this and something like tether is that even if one of the points like one of the places where collateral is deposited fails basically like it turns out to be insolvent or something there's still so many other points in the system that on their own offer this over collateralized protection that a single failure in the system doesn't really affect the stability of the overall system and it can mitigate even relatively large crashes or unexpected events and still remain stable for the end-user who can just trust it to be $1 or whatever it's supposed to be stable against and wait and I just but there's one thing part I don't understand so I I obviously get how you can use ether to over collateralize or a crypto version of gold but then what about something like US dollars like where would you store that well I mean actually if we like if teller was extremely legit and it was like totally transparent how you know their claim to the underlying dollars worked then it would just be through to something like that all right however like there is a there's another project called true USD which is making something similar basically they're calling it like they're pretty much positioning themselves as Heather but legit pretty much and that's an example of something we could use as really great collateral right because it would be something that it would be transparent for us to understand the risks of it and it will allow us to add it into the autonomous smart contract system and then just have it be another node in the overall diversified portfolio and when you say tether but legit they're working with kind of like known custodians around the world and they're you know there's everything is done in compliance with like know your customer and Annie Monday and anti money laundering regulations so there's kind of like a certain level of comfort that people would have in those dollars actually being in reserve but is it did I characterize that correctly yeah exactly and crucially it's also possible to take through years deep and and go to them with your curiosity and then they will give you real dollars in return which is something that Taylor used to say they offered people but at some point they just stopped actually letting anyone do that okay and one other thing that I wanted to add to what you're describing here is that am I wrong in thinking that this is somewhat similar to this concept that the IMF has which I actually wish I had thought of this earlier when I was writing the questions but I googled it quickly I guess it's called an SDR Special Drawing right and it's sort of like I think it's a basket of different currencies or something do you know about that and is is that similar to what you're trying to do with megiddo so what's really interesting is actually that dye used to be pegged to the STR so we used to actually be really obsessed with the IMF and the SDR and what do they were doing with this currency basket basically because I mean there are some parallels there right because it's about how they diversify these various currencies to create a basket that's supposed to be superior compared to any single currency however after doing a lot of research on the sort of the actual performance of the SDR in the market we actually came to the conclusion that there isn't much advantage just using the usdollar sort of as our reference of stability right so that's why Dai is now just packed one dollar because ultimately they're it's just you know it's just easier for regular people to understand and you don't really gain much advantage in using the SDR which actually is a little strange I mean because it is possible to design currency baskets that are superior but the SDR just isn't designed in that way and I guess the the the principle of how the underlying backing and like the fact that you have a basket behind it isn't exactly the same as the way like dye works with the collateral and so on right because the SDR is just sort of a one to one backing and one to one pick in sort of speak of the exposure whereas in our system it's kind of that we have this you know we have this highly diversified collateral that all has like all these different exposures right and there can be thousands of different collateral types in the system and then ultimately we use all of that to back something that's back to exactly one dollar regardless of what's happening to the collateral behind it and the way we're able to enforce that is because we just always ensure those over collateralization so basically it's because there is always going to be you know if there's what like if there's a million dollars of guy outstanding there's going to be something like two million dollars worth of collateral at least or I just like a large amount of collateral so even if the collateral changes from day to day it doesn't impact the fact that there's still more than one dollar worth of collateral for for the dinosaur claim and that just ensures that the IRA mains overall stable regardless of what's going on in the market and if I could add you know aren't we really talking about as we look at these reserve strategies these backing strategies for different stable coins and crypto currencies we're really talking about a broader phenomena which has been an important part of the financial history of the whole world which is fractional reserve banking you know the bank's ability to make loans is based on the fraction less than 100% of reserves that it has to maintain I I'm struck by the observation that a lot of the stable coin design exercise is one that is very similar to the question of you know what fraction of deposits a bank is required to hold on account and that that's been obviously such an important and interesting issue in world history and it seems like we're going through it again with crypto currencies I would also add that there were coming from Second Life there it seems to me that there are two important different types of stability there's seeking stability during a period of monotonic or increasing growth and then they're seeking stability during a period of equilibrium where there are for example as many people using crypto currency as want to and then there are all these real world currencies I'm it strikes me from the second life background that it's very important that you understand which stage you're and I think we're in a stage with crypto currency and I bet most would agree right now where everything is growing because for the most part cryptocurrency is as yet underutilized and so like Second Life in its first few years you're gonna see steady growth as people are trying to make some use of these new systems Phillip I actually want to go back to what you were saying where you sort of compared these over collateralized stable coins to fractional reserve banking because I feel like it's the opposite right you need to put up more money than you can take out which is a really different thing from getting a loan where you don't put anything in and you get to take something out right it's so like I understand what you're saying on a certain level but I feel like the individual experiences is completely different it's definitely not a credit system well I guess what I'm saying is going back to what you guys said about maybe tether being overly centralized if we had a transparent reckoning of dollars and euros and other currencies that were submitted for deposit in say a regular Bank in exchange for a certain amount of a token on a cryptocurrency and was done all over the world and we could publicly see a lot of different balances that would tell us essentially how large our reserves stake of US dollars overall was then I think we will end up with a financial system with a fractional reserve we don't need I don't see the riper Sinhalese I'm not an expert on this don't see the reason why we would need to collateralize beyond a hundred percent we should be able to collateralize less than on a percent just like we do with the regular banking system I think so so I just want to add some here about what fraction Reserve actually means because it means so it's an interesting point this this like over collateralized station isn't that the opposite of fractional reserve for instance so what fractional reserve actually means is how much of the reserve like how much of the bank's collateral is held with the central bank and how much is held with like you know the in the various loan agreements that the bank is doing so I mean what's interesting is and I mean and in it does you know making perfect sense when you think about it said from the point of view of a bank even when they're doing fractional reserve lending they're still over collateralizing in the sense that they are always making sure that they have enough like they have some sort of claims that they feel is enough to cover what they're risking right because then they'd never make a loan to someone who they feel could not possibly pay back that loan but the like it's irrational but so what's interesting is that this collateral can take take all sorts of strange forms right it could be like a like a personal liability right like some claim on someone's salary basically it could be like lien on a house which is a really typical type of collateral to use right and then when you're talking about fractional reserve you're actually like it's really like the fraction of the reserve that's like hard reserves and the fraction that are sort of most soft collateral and then in the context of a stable life of an over collateralized stable coin like die it's actually the exact same situation you're in because you have to so think about this like how much of the collateral needs to be like really hard extremely tangible assets and how much of it can we risk basically having us more you know slightly more unreliable or more soft assets that on one hand are like they're less it's it's more hard to like predict what happens to them in the event of a crash for instance but then at the same time there's way more of this stuff available and we can heavily oracle analyzed with this kind of stuff so that's it's it's actually dynamic that's very similar and when you govern a stable coin like Dai it's basically it's definitely extremely important to rely on sort of the existing knowledge from the financial system right and like use existing models existing theory and especially avoid you know historical blunders in the banking system that kind of stuff and make basically make sure that we're building on top of the knowledge that already exists okay so we're gonna finish this discussion about maker and we're gonna also talk about linden dollars and some other proposals for stable coins but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors start engine interested in raising capital through a regulated IC o---- start engine is your one-stop solution start engine

gmail.com that's la ura Shi n podcast at gmail.com our topic today is sample coins and I'm speaking with rune Christensen founder of stable coin project maker Dao and Philip Rosedale the founder of VR world's second life and high fidelity so rune let's let's actually finish talking about maker one point that I wanted to make here is I think you're starting off with the you know what you're using for life or collateral as being you know ether and I guess next you're adding gold but I feel like the success of your project really depends on how diversified it can be right because if you end up using a basket of all cryptocurrencies and then the whole crypto market crashes 90 percent or something then your your stable going to not going to be so stable either right so it doesn't it sort of depend on you getting crypto versions of other kinds of assets yeah absolutely and that is the one thing we're focusing the most on right it's like getting high quality diversify collateral from all over the world and and I mean the core team is working on this a lot luckily what we're seeing is there's just this incredible trend right now in the space that basically a lot of projects all over the world are doing exactly what we sort of predicted and bet on which is just making their own platforms for scalable organization of securities and various assets we also have it really like in the short term we have some really interesting like individual projects such as I mean there's there's gold tokens that are actually popping up all over the world and then we're also seeing a type of real estate token that just has a really sort of simple and straightforward legal framework that allows us to actually use tokens that have the same sort of risk profile as real estate but at the same time are extremely easy to use in our system without having to worry so much the legal and regulatory framework however it is definitely the next step is to actually set up these strong and highly reliable regulatory frameworks that will allow us to use securities as collateral like I was talking about before right it's like about like getting like stocks and bonds and commodities and all of this stuff in a format where we know it's going to be strong claims on the underlying assets so that we can actually rely on them as a significant portion of the collateral for the stable point and yeah I mean basically this is it's the biggest it's a biggest challenge to get this done right and I think right now it's looking really positive in the short term I think we will have more than enough to handle sort of the short-term spike in demand that we expect to come when we launch the fully scalable multi-core level system this summer but also like a clear pipeline to towards our you know our our end goal which is this state where the system really is exposed to assets from all over the world and basically every single legitimate jurisdiction has a very straightforward and way to interact with our system and allow us to use assets from that particular jurisdiction to back dive so a couple of other questions I want to ask you are we know that different central banks are looking into creating fiat versions of cryptocurrency would is something like a Fiat US dollar sorry a crypto version of the US dollar would that threaten a maker Dow like with that just to obviate the need for stable coins at all and render your project sort of not useless but you know obsolete I mean so actually we are really excited about those because we see them basically as like a highly like a supercharged tanner basically right like like a highly highly reliable version of the one to one back stable coin and I mean first of all they're really really reliable collateral in our system right and it actually ties a little bit back to the discussion on actual reserved right because if we can get access to through central bank money as collateral then we finally actually have an asset that is you know that that is considered like true reserves in the in the traditional financial sense but it is a cryptid version of USD then won't that mean that your project is unnecessary well I mean it's still you know it ultimately still a claim on a centralized entity right I mean it's the thing that our system does sort of us differently is you know that this system itself is fully autonomous its fully decentralized it really has all the features of you know blockchain technology is that you want something to have when you sort of me you know when you're thinking about decentralized applications and that kind of stuff right I mean ultimately if you build let's say a decentralized prediction market but you're making people use you know Federal Reserve US dollar token then ultimately it's your it's not really much different from just having the Federal Reserve running that prediction market basically right because ultimately they have the ability to pull the clock on it at any time and who knows I mean maybe prediction markets become illegal suddenly or you know there's just you know some sort of action like that we could potentially make this a very big weakness in the system I mean at the same time it's not like this time these type of assets are not extremely useful because they definitely are but it's just like you know there's always going to be these different use cases for different assets depending on what the characteristics are and I think what we might end up seeing is something where die is sort of this you know like the the asset the sort of stance at the center of the entire blockchain hurricane so to speak like the the eye of the storm kind of and then something like US dollar like Federal Reserve tokens or and then of course also tokens from every single other central bank they you know they sort of tie into it right but they're still centralized they're still sort of at the edge of the actual decentralized ecosystem and the one thing they do really well is that they're going to be really excellent ramps right it's going to be a really good way to sort of move money out of the traditional banking system and into the decentralized ecosystem huh I like the way you answer that that is a point that's obviously really important that I hadn't been thinking of and one last question before we move on to Linden dollars is I wanted to ask so if maker is gonna be pegged to the u.s. dollar then that means that it will always be slightly debased every year right Erik Voorhees in one of the recent episodes talked about this at length but isn't it essentially the same thing that's going to happen to maker so or die the thing is the thing is actually that like the reason why I die is called you know die and not something like decentralized dollar or something later it's because leave like that I was saying earlier actually the original goal was not for it to be pegged to the dollar or any particular asset it was for it to be just sort of stable in the fundamental sense of the word right it we just have like a stable purchasing power over time measured against goods and services and initially we were actually looking at the SDRs like the the primary like reference of stability and then basically because we did a lot of quantitative measurements we came to the conclusion that we're better off just picking you to the US dollar initially but the plan is actually in that over time if the US dollar sort of fails to be this really well-managed currency which I admit I mean I would say it currently is is a really good asset like in terms of if you look at overall performance of the various currencies around the world US dollar right now is like a you know it's a really solid asset that people can trust but of course it's not guaranteed that'll always be the case and basically our plan is to rely on the US dollar for as long as it makes sense and then the moment that there is something like stronger inflation or hyperinflation or any sort of mismanagement of the US dollar our system actually supports just deep hacking at any point in time it's basically up to the community to decide when it happens and then implemented through voting and once they do they can Smoot they can switch to something like like a diversified currency pie get something like the SDR or even something like a diversified CPI basket so actually it they could it could move to something where you just measure value in terms of goods and services and don't even think about exchange rates to other currencies well this seems like a really powerful concept and that's pretty interesting um so before we move on to Linden dollars I actually we didn't finish going through the different strategies for various staple coins but I just want to mention in addition to true USD which rune I talked about earlier another project that a lot of people are talking about is base coin and that has a pretty different strategy where they essentially use a smart contract as a sort of central bank that inflates or deflates the money supply based on price and there are other actors in the system I actually discussed this on a previous podcast I'm just blanking Brune do you remember the names of the two groups it's like the bondholders and then the something sure holders sure shareholders and then the bond Jerry so there's this there's this the original project that's that's stuff like base coin and oh there's another one called heaven as well both of them are based on a concept called senior shares which is actually one of the oldest stable coin ideas but the idea itself which is called senior shares actually never was implemented and then base coin and heaven both sort of complicated the design basically but still remained with the fundamentals same economic incentives and so from the point of view of me like someone who is who's into maker and basically understands how maker makes you know works and why dye makes sense because there's some value behind it that's backing it right which means that even if suddenly there's a huge drop in demand for dye and nobody wants it anymore you can still count on it having value because you know they're those real assets behind it and basically that dynamic was sort of the downfall or the problem of senior shares that it's face that made it men did never get implemented the problem is basically is that if everybody suddenly at the same time just decides that they no longer wants a stable point of these like feel it's risky earlier there's a run on the bank basically there's just no mechanism to basically deal with that like the system relies on a continuous growth over time that that always has to be there always has to be present like there always has to be these new people coming in and basically contributing to the stability of the system and if that continues flow of newcomers stops then there's actually nothing left like that's the that's sort of the first and last line of defense it's like future demand for the stable coin and that just means it can be subject to some really horrible like crash conditions basically right like similar to like a run run in the bank where if enough people do the run of the bank the whole bank just like collapses to zero and everybody who weren't fast enough they just end up with nothing yeah it's definitely one of the more kind of faith based coins in the sense that it really makes you realize that the only value that an asset has is or money has is with a value that people believe it has but we'll see there's a lot of really smart people that are backing base coin as well I believe andreessen horowitz and Union Square Ventures invested in it so let's finally turn back to Linden dollars we did describe it a little bit early on but I wanted to get into some of the problems that you experienced to experience with it Phillip I read some critiques also and I actually don't know if these turned out to have happened but like I read this critique in 2007 that predicted that linden dollars would eventually run a deficit because the amount of money second life was taking in was less than the amount of linden dollars it was creating I know also eventually you ended up banning interest Baron interest bearing banks in second life but you know I don't know how big these problems were in general like what did you feel was your experience with having a virtual currency and the problems that could come along with it and the challenges well there are so many things to say there let me start with interest bearing banks and our balance on that just like fractional reserve banking there is the legal question of how much reserve to allow and there were experimenters you know inside Second Life that were trying to set up offerings that you know feel a little bit like some of the ICO offerings we see today where they looked like you know poorly collateralized or you know unlikely to fulfill offerings in the long term or you know or even somewhat like Ponzi schemes and so we as the company operating the virtual world had to make both kind of ethical and legal decisions about what we would sort of let people do and one of those was whether to allow you know different types of banking schemes with different types of reserve strategies and so simplistically it didn't seem to be adding a lot of value to end-users and so for the most part we tried not to let people do that I say try because Second Life is a big virtual world you know it's huge it as a million people and edit you you can't you know for a reasonable amount of money sort of police everything in such a world but we did that as you said the money supply looking at this this hacker noon article which as you say very well captures decided to have three types of stable coins a fiat collateralized stable coin a crypto collateral as stable coin and then a non collateralized stable coin as you just said base coin as an example of the non collateralized case Second Life most accurately could also be described to be a non collateralized case for as I said we never established a reserve or even offered to buy back currency we simply built an exchange in open exchange where people could trade it out for real currencies and then the only piece of monetary policy we executed was a willingness to sell additional currency that has increased the money supply as the growth of the economy went up and the exchange rate went up and I think that gets back to a point that I think is true about crypto and I think is part of why we're all excited about crypto which is in a growth stage where there's genuine new economic utility goods and services being created amongst people you want to have a different strategy for stabilizing an economy then you do understate where you just have say you know two you know gold and silver fighting for share amongst investors so Second Life was like an island that kind of came up out of the sea where we went from no economic value to a billion dollars a year of economic value in the space of three or four years and I think that's exactly what we're gonna see with crypto crypto is not going to steal money from existing ideas it's going to create new economic opportunities in VR an example of that would be people being a teacher somebody teaching a bunch of kids that are 10,000 miles away because she can she can use virtual reality to put a bunch of kids in a room and teach them something while that teacher can charge for her services and if she's able to do that she's creating new economic value and she somehow needs trading currency to be able to do that and so I think that is the question is when you're growing and growing rapidly how do you increase that money supply in a way that best accommodates the new things that people are doing so how would you release new money into the system well I what what we're thinking at high-fidelity right now and I've written and talked about this a bit is that we we've already set up a blockchain that is a fast low fee blockchain for people to exchange goods and services inside high fidelity as we look at as we look forward and anticipate growth as high fertility starts to get launched and get out there we're gonna see the same kind of economic growth amongst end users that we saw with Second Life and so we're thinking about how what strategy can we use as a cryptocurrency to increase the money supply as that growth occurs in a way that is best for the economy and so what we're trying to do what we're thinking right now is to try to do something that is fairly similar to what we stopped did successfully with second life but in a decentralized fashion and a portion of the base coin strategy which is what you do when the economy is growing is something that at this point does make a lot of sense to us and that is you watch the exchange rate as the exchange rate between the new currency and the old currencies say the fiat currencies goes up you algorithmically create new money and you distribute it in some widespread means the the proposal for example from base coin is that you distribute it to a second class of token holders and you allow that class of people to be you know numerous and trade those tokens amongst themselves you distribute the currency to them and you let them sell it back eventually on the open market thus putting it into circulation oh so is that how HFC the high fidelity currency is out how that's gonna work we haven't yet implemented that increase in the money supply algorithm but that is what we are thinking is to do something very similar to Second Life where we use an Oracle of some kind to watch a number of exchange rates and as you said you know a basket of them is probably appropriate like you guys were talking about and then we create new HFC and distribute it out to someone probably a second class of token holder and you know those tokens could be on another blockchain you know they could be on a theorem for example so that that's what we're in the midst of designing right now and I saw on Twitter you said something about how people in high fidelity that their avatars were waiting for waiting at the virtual bank for their cryptocurrency what did that mean so here again when you grow when you create a virtual world that has late and economic value people are going to begin exchanging goods and services that they've never been able to exchange before basically because it's VR you need some way to give out initial currency to people to get things going you know it's a lot like someone immigrating to a new country what basic things do you give that new arrival anticipating that they're going to contribute to the economy in some way so one of the things that we're doing right now is for the existing alpha and beta users of high fidelity and for the new ones coming in we literally have a bank and of course this is just also kind of fun fun way to experience VR we literally have a bank where you can go and stand in line and collect an initial small allocation of HFC and so that's one of the strategies that we're doing right now to cause the economy to cause everyone to have a little bit of spending money in the new economy just as we did with Second Life and it's a the thing that we're trying to figure out the best way to make algorithmic as the economy starts to become large so built I who I know as a friend of yours and for the listeners who did not hear the episode with built-i I actually think it may have been my third episode ever he was amazing I highly recommend you go back and listen to that episode but Phil so bill told me that you had some interaction with the government about it was something like the IRS maybe contacted you when users of Second Life started making real money what happened there and do you feel like you learned any particular lessons around maybe like what what regulatory risks stable coins might face well first you know as to Bill tie a bill as a friend and I think it's just a genius you know just one of the most brilliant guys that is thinking about every aspect of this I've always as a friend just been delighted by Bill because he never fails to come into the room with some big thought about something in economies that I've never thought about before and that's you know having thought about them a good deal and we I used to call Bill my he was the Alan Greenspan you know who always had these wonderful opinions about what was happening with the second-life economy he was Alan Greenspan gollum because you had to have a a special last name basically that sort of made you part of second life so it was that was a delight and you know Bill was the guy that you know got me thinking about Bitcoin because you know we had the virtual economy and it starting from about 2005 in 2003 when we launched and then Bill I remember I think was was the first person who came to me and said you got a look at this thing go pick one because it's pretty similar you know to this digital currency that Second Life has and so we've we've had a lot of amazing conversations over the years and he's been a great adviser on the things that were thinking about with respect to the to the IRS I mean one observation interesting observation is that because Second Life again as I said before created a lot of new value people were doing new things in Second Life and continued to that they couldn't do in the real world the way the government looked at us I think appropriately was different because we were creating new value we weren't for example kind of letting people kind of move from doing a job in the real world to doing in the virtual world and then not paying taxes for the most part people were still doing their job in the real world but they were also in the evening doing a job in the virtual world and getting paid for that so one observation was that the government correctly I think always looked at Second Life as generating value yeah I was asked one time to come and actually speak before Congress about that and it was a lot of fun to just kind of try and say you know this is what virtual worlds are all about but but for the most part they were about creating new economic opportunities not eroding existing ones and so we actually I think didn't have to deal as much with the regulatory impact because there was just a lot less to worry about with things that were being done entirely in the virtual world and reun do you know if stable coins face any particular regulatory risks I mean so what we see right now is that it's not really being taken seriously yes so to speak like this I think actually the overall attitude towards something like stable coins and cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is it's very similar to the to what Phillip is talking about with how like Second Life is it's creating value right it's like a new economy a new thing perhaps with the added nuance of all the icos creating some level of shadiness right but I think overall there comes a point where the authorities will have to really think hard about what the impact of stable coins and blockchain technology will be on just like the regular financial system and the regular economy and currently they're not ready to do that just yet so that leaves us a really interesting opportunity to basically be first with our own ideas write our own suggestions for how it should be regulated and how it should be approached but I think one thing is assured and that is eventually it is something that will be highly regulated and highly controlled because it's simply necessary for financial markets to be like that if you don't do that you know it'll basically be just like an IC o---- you know fast forever basically and that's not really what we want to happen with blockchain technology right we want it to be something that actually impacts real lives and just improves on the current economy I agree okay so we're running out of time but I actually want to tackle one last topic super super fast Vitalik wrote this blog post where he had this other idea for a sort of stable kind coins that he described as a collateralized debt obligation for issuer backed tokens and here's my summary feel free to correct me if my understanding is wrong but a number of issuers issue dollar pegged staple coins with different levels of risk and then those who purchase the coins with low risk they will pay interest rates to those who purchased the coins with a high risk and and in like the coins with different risks actually have I think different prices too if I understood that correctly what do you guys think of that idea and is there any project that's trying something like that yes I mean this is really using this sort of the traditional thinking around CDOs and just applying it to stable point specifically but this is actually you know this is a technique that's used I mean that was used especially with mortgage-backed securities to sort of attempt to turn basically you know unstable and risky assets into some sort of financial product that itself was actually stable which of course at some point is impossible right because like if you you know 0 times something is still 0 basically so like at some point you know no matter what you do to a bunch of risky assets you'll always end up with something that's still risky but if you take that idea and you apply to stable fine what you actually end up with there's some sort of supercharged extremely stable acid which I definitely think I mean metallic side ear is definitely like it's interesting in a sense that you end up with something that really like it's very close to being as stable as you could possibly ever make any sort of fastest basically I think it's just like I know that no one is working at a little I believe no one is working on it right now and I think the main reason for that is that there's there's basically too many drawbacks to the system like there's going to be a lack of liquidity and especially the like you know you have to pay a high cost for the privilege of getting this like extreme security like stability that you would get if you if you purchase the safest of the the stable hein studios and I think overall like there's a number of other ways to approach this where you like if you're not so interested in fungibility and liquidity there's you know you can use like insurance or or you know like similar derivatives that type solutions where you just somehow try to end up with better stability but solemn essay as a thought experiment I think it's very interesting because it just like it shows yes especially shows the power of smart contracts because of how he like conceptually relatively easy it is to implement this with just an Oracle and some smart contracts okay well I will put the link to that post in the show notes so it's been fantastic having you both on as guests where can people get in touch with you or see your work well for Philip
