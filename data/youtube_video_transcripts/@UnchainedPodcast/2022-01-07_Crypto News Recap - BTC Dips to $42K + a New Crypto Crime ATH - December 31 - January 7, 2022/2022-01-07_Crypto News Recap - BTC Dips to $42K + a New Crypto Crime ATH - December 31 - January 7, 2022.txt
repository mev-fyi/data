[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap [Music] bitcoin dropped to 42k here are two reasons why bitcoin fell by roughly 10 on wednesday dropping from a high of just over forty seven thousand dollars to below forty two thousand five hundred dollars before settling in around the mid forty three thousands for the rest of the week the crash led to 322.86 million dollars in bitcoin liquidations between wednesday and thursday afternoon the largest such liquidation event by over 100 million dollars since december 3rd when over 615 million dollars was washed away in 24 hours the slump coincided with two negative events for bitcoin first the network's hash rate or the amount of computing power securing it took a hit on wednesday when kazakhstan shut down internet access across the country due to unrest over spiking energy prices according to cambridge center for alternative finance as of july 2021 kazakhstan accounted for roughly 18.1 percent of mining power in the world with the internet off in kazakhstan data compiled by the block's larry cermak shows that bitcoin's hash rate fell approximately 12 after kazakhstan's internet went down data from btc.com shows similar results with major pools like f2 pool and pull and via btc each losing hash rate between 12 to 19 percent as of recording time it remains unclear when or if kazakhstan's internet access will return the second negative event for bitcoin was that on january 4th bitcoin's dominance a statistic that tracks bitcoin's market share compared to the entire crypto industry reached 39.38 percent marking just a three percentage point difference between the all-time low of btc dominance that occurred back in early 2018. with bitcoin's latest dip ethereum is roughly 50 away from flipping btc as the largest crypto asset on the market despite the bearish outlook for bitcoin in terms of liquidations hash rate and dominance not every headline was negative a recent goldman sachs client note dated january 4th expressed optimism for the largest cryptocurrency and cited the possibility that bitcoin could hit 100 thousand dollars if it were to command a healthy percentage of the store of value market the goldman sachs note comes just after the firm reported that btc was among the best performing assets of 2021. speaking of bitcoin the block reports that a congressional subcommittee is preparing a hearing on bitcoin's environmental impact the block cites three sources with knowledge of the matter who say that the oversight and investigation subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee is starting to build a group of witnesses to speak on the energy usage of proof-of-work crypto validation cryptocrime hit an all-time high in 2021. according to chainalysis a leading blockchain analytics firm cryptocrime spiked to an all-time high of 14 billion dollars in 2021. this is a 79 increase upon 2020 when only 7.8 billion dollars worth of transactions were deemed illicit however as chainalysis is careful to point out an all-time high and crime value is a bit of a misnomer crucially chain analysis reports that total cryptocurrency transaction volume grew by 567 percent in the last year while illicit transactions only grew by 79 this discrepancy and growth led to an all-time low of 0.15 of all cryptocurrency transactions deemed illicit in years past this number has been between 0.62 and 3.37 percent the cftc brings enforcement action against poly market on january 3rd the commodities futures trading commission announced a settlement with poly market a

because it highlights the importance of having a decentralized front end wrote belton cftc highlights how poly market users are functionally entirely dependent on their front end to access the smart
