people that hold the tokens are going to be making these same types of decisions if this type of liability regime applies because they're going to know hey hold on maybe we should or should not allow something like this to occur if the government is going to be able to show up in two years and say hey 63 of you who voted for this are liable for the other 37 so the entire dynamics of how Dallas will work I think are upended by this and yeah it's a good example of of an implication that you know might seem very limited but it won't be just like you know people are already starting to change and Order their behavior in response to the ukidao complaint despite there not even being a resolution yet the same thing would start to occur here if it really was the case that these dials were not just operators but suddenly individual members or collectives could be liable for these things the entire the entire system would be upended and I think you'd see a lot more Anonymous participation you see a lot more student Anonymous participation offshore participation and I think you know like you know Gary or cfpc is listening to this and they're like yeah that's what we want I think they should really consider if that's what they actually want
