as we have a window into how this custodian ended up collapsing basically they ended up at one point so initially they had their own crypto wallets that they were managing on behalf of customers they ended up moving over to fire blocks and having fire blocks manage all their wallets except they had this concept of Legacy wallets which were basically their old wallet systems and for some reason you know fireblocks didn't have certain flexibility they wanted and so they were creating throughout 2022. some of these old Legacy wallets using their old system but it turned out these Legacy wallets were not being persisted or something and so they essentially were creating these Wallets on their own interfaces but they did not actually have the private keys to these wallets and so they were telling people ah yes we created a new wallet for you and your Bitcoin is over here according to our internal Ledger but they did not have any of the crypto and so when they realized this they were like oh uh we don't have the money that we keep telling our customers we have let's go use our cash deposits which are being given to us by uh customers who are depositing Fiat in their custodian and let's use that to buy the crypto that we don't have to give people withdrawals and kind of keep the keep the party going so this looks like just a total complete circus so they're they're down 85 million dollars in cash liabilities and like 69 mil and crypto liabilities but the crypto is almost one-to-one and it's almost all audience tokens um the rest is like you know some Bitcoin and stuff like that but yeah they only have three million cash and uh you know sort of like 82 mils short and so yeah it's like where did the money go maybe it was all lost and sort of trying to buy back the crypto that they lost but yeah also I mean their custodians should have insurance so like the whole thing seems very uh goofy to me the bigger issue here Beyond not getting hacked because in essence they got hacked I mean it's they didn't get hacked they lost the assets but like there's the assets go into the black hole and then there's the cover-up which is the consequence of it right like if coinbase somehow had assets go into a black hole which it always could right like there's no guarantee that any custodian can keep all the assets completely safe at all times if the assets go into the black hole you know you're basically saying you would trust them not to cover it up and lie about it and fraud it and so the real problem here the iso Prime trust is not it's hard to safeguard assets because it's extraordinarily hard to safeguard assets right even as a custodian it's how they handled it which is like the truly like disappointing thing like it's so hard to safeguard assets it's hard for individuals it's hard for businesses it's hard for custodians whose job it is like it's just hard right it's hard for exchanges how many exchanges have lost assets Mount gox lost a you know lost assets right like quadrigo probably lost assets you know it's like there's so many instances of people losing crypto assets because keeping them safe is extraordinarily complicated and from there it separates into the good guys who own up to it and the bad guys who cover it up and dig themselves deeper trying to make it all back somehow my takeaway from this is I always go back to First principles this is yet again one of the reasons why defy has the long-term Advantage because if a D5 protocol somehow black hole assets everybody would know right away and there would be no ability to cover it up there would be no fraud there's radical transparency and this would not happen with a smart contract if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode now on Unchained
