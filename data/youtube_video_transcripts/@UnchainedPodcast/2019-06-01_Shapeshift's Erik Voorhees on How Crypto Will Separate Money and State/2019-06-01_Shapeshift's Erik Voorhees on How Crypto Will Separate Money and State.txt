legal advice today's guest is Erik Voorhees CEO of crypto - crypto exchange shape-shift welcome Erik thanks for having me on the show so you're down at the Satoshi round table right now and today was the day of the Senate Banking Committee hearings on quote-unquote virtual currencies as they call them what is everyone talking about down there at the round table were you guys all paying attention to the hearing are you focused on other matters I think most of the people here are not paying attention to that because part of the reason that we're all down here is to talk among ourselves about how to push the industry forward so I'm sure we'll read all the headlines as they as they come out Oh interesting so what are kind of like the topics for a discussion that's all private but I'll tell you that this see this is the gathering where weeds where we come together to set monetary policy for the world we decide on my interest rate we decide how large our balance sheet will be how much money we'll print that the world will have to consume and then we go eat caviar oh great okay great so clearly this is not going to be a disruptive technology I don't even know why we're doing the podcast should we just shut it down right now no but really you cannot talk at all about what you guys are discussing there must be something interesting the rules the rules here are it's okay to publish or talk about things that you've gotten explicit permission from individuals to discuss so since I haven't done that before this I can't do it oh I see okay okay okay well um I guess I'll just have to UM just not be as nosy as I'd like to normally be so one thing that I have always been curious about about you is um in Niall Popper's book digital gold at the in the very beginning he's describing how before you discovered Bitcoin you were mired in credit card debt you were unemployed and you'd been doing odd jobs and this was all of course before you discovered Bitcoin so I'm just curious to hear you describe kind of what your life was like back then how you discovered Bitcoin and then just hear your reflections in general on this long journey that you've had yeah happy to discuss that so I think mired in credit card debt is a bit strong you know this was back when I was in my mid-twenties I certainly had some credit card debt and I was making very little money probably probably pretty typical for someone of my age but I was doing just freelance work in marketing and brand development and I had just moved back to the u.s. from Dubai where I had spent two years working at a real estate agency out there and I thought over the last year of that that bubble and watched the whole financial crisis unfold from across the ocean which was a really interesting perspective but then I went back to the US and 2010 and in mid-2011 I saw Facebook post about Bitcoin and after about 10 minutes of dismissal and thinking it was the stupidest thing I've ever heard of I realized it was going to change the entire world and ever since then I've been down the rabbit hole wait and I'm sorry you said this was mid-2011 yeah so May early May of 2011 is when I first learned about the claim oh wow okay was it around the time that that Gawker article came out about Silk Road is that how you heard about it that was a few months prior and probably that wave of publicity is maybe what ended up catching me into it as well it wasn't that article that I saw but it may have been something that happened shortly thereafter and it's kind of unusual that you say that you only dismissed it for ten minutes because most people I feel like their moment of realisation was kind of a bit later why do you think you grasped it so quickly probably because I wanted to I wanted this to be real and I say that because you know as I was watching the financial crisis unfold I started really learning about how money works and how banking works and how central banking works and really feeling that there needed to be a non-state form of money or a non-governmental money you know back when it was gold that was not something the government could could print or control so we we used to have a monetary system that was not States backed and it's only you know the last hundred years or so that it's been really a government institution and so I really just wanted there to be some kind of free market money Gold didn't work super well for online commerce and if you have some form of digital gold where companies are storing the gold and using you're using you know gold backed cards that can work but then the company's story that gold becomes a central point of failure and a government can go in and shut that down that's exactly what happened with the company called eagled and they got destroyed by the government once they went they to large so I was kind of you know lamenting that phenomenon that there was no no private money really and I didn't know how that would work because any company that succeeded in doing it would just get shut down so then I came across Bitcoin and I learned that it doesn't have a company behind it it doesn't have any central servers it doesn't have any central groups of people in charge of it and it can't be shut down and it was upon that understanding that I really fell in love with it but I'm confused about the connection you're making with the financial crisis because a lot of people looked at the lessons from the financial crisis and felt that this was where the free market got out of control and that actually government regulation was the answer to prevent people from or these large institutions taking advantage of everyday people so why did you have the opposite idea for what the solution would be yeah I mean so that explanation is farcical there hasn't been a free market of any material level in the u.s. in a very long time nearly every single industry is regulated and most importantly the financial industry which is sort of at the center of everything especially money itself is one of the most highly regulated industries in the world this rumor or this myth that finance was unregulated and that's what caused the global financial crisis is is pretty absurd actually certainly the regulators people in the government regulators banks themselves and then many academics and status quo economists they all will be very quick to point out that it was a lack of regulation because they all have a vested interest or Nydia logical reasons who want more regulation and so if people get their information from them I can understand why that rumor would develop and and so just to hear your take on what exactly happened with the financial crisis so you believe the cause was what so first thing to say is that financial systems are very complex there wasn't probably one cause and people like to ascribe a cause the things every time the stock market goes up or down or eclipta prices go up or down people grasping for Zee cause or a cause and I think that betrays a misunderstanding of how complex systems work so there were probably many different causes and ultimately the financial crisis happened based on the individual decisions of millions of people in institutions around the world in a very complicated way that can never be really understood that answer doesn't satisfy a lot of people they want to know what caused it but if you were to ask me what were some of these causes I think the fact that the price of money which is the interest rate is centrally planned by the Federal Reserve by all central banks around the world since this sentence since the price of money was held artificially low in other words below what the market itself would set the price of money as for you know half a decade ever since the calm bubble popped that contributed a lot to it that brought people into borrowing lots of money that they shouldn't have buying houses that they shouldn't or couldn't have afforded that was one of the leading causes of it certainly a bunch of companies doing reckless things was also part of it but they were not unregulated companies they were in the most heavily regulated industry on earth okay and you've also had your own challenges with regulators obviously there was the incident that happened where the SEC charge you with offering an unregistered security and here I'm referencing what happened with Satoshi dice but then of course also ever since then you've also had plenty of successes such as with shape-shifts so when you look kind of at your own journey but then also the way that the Bitcoin space has developed what do you feel are the lessons to be learned in terms of how regulation might effects cryptocurrency or how this means might develop yeah so the sec matter basically they were upset that I did not get their permission to sell shares in my company at the time that company was called Satoshi dice and it was an early casino game built on Bitcoin and I sold shares of it which were dividend shares to anyone who wanted to invest and I did not get the FCC's permission I did not register it with the SEC and when I sold a company a year later even though the investors have made a ton of money from it they were bad that that I hadn't gotten their permission to do so so if I was opposed to regulators before then that really that really did it for me they spent nine months of my life coming after me wasting tons of my resources and of course taxpayer resources so I'm forced to pay taxes to these kind of agencies that they can come after me for doing something that made people money the whole thing was just completely absurd and it really left a bad taste in my mouth ever since then you know crypto has grown and grown very rapidly and fundamentally it removes the power over money from the government and this is one of its one of its primary virtues this is why it's so important it puts the power over finance and the power of value into the hands of individuals as opposed to governments and regulators and as this grows the regulator's of course don't like that and there they are scrambling and trying to figure out what to do about this they can go after companies and try to hurt people to get their compliance but ultimately the fundamental nature of money has changed and I think it'll be important for regulators to realize that you know crypto doesn't remove all control that they have but it certainly removes some of it and I think for good reason oh okay oh interesting oh we will circle back to that later but I find it fascinating that you just said that it doesn't remove all control they have but one other thing I wanted to ask you about was at some point you got Panamanian citizenship what was the reason for that incorrect I lived in Panama for a year but I was never a citizen oh okay okay sorry for spreading fake news but so then you pay taxes on all your crypto here any less yeah the amount of taxes I've had to pay to the u.s. to go build weapons and bomb Brown people in other countries is pretty important and it's something that really bothers me I hate that the work I do and the wealth that I build gets siphoned off to go cause harm to other people I wish that wasn't the case and that's one of the one of the reasons that I'm ideologically interested in this kind of stuff okay yeah I guess for some reason I thought that you had done something similar to rod Revere who obviously pronounced his American citizenship but but I knew that you still retained yours so okay okay I'm going to have the facts now so let's talk about shape shift you're CEO there and as I mentioned early it's a crypto to crypto exchange you guys recently launched a new product prism which enables people to create smart contracts through which they can hold multiple digital assets in a portfolio without holding coins on an exchange you also acquired the hardware wallet kiki last year and you also offer crypto market prices on coin cap io why have you decided on this suite of products what is your overall strategy yeah so shape shift the idea for shape shift was about four years ago and it's meant to be a way for people or robots machines to buy or sell digital assets and that's a very simple simple objectives but we tried to do it with as little friction as possible basically make it as as efficient and as safe as we could for any person or machine to trade one digital asset into another so that's been the core of what I focused on for four years and then in the crypto world there are so many opportunities and things that need to get built sometimes we come across ideas or concepts or designs that mean we think are useful and so if they have any kind of relationship or benefit to the core business of shapeshift we'll often consider doing them so a prism coin cap Kiki or all other projects that we've either built or or acquired and they are tangentially related to the business of exchanging digital assets but they're all a little bit different and then I also heard about this stealth initiative that you've been working called arbiter what is that we have not revealed any details about arbiter but we probably will in the next few months you can right now in the podcast if you like I appreciate the opportunity but Emily who's in charge of our marketing and PR would probably not be happy okay okay I'll have to be satisfied with that um so you used to be a Bitcoin maximalist and now you believe that many digital assets will exist and you wrote this interesting blog post criticizing maximalism it in general I'll just sort of summarize the argument you made which is that you said that none of the crypto assets so far have every feature built in and that's why we have multiple of these but do you feel that your argument was based on the short-term meaning in the long run do you think that we would see cryptocurrencies go the way of you know like multiple European currency is converging into the Euro or the way that you know there's kind of one main global reserve currency which is the US dollar so why do you feel the or do you feel that in the long run we we might see the same pattern for cryptocurrencies yeah great question so first of all I guess I'll define what maximalism is a little bit so maximalism in the crypto world means the belief in one coin essentially dominating everything else and that that there will only be one essentially you know so you can be a Bitcoin maximalist and think that Bitcoin will take over the world and it will be the only kind of digital asset or there are some aetherium Maxim lists I used to be one of these days to be a Bitcoin maximalist and when other other cryptocurrencies started forming I sculpted them a little bit I thought they were a waste of time and a distraction but the more I thought about it the more I realized that but first of all one of the greatest attributes of cryptocurrency is that it operates in this open competitive market where there isn't just one option users and consumers of currency of value can have different alternatives to try and I don't know what's the right answer for everyone so it's nice that there are alternatives and to the more important point really is that a lot of these digital assets are not built to be crypto currencies and they're not really direct competitors of of either Bitcoin or of each other they have different attributes so the most clear example is for example a company that sells shares of its stock so you know securities that are represent equity in that company those can be created as tokens on an assyrian blockchain some people would call those tokens a cryptocurrency because they're they're a crypto digital asset that exists on a blockchain but they have a very specific purpose they represent shares in a company they are not Bitcoin and both of those two things Bitcoin and those shares there's there's good reason for both to exist and you know if you follow that line of thinking you'll end up seeing that there will be many thousands or millions of different digital assets representing all sorts of different kinds of value some are going to be meant as crypto currencies some are going to be equities or other types of securities and some will do all sorts of interesting things that just couldn't have been done in this traditional financial world so I think that this tapestry of different innovation on block chains is is great I don't know how many of these things will exist in the future but I think it'll be more than one and so in that world you know that's the perspective with which I built shape-shift but in that example that you gave of a tokenized security not competing with Bitcoin that's kind of a super obvious example but do you believe that we will see things like litecoin and Manero and sea cash and - all exist alongside Bitcoin yeah good question so those those that you mentioned are all much more trying to just be crypto currencies narrowly you know more narrow and G cash are trying to essentially be much more anonymous and that has some drawbacks so Manero is much much more complicated it's harder to build wallets for there are some problems with using block Explorers which means that customer support is difficult and it's very possible that we end up in a world where you know one kind of cryptocurrency is used for a certain type of activity and others are used for other types of activity maybe things that people need to be really private they use something like the cash for Meniere's or and for everything else they use these Bitcoin or likely similarly litecoin hesitant has properties that are very similar to Bitcoin but a few that make it distinct such as the bloc time being one force or sorry four times as fast it allows you to get confirmations more quickly which means that litecoin works a lot better for smaller payments so maybe that becomes adopted for smaller payments but bitcoin is used for you know buying a house I don't know how the stuff unfolds but it becomes nearly impossible to design a digital asset that's that's perfect or ideal for every use case imaginable so something that's interesting to me as I was reading over a lot of things you've written and at the same time that you seem to believe that multiple digital assets will succeed you've also said that the only two who you seem to say have already really established themselves are Bitcoin and aetherium we said why do you think that there's only two so far and and you know what do you think that says about how we're going to get to this future where there's many that succeed it well so I hold mostly Bitcoin in aetherium and I think those are the safest bet that doesn't mean that those are the only two that has had any success there are probably ten or twenty that have achieved some good degree of success so we'll we'll have to see how that how that plays out and I'm just I'm just one person so someone else might might not like Bitcoin or if they're him at all maybe they're they just use one arrow because it's much more private and that's what they want and so they would say that you know Manero is the one that that was successful this is the beautiful thing about a marketplace different solutions are created and used by different people as opposed to just some kind of central planning one size fits all you know solution that no one's really happy with so we're going to talk about Bitcoin cash fiat currencies and regulation but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsor start engine interested in raising capital through a regulated IC o---- start engine is your

Laura Shin podcast @ gmail.com that's la ura Shi n podcast at gmail.com my guest today is Erik Voorhees the CEO and founder of shape-shift so let's talk about Bitcoin why do you think the narrative around Bitcoin has changed from it being a new payment system to a new form of gold great question so Bitcoin when I got involved it was $5 a coin the blockchain was not nearly full and moving value doing a Bitcoin transaction cost a fraction of a penny so you could move a million dollars from yourself to China for a fraction of a penny or you could buy you know beers for your friends at the bar and it would work equally well for both Bitcoin has grown in usage significantly and so now with the blocks filling up and so many transactions on the network people have to prioritize these transactions to actually get them included and so that leads to a bidding war so people have to pay higher and higher transaction fees in order to get into the block and it's come down recently with the price of decline declining from the highs in December but it's still several dollars you know five to ten dollars for Bitcoin transaction Justin fees so sending money to China if you're sending a million dollars still works great for that but it's but no longer can you use it to to buy beers at the bar so as the fees go up the use case for Bitcoin declines you get fewer and fewer opportunities in which it makes economic sense to actually use it so there is a raging debate in the community of how significant of a problem that is but it's not going to be resolved anytime soon and for those use cases where Bitcoin becomes priced out obviously other crypto assets start taking that spot so if you're going to buy beers at the bar it's much better now to use something like litecoin or aetherium than it would be to use Bitcoin so you've just sort of outlined to all the problems with the shift in this vision you know from Bitcoin being a new payment system to a new form of gold but why do you think despite all the problems that that shift has caused why do you think it's persisted and why do you think that that really is now the prevailing way that people are viewing Bitcoin um you know when Bitcoin was created it had all sorts of use case potential and so you could imagine all sorts of different things that it might become used for over time and people put all that imagination and prediction into their you know bets on the currency in the present people bought Bitcoin in 2011 thinking that someday to become you know the payment system of the world but people also bought Bitcoin realizing that it was in the mutable ledger that no one could tamper with and that you could store value you know safely and relatively easily no one could take it away so while some of the use cases are degrading meaning payments for beers at the bar can't do that anymore other use cases to work great so holding value in Bitcoin or sending large payments to people especially across borders Bitcoin is really awesome for and so you as long as there is enough used case for there to be a demand people will buy it and there's only so much supply so there's always going to be a price it remains to be seen if people start moving to other chains and over time as people just forget about Bitcoin because why do they need to store their value in it if they can just store their value in my coin which also works great for small transactions that's that's unknown so you were on the side that supported the Segway 2x Hart fork which failed as listeners of um podcast should know if you haven't listened to those episodes about that I recommend the one with Nathaniel popper which was sort of our post-mortem on that effort and the fact that it eventually was not able to succeed so Eric do you think it was a mistake for your side to back down well to set the record straight segment to X failed in the 2x hard fork part that succeeded in activating segments so the goal of that project was for both of those things to get seg would activated and to do a hard work to a two megabyte block is that half of it was successful in the grade and I'm sad that the other half was not but it was a mixed bag I don't I mean when you asked was it a mistake to stand down I don't I don't know I I think it was clear that there was not enough consensus in the community to do the hard fork there are a lot of reasons for that some valid some not but there was not you know a there's not a confluence of support needed to make that drastic change whether that's a mistake or not I think we'll only know in time you know three years for now maybe we can look back and say yep that was the one opportunity Bitcoin had to actually increase its block size and that's totally killed it since then or maybe we'll look back and say it's really good that we didn't increase that block size at that fork it was totally unnecessary and the community made the right decision I think we are only going to know that in gente so right now I totally get that you don't know but I'm sure you must have some sort of opinion on you know what you think the prospects are for Bitcoin now that the fees are so high and some of these use cases have been priced out so what is your feeling about the prospects for Bitcoin so let's ignore the last few weeks because fees have come down remarkably significantly both because of the price decline itself and also just number of transactions with my network is falling but the longer-term trend is that fees have been getting higher and higher and higher and at the at the worst point you know in December fees were 50 to $100 per transaction and that was for an average one and depending on the type of transaction you were doing this gets a little technical but depending on how many inputs were being formed in your transaction that we're sending out a transaction could literally cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars so for many companies that actually use this technology that started to become absolutely nuts I think in December shape-shifts my company paid close to two million dollars in Bitcoin transaction fees and that was compared to what previously like I have no sense of that you know how high that is compared to what you've been paying before well so a year prior we probably paid $8,000 okay all right so so the or another way to think about is you know transactions in a period of time in which transaction double the fees might go up by 100x so it just becomes insane and then if you know transaction quantity doubles again you know fees could have gone to $20,000 because if there's only so many transactions that can go into a block the person who's trying to send a million dollars to China might be willing to spend $20,000 on the fee and you know we we as a company have to be moving Bitcoin around between our wallets and to and from customers and so the fees just got really nuts I mean it got to the point where we couldn't allow customers to send us orders that were less than 250 dollars because if a customer does a $250 order from Bitcoin into aetherium and they pay $50 and see they're already going to be pissed off and they don't really understand why that even happens and then if there's some problem with the order we're going to have to spend $50 to send it back to them so now $100 has been lost from the 250 that was trying to be sent so that's the kind of like actual practical problem that ends up happening when these scenes get too high and it's it's serious I I worry that people that aren't running businesses with actual customers they don't see and feel how urgent of a problem this is and certainly now that fees have gone back down for the last month I think the conversation was going to die off until this problem roars back again and so it's an issue just that ii went adoption hasn't been fast enough to manage the increased volume or is it that even if we had full segment adoption we wouldn't we would still have too many transactions on the network and so therefore you know a higher limit would a block size limit would would alleviate that yes so seglet is is great and it helps and the more adoption it gets the better it will be but it's not a panacea and it doesn't solve the problem it simply allows there to be more space or more transactions happening which drops the fees down significantly but even if segment adoption was complete that simply moves the problem back by let's say a year so a year later you have the same number of the same fee level because more people have arrived and you end up at the same problem so doing things to reduce fees while the layer Q technology gets built which is Lightning Network and other solutions like that that's the long-term solution for sure and most people agree on that but we're not there yet and so what the actual industry and actual customers do during those years where we don't have the layer two ready becomes really important and it's a consideration I think that some people that are you know either academics or on the engineering side just don't appreciate because they don't see it well one thing that I've been wondering about the Lightning Network is I feel like there's only certain types of transactions and probably low value transactions where you'll want to put up the money to when your channel right because you like basically tie up that money while the channel is open so I just feel like there's something there's a little bit of a psychological barrier there right so is that really gonna be as big of a solution as everybody thinks I don't know and that's that's part of the problem I mean lightning will certainly help a lot and it might solve all or most of these scaling problems but even if it solves everything it's not gonna the solution won't be here for a while and what do we do in the interim and the big risk the big gamble is if something is not handled in the interim that alleviates this problem it is possible I'm not saying this will happen but it's certainly possible that some other cryptocurrency takes off because it was there and it was ready to take on the world's demand when the world had the demand Bitcoin can't you know if Bitcoin can't grow when the world needs it's here the world is going to move to is something else some other chain that solves its problems so obviously there's now Bitcoin cash which its proponents say you know means that Bitcoin cash really is the answer because it is a megabyte blocks the fees are low what do you think of Bitcoin cash so on one hand I hate that a lot of Bitcoin cash supporters are trying to call it Bitcoin it's just a I think a really sneaky and illegitimate way of changing the language Bitcoin cash is it's an own blockchain now that derived from Bitcoin it will rise or fall on the merits of that blockchain and certainly it does have more capacity than the traditional Bitcoin does but it also has far less hash power or far less adoption for far less brand recognition and a totally different developer team so I think you know personally I don't own much of it but I definitely see why a lot of the industry is moving toward it bid pay is trying to move you know at all of its payments over to Bitcoin cash most of the major exchanges have adopted Bitcoin cash and I think any any company in the industry that has actually felt these pains of looks pretty longingly at the clink ashes maybe that that's what they should start using and so even if it's a one or five or ten percent chance that the industry moves over to Bitcoin cash instead of the Queen that's a huge gamble to take for those who who have not been willing to raise the Bitcoin block size and and when they often make these arguments that they can't raise it because there are risks they seem to be ignoring the risks of not raising the risks that Bitcoin becomes a stagnant chain that lost its first mover advantage that would be a huge tragedy and I think people don't take it seriously enough so let's move back to regulation which we talked about a little bit at the beginning obviously that is something that's hugely in the news right now as I mentioned earlier today we had that Banking Committee hearing so I just want to get your take on where you think regulation is going to go and how that's gonna affect the space yeah it's a big question so first there isn't just one monolithic set of regulation each jurisdiction each country is different and then within the country different regulators will do things differently so it's again a complex situation in which some regulators in some places may be clamping down and other regulators in other places may be opening up and this can all be happening at the same time generally regulators job is to regulate so like the hammer that sees everything as a nail a regulator is going to try to put an impose rules on everyone that's that's their job that's what they do that's all they understand so on one hand everyone should expect that a regulator is gonna regulate on the other hand people should realize that often that just totally destroys technology it destroys the ability for people to innovate and as someone who's tried to build companies in this ecosystem the amount of time money energy brainpower and sanity that is spent trying to navigate and deal with regulations is is mind-blowing and I can only imagine where the industry would be if all those resources weren't sucked away to pay for lawyers to tell us what to do and what not to do with what is maybe okay in this place and not in this place and no now that's change because some meeting was had by a bunch of regulators in some city it's horrible for anyone who's trying to build things and has run into this stuff you can sympathize with the fact that regulation even if some of the results are good for some people sometimes has its immense cost on the industry and it's a cost that's largely unseen by the by the public I personally think that the only thing that needs to be regulated is fraud and theft which are illegal so fraud is always illegal theft is always illegal as long as you're not stealing from people or lying to people you should really be left alone and consenting adults should be free to do whatever they want with each other as long as they're not defrauding or stealing or harming each other um well like they've been doing because if I think about the a lot of the SEC actions you know just for much of your answer it sounded like you were sort of assuming that everybody was a good actor in this piece but obviously as we've seen you know with things like I would never assume that okay so so I mean for some of the actions that we have seen don't you think that the net-net of it has been positive with things like the Kinect and you know there are people that have lost money to fraudsters in the space right totally and if the SEC goes after fraudsters I will praise them all day long that's what they should do they should go find people who are harming other people and to go prosecute them that's great I don't think anyone has a problem with that what I have a problem with is when they go after peaceful consenting adults who haven't harmed anyone and steal their money ruin their lives and destroy their businesses that's what I have a problem with so it's something um like I always find that your views here around kind of crypto and the effect it might have on governments is pretty interesting you've said before that you believe people will finally realize that crypto competes with fiat you've also said that the struggle of crypto against Viet will be the biggest and most important struggle in our lifetimes and that's what we'll tell our grandchildren about so how do you think that's gonna play out yeah so I always like to use this phrase the separation of money and state and I use that phrase because as schoolchildren most people grow up learning about something that happened a few hundred years ago which is sort of a philosophical and political movement of separating church and state and everyone learns why that was so important and they see a history in which church and state were tied together in which they were the same thing as something that was primitive barbaric dangerous harmful and ultimately unjust most people celebrate that those two things have been separated and yet an institution even more important than religion money itself for some reason is all intertwined with the state the state creates it the state controls it the state oversees everything about it makes every rule about it money itself is printed with symbols of the government and it comes from the government for the benefit of the government this is something that in hindsight the world will look back on and think also was a Dark Age was barbaric and ultimately was unjust and and I think cryptocurrency is the biggest promise they have is in separating the power and control of money which is perhaps one of the most important institutions in the world separating that from the state and so how will that happen exactly like is it that after some period there will be more and more people transacting in crypto and evading taxes and then the government won't have as much money or really how does this happen yes the main way it happens has nothing or little to do it with taxation actually and everything to do with currency debasement so fiat currency is a scam and the greatest scam ever peper perpetrated on mankind because the small group of people created out of thin air and use it for their own benefit mainly governments and banks and they get to use it before general price levels rise as that money flows through the system price levels around the economy rise and everyone else has made poorer this is why the the price of things Rises every year because the money is being debased with crypto you can't debase it there's only so many bitcoins there's only so many like coins and people know exactly how much of it exists so if these technologies actually gained adoption and the world at the margin starts moving to cryptocurrencies at some point the government starts losing the ability to print money so you can imagine a world in which 90% of transactions and wealth are stored in crypto assets the central bank can't just create money out of thin air and give it to the to the other banks that is the most powerful effect that cryptocurrency will have and it's not going to happen overnight it'll take ten or twenty or thirty years to really roll out but I think it is inevitable I think people will not willingly choose to hold their their life savings in a currency in a virtual currency that can be created out of thin air by a bunch of bankers that's what they're doing now and that's what they're used to doing that's what their grandparents did but it's not something that their grandchildren will do do you think that this will cause governments to go down or do you think that governments will still exist just by losing this power governments will still exist most people seem to want governments of some form or another so cryptocurrency is not going to make governments disappear but if the ability to print and debase currency is removed from governments they will lose part of the way that they fund themselves which means that they'll have to shrink so governments fund themselves in three ways they tax money they they borrow money which just means getting taxes later and they print it and if you remove the ability to print money then they're left only with those other two so that means the government would have to fund itself entirely on tax revenue or borrowed the broad revenues through the bond market so that simply means a smaller government now I don't know if that means one percent smaller or ninety percent smaller but it's probably something significant and what about the introduction of Fiat cryptocurrencies which could happen do you think that those might like everyday people might be more comfortable adopting those and that if so then that would pose a threat to the different crypto assets and cause sufficient have competition to them that they actually won't end up disrupting the system and and we won't see you you know this disruption that you just outlined of governments yeah good question so fiat means value by decree so fiat currency is this currency that has value simply because some government says it does people often ask this question about fiat currencies on the blockchain or cryptocurrencies that are backed by a government I'm sure that some governments will try this but what you will end up with is the cryptocurrency that can be controlled by the government and it can be created out of thin air and that's going to look a hell of a lot like the virtual currency we already have which is dollars the government is not going to create a digital currency that can't block or control or print so I think in that context it's highly unlikely that people will choose to hold the cryptocurrency that gets to based and can be controlled and stolen from you a twin versus one the can and so just to go back to something that I flagged at the very beginning of the episode when you said that you actually didn't think that crypto assets we're gonna fully take control away from governments even though you think it will take away this power to this financial power that governments will still remain because they will have some other power in the form of people simply wanting to be governed is that why you said that yeah I mean as long as the government can tax money from people and borrow money they can exist a certain size and most people want some form of government so crypto doesn't prevent half from happening it just means that a government has to invest more honestly it has to exist through taxing or borrowing only as opposed to creating money out of thin air which most people don't really realize is going on something else that I've been wondering about have you been that book sapiens by Noah you've all her re yeah that was a great book so something that is interesting to me yeah it was a great book by the way listeners if you haven't read it I definitely recommend you Rita and of all Rafa Khan often talks about this book so one of the theories that he outlines in that book that was interesting to me is he talked about how one of the drivers of a lot of the economic growth we've seen over the last few centuries I don't remember the timeline has been credit but how does credit work exactly in a crypto based economy yeah so credit in a crypto economy would work very similar to how credit worked in a pre fiat economy which is to say how credit works through most of human history so I like to use the 1800s in the US as an example where the monetary system was based on gold that is or silver people use precious metals as therefore most money there were banks that would loan people money so credit totally this is the most successful century of the United States when it rose from you know essentially an agrarian wasteland to one of the most powerful industrial nations on earth all happened under a system in which the government did not create money out of thin air I think people should not be scared that a lot of the things that they want and used in the normal financial world like credit most importantly exist in the crypto world it just has to be done more honestly you can't just create it out of thin air or or if you do the block scenes can be viewed so that people can see what's happening um the the idea that money should just be you know some obscure controls held by certain privileged people seems really backwards to me and some functions of such a currency is removing this and do you think that fractional reserve banking is something that will be possible in a crypto based economy or is it necessary or not so there's nothing fundamentally wrong with fractional reserve banking as long as everyone's having banking relationships understanding what's going on is just after that question of fraud if you set up a organization and you're willing to lend money to people and those people know that or if you're taking deposits from people and most people know that you're lending some of that out and you don't have all the deposits on at the same time as long as everyone knows that's going on people can make their own decisions about whether they want to take on that risk or not so yeah you can you can have fractional reserve in a crypto world but it's going to be more predatory and coming back to government some other thing that I have been wondering about just with your talk about about power and and governments and stuff do you think that block chains could become some form of government that's a very abstract question certainly a lot of things that people want governments to do can be done perhaps better or in a more transparent or democratized way with block chains voting is a great example land registration is a great example but whether a blockchain itself can be a government that gets a little bit sci-fi because I don't know quite what that would look like okay well I maybe I should as a side yet to take up sci-fi because it was something that I thought maybe maybe long after our grandchildren are dead we will see that happen well is there anything else else that's been top of mind for you these days as you like a cryptid going forward I mean I think top of mind right now has just been a crazy year of 2017 the price and all this phenomenon of token sales which is really incredible and certainly you know the last few weeks and the crypto markets have been pretty pretty dismal but I think a lot of us expected this I mean you don't you don't get a hundred X gross without some serious pull backs so it's normal and healthy but yeah 2017 was a wild year certainly cryptos best year ever every major financial institution in the world is now taking the stuff pretty seriously every government in the world is taking it seriously and no longer when you bring it up do people just laugh at you and dismiss that they they ask about it either a superficial question about the price or how they buy some or they ask a more interesting and important question about what it is what it means and why it's here so that's been really exciting to see that this is the kind of thing that I hoped would end up happening when I got involved in 2011 well it's been so fantastic having you on as a guest where can people get in touch with you or see your work probably Twitter
