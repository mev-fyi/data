hey everyone just a quick note before we begin first while we typically release shorter interviews on Fridays this one with Martin shkweli was so fascinating it ended up being an hour second it's only after he and I wrapped that we learned that Sam bankman freed had been released on bail which is why we don't discuss that news in the episode otherwise enjoy this Illuminating interview with Martin shkweli hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The cryptopians I started covering crypto seven years ago and as a senior editor

description today's guest is Martin shkelly entrepreneur and investor welcome Martin hey thanks for having me you're a former hedge fund manager and pharmaceutical executive and you are also one of the most famous white collar criminals of recent times you are convicted of Securities fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison and after being released earlier in this year you took not only an interest in crypto but it also seems the case of FTX and as we speak former CEO Sam Pinkman freed is in the process of being extradited from the Bahamas to the US and two of his associates Caroline Ellison the former Alameda CEO and Gary Wang ftx's CTO have pleaded guilty to fraud given your experience with the justice system as a white-collar criminal which is pretty much the situation all of these people are facing I was wondering what do you think is going through Sam's head right now sure I have a lot to say about this I just wanted to start by saying though that you know I while I I respect the the legal outcome in my case I was found guilty at trial I um certainly went to trial as a not guilty plea I was found not guilty of several of my charges I was found guilty of three not guilty of five I still maintain my innocence so I uh certainly respect the courts I I am technically a convicted felon and a white collar criminal but I still dispute those charges and and still uh Proclaim my innocence just so you just to air that out for a second Sam's going through a lot this is the hardest the people I've talked to this is the the hardest uh thing you'll ever have to go through in life it's uh extremely difficult emotionally to know that your life is in the hands of one person and that person is in this case uh judge Ronnie Abrams uh Sam's uh judge and what you learn as a criminal defendant in that state of uncertainty is that you have very very little control over the things you're going to be doing over the next several years throughout the the process of the system but quite possibly after that as well as you serve yourself but the next it's funny because you think the the long sentence is the hard part honestly I think that was the easy part for me and and I could say being in a similar situation to Sam's sort of you know it's it's much easier than the trial prosecution part which is really really harrowing it's really difficult it's fraught with a lot of emotional baggage and difficulty you feel frustrated you feel angry you feel in denial you have to go through acceptance you have to go through a little bit of grief um you know it's it's really it hit me the hardest when I saw my mother in and this is It's funny like you don't process it until certain moments and for me the moment was seeing my mother in the galley I guess it's called when my sentence was given and I said Gee I really messed up and I didn't think about it uh that way until that moment uh interestingly I'm still defying it still sort of I'm innocent I'm a political prisoner this is you know really crazy what they're doing to me and then I saw my mother who's you know uh you know old and you know won't be around forever and I said I just took you know years away of good potentially good memories from this person and I think when Sam thinks about that for his family his friends that he potentially may never see them again in some cases uh at least outside of a prison visiting center you know this is a really you know that's not going to Dawn on him just yet I don't think but eventually when that daunts him it's it's so crushing and difficult and again for me it's a seven year sentence which isn't the largest amount of time in the federal system but you know for Sam who's looking at the undoubtedly more even in a very best case scenario you know I think um it's it's going to be very difficult for yeah and I love what you said about you know kind of some of the later stages of the process but let's talk a little bit about just this moment so he's arrived in New York and I don't know if you think he'll be let out on bail or whether he'll be held in jail or what do you think is going to happen at this moment I would think he has no chance at Bill almost no chance the the best he could do right now is to cooperate fully and I I think that given the odds against him given his judge um you know the best he could hope for is to cooperate fully I still don't think they'd give him bail in that circumstance it's so hard to get bail when you're the head of the indictment when you're somebody important when you have a lot of money and when you've had extensive international travel and ties he's had that I I certainly didn't um I barely left the country I would go on business every now and then but Sam's a world traveler you know he's somebody who's spent a lot of time in the in Hong Kong a lot of time in Bahamas he's somebody who has talked about you know sort of the us being not the most favorable place for for business and things like that and so it sort of shows you that between his massive crime or alleged massive crime I want to be clear that I have no opinion on whether Sam's innocent or guilty and nobody really should be frank because we don't have evidence we don't have the discovery we don't have the so-called Brady material Jinx material material the the courts uh or the prosecution has to give this is exculpatory material and it can be very very valuable in one's defense remember a defense to a lot of these charges is things like scienter what was his state of mind you know he's protested many times that his State of Mind was not one of criminal that is often enough to win that that's certainly how I won five charges it's not enough to beat the whole case um Security fraud for example is very easy to prove and very very hard to uh defend against even if your mind state was in a good one you can often still be found guilty of Securities fraud just because of the sort of Prima fassay on its face lie that you may have told uh or Mis or Omission or something like that it's quite easy for a jury to say well gee these investors should have known that you were you know doing this with them or their money or something like that and from what we can see it certainly looks like it won't be hard to prosecute and I think that brings me to one point I would add which is that nobody goes to trial uh nobody in the right mind because the conviction rate is is in the very high 90s which is very similar to Russia it's very similar to China it's very similar to countries where the criminal justice system is sort of a farcical and in the United States we're certainly taught that that well if you're innocent you'll be found in a set of trial and you have a jury of your peers and so forth the reality is quite a bit different the government almost never loses and that's not because the government does everything right I think if you look at other parts of government you know that nobody's 99 right and I think it's often because uh for example we'll talk about Ronnie Abrams the judge for Sam who I actually think is a really good pick for him judge Abrams was a prosecutor almost every federal judge was a prosecutor they don't see things through defendant's light every criminal that's brought before them is basically a criminal in their eyes before they're found guilty um and it's routined to them every day they have a criminal in their Court alleged criminal a defendant and every day they sentence them and find them guilty it's almost never a case that a jury says you're you're home free especially in the federal system so Sam is looking at extremely unlikely odds and especially the fact that he's Cooperators mountains of evidence his best bet in my opinion is plead guilty try to get 20 years something like that and hope that you're unprecedented cooperation will give you some kind of you know some kind of uh favor from from prosecutors of the judge that's I think your best bet well all right I just want to ask a couple other questions about um the jail situation since you said he probably won't be released on bail because I'm sure you heard a lot was made about the conditions at Fox Hill and I was curious what you thought the conditions would be that he could expect in jail here in New York yeah so I know a lot about the jails here oh my uh was in um see Brooklyn for nine months I certainly know a lot about MCC which is Manhattan those are his two options and I think he'll be okay Metropolitan Detention Center yeah MTC is worse but nine months it's uh the the guards have a t-shirt that's like an exclusive t-shirt I want one it's uh it has uh it's MDC Brooklyn Room with a View and it's actually true it has a beautiful view of man and Statue of Liberty and so forth and Room with a View is uh not the way I think the inmates think about it but it's um you know you can jockey for position to get the nice room with the view but uh rarely do you do you get it so MDC MCC they're both very livable places no prison is nice right whether it's in the Palmas or New York or whatever MCC is considered by inmates to be inferior to MDC MDC is a little more modern it's a little more polished MCC is a little bit more rodent infested dirty you know pretty dingy kind of place neither places the Four Seasons but you know if uh it sort of reminds me a bit of like a college dorm you know it's a college dorm room with not you know not very comfortable it's very small but I've seen NYU dorm rooms about the same size so you know ultimately it's uh it's not that you know horrible I think that MDC can actually be kind of fun it's a bit of a raucous environment um he's a celebrity people uh I'm assuming he's gonna have similar treatment to myself people are going to be coming up to him oh hi you're the guy from from your post aren't you that rich guy and you know they're gonna he's gonna hopefully if he knows what he's doing I'm writing a little memo like 10 tips for Sam if he were smart he would try to Regale these guys with stories and things like that and all of his peers will sort of think about kind of maybe not looking up to him but certainly not you know antagonizing him and I think many people will want to hear his stories about his interactions with celebrities and things like that so I think he'll be okay in the jail environment the prison environment is quite a bit different and I want to differentiate between MDC is not prison it's it's a Holding Center it is high security a maximum security in fact so you will have killers there you will have MS-13 a very notorious probably the most feared people you would want to interact with uh in or most fear people you could interact with in prison or in jail General and he Sam's in a very unique situation we could talk all about in a second but it in MDC generally he'll be treated I think like a celebrity he has to be careful and respectful of other inmates there are going to be some people there that don't care about his money they're going to be people there who will try to intentionally kind of you know give him an earful in general jail is a little less violent than people think or watch on TV or things like that I certainly seen my fair share of stabbings and things like that in MDC it can be a pretty crazy place but his safety is almost certainly going to be fine in MDC as long as he doesn't do something stupid the food is bad um it is pretty much I'm not a foodie so I kind of survived jail by I I'm not a picky eater anyway but jail can be uh definitely one of the worst culinary experiences of your life it's uh you know very very difficult to to eat uh three Square meals in prison they're not very nutritious visiting is very limited MDC um you can see your family once a week for an hour roughly um you can see your lawyers throughout the day which is good uh there are a lot of Pat Downs every time you see a lawyer you have a full full cavity body surge which is not pleasant the other inmates like I said that they're mostly going to be very curious you know they're gonna They're Not Gonna Wanna beat them up or something you know they're going to be like oh wow maybe because you know jail is boring and you all you have is your your peers and you sort of get tired of telling more stories and here's this new guy that comes in he's probably got a lot of more stories if he's willing to share them now if he takes up this attitude where he's like high in my knee or he's climbing up or you know he's like well I don't want to talk about my case or something like that that's not going to be good he's going to be considered sort of a jerk you know but I could see him holding court at a table at MDC on say the fifth floor uh there's only so many rooms and I'll have a little bit of a reputation and stuff like that and certain gangs kind of you know congregate in some places and things like that it's a there's a system that he's going to have to learn you know he's gonna have to find sort of a click which is which might be difficult because there is a lot of racial segregation he's a white guy he's a Jewish guy I have to say there's a lot of anti-Semitism in prison I've seen that uh firsthand there's usually a weird I I had to put it this way but stereotype of white prisoners uh one of them is that many of them are sex offenders which is uh just statistically true and so one of the issues with Sam is he's going to have to prove that he's not a sex offender now Sam is also very famous so it won't take long for him to be able to sort of point to say and say like don't you know who I am you know so forth and so forth but again he has to be careful it means can be very sensitive about especially with respect to things like power or respect or notoriety or things like that the one thing he has going for him which is extremely interesting is that he's facing the life sentence uh many other prisoners are not so my my advice to Sam is if he gets into a bit of a tiff one of the things he can throw out there that will will win the respect of his fellow prisoners is I'm facing life I'm not facing what you're facing you're probably facing five years or ten years I'm looking at you know you can even use hyperbole here but it's true they could calculate his guideline sentence as a hundred years or 200 years or 300 years and he could throw that out there and you know that will turn a lot of even the most thoroughly prisoner Stone Face when when you say something like that they will realize that maybe he's right you know and I think that that is the one thing in that prison environment for now that he kind of does have going for him is that he is kind of a financial gangster you know and that's sort of something that the other prisoners will respect and realize they're they're going to read and say oh you have you messed around with billions of dollars I sold heroin or fentanyl for hundreds of thousands maybe low millions of dollars you're the real gangster you've you're doubting billions wow what was that like you know so there will be like heads of gangs or Regional heads of gangs uh at the different famous gangs that will want to talk to him and want to respect him and maybe even want to do business with them believe it or not I sort of got some of that in prison uh where guys would say hey do you know anything about the the nightclub business or the strip club business do you would you want to do that with me I certainly walk them through why you know I stick to pharmaceutical investing but um you know so it's a really interesting environment it doesn't have to be all scary um I do think the tides do change when you go to prison which is a more permanent confinement but NBC can kind of have like a party like atmosphere it's very sort of odd everyone's trying to help each other get through this tough time by not having fights and drama but by playing cards and telling jokes and you know that kind of stuff you know you can find a fight if you're looking for it no doubt but uh the uh you know you you generally if you you know I think Sam's smart enough to to sort of de-escalate if he gets into a tough situation or something like that well this is such an interesting picture two really small questions but I was so curious Sam is a vegan and you talked about the food do they respect those kinds of dietary preferences they do especially in prisons each prison is different every single prison is a different personality Sam's biggest problem is he's if he gets convicted at least with my rough estimate is he's probably looking at a very long sentence and I went to a so-called low security prison there are four security levels there's the camp system which is what they call Club Fed sometimes it's extremely nice relative to the other three uh I went to a low which is the second least difficult yeah yeah I I my mind isn't a Conjuring the idea of least difficulty in prison but the yes exactly it's the second best option and um you know the low system for me was was fairly livable and fairly decent it's usually for people who are looking at something like 10 years on average and you live with other people who are doing 10 years so like you all don't want to like commit more crime and like you know hurt each other because it's gonna create you know you're gonna go home later you're gonna every time you get into a fight they take like a month off your good time so you don't want to get into fights every time you have a Contraband cell phone they take two or three months every time you have your call the cigarette they take a week or something so like you don't want any of these violations so you try to more or less be in your best paper the medium and the the penitentiary are really tough those are the places where the bad things happen those are the places where you can get murdered you can get raped you can um get into really tough situations I've had many friends describe to me for instance what Ross albrook is going through um from the jail system um these are prisons that are run almost entirely by gang-based systems there is no white collar gang I joke that at the low system I was in that I was ahead of the white dollar Criminal Division each City like Baltimore New York has sort of a chief and we call that Chief the shot caller and the shot caller says what the other people in that we call them cars but in that click in essence or that group what that car would do and if you want to be in the car which is the benefits of the Car Protection you know during a group friendship uh maybe even a little criminal networking um and things like that and uh again I wouldn't understand how important that is for some people who are in their narcotics trafficking trade or something like that you do want to meet people that or do like to do what you do and it doesn't hurt and again I I famously turned a lot of prisoners on to crypto uh while I was in Allenwood FCI Alvin wood we even had a meeting group called crypto fogs which was very tongue-in-cheek and we met every virtually every day to discuss crypto in a new Avenue in the software World for for Success that didn't involve crying so I think a lot of people are going to be really curious about that with Sam he's going to have unending questions about investing investors Etc so food Kim sorry this is a really long answer I I totally discuss it then I'm sorry the food part of this is is my prison the low respected it I don't know if a pen will respect it or not um the federal system has rules coming from the federal government uh you can ask for an I think you call them like a no-flesh tray or no meat tray and generally they do have something they often have tofu which is I don't recommend but in general there's a lot of fruits and vegetables it's it's um you know nobody's gonna sit there and prepare them a special vegan meal but they will like truck alternative option on the tray I mean it literally is like this you know and it's the slop that they give you is not very fun to eat on Christmas and holidays and things like that yeah they actually prepare a halfway decent meal but you know in general if you're used to eating well and you like to eat well you know jail isn't the place to go and earlier when you were talking about the different levels do you think Sam will end up in medium or Penitentiary is that what you were implying I mean that's the problem so is that if he were going to do time and low like I did a he'd be fine and I could even send him a care package um it's very funny how the jail network works like it's it's not hard to sort of make a call and say hey I have a guy named Sam he's coming there in a few months uh make sure you take care of him and the day he gets there these again prisoners we have nothing to do so the day he gets there he'll have like an entire toiletries of like all the stuff that you normally would have to accrue over a week or two you know they'd all be waiting for a fresh pair of sweatpants which is you know very valuable and you know all this stuff that you know again you would take for granted but you know wearing the jail issued boxer shorts uh which are yeah um they might have cost 10 cents to make uh versus you know the commissary sweatpants that are 20 bucks you know you you're thankful for something like that and and again you know we I could easily have that ready for him uh you know or any other inmate friend uh I'm not Sam's friend so I won't be giving him a care package but the uh you know the most important thing you need is is not the little care package but the hey take care of this guy make sure nobody messes with this guy and I'm albanian-american uh albanians have uh quite a presence of the US person system and so does every like every prison has like a little group and so uh for example if I were so so inclined it wouldn't be hard for me to say call an Albanian friend and say listen when when Sam shows up just make sure nobody messes around with him because a lot of people are going to want to mess with them can you take them onto your wing and kind of you know maybe not offer him your fullest protection but kind of give him a little bit of uh schooling and how all this works and you any Bloods or Crips or any other gang could do that very easily and and certainly I made enough relationships with folks like that that you know it's it's not hard now conversely unfortunately when people say snitch or become an informant the opposite message often gets sent hey there's this guy named Sam coming to this place say USP Marion or USP bolmont or you know these are terrible terrible penitentiaries USB Beaumont for instance it's called bloody Beaumont because the percentage of prisoners who get killed in there is significant which is an unbelievable flawed right but you can send a message to Beaumont and says hey when Sam gets there you know I want you to to you know uh send him a message or something like that you know and and those kinds of things happen every day I'm not the kind of person that does things like that obviously I'm not you know a deeply hardened criminal but in that world of Narcotics and violence and stuff like that it's it's rather typical for someone to say even in a coded message I heard one gang would use this code where they would say Hey My My friend John is coming to MDC make sure you introduce him to my friend biggie that's a coded message to kill him because Biggie Smalls is a rapper Who's dead and so introduce him to Biggie means introduce him to Me Biggie Smalls uh in heaven and um you know so again you can send these coded messages and people will wait be waiting for you uh whatever person you go to you really it's a it's a confined system of only about 100 prisons in America so wherever you go your reputation will precede you you know what you did that's your last prison will follow you all kinds of stuff like that so if you lost money in a gambling tournament in a prison in New Jersey and then you stiff everyone and you go to prison in Philly someone's gonna beat you Philly which is kind of crazy because you know it's a really small close-knit system there's about 150 000 federal prisoners and As Trump once said it's the worst of the worst um there's three million American prisoners across the federal and County system I'm sorry the state and County system but the federal system is reserved for sort of Interstate you know uh jurisdictions um and you know very high crimes which this is allegedly one well I have so many questions first question is when people send messages to other prisons or jails how are they doing that it's a mix of ways so um the first way is contraband cell phone well that's not always available every prison is different there's prisons that are very porous where a cell phone can be bought for a hundred dollars there's persons where I was offered fourteen thousand dollars for a cell phone uh to purchase a cell phone which I denied uh Because unless the cell phone's made of gold I I didn't think that was a good deal so every prison is different depends on the guards and the looseness and the the traffic that goes on in that prison so barring a Contraband cell phone there is our Core Links email system again it's monitored it's recorded sometimes not monitored so great it's sometimes over monitored I've gotten in trouble many times from sending very innocuous emails in the core link system I think it's sometimes guards in prison I mean as you can imagine guards will pick on you sometimes sometimes they'll be nice I had a guard give me Dunkin Donuts uh which is completely against the rules but they would do that because they were really nice and I never paid them or anything um and so there are a lot of ways to get messages across sometimes you'll have a friend transferring to another prison you'll say hey when you go there go find my friend C and tell C this or that um you can also have messages sent from your friends on the family on the outside you sort of tell them hey you know you know my friend John he's doing time over there can you call John's family and tell him when they visit him and they see them face to face that's a really good way to send messages face-to-face visits are fairly confidential so you know there's a lot of um you know ways to send messages it's not easy and you have to be smart but again Sam's not a career criminal he's not a criminal in most senses of the word in many white-collar people find themselves in the situation where you know you're a fish out of water other folks who are schooled in the streets in the in the drug trafficking business or gamis it's sometimes called when I've seen some of these guys go to jail and it's like a family reunion someone will come in off the bus and they'll say just give you 10 years it's uh you know you would never you know Sam's not gonna that's not gonna happen to Sam you know having said that you know there are people in the crypto space in prison um there is uh one guy in particular I'm thinking of well I won't get into too many details but you have to be pretty confidential uh in this world but you know there's there's certainly people that are being looked after by friends uh in in the crypto space that won't have any trouble because there seemed to be nice people and liked by an entire Community they've never done wrong by anybody wait I'm sorry you just said in the crypto space so like there's career criminals in crypto who are in jails who they'll look after look after each other there are crypto convicts in prison right now some very very well known who are early in many blockchains or other people who are Maybe did do something wrong per se but they they are not necessarily disliked by anybody uh Charlie Schram comes to mind Charlie hired the same attorney as as I did um he did a year and a day in prison which is the lightest sentence you can get basically and they're generally people that haven't been sort of really faced with with uh sort of a widespread hatred some of those people um have people looking out for them you know and that they have people that are helping them out through this process Sam is unfortunately somebody that's probably pissed off at a lot of people and I don't think he's going to have a ton of people that are going to be too friendly to him he may make some friends just on harm I hope that he doesn't get sort of you know seen as somebody that can be extorted basically you know you know there's some presumption that he's got a lot of money or his parents have a lot of money or something like that and it's not uncommon for somebody to sort of it certainly didn't happen to me but you know again I I come from the Albanian Community which is a very rough and tumble place I come from the sort of uh streets of Brooklyn and a very sort of modest neighborhood I have some credibility Sam's gonna probably be accosted by people who want money from him and it wouldn't be crazy to see somebody go up to Sam and say listen you have two days to get me a thousand dollars or something like that and if you don't do it I'm gonna you know do something to you and that's going to be something that can be very very difficult again Sam's also kind of I have a lot of problems sort of with you know again in my advice list Sam's General and I hope this doesn't sound like sexist or like not you know not very normative or PC but Sam isn't exactly gonna be somebody that fits into prison you know my advice for him includes shaving his head my advice for him includes uh deepening his voice he speaks in a sort of and again I I would normally not judge somebody this way unless the context of prison which is a very testosterone-filled masculine place it's very difficult um there are plenty of prisoners who are trans who get by just fine in prison I defended one trans prisoner and vouch for them in many ways and helped uh not protect them so to speak but but sort of vouch for them as somebody that should be accepted Sam is going to have a lot of issues because he's a bit of an infeminate Guy and um his his sort of demeanor um some people say autistic sort of sense uh or sensibility is not something that goes over well in prison people sort of expect you to be direct they expect you to be very assertive if you're not it's seen as weak you know you have to be quick on the on on the uptake with sort of um responses you know if you know people get the sense that they can pick on you they will pick on you and you know it's going to be very hard for him to sort of adjust to that sort of Lifestyle he also doesn't know anything about the streets and sort of criminal culture which my advice to him is just pick those things up as quickly as he can he should be listening to as much rap music as possible he should be trying to learn everything there is to know about gangs about the tough neighborhoods in every major city this sounds funny but this could save your life you know I I my suggestion to him is that he rebrands himself quite a bit in fact he probably should no longer say that he's from Stanford or something like that he can say that he's from Oakland and I think people would rather hear him lie than hear the truth even if they know it's a bit of a lie he should probably start to reinvent his background in history because the rich white kid um from a good neighborhood that story doesn't sound great even if it's a little less believable people will kind of believe this okay well I came from Oakland then I went to MIT and I made it out of the hood and that sounds a little fishy but you know it's a decent story and I think it'll work work a lot better for him and he could meet other prisoners who are from where he's from and they can kind of affiliate over that and I think he you know may be in a good condition there I was able to affiliate with virtually anyone from New York City because I know every neighborhood New York City have been around and um when you can mention specific streets that's the like credibility little things like that where you say oh yes I've been to Nostrand Avenue you know I know the the this chicken spot there everyone Sarah says oh he's one of us okay you know but if you're like well you know I went to private school so that you know you need people to be on your team and you know it's it's uh it's hard to be authentic but also be you know sort of in in this space where you know you're making a lot of friends and friends can really go a long way in prison and I think that you know Sam smark he can survive um again those penitentiaries with life sentences I wouldn't wish it on anyone I don't wish it on Sam um no matter what he's done it's it's not a way to live it's it's barely life at all and I think that you know from what I've heard you know he he wouldn't be surviving there very long um there are ways for for instance what I've heard for Ross for instance is there are ways where you can sort of um go into protective custody which is again not sort of the thing want to do but for Sam's case I think might be the only option I mean he's not going to be able to integrate into the penitentiary culture I was able to integrate into the low culture just fine in fact it's fairly well liked and kind of you know popular and I was really friendly to everyone I think that the pen culture is basically about gangs Turf territory stabbings killings you're in there for life you're in there with other people who are in there for life they will kill you over who owes each other a peanut butter sandwich or that you stepped on somebody's shoes or something like that like it can be so brutal because there's nothing else to your life other than you know the rest of your life in prison which you still have TV you still have family and friends there's still things you can do to talk to your people that you love and let them know that you're still there and again the visits are there but you know the environment's very very rough and I think that you know protective custody is sadly you know again nobody wants to have the embarrassment of going to protective custody and basically you're in this situation that's not ideal it can often be very excluded where it's you and one other prisoner who potentially is a huge informant or something where they can't also be in a public prison in so-called general population GP gen pop so Sam wouldn't do well in genpop in the pack um for him to do well in that environment he would probably have to affiliate with one of the white gangs which are often white supremacist gangs and my Intel from from real prisoners and the real situation is that Ross albrook was asked to affiliate with with some of the white supremacist gangs and was very very difficult thing for him to do when he refused to do it which resulted in him being transferred to another prison so there's this very weird system that sets up at that higher level of the prison system sorry I'm talking so much I have so much worthless knowledge about this stuff but it is fascinating no no I I mean it's it's just so enlightening I I have I have intelligent things to say about database systems and programming and solidities and stuff like that you know this is this is another part of my life that I did live yeah yeah and um just to Define it so or what did you call it protective custody yeah what is that it's when a prisoner oftentimes they're a child sex offender they're transgender they're a rat in the mafia or other significant sort of organized drug organized uh crime syndicate where basically they're not safe anywhere you know that um the phrase that sometimes prisoners use and the blood skangs that I was friendly with was push the button or put them on the menu no matter where they go there's sort of a kill on site kind of order you know again that's for sort of more of an informant type person and I I would I actually involuntarily went to protective custody the people at MDC decided that I was sort of too dangerous to leave uh out in the open it's a very weird story there but I went to pronography for a few months and there were cops who committed crimes uh there were two cops who were sort of dirty cops and they couldn't be in you know General pop because everybody doesn't like cops and in prison as you can imagine so they had to be in general population so every gen pop is a different situation some prisons don't have them so they just kind of bust you around from prison to prison hoping that you can survive and you know find a place to set up set down routes if you're going to be there for 20 years you know you kind of you know do that and as you can imagine people who've been into prison for 20 years they start to start to claim some territory and claim some ownership of the place and there's a hierarchy and you have to obey the hierarchy and people like Sam may not understand that but they'll figure it out pretty quickly though so I hope that he doesn't get life I hope that he doesn't get 30 35 40 50 years something that's akin to life remember in the federal system you do 85 percent of your time there are other deductions that you can take there's this first step act which sort of can give you a year or more off your sentence depending so even a 30-year sentence for Sam is not the end of his life you would do probably 20ish 22 on 30 years um maybe 25 if you're unlucky but more likely in the low 20s so a 30-year sentence is honestly not the end of the world it's a lot of time it's really difficult but in a 30-year sentence he could conceivably get down to a medium fairly quickly maybe even down to a low and at a low he could be relatively comfortable so I think um my heart goes out to him and his family I understand there are a lot of victims here I understand that um you know I don't feel bad for Sam having to go through the system because it is if he did commit a crime that he deserves to be prosecuted but I do think that personally I think that white-collar criminals are over sentenced quite a bit nobody died in FTX this is a paperwork crime to get a life sentence over it is something that often will happen people don't understand that about white collar crime many white-collar criminals get life sentences it's not um it's something that I think a lot of people have this misunderstanding there will be no slap on the wrist for Sam so I'm already sort of feeling kind of sorry for him knowing kind of what I think is coming I I don't think in any circumstance you'd say for instance get less than 20 years and even on 20 years you're doing 15 which you know is is a lot and again maybe he deserves it maybe he doesn't in my personal opinion I think that that that's a harsh sentence for for white collar crime this is probably the white collar crime of the century so maybe it does deserve something like 15 20 25 30 years but again it's not for me to decide it's for judge Ronnie Abrams to decide all right so in a moment we're going to talk about the sentencing um but first a quick word for the sponsors who make this show possible join over 50 million people using

you do these live streams and I saw a bit of you talking about the sentencing guidelines which have a point system so can you walk us through that and how it is that you're making these estimates of what his sentence will be yeah so when you're in federal prison waiting sentencing you have not very much to do other than sit in the law library or talk to your lawyers and figure out what the heck's gonna happen to me right it's interesting because not even I had a girlfriend who was a criminal justice reporter and she was probably the best criminal justice reporter um I think in the world and uh she covered my trial extremely fairly and we ended up starting this relationship while I was in prison which is you know Serena worthy and people have talked a lot about it uh Christie's life is her name Christy and I would often discuss that most criminal justice journalists who were supposed to know this stuff don't even understand the sentencing guidelines system so I certainly don't expect any person who's not intimately familiar with criminal justice to understand it either there is a point system that is the so-called guidelines the guidelines actually used to be mandatory so depending on the sort of supposed to be objective calculation where you know depending on your crime you add these points and you go down this checklist and for fraud the checklist is fairly simple the big thing with fraud is the amount of money lost and the amount of money lost um can basically entirely decide your sentence and so the interpretation of how much money got lost is often up up in the air for instance in my case none of my investors lost money nevertheless the government used an interpretation of the second they gave you their money under false pretenses that amount was lost and it's like that's not fair and if if I was calculated under my definition which is well did they lose money or not I would have gotten like a year or less my guidelines would have been quite some small um based on their guidelines I was uh in the category of very close to a life sentence so it's very easy to inflate these guidelines to an enormous and insane uh level um and many judges look at the guidelines and say okay I'm not going to keep piling points on the points on and points on nevertheless Sam's guidelines calculate to a point of you know beyond it's basically off the charts um there's no even use of the guidelines at that point because he's so far into life um that you know he's got enough points to last them several life sentences and and you're talking about the eight billion dollars right because that's that must be higher than pretty much anybody ever there's no number on the guidelines stop at 5 150 million so like it's it's and and they corrected it for inflation fairly recently and it's just uh you also get uh extra points based on how many victims you have which stops that after more than 10 victims at Four Points you know for him he's got 10 000 victims or maybe even a million it says over a million right so so there's no real you know it wouldn't be hard for the prosecution to say look at this your honor I mean have you ever seen something like this and the honest answer is is it's it's really unprecedented um similar crimes you know um they're hard to come by but you know the famous I call them the big three uh frauds of the century I studied almost every fraud case before mine to get a sense for what was going on I made a spreadsheet I uh calculated uh averages across different judges across different jurisdictions the big three were were um Bernie Madoff uh Alan Sanford and Tom petters uh all got life sentences three of the biggest uh frauds in American history all smaller in dollar amounts uh roughly well except for Madoff perhaps uh I guess Sam would rank as number two roughly depending on how you calculate the numbers it could rank as number one um so both are uh it's not a good company to be in um you know it's really not good company to be in and I think that um the number of victims and victim hardship is something judges really like to focus on it's not exactly in the guidelines but elderly uh victims are really looked down on um and certainly it is in the guidelines where if you're if your crime Clause substantial financial hardship to somebody that's extra points and it's also supposed to sort of give the judge that latitude of saying you know I can depart from this life sentence but I probably shouldn't you know whereas at the calculations in my case for example came up to this you know insane number but the judge said listen a lot of these guidelines double count for example if you your crime was done by so-called sophisticated means you get an extra two points and it's a joke among criminal justice attorneys and and defendants unfortunately that every crime is not by sophisticated means it's like you know there's no Noms you know there's no crime that's not sophisticated to some extent right and like if it involves computers and sophisticated like it's kind of like a silly thing so like so many times the the point system is thought to be double counting over and over again for the same crime so judges will often like kick out the sophisticated means or they'll kick out you know a few things and then they'll say Okay based on this I'll calculate this point range and they'll sort of explain it sentencing how they got to where they got um the good news is that they never almost never there's only one judge I know about in the entire bench that would do above guideline sentencing almost certainly they do some percentage of the guidelines so I got a really good judge draw that I calculated your honors history and I determined that she generally calculated or generally sentenced around 50 of the guidelines and that was close to the best you could get um other judges give you like a 10 or 20 discount so if you're supposed to get 20 years though okay I'll give you 18 or I'll give you 16. um and that's only a mean right there are some cases where you're supposed to get 30 and they give you one there are some cases where you're supposed to get 10 and they give you all 10. you know so every case is different but you rarely ever see your you know your guidelines are 10 years you're getting 30. you know that that often that will almost never happen in fact judges don't relish sentencing people to jail you know it's often said uh there's a book called uh how judges think by judge Posner and there's often judges who say it's the hardest part I've heard that so many times it's the hardest part of their job and you know they see the family they see that but they also get to hear from the victims and the victim impact letters are some of the hardest things to to go through I didn't have any Victim Impact letters in fact I had one victim so-called victim support me um I actually did have a victim impact letter to be fair but I also had uh I didn't have a volume of them I had one I think and you know in Sam's case it's not going to be hard for 10 000 people to write a letter to the judge and say hey throw them look at this guy I lost my life savings because I am This is BS I want you to do everything you can and he could have a support letter or two but in general I think it's going to be pretty overwhelming and I don't think his political connections will help for example Elizabeth Holmes had Cory Booker a U.S senator big deal write a letter she still got a pretty big seven so I think Sam's in for you know unfortunately you know a bad situation and and begging the court for Mercy is often not a bad strategy I mean judges kind of get pissed off if you're running into for example um I I sort of walked this tightrope really well where I went to trial which is a huge consumption of resources it's a huge calendar drain it's your right but y'all just don't like it if you're going to trial an obviously guilty case where all the evidence is there laying out in front of you it's like come on why are you doing this why are you dragging every one of us through this this could be a six-month trial and you know what the heck so you get three points off your sentencing guidelines if you accept responsibility but if you go to trial and you just are like you know throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping that you know you have no defense judges take that you know they kind of take that in consideration they'll often say you know I'm going to teach you a lesson for really being so arrogant um as to pretending you're innocent and this and that they're not allowed to do that but I think in their head most people feel especially in the criminal justice Community attorneys certainly feel that you take this to trial and lose you're going to get a double penalty basically and that's you know something that can be you know something for him to sort of think about I think let's now talk about the judge which you said is Ronnie Abrams um I've heard you talk about how there's a range of different judges and also about how the southern district of New York is the most prestigious and therefore one of the toughest jurisdictions so tell us a little bit about this judge and you know how tough or lenient he or she is yeah judge Ronnie Abrams is a woman she's fairly young um she was appointed at a fairly young age she was in her 40s I think when judge President Obama appointed her she was a prosecutor as most judges are it's nothing to hold against somebody uh some of us criminals kind of don't like that uh we kind of view that the pipeline of prosecutors to judges as kind of just a continuation uh quite frankly and sometimes there's a lot of jokes and even criminal justice defense uh defense attorneys say this uh there's two prosecutors in the room the prosecution and the judge and we're sitting here by ourselves kind of you know it's a two-on-one and you know very rarely the judge can see themselves in the prosecutor's seat because they were in the prosecutor's seat possibly even just a year or two ago and they never meet a defendant that they think is innocent or that they really like quite frankly judge Abrams is and this is kind of you know another Larson exclusive you have much bigger exclusives in your life uh but judge Abrams is a fantastic pick for Sam and that's the one headline I would take away from this conversation he lucked out the judge draw is supposed to be completely random a lot of times when you get a bad judge uh you think you know gosh the fix is in you know they gave me this bad judge for a reason um and there are bad judges in the southern district my best pick for Sam would have been John drakoff John drakoff is the kindest judge in the building he would have given Sam 10 years um there are some bad judges in that building one was the rumor is she was excommunicated or asked to leave but regardless of what happened judge Forrest was the worst judge in that building and would have had taken zero seconds to give Sam life I mean 10 life sentences like she would have thrown the entire book at him and then some judge Abrams is a great great pick if you're Sam wait good for Sam you mean great for Sam okay great for Sam you could have done better with judge rakoff but this is literally maybe your second best pick and he's uh should thank his lucky stars that he got judge Abrams because it probably takes life off the book but uh we don't know for sure you know every judge is different every judge can have things whispered in their ear even though they're not supposed to she's a relatively young judge which means that she may be susceptible to influence again this is sort of tea leaves that are you know very very out there and it's very hard for to think to put yourself in a judge's head some judges want to go up the bench they want to go to the Circuit they want to go to the Supreme Court and all their decisions will be scrutinized heavily so they think really hard about okay what do I want to do and how do I want to do it do I want to make a name for myself on this or do I not and I think it's going to be really this is going to be the most watched case in decades right so ultimately uh it will be scrutinized closely if the consensus is that he should get life I think she'll move to the consensus most judges don't want to do something controversial so I think they kind of get a sense in the courtroom for what's happening and they kind of pick from there um do you want me to tell you why I think this is an amazingly great pick and turn of luck for Sam yeah so the so the best thing you have is a reputation and I've asked around the criminal justice Community but but that's sort of one thing you can look at but I think actually the best thing you can do is look at the cases and look at the data and so the cases that I've looked at I found a really similar case that John Travis presided over and it's the case of Hannah Park Hannah Park went to Harvard and a park went to Goldman Sachs sound like Sam doesn't it um to prestigious School prestigious investment firm Hannah Park perpetrated a terrible Ponzi scheme which involved 23 million dollars which is fairly large you know it's not a million or two million dollars it's quite a bit and all the money was lost pretty bad and Hannah Park got three years sentenced by judge Abrams very very very generous sentence you know women in the criminal justice system and I'm just using a fact-based pattern here they often get much lighter sentences than that and again maybe that's a good thing maybe it's not a good thing maybe it doesn't matter I don't know it's not my sociological call but it is a fact so that probably you know factored in a little bit but in general that's still even a double that sentence is fairly light sentence so you have to look at the other cases the judge has sentenced on and that is a very analogous case um it's a financial crime it's by sort of a person that's you know should have known better they were somebody in society they had all this prestigious stuff there are some judges that will hold that against you they'll say Mr bankman you were a student of professors you were an MIT graduate you went to prestigious you know investment firms and you did all this how dare you uh when I see people from a poor neighborhood in the Bronx and they deal drugs because they think that's their only way out and I have to give them 10 years mandatory minimum I feel terrible because you know I want to give them less but there's a mandatory minimum and therefore you know I have to give them these 10 years but they they come from the worst environments in the world you came from the best environment in the world you should not be before me and I have to send a message that if you're a child of privilege that you know you're you're I'm going to you know hit you with the book there are other judges that say they actually kind of I think they see themselves results as the defendant and they say you know because most of these judges went to a nice law school they you know kind of um often are from families of Fortune relevance and they kind of say hmm you know I wonder you kind of remind me of you know somebody I went to to law school with or Stanford with and gosh this is a shame that somebody like you should you know be facing the criminal justice system and sometimes it's in between so we don't know for sure but we do know when judge Abrams saw a defendant quite similar to Sam judge Abrams uh gave I mean I don't know if you could get more lenient than three years you know the the old uh scuttlebot or rumor bill or Grapevine and the financial or the criminal justice Community is the federal government does not go after you if they think that they're going to get less than 10 years you know this is not a system where they just want to throw you know a small charge on you or something they go for the jugular every time you know this is not uh the state where you can do six months or something like if if you get less than 10 years in the federal prison system you won you know they did something wrong you know they messed up um and I think that in this case it's it's going to be the best he leave for him is is this amazing sentence that he gave a fairies that she gave a very very similar kind to um remarkably similar analogy and in my case it was very interesting my judge and again I viewed I looked at every single criminal case my judge ever did which was over 200 and I found one case which I'll never forget uh a man committed some fraud um accounts receivable fraud uh same dollar amount roughly as my alleged fraud uh in convicted fraud kind of similar personal background and the guy got seven years and I said to my attorneys I don't even think we have to think anymore I know exactly what I'm gonna get and I got exactly seven years and you know it was like the judge you know they're they're human and if they see one thing and they acted this way to be consistent they're gonna act another way so Sam's not going to get three years he's not gonna get seven years but the fact that she was that was that I think is a really good sign and again if I had to bet today I think he could if he plays his cards right get 20 but he has to plead now he has to just throw himself in front of the mercy of the Court you know don't fight this you know if you fight it gets worse you know they they you know if you cooperate and say okay here's what I can do I'm gonna try the best for my customers which he says he's doing right if that's true plead guilty you know if you really are want to do what's best for your customers help recover the money help show them all the accounts and all this stuff come really clean so the government believes you as opposed to fight fight fight fight fight oh yeah I might have you know 200 million dollars in the cold wall that you don't know about and you know they're sort of always thinking like you know he's not gonna say that but that's what the prosecutor's thinking like this is what what tricks does this kid have up his sleeve but if he comes in like immediately like his colleagues did which they took a plea remarkably quickly I I want to talk about that too you know that that's sort of the kind of thing that um may go well for him especially when the when the judge says all right you know you messed up you're fasting up there wasn't even a little bit of kind of resistance you know you crazy kid and whatever excuse he has he can throw out mental illness he can throw out medical illness he could throw out the pressure the you know the attention all that stuff Elizabeth Holmes did you know and he might be able to get 20 and and 20 for him I would take it today you know I would take it in a heartbeat because it can get a lot worse and you know if he you know as my lawyer said I should have gotten three but I got in my own way um you know I make comments about the prosecutors I would do all kinds of silly stunts and the pressure that builds up on you has to escape somehow right and I think for Sam he did all of these um interviews uh he made all these comments that was foolish and I think that for him he's got to make sure all that pressure doesn't release in the wrong way that if he says something bad about the judge the government something like this it'll all be held against him so he has to sort of I think my opinion come clean as fast as you can pray this judge Abrams um sees you the same way she saw Hannah Park and is relatively lenient for you yeah so let's talk about what you alluded to Caroline and Gary have been cooperating with prosecutors they've pleaded guilty how does all of this help them and how does it hurt Sam it's obvious that it's a huge help for them and a huge hurt for Sam I'll start with Carolyn so Carolyn's situation is very unusual she pled guilty immediately which is strange and her plea agreement which I read last night is not good um she has pled to many many many accounts she made the mistake and it's strategy right there's pros and cons so it's not a mistake to me I would have I would have made the deal for a single count and so when you do that you are limited to a maximum sentence so some of these accounts carry five years some of them carry 20. but if you have five or ten counts they can actually give you five on this five on that 10 on this 10 on that they rarely do that that's called running them wild in in jail parlance it's also called uh running consecutive they almost always run these concurrent which means that if you have five from this 10 on that 15 on that you do 15. uh they're all kind of one case Carolyn pled to like seven or eight charges which is a lot and um some of those charges have a Max I think I double checked this um but I think they have a well I won't even throw out a number there but federal charges either usually have a maximum 5 10 or 20. and I again without Triple checking I I don't want to say which but I think she may have pled to charges that have a big sentence that's a maximum there's no minimum on fraud charges I saw the total if you added them all up was 110 years they almost never will do that running them wild is something that judges will only do really want to set up right no no of course if there's only seven and it's 110 total then obviously some of them are some of them are long yeah they should be one with 20. yeah yeah in fact I'm almost certain again I hate the speaking term that one of her charges has 20. so she could get 20 years it sounds like she also again the nice thing about this case or for the defendants is you all got the same judge so you're all looking at this super nice judge and if it's if she has an even better story than Sam which is gosh this guy kind of amazed me and I fell into this trance and I thought I was doing everything right and at the end it was too late I realized I did everything wrong and now I as you know maybe it wasn't immediate but I kind of confronted this it was my conscience and I'm I'm here before the mercy of the Court you could get five years off that you know I mean it's it's uh you know in five years in federal prison at a camp you know you do three that's not bad you know I gotta say it's it's not good it's not fun but for for a crazy moment of your life like three years is you know you can I I thought the way I sort of was able to internalize it is I basically said I never got a graduate degree I love school I love learning things and I basically said okay well I I can't go to grad school right now but I can kind of do the best I can by reading and stuff like that so I was able to read hundreds of books and you know I learned quite a lot about uh math photography and stuff like that amongst other things and I use the time wisely um three years you can use that time wisely in prison it's not the worst thing to unplug you know and to sort of be not Tethered to this all day and there's some benefits you don't want to be there but you make the most of it so I do think she can get something like five years I do think to some extent would be a disgrace uh but this is a judge that is fairly lenient um again I don't know the exact magnitude of a crime she might have a letter that she wrote Sam for I actually had this in my case a partner of mine wrote a letter and it said Martin I don't agree with the direction you're taking this I think you're making mistakes I think some of the things you're doing I'm really uncomfortable with I'd really like you to suffer all quit if you have a letter like that he kept it in a drawer in his desk you know metaphorically and if anything would come around he would say hey this is how I felt at the time my mental state is not criminal I was not with you on this I completely uh was against it and having a letter like that which we wouldn't know about right that's something her and her attorney is in the government would know about that is something that you can bargain against on the flip side if you had a chat room perhaps called wire fraud where you said oh gosh these people are idiots and oh I'm gonna take all their money and hahaha Let's get the private jet and let's go to this place in that place and have Taylor Swift perform that's something that the government will have possibly and they'll use it against you and they'll say look at this person say enter it's horrible I think that they the government would not offer a plea to one count if they felt that they had a really strong case so it's still a negotiation the government offered a plea for one count for me and I probably should have taken it it had a Max of five that would have been a nice deal um but you know part of me felt like look I'm innocent I don't need to plead guilty to anything for Carolyn accepting a plea of seven counts shows that either the government was very Stern with her and they said listen you're going to take the worst deal in the world you're not negotiating with us we got your dental rights um you're gonna plead to everything and you're just gonna beg that judge that that you know you don't get uh slammed and she took it you know that those are the facts we don't know what that conversation looked like but if I'm for a defense attorney I'm saying whoa I'm not pleading guilty to stop and counts I'll do one or two and she pled to all everything and and to me that's nuts now again it could be a good strategy in a sense that hey I'm cooperating from day one I'm showing you where all the money is I'm telling you everything that happened everything I knew I'm capitulating do what you will with me but I'm trusting you the government to do right by me which is quite a to trust you know the government also has like this prison there's a lot of thing where they could put Sam in one room I'm sorry Carol in one room and Gary and the other and say listen you know it's not like the movies right but it's the metaphorical equivalent of saying which one he is going to plead first you know if you plead first you might get 15 and you might get five doesn't the five sound better and you know you have this back and forth the one thing I would say about Gary it's a bit different and again prison is segregated by by sex um there's very little room for gender in prison and talk about that maybe some other day but Gary is a man and I know what man's prison Men's prison is Spike Gary is now a rat um this is the worst thing you can be in prison it's actually worse than a child sex offender in many prisons if you have cooperated with the federal government against somebody you are bad news you are not welcome on the prison floor if they know that that's what you did you will often be asked to go into protective custody you'll often not be asked to go on to protect us so you'll be taken into custody after you've been um violently um hurt two criminals the worst thing in the world is a rat and an informant cooperator a CW uh Etc the five 5K one distinction where if you've read the Carol let's play agreement she's going to get this 5k1 the 5K one is a so-called outward departure where you can get a downward departure from the guidelines getting a 5k one is the worst thing you could be you can have as a prisoner the other prisoners loathe the idea of an informant why because informants are what got them in prison without the informants there's no case without a witness to take the stand and say yes Sam did it I know that he did it because I was there that's what gets you convicted now again it's twisted logic obviously uh but you have to think about what the environment is this is an environment of people who have committed crimes their whole life in many cases several times they've been to jail they think they will look at Gary and immediately think of the person that ratted them out and they will want to take out every ounce of aggression and anger they have which I can assure you is an enormous amount on this person so if you're Gary listen I think ultimately he probably did do the right thing he's doing what's best for him but it's very hard to sort of sign up to be a tattletale and it's this is the most grown-up version you can of being a tattletale and it is not something the other guy's kids in the park look look uh nicely upon all right last question is that nishad Singh Is reportedly the fourth executive who knew that FTX customer funds were being used by Alameda no word on him what do you think is going on there he might be negotiating complete deals you know I think that he might also be thinking about putting up um you know a defense the biggest problem with these defenses is that you often for economical reasons the judges will ask everything to be in one trial same facts it's the same Witnesses it's the same you know there's no reason to have two trials if you're nashaad you do not want to go to trial sitting next to Sam bankman you can get a so-called Severance my lawyer who went to travel with me who I believe my lawyer didn't do anything wrong he simply caught up in a Maelstrom he's the nicest most innocent person in the world but my lawyer uh successfully won a severance he got a separate trial and in Elizabeth Holmes case you got a different summer trial from sunny bawani he could probably get a severance given the craziness of this case but you do not want to go to trial with Sam you also don't want to go to trial at all so it's hard to accept guilty plea it's hard to say I'm signing this piece of paper sending me to prison you want to resist you want to say no I'm not going to do this I think Sam Trabuco is going to get knighted I think you know there's no reason why 50 people can't get indicted here you know the government does not play nice they don't play fair you know it's a sledgehammer you know uh in the Madoff case I think around 50 people got knighted you know this isn't something that's just like you know oh let's just deal with a couple of people at the top and that's it sometimes it is uh but sometimes they will go all the way down and secure guilty please from tons of people now I think in this case they should probably say listen we got the big wheel I mean that's that's what we got but you can't be too careful in that business right so if you think there's somebody who could provide good testimony until Sam pleads they're going to keep going until they get every single piece of evidence every single person you know so if Sam pleads today that'd be the best thing possible for Trabuco for for nishad for others because there will be I mean you just keep going down that list and that'll be really good news of sampleets for those people but every day that he doesn't bleed they're going to keep putting pressure on every other person in that organization it's a such a crazy case it's really sad that you know um professionals um will oftentimes you know get involved in situations like this because it's as I said I mean white collar crime and this kind of stuff is not common I mean this is um Sam's going to be in a world of a world he's not used to it he's in a world he's not used to he's in a world that's you know why do you have to handcuff me is what he's probably thinking right now what am I going to do I'm not I'm a fat kid with who's a computer programmer I can't do anything but every time they're going to put you in handcuffs it's real uncomfortable why can't I have a toothbrush because you might I might stab somebody with it this is insane but you have to live that life and he may be living that life for a very long time all right this has been an amazing conversation but I I just want to check and make sure is there anything I didn't ask you that you think my audience would be interested in knowing well I'm not just a former White Collar criminal well I'm also uh you know and I know people know that I'm a successful entrepreneur I'm involved in the software industry I know a lot about crypto I talk a lot about crypto a lot of opinions about it this is obviously one of the most interesting things that's ever happened um in in business and finance and crime and all kinds of things so I'm happy to chime in on that but you know certainly um you know have have had a lot of opinions um you know in this space and always happy to talk to you about about that in terms of the crime side of it I think we covered the Waterfront pretty well again I I think the the one or two things that are kind of interesting uh that you might want to know in your audience might want to know is you can write to prisoners in jail and it's very easy in fact Sam's prisoner numbers should be public at some point on vop.gov it is not hard to find the address in the prison and you can write a letter and I return hundreds of letters maybe even thousands Christy Smythe kept uh thousands of uh my letters uh they're almost exclusively positive letters of encouragement and one or two cranks but it was like a 99 you know we like you we support you that kind of thing if you you feel like writing to Sam or Carolyn or anyone else you can do that I'm surprised that Carolyn got Bail be frank um again her cooperation must be extensive she to be allowed a personal recognizance Bond at 250 000 so no monitoring and at least slap an ankle monitor in her fire the judge it does start to show you judge Abram's temmer and thinking I think is that you have basically the number two accomplice and possibly the number three accomplice and Gary and they can walk the streets of of I guess New York uh since they're charged in New York or wherever uh they're allowed to walk the streets uh free until sentencing and it sensing could be three years from now um and I can tell you I I was on a on a secured Bond I put up five million dollars you know being on a bond is you're fairly free I mean you basically are free um if you were crazy enough and I would use that word clearly you'd have to be out of your mind if you're crazy enough to think about escaping you could do it um there are ways um I don't recommend it I think it's a Nutty idea you don't want to live your life on the run you know if you get caught you'll get an additional seven years for escaping um but you know they are letting these they're all free you know they're not incarcerated and again with that 100 million dollar cold wallet you know you you might be able to go wherever you want um and get your you know I don't know what these people would do and get their face changed get plastic surgery we've all seen those movies but it's it's it does give you tea leaves that you have this judge who is letting the co-conspirators or co-defendants out on bond she gave a similar case three years this is not that bad if you're Sam you know it's things could be worse you could have a different charge that's not so nice you could have a judge that's saying no Carolyn you're nope no bond you're in until then and um you know he's got neither of those things so it's a little bit sunnier day for Sam than it maybe was a couple days ago yeah I think for me the main thing is 23 million dollars versus eight billion dollars is just such a huge gap that there's no analogyx yeah like because I saw your video where you're walking through the points and you when you added up all the points of things that he likely did then it landed around the 30 to Lifetime range so we'll see what happens but um anyway this has been such a fascinating conversation I've appreciated so much thank you so much for coming on Unchained thank

market cap a 20 tender offer would require 1.1 billion dollars of capital where on Earth is grayscale going to get 1.1 billion dollars to fund this tenor offer seems like more of a PR stunt to reduce
