you thanks for having me on Last Summer the US government sanctioned the tornado cach smart contracts at the time many people in crypto said that it didn't make sense to sanction software and that the government had made a mistake but this Wednesday the government actually went a step further what happened on Wednesday the the southern district of New York indicted Roman storm and Roman semar for three different counts of conspiracy and we can get into what those charges actually say but at bottom they're saying that between 2019 and 2022 the three co-founders of tornado cash created software that the government is saying was used to commit various crimes yeah one of the comments made here was that they facilitated more than $1 billion in money laundering does that make sense to you you know a lot of people in crypto at least make a distinction between developers and the actual software in crypto which is you know as people tend to describe as decentralized um so what's your take on whether or not you know facilitated really is the right word yeah and I think that they're just to hinge off with something you said they should be making a distinction between software development right and alone and doing more than that and I think here in the indictment what we're seeing is an allegation that um the conspiracy to commit money laundering from September 2020 to August 2022 is the creation of the software that allowed various people all over the world to use it to anonymize private transactions and I think that we haven't seen this exact set of circumstances come up before and I think the question of whether facilitation is the right word also comes into play with the money transmitter allegations which we can also talk about but for the money laundering charge it's really my guess to give the government the benefit of the doubt I think what they're going to say is it's really more about the concealment of potential proceeds of a crime versus like the facilitation of that crime and when you say concealment of proceeds of a crime what do you mean by that like who who's doing the concealing so I think what the you know these are all unproven allegations of course I think what the government would say in this indictment is that the the agreement right because this is a conspiracy charge not the actual substantive charge itself so they're saying that there was an agreement between several people to com to knowingly engage in conduct that might be money laundering um I think that they're saying that the agreement was to provide software that would conceal transactions that include criminal proceeds I think that's what the government would say and that the the money laundering charge in this case is actually not hinged on like the money transmitter business or the aifa violation it's actually connected to the cyber crime Fraud and Abuse Act and the the wire fraud act so I think what they're going to say is the tornado cash Founders told everybody they had no control over this protocol when in fact they did and of course we would disagree with that I think but they the government's going to say they told the the world that they had no control over this protocol which allowed people to anonymize transactions when in fact they did and then that protocol was used by Lazarus group to engage in the Ronin hack and the tornado cash Founders like essentially agreed to allow the service to continue concealing those proceeds now I think a a more rigorous understanding of the technology would not support those allegations but that's I think what the government would say and what then would be the view um you have based on how the technology works so I think that we we have to look carefully about what at what tornado cach smart contracts were actually doing and I think the key wordss here are you know when it comes to the money transmitter business allegations specifically are accept and transmit I do not think that the tornado cach software was accepting people's funds and transmitting them to other people if we are looking specifically at the technology The Spar contracts were publishing secret notes from that one person intended to send to the network and they were publishing those secret notes to the actual smart contract protocol so I don't think that is the same thing as saying that they are accepting and transmitting funds or accepting custody or holding any funds on behalf of customers I think that we need to make that distinction when we're talking about the technology Storm's lawyer Brian Klein said quote we are incredibly disappointed that the prosecutors chose to charge Mr storm because he helped develop software and they did So based on a novel legal Theory with dangerous implications for all software developers um what is that theory that they use to make the arrest and what do you think the implications are for all software developers so yeah um I think that the novel Theory here is the money transmit or business theory that they're alleging in count to of the indictment I think that we have not seen an indictment packaged together uh user interface smart contract protocol and you know what the government is going to say marketing and promotion of services and call it a service or so that they can call it a business so that they can then say it's a money transmitter business I think we have not seen that before and as Brian said and Brian is an amazing lawyer and uh we should always listen to him when he's when he's talking about uh criminal defense cases but he I think what he's the point he's making is from Storm's perspective he developed this software and just because he developed this software and some other person in the world used it to do something bad storm should not be held responsible for simply putting that software out into the world right that is not um that is not fair that would have huge ramifications for all software developers everywhere you can use anything uh you know to commit a crime so I think that there is a really big chilling effect that could happen if this kind of theory is like extrapolated out yeah I mean this really strikes at the core of decentralization which is you know one of the foundational principles of the crypto movement and I just wonder you know looking at this do you think that if this kind of charge by the government stands if you know decisions kind of affirm what the government is alleging here and that it is Criminal do you think that means the end of defi I don't think that means the end of defi um I was hoping you would ask me this so that I could say this I do not think it means the end of defi I have seen a lot of really like some anxiety on Twitter obviously I think everybody is up in arms and I totally get it and it is very serious when we are alleging liberty interest related allegations right um but I do not think this is the end of defi I I think that we need to be clear about what the indictment is saying and what it is not saying it is not saying that simply running a front end is a crime it's not saying that simply writing code is a crime it's saying that according to the government that you're running a financial institution that would have to comply with the bank secrecy act and when you agree to do that thing and you don't actually comply that is the crime so I think that that is I think the indictment is just a little more specific about what they're criminalizing and I think that's a good thing for defi right we don't want the indictment to be broader than it actually is we want it to be as specific as it possibly could be in in terms of differentiating what is going to be pursued as a crime versus what is not in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about what this could mean for defi but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible arbitrum stands at the Forefront of innovation as

XYZ back to my conversation with Amanda So based on this do you think we're going to end up in a world where front ends will need to do know your customer processes fair question I think that that is where my brain would go first right like that does seem to be the logical conclusion of what the indictment allegations are saying but I don't think that that's where we have to go I think that that is not um necessarily what's going to happen I think that there is a risk analysis to be done for every project like if you are putting out a um a protocol connected to a front end you have to analyze whether there is a risk of sanctions violations a risk of AML violations and take action in response to that risk and I think obviously getting a lawyer involved is always a good idea to help you do that assessment but I don't think that this has to mean that we're just going to regulate all front ends going forward I also think we should separate out this is the doj this is not treasury right this is not the Department of Treasury this is not ofac this is the Department of Justice alleging Criminal allegations so we should separate out like forward-looking regulation from what the doj is doing by putting out an indictment yeah and that's a natur natural segue to my next question which is about a blog post that coin Center published pointing to um some finsen guidance where they say that they believe that these charges actually run counter to that guidance I think this goes back to some of the comments you were making earlier about the custody um you know can you can you explain uh coin Center's argument and also talk about whether or not you think this could be a potential defense for these developers yeah absolutely and I I thought the coin Center piece was really on point and talking about how the industry had this 2019 fend guidance that it felt was like actually pretty clear at the time which is if you're running an anonymizing software provider you are not a money transmitter business and I think it is surprising to have received that guidance and then see this indictment come out and think wait like how is that consistent with what this guidance said several years ago so I think that the article does a great job of explaining how that guidance would have made software providers who created a tornado cache think that what they were doing was providing software alone and not running a money transmitter business um and it is on the theme of you know this regulation by enforcement atmosphere where instead of getting prospective advice we're finding out after the fact that people did things wrong but I think that um what I was saying earlier with the accept and transmit is like that's the key question when we're talking about running a money transmitter business is the alleged business or group of people accepting funds and transmitting them and I think here when you look at the actual software what it's doing it is not accepting funds and like holding them and then transmitting them to other people I think that's a mistake on the tech you know one thing I can't help but know notice is people are reacting very strongly to these charges um same way that they did last year regarding the sanctions on tornado cash um however you know both of these actions by the government seem to have happened basically because North Korea was involved and um this was a a theory that Arie RedBoard had um put you know given on the show last year and I wondered you know if you thought that that that continued to um just heighten um you know the government's radar on anything going on in crypto when when we see that um you know those actors involved 100 per. I I I think that they're the Spectre of the um involvement of North Korea is very strong here and I think it's what the case will look like what they will use to make the case look really bad to the jury right it's like you say North Korea and everybody has a strong reaction I also think you see this theme in the indictment that is like very anti-privacy anti- encrypted messaging apps anti you wanting to keep your transactions private right like I think that it is like part of this package of we're going to make this look as bad as we possibly can because they want to convince the jury that there were crimes committed here and in order to do that they have a high burden and they need to meet that burden so they're going to use I think the tool that they have in their Arsenal to make it look really bad and so what would you say these indictments mean for anybody in crypto who's working on privacy I would say that privacy is not illegal or illicit and there is nothing IL you know of course this is not legal advice but that there there is nothing inherently illicit about using encrypted messaging apps there is nothing inherently illicit about wanting to keep your transactions private i' I've seen so many memes about how like cash is the original way of keeping your your transactions PR right the government can't surveil your cash transactions and what we're seeing is like the government chip away at this idea that we as Citizens want to keep our transactions private so I would not say like give up I think that the there are other ways to fight and just because we've received like one indictment that does not mean we don't continue to educate lawmakers and policy makers and look at like the policy side of this world as a place where we can make more Headway in favor of privacy rights and you know we've seen multiple instances where North Korean hackers do um use the tools of Defi and other you know blockchain related things to enrich uh the North Korean dictatorship so I wondered what advice you would have for developers in crypto who are working on decentralized projects that's tough um I don't I'm just a litigator um I don't typically give first effective advice to projects but um what I would say is it is all about a risk analysis and it it like you know I know that it is costly and kind of annoying to get a lawyer involved in your project early but I think in part it is smart to do a risk analysis and understand what risks you need to mitigate in order to operate because I think we all we are all trying to create enough room for technology to be able to flourish and for people to be able to innovate so I think you have to do that risk analysis early and and get as the best advice you can can all right and so in regards to this case what are next things you're you're looking for one of the developers was arrested um a storm uh s of I think is still living freely um but you know what do you think the next steps will be sure so this just begins the process right we're at the very beginning there will still be time for motion practice and Discovery and eventually if we get there trial so I think the very next thing that we'll that we'll see happen is um Roman storm will have to be arraigned on the indictment enter a plea of either guilty or not guilty um and then there will be some kind of fail hearing and uh argument related to that to determine whether or not he is going to be able to be out during pre-trial release or whether he'll be held so I'm sure Brian will be very focused on that in the next few days but then after that it's motion practice so what the defend what any defendant can do after an indictment is move to miss that indictment and I imagine we'll see motion practice here to that extent like in in uh consistent with Brian's statement about this you know his client is a software developer and all he did was develop software we might see some motions that reflect that theme and then once we get pass motion practice there will be Discovery the government has to produce evidence that they plan to use a trial so they will have to give that uh Discovery evidence over to the defense and then there are some reciprocal obligations for the defense to also produce Discovery they plan to use a trial and then at the very end we would see pre-trial motions about what what evidence can come in and out we might see some expert Discovery I would imagine in a case like this there will be um experts called to talk about what the technology actually does and doesn't do and then there would be a trial if there's no if there's no plea and you know we've discussed a few different things that uh you seem to believe the government got wrong um you know one around the money transmission another around writing software um and I was curious like what do you think is um are the two Romans best defense so I think that it's important to note again that these are conspiracy charges so they do the government does not need to prove that the underlying violation occurred they only need to prove that two people or more agreed to engage in conduct that would result in a violation so I think the best offense to a conspiracy is we didn't have an agreement to do anything illegal right so if you are able to show that you either didn't know the aims like the goals of the conspiracy or you didn't agree with somebody else to do a crime then you that is your defense to a conspiracy charge okay all right well this has been super interesting thank you so much for coming on

news broke that tornado cash co-founder Roman storm had gotten out on bail according to his lawyer Brian Klein who added on a tweet I remain very disappointed that the prosecutors charged him because he developed software their novel legal theory has dangerous implications for all software developers in other legal issues this week the former FTX Co Sam bankman freed legal saga continues to unfold on Wednesday US federal judge Lewis Kaplan granted bankman Freed's lawyers permission to visit their client at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn New York in preparation for his trial starting on October 3rd according to a coindesk report however the FTX Founders request for daily meetings at his lawyer office or to transfer to a lower security prison was denied elsewhere prosecutors at the US Department of Justice filed a proposed set of jury instructions for bankman Freed's trial commencing in October detailing the seven counts against him including wire fraud and money laundering bankman PRI legal team's strategy and the Court's decisions this week set the stage for the highly anticipated legal battle in the crypto space judge Kaplan granted bankman freed

expressed concerns over delays and the voluminous Discovery including a list written by former alamat research CEO Caroline Ellison titled quote things Sam is freaking out about end quote including alama's trading Hedges and ironically for a man once widely described by reporters as the White Knight of crypto negative press coverage bangman Freed's trial is scheduled to begin October 1 and he faces a maximum of over 100 years in prison if convicted of all charges in accord appearance Tuesday bankman freed pleaded not guilty to all charges his lawyers sent him a letter to judge Kaplan explaining how they plan to use the October trial to show that bankman freed was acting in good faith when he followed previous legal counsel to autod delete some information and to make loans to FTX moreover FTX is seeking to sell stake and hedge which left in no small part of $3 billion in crypto Holdings using using Mike novag gr's Galaxy Empire to advise and assist in maximizing value from the

pools behind much of the global crypto trading activity after the balancer team experienced the undisclosed problem it sent an urgent Twitter warning urging you users to withdraw funds from the affected pools including on the ethereum main net polygon arbitrum and others in a tweet the team claimed it secured most of the total value locked in the protocol but some funds remained at risk in spite of being partially decentralized balancer users last year voted to give a small group called The balancer emergency subow the about to kill vulnerable pools enabling a proportional exit from the affected pools although ballots are estimated that just $10 million was still at risk data shows that over $200 million has been withdrawn with tvl falling a whopping 25% to around $544 million the team plans to provide additional details through a postmortem report at a later time reflecting what appears to be a Swift and coordinated response to a potentially significant weakness in the defi

as the asset expanded its reach that project is no more in spite of shuttering the center Consortium and the shift of Power Circle CEO Jeremy air emphasized his commitment to making usdc the most widely used digital Dollar in the world in a tweet the US Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an alert regarding the activities alleged of North Korean hackers warning cryptocurrency companies of a potential Cash Out attempt involving stolen Bitcoin worth over $40 million the alert focuses on hackers belonging to Trader Trader group that's t r a d r t r AI t o r group believed by the FBI to be associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the group is also believed to be the latest incarnation of a team of hackers identified separately as both the Lazarus group and ap38 known for spear fishing methods where counterfeit emails are used to trick readers into clicking on links that introduce software that steals money and data locks out authorized users in exchange for a ransom or any number of elicit actions the FBI's investigation has tracked approximately 1,580 Bitcoins stolen by the group from several significant heists including thefts from payment processor alphao and others the agency has urged private sector entities to closely examine blockchain data associated with Bitcoin addresses its agents suspect of being involved and called for increased vigilance against transactions involving these addresses in a related the FBI in Thursday announced it has seized nearly $1.7 million in cryptocurrency between March and July of this year with the majority of its seizures coming from a single exchange binance on a more light-hearted note Bitcoin as you all probably know has not been performing so well for a more upbeat interpretation of the down Market your market update from standup comedian jinny Hogan is just below coin's price plunged dramatically last week week which is wild I had no idea it had been up to begin with but it's true Bitcoin dropped from 29 to 25 which is to say it started getting Botox at one point Bitcoin shed 7% of its value in just 20 minutes which feels like it could be the advertising for a new Pilates program and the price plunge led to mass liquidations which is not nearly as sexy a phenomenon as the term suggests but it's a bummer like imagine you were planning to use your Bitcoin to buy a large plot of land in Siberia to evade taxes now you can only buy a medium large plot of land in Siberia to evade taxes and it was crypto's biggest one-day fall since the collapse of FTX which was actually less than a year ago can you believe that in just 9 months s SPF produced about 72,000 Excel spreadsheets proving his innocence so productive the only thing I can do in 9 months is like make a baby
