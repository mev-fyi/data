of Unchained appreciate has recognized amazing people because we believe in the strength of recognition and relationships in the strength of community who will be recognized today stay tuned my guest today is Jimmy song partner at blockchain capital and founder of programming blockchain welcome Jimmy thanks for having me big fan first off I want to know why the cowboy hat and do you wear it everywhere you go I do wear it everywhere I go I have three separate reasons for the cowboy hat first of all I live in Austin so I wear the boots and the cowboy hat as sort of a way to let people know that's where I'm from my name like when I go to conferences things it's a hey where are you coming in from I'm coming from Austin can't tell from the Hat second thing is yeah the second reason is I love the 1800s that whole era you know like yeah the United States went from a backwater British colony to a world superpower in that period and you know cowboy hats and that whole West and self-made man ethic and all that stuff was very prominent around that and I'd like to point out to people you know that that was largely built on sound money so for me that's that's a very powerful motivator to sort of imitate that era just a little bit and finally the third reason is I do speak on Bitcoin and the entire crypto space so for me the Hat represents the crypto space in the sense that you know we have a lot of opportunity but also a lot of danger it's it's the Wild West right and there's you know a lot of interesting things that can make you a lot of money but there's also a lot of stuff that you know might get you killed so yeah that's that's why we're oh boy I hope you mean killed in the financial sense and not any other since hard to say hard to say oh man oh boy okay I was looking for some certainty there you know yeah I'm here I've heard you say this word sound money so often I'm just curious what does it mean to you sound money hard money versus easy money hard as in it's very hard to produce so not a lot of society is spending their money and resource the resources into generating that hard money easy money is by definition like easy to produce so central banking fiat money that's very easy because it just requires the stroke of a pen or an update to the central bank's database in some way or shape or form so for me sound money is money that is hard money that's that's very difficult to increase the supply of and that's what bitcoin is that's why bitcoin is interesting to me and did you have that interest in sound money before you got into Bitcoin or did you develop it once you learned about Bitcoin well I I think everyone sort of has that instinctual value of something that's scarce right like even when I was little I would collect baseball cards or something and I still remember that was like a Billy Ripken card from like 87 that you know had you know profane word at the end of the bat that they didn't catch and then they revoked it and everyone wanted that card because you know like it they revoked it so it was rare so people wanted that card I I think that that's a natural instinct for people and it's it's not necessarily something that you need to learn per se it's something that's almost in built and when I heard about Bitcoin first back in 2011 that's one of the first things that made me want to get some was that there was a 21 million bitcoins limit and I knew that it was scarce right like you can't make any more so therefore it's a very good thing to possess and you know people people recognize this about other all sorts of scarce things and that's that's part I mean yeah you can be versed in economics I guess and know about the you know subjective theory of value and all that stuff but I mean it's sort of inbuilt I think for me and I imagine for most people and what were you doing at the time that you learned about Bitcoin and how did you hear about it 2011 I was working at a startup I was one of three people the only technical guy at that startup and I had been doing startups for like 15 years before that so you know I was at the startup I saw a story on slash thought that's a geeky website that I used to read I don't read that one so much anymore I think hacker news is like then you hang out but you know their tagline is news for nerds important stuff so you know it has like you know it'll have a story on the matrix movies or something like that and then another story on like how SEO is a patent troll that's like suing all these companies or a new distribution of Lynn and and you know like it's just sort of stories that I would be interested in so it was very much catered to me and I I read I read a lot of the stories that are on there and and one day I saw one story that I had no idea what I was talking about it just it said Bitcoin has broke in one dollar and I was like what what is this talking about so I clicked into the story I read about it and it's like what digital money what the hell is this and I basically fell down the rabbit hole and you know looked at it for a few days and I was like okay I need to buy some of this largely because of that 21 million limit because I was like okay I have no idea if this will gain traction or not but if there's only 21 million and if it does gain traction then I better be one of the people that has some and not one of the people that's buying it much later because it'll be worth a lot more and that's largely proof correct which I I'm kind of still astounded by that it's uh it's come this far but you know if you think about it and think about how much money printing there is going on in the world that makes sense well to get in that early and buy at that time that's that's amazing but to be clear I didn't I didn't buy that at that point because it was really really annoying um actually I ended up buying many months later but yeah it was okay yeah I didn't buy one of them one of the biggest regrets yeah you worked at wallet company Armory and enterprise blockchain firm Paxos and I was actually surprised to see that you were at Paxos as recently as March at least according to your LinkedIn what were you doing at those two companies well armory I was a VP of engineering so I was I was hoping develop the product I did a lot of coding we weren't we weren't a very big shop so I think we had like eight employees at our peak and it was like six engineers or something like that so we're a very engineering company it's kind of funny that we're talking about that because you know a lot of these institutions want custody solutions we we had something back in like 2016 and we couldn't find anybody that wanted it we had like this interested key ceremony stuff and it's it's kind of sad to look back on it because we were just two years early but you know what can you do after unfortunately we ran out of money there and I was looking around and an armory at least back then was a really popular wallet so when Alan Rainer was the CEO and he founded it and it's very good coder friend of mine he he posted right after armory you know ran out of money on the Bitcoin talk forums and told people hey like where we're going to stop I think he he had something like 17 emails in the next hour about how you know we should he should apply to work at these other companies so based on that we went out and and interviewed out a few he wanted to bring me along with him and I ended up at Paxos otherwise known as it bit and they wanted to do a an enterprise blockchain product and that's what I worked on for almost two years I mean I I did do some advisory stuff on the at that side of the business but yeah it was largely trying to make a private blockchain work which is really interesting given that you have a very strong viewpoint that private blockchains won't work or don't work and yet you worked on one for two years so why why do you think that well I mean it's largely because I tried to make it work and I couldn't and and every single time I came back the same thing you have to have some central point of failure in which case a blockchain makes zero sense if you try to leave it but haven't having a central point of failure like if it's you know let's say five different companies then so what is the central point of failure is it that a hacker would have to attack three of the five companies and and that's the central point of failure no no no almost so if that would that would be more a federated system so three a five or something like that and that's that's what like block stream is doing with the element sidechain and liquid and things like that now I'm talking about the actual actual blockchain you and I I've studied a lot of these other ones you know hyper ledger and quarter and all of these you almost always come back down down to some sort of central entity that that needs to control what goes into the ledger or not and if it's not a central entity if it is like you are saying like three or five it doesn't work and there's a lot of reasons for this part of it is regulatory so if you're doing anything in the security space there's there's a regulator that needs to be in the middle of that process so they can roll back a trade or you know like somebody's on suspension they're not allowed to do that they they need to control that so there there's a there's a central point of failure there but more more importantly if you're going to make money with the software almost always you have some sort of software as a service type offering you you need to justify why they're paying you money if they're just running software and you're not really doing anything then it doesn't really make sense you could I mean we try to design it around so that you have some sort of you know multi-party approval kind of like what you are suggesting it doesn't really work and and there there are lots of technical reasons for that but the main main ones are you know if you're trying it's a digital bearer asset you always run into the Oracle problem you you need to bind the real world thing to whatever is on the chain and once you do that then it like then you lose a lot of the protections that you get from say the gold bar being in the vault if somebody steals that token who does that gold bar belong to right like you you get weird situations like that so to make any of these viable you end up needing to centralize at all and at that point a blockchain doesn't really make any sense and and this is something that I discovered with I tried so hard Laura to to make that work and and I couldn't find a way to do it without you know centralizing a large part of it at which point it's it kind of becomes pointless so I have multiple questions here first of all at the beginning you made a distinction between the example that I described and you said that that was a federated chain so how are you defining federated versus private what's a private watching well I'm so federated and private are orthogonal concept so federated is is multiple parties controlling something so you could have something like you know a multi sig is like federated control if you have three of five then that would be you know no single person controls it but it's three or five of those people but with with a private blockchain is just something that's not public like you can't go look into it or download that entire database when so why did you say that that was a single point of failure because you could presumably have a private federated chain where the data was not public well you you can't in in most cases so I and you could try to have a private federated chain and that's what most most of these private blockchains try to do but almost always you either have a regulator that needs like direct access even if it was federated if somebody ended up stealing three or five of those keys what happens you have the Oracle problem you have the regulator problem you you also have the very practical business problem of like how do you justify them paying you money all of those things so and if the software is yours then they're not really controlling it and it's basically it it you can't have a federated system while making it so that the economics worked out for everybody and that everyone follows the rules okay yeah you know I don't know the business models for some of the ones that are coming out but I do know that there are some federated private blockchains that are going alive using things like IBM yes has has a central point of failure they they have something called an ordering service which which sounds very innocent it's just something that orders it but that's if you think about it in Bitcoin terms that's who determines which one is double spent which is a double spend and you you you take that out and which one is not so it's actually a very powerful central entity and they control that central entity the ordering service everything else is it's not actually federated it's it's a central point that determines which transactions go in and which transactions don't oh interesting so if I'm doing like supply if I'm one of you know multiple companies doing supply chain using a hyper ledger blockchain then somehow hyper ledger is sort of like the referee of different transactions like if there's some kind of dispute yeah yeah that's that's what they call the ordering service and it's literally ordering the transactions and then if a new one comes in that conflicts with previously ordered transactions then and then it's not allowed in that's that's how it works but yeah I mean but they get to determine the order so that's that's kind of a central point of failure to me I'll have to have Brian on my show and asking about that I also noticed that now that you've left Paxos you have been focusing a lot on developer education and February you announced platypus labs at washing capital which probably at least and you can correct me is trying to educate developers in some respect to actually work on Bitcoin and you also yourself we're at of launching an educational course called programming blockchain can you describe these two initiatives that you're doing and how they differ from each other yeah sure so I started programming blockchain last year because I saw that the biggest risk to the Bitcoin ecosystem is the lack of developers lack of good developers and and it's not that Bitcoin develop is super super difficult I mean it is difficult but it's something that I think any intelligent person can you know pick up it's just that there weren't resources to you know get people in and get a lot of these people that were interested in to you know to learn a lot about this stuff in a reasonable way so I created the course it's a two day course live and in-person and I've done 15 of these already but basically they sit in a classroom it's eight hours each day and I go through from the very basics it's more or less like high school met at level math something called finite fields and elliptic curves and go all the way through the transaction hex dump and analyzing that and figuring out how to build those and going all the way to you know the network programming and figuring out how to grab transactions and blocks from the network and how all of that works so it's two days a very intense instruction it's it's about a semesters worth of information and I don't say that lightly I actually had professor at the University of Texas in Austin asked me to do this course over an entire semester there so and it's the same exact material but that's ok how can somebody even take in an amount of information in two days you would think that that would be hard but amazingly you know like university education I found is a little less efficient than it could be and if you're surrounded by a lot of people that are also learning the same thing and and you know you you have exercises and things it turns out to be pretty good or at least that's what I'm told so Wow yeah as somebody who did like philosophy and literature and had to read you know like multiple books every week like somehow I don't think you could do that for what I studied with anyway yeah yeah it's a little different than philosophy of reading lots of books yeah but yeah that that that's a programming block chain I you know I have one in July and Denver and San Francisco and I applied to one in Chicago and possibly the in Prague and I've done these all over the world right I've done them in in North America Europe Asia I just did one in Sao Paulo so you know it's it's it's been really good the reaction by the community has been very positive and and you know a lot of the developers that are trained go on to contribute to a lot of these projects or founding their own company so really wait do you have like numbers on that because I just I have to admit that I'm skeptical that somebody can take a two day course and then suddenly be contributing is it to Bitcoin is it to the Bitcoin cord code base that they're contributing or well I have at least one and I can I can refer you to him later but yeah I this is something that I out for all of my students is if you manage manage to get a non-trivial pull request merged into core then I will pay you 500 dollars and they and one person has taken me up on it other people are looking into it part of it is that like core developments actually very very strict and you know doing that particular thing takes a lot of work and you know a lot of review and understanding that code base which is separate from learning the Bitcoin protocol but I can yeah Chris Cloverdale took my course in London back in January he had emerged he had a PR merge like and I wanna I want to say not too long ago so you know I yeah it's there there are people that are doing you know like that have gotten jobs at different companies as well after the course so yeah that's that's what they do and what about platypus labs yeah so platypus labs is a different initiative and this is to support open source development and I think you know the my partners at blockchain capital that you know the bitcoin developers are adding a lot of value to the community but there's not a very easy way for a lot of these companies that are getting a lot of value out of it to contribute back and some of them certainly sponsor core developers and so on but they wanted something that was more systematized and and long term and this is where we came up with platypus labs and and this is something that if you think about it a venture capital firm is actually really well positioned to provide because they have a lot of portfolio companies that are benefiting from this and they have money so between those things we can build out a lab where we can support a lot of open source work that you know for a long time a lot of these guys weren't getting paid for but now you can at least provide them with a space maybe even provide something of a stipend or something like that and you know help educate more people as we go you know you can we have all these plans for you know fellows and residents and associates and so on that would come through the lab and help grow the ecosystem from that perspective so they're like paid a full-time salary and they apply or yeah so these are all questions that we're still wrestling with I like my partners are currently moving offices in San Francisco in part because of this right look we we have a large office space that we got so that we can have a lot of people that can work out of there what that exactly looks like and how much they get paid and things that's still to be worked out but that's that's the vision is that we would have a place where a lot of people can come and work on their coin together so I was curious do you consider yourself a Bitcoin maximalist and when you answer the question can you define it so people who don't know what that means will well so the way I define Bix Bitcoin maximalism is that money has a tendency to have be winner-take-all and I personally believe that Bitcoin will be that winner and now everything else that's not claiming to be money from what I've seen tends to have very money like properties to them so aetherium could always tells people were not money were like oil to bitcoins gold or something like that but if you look at the value and what you know the token value versus like what people actually use it for you know you know however many crypto kitties you've created that's you know the the amount of etherium that you pay for that or whatever it's it doesn't justify if you're in salvation the only way that valuation makes any sense at all is if you think of it as a monetary thing so from that sense I am a Bitcoin maximalist because I think money is the main use case and in in the realm of all crypto currencies I think there will be one winner and I think that winner will be Bitcoin with the history of technology shows I'd quite often not always but quite often the first example of something does not become the dominant example of that thing so for instance then you know like Google with search or Facebook with a social network so so why are you so convinced that this is going to happen well that's true of technology but not necessary not necessarily true of monetary mediums so you look at something like gold that it had a lot of competitors with silver and other metals but it kept it and what and here's the thing that's weird about Bitcoin a lot of people think in terms of technology but it's economics are very much like money so you know there's this tendency to want to change everything which is normal for technology but you know for something like money don't want it to change so there's this tension that's constantly brought up all over the place and cryptocurrency for that reason you know you add the tension between these two things for me the reason why bitcoin is going to win or it has won is because of the network effect scarcity is its own network effect there's a reason why you know no competitor to eat like no auction competitor - eBay has you know existed in the last 20 years you know buyers want to be where the sellers are and the sellers one of you are the buyers are so you know I mean you can you could try to launch it I think Amazon at one point tried Amazon options or something there were there were other competitors that tried but it's it's a that's a very very hard thing to overcome is that network effect and money certainly has that once you have a lot of people that value something scarce something scarcity then then it's harder for other ones to overcome that so for me that's why it's Bitcoin is the main winner is because it has the network effect it's also I think maybe I'm being a little biased here but I think it has the best technology the most well tested I mean that this part is objective it's it's been the most well tested in terms of time you know it's lasted a lot longer than some of these others and it's gone through a lot so it's pretty easy to do if you think about it there were a lot of coins that came out in 2011 that are nowhere right now I mean have you heard of ix coin or tena bricks like okay they they were there at in 2011 they they've like completely well not completely disappear but they they've more or less disappeared off of everyone's radar and and this is because you know they they weren't very viable and also like a lot of people felt like the founders were being unfair they did a large pre mine and stuff like that which is the exact same thing that we see in a lot of I see and all coin launches today but back then I think people were a little more offended by that sort of thing but you know that that's that's the that's the reason why I think the coin is going to win it's it's lasted longer and it's scarce and a lot more people value it and it's got the network effect so I I don't see those things as very easily overcome oval and if you are to overcome it then you need to be at least an order of magnitude that are not like okay well we have like two and a half minute blocks therefore we're gonna win it's okay well we we are like ten times better in every aspect that that that would be that would be compelling pretty much everything out there is a tiny improvement if if at all most of it isn't an improvement at all there's a lot of these all coins are solving problems that don't exist or aren't problems at all so yeah I mean that that's been my assessment of the things that I've seen well if you are so convinced that bitcoin is going to be the winner and kind of has already secured that spot as a venture capitalist how do you value find anything to invest in well there are lots of you know companies that are related to Bitcoin that you can invest in for certain I mean they're there's a lot of companies that are making money I mean if you if you somehow found a way to invest in finance I think you'd be doing pretty well right now but what about would you support the fact that finance lists so many tokens including like brand-new ones we know with kind of somewhat minimal due diligence I mean that's I personally wouldn't but my partners might feel differently and you know that's part of what it means to be in a venture capital farm is you know you lay out your case but you know they might not agree right like III I think investing in Bitcoin businesses is can be pretty good depending on what business they're in I mean some of the I mean in any industry you're gonna find companies that are really stupid and other is that our really good so you know but of course like like you were implying there the the bar is set higher because you're going to have to measure them against Bitcoin and not the US dollar we're going to discuss smart contracts Oracle's

this summer I'm speaking with Jimmy song a partner at blockchain capital let's talk about your medium post the truth about smart contracts that was super fun to read why don't you summarize the main points for listeners well so smart contracts have been hyped a lot in the past year only rivaling blockchain in this space as a word that people think they understand but don't really so I tried to lay out in that article exactly what a partner smart contract is and why it's actually not that tenable for almost anything other than digital bearer instruments and by digital bearer instruments I mean stuff like Bitcoin where possession of the digital token is it there's no physical or real-world corollary to that or some rights or anything else because you know that that leads to the Oracle problem and so on but that the idea of smart contracts I think has been oversold and people are thinking oh you know this going to replace lawyers and all this other stuff and and I I guess in I had my black hat on there and sort of threw a little cold water on it so I I do agree that smart contracts probably won't work in the most idealistic way in which a lot of people write about them but why do you think that that means that smart contracts will never work because I sort of feel like if you look at the history of technology it it's a it's no - were really good bet in general - say like something will never work do you know what I mean so like do you ever worry that you might end up sounding like those technologists back in the early days of the internet who would talk about like why HTTP was a poor technology no I mean I think this is kind of like saying why two plus two won't equal five i I don't I don't see it that way at all the you you can do things in a centralized way you know you can have contract if you trust a third party you know like with a normal contract this would be called like an escrow or something and you know or a judge or somebody that you both trust then and they'd be more or less tell you what the decisions going to be should the contract go a certain way or whatever then that's fine that that's that's how it's done in the real world with a smart contract the promises that you don't have to trust anybody and the fact of the matter is as soon as you add you know an external reality right like whether or not the 49ers won last night or something like that you you add a trust factor and as soon as you add a trust factor then it becomes an intractable problem because you have to first of all secure that Oracle right like you have to make sure that that person won't collude with the other person well it doesn't have you know some other state is something something else some other way in which they can get corrupted like you know make sure that they're not hacked you know you you not only have to trust their integrity which I think it shouldn't be too hard right like but you also have to trust their competence in being able to secure you know whatever method in which they give information into the blockchain so you know the the it's it's an intractable problem unless it's all digital bearer instruments in which case you don't need an Oracle but if you need an Oracle I mean you you get to you you get to this really weird state where you have you know the Nash equilibrium on the game theory ends up being like okay it's rational for me to go kidnap that person and threaten their life unless they you know like put put something on and like the downside of that is I might go to jail but the upside is I make like 100 million dollars right like yeah there are weird situations like that and if you don't think like people make those kinds of decisions criminals make them all the time right like and that's that's that that's the kind of thing that you have to think about when when you're thinking about these smart contract things but what about something like for some reason I don't know why I am blanking a little bit but I think it's auger where people bet on the outcomes of things and then based on the way you report you that affects your reputation and so you wouldn't necessarily you what you could do is have the same system but not necessarily rely on a single Oracle it could be something where you know people are staking their reputations to honestly report on the outcome of an event so why do you think that won't work well so again this is this gets towards this is in the article usually when you when you propose something else to cover up the fact that you have less security on the previous one you know that that itself usually has a lot more holes and then it can get more and more complicated to the point where it's like very very difficult to analyze and only after its release do you find out that there's a hole in it but yeah you could have multiple Oracle's right and this is this is a typical thing and you say okay well we'll have five of them well how do you make sure that they're all five independent people you could I could be the same exact person and I can I can con somebody into into and I could even bet with somebody else and I can I can adjudicate fine for you know a year and then I can have a long con afterwards and that a significant amount all flat and you go okay well you know three or four four or five of these Oracle's have to agree in order for me to collect from you so you money is safe why don't you bet me a million dollars on something and then I I pulled that long con I end up you know reporting the opposite of the actual result and then I run away with the money like what are you gonna do about it right like there but but so I totally get how this is the case with small numbers but you know an example that I pointed out about auger where you're really using the crowd it would be very difficult to do any kind of manipulation like that right I don't know I I mean I I think Paul stork has done an analysis of auger and you should and I haven't done a completed analysis of what what that's all about but he he's done it and he he thinks there are all sorts of holes based on that and you know and you know I I'm not gonna pretend I know the details of their stuff but this is generally true the more complicated you make something the larger the attack surface is going to be and the harder gets analyzed and and to say okay well this is going to work is it's more faith than anything you're not you're not actually knowing if it's actually going to work until it's built and some you know a lot of transactions have gone through it and you know if if Paul can point something out after like reading their paper I mean I would guess that there's a lot more exploits to be found or flaws to be found that it isn't incumbent on me to find a flaw in the system it's incumbent on the system to prove that it is secure like to say that it's secure because I can't find a hole in it at this moment is the wrong way to go about it you have to be the one to say this system is secure because we've thought of all of these cases yeah although I think my my questions are more in the direction of how can you be so certain that it won't be that's more where yes I mean like if you can solve the Oracle problem there's PI a lot of money in it for you but my but I've examined the Oracle problem and it it looks intractable to me you you always have to end up trusting somebody if you can't trust that person if you can trust some other entity or whatever then you need to justify why you can trust that entity and it's a McGann the whole point of a smart contract is that so that you don't need to trust other people you can just trust in the code or something like that and if you if you I actually want to dispute that assumption as well because you mentioned this earlier where you said oh if you have say tokenized gold or something on a blockchain and you said what if somebody steals that gold bar then what but I think I think the judicial system or the legal system does have ways of you know defining who would own something in that case and I think just because some somebody steal something doesn't mean that they own it now okay but that's again trusting somebody else right trusting the jurisdiction you happen to be in if you do you feel that there's no way where you can have this combined you know coz because what if there's something like with certain smart contract functions you know we've got these standardized libraries that open Zeppelin is trying to create for smart contract functions and they do discrete tasks I guess you could say and then have that in some way at a certain point merged or not merged but touch upon the legal system does that sound like something that would be viable to you well if you're doing that then why are you using a smart contract at all if you're going to rely on them then you should have a centralized service that's run by those same people that you already trust or something like that that that'd be way more efficient than you know paying all the different costs of a blockchain and decentralization and all this software and all that stuff it doesn't make any sense to me like that's like that that would be right for disruption by something that's a more centralized because it's already centralized you're trusting the legal system and and - and if you are trying to do something that like that with gold say say you made a chain that supposedly decentralized that relies on like gold or whatever okay what if that gold bar is in Afghanistan somebody like who owns that gold bar if it gets stolen out of the vault who and but the token says I have it you know who you know who does it go to right like you can't you can't link a digital token to a real-world thing without trusting somebody and the whole point of a smart contract is that you don't need to trust anybody so if you if you're going to trust someone anyway like you are saying like okay well we can we can have the judicial system settle it then then it's it's a are more efficient system if they do the running of of the entire thing because that's ultimately who we are gonna go to anyway so why do you need to play with smart contracts and all this other stuff like what yeah I agree that crossing jurisdictions does present a lot of difficulties like if the laws differ and people are trying to transact in different jurisdictions but I do think the way and I am by no means a legal expert so please nobody listen to what I'm saying take it for for some kind of definitive commentary here but you know as far as I understand when there's sort of like legal precedent around something like once you sort of say like this is how we're gonna decide situations like these and that you know obviously would apply so maybe in the beginning when there are these kinds of questions some of them might be settled via courts but then going forward you wouldn't you would have some kind of confidence okay if I use the smart contract in this way under these specific circumstances it should be okay to cover these different scenarios or something like that I'm making it up but I think you see where I'm going I mean I'm not sure why what that what the smart contract gets you in that case because in the case of buying a house you know you would mention that using this more contract would be expensive but I actually think most people tend to think it would be quite cheaper than rather than using an escrow agent and I think faster well all right so say you say it's a house right and you know the government tells you you own the house and they issue you a title or something like that I'd say you put that title on the blockchain with a smart contract and then you trade you do an atomic swap for that house for I don't know 500 et room or something like that and then you do a swap you now own the house except now your ascent essentially trusting that jurisdiction to honor the fact that this token went through of course and you know I don't know maybe there's case law and that you know that that's been established by that point where it says okay this went through what are you gaining by using using the blockchain to do that I mean they could have just paid you 500 etherium and you you get the house what what are you gaining right like the ability to simultaneously swap the payment and the the deed to the house without having to without one person having to go first and trusting that the other person will also but the courts going to enforce that anyway I mean like what what like if you if your trust me you don't have to go to a court you both like enter into this agreement to do that by by both you're gonna need to go to anyway because they they need to update the registry to say okay well now you actually own it like I like the token on the blockchain that represents the house remember that that's also got like a whole set of ulnar abilities if somebody loses the key and then they that moves around now now the courts gonna have to issue another token like if yeah we're weird weird set of scenarios where the token on the blockchain and the actual physical item can get sort of skewed right like they no longer reflect reality that and like keeping that in sync it's not so simple so I I'm not sure what you gain out of it I mean like if you're if one party goes first and the other doesn't you're relying on the judicial system to enforce it anyway why wouldn't you trust that judicial system in the first place like I try to avoid going to the courts when they buy their house I think that's the point so you would know that the judicial system was there but you're hoping to not use it and so if you use the technology then the contractor will enforce that they get swapped simultaneously okay whatever benefit you get out of that is is the exact same on the opposite side if that token gets stolen because you're now have to going to keys to that token gets stolen because now you're gonna have to do the same thing to say okay this is actually my house but my token got stolen from me from this other person but I do think here we are in this summer where everybody's talking about custody and we have all these new custody solutions rolling out and I can see a scenario in which similar types of technology do get used for even these cases but I do agree with you tokenizing a deed to a house is a scary proposition at this point by actually I want it I we have so much to get to when we're running out of time and as you know we want to reserve time at the end for something special for our listeners but one more quick question before we move on to that is because you are such a big proponent of Bitcoin and here we have gone through this period where there was this big saga about whether or not this size of the block should go up or whether it shouldn't and instead they decided to keep the block small which is basically for listeners who don't know the limit on the number of transactions that can be processed at any given moment in time now everyone is relying on what's called layer 2 or lightning Network to scale Bitcoin so what do you feel could happen to Bitcoin if lightning doesn't see a lot of adoption well so first of all I don't like your characterization of what happened because I didn't keep the block small the blocks went up to two megabytes I like they the Segway was a block size increase and a lot of people seem to have this belief that we kept the you know block sizes a way of reorganizing the blocks yeah take it more no no no it's it's now it's it's to bang bytes right so it was a block size increase there's this false dichotomy limit no that's that's only for old notes I mean you can go to like coin dance and look at the block sizes they're all over a megabyte for a lot right I mean yes okay so the amount of data going through yes is higher than that no I don't agree on this III don't know agreed in this characterization that it was small blocks versus big blocks it was how to you know different ways to get bigger blocks that's that's what the debate was about knocking about small versus big that's that's not what it was at all okay but regardless the number of transactions the increase in the number of transactions wasn't huge and here we are where Bitcoin sure it's definitely seen some adoption but still I'm sure in terms of the percentage of people around the world who house in Bitcoin it's a very very teeny tiny number so if lightning really is going to take the rest of the way what would happen a Bitcoin if it doesn't get that kind of adoption well so first I I think you can you can see the fact I think it was doubling of the block size I think for me that's a pretty large increase in throughput and you can see that you know the fee pressure has relieved significantly as a result of that there are I mean you look at the fees back in December before a lot of these large companies implemented said would and that batch processing and things like that and you know the fees were very high largely because they weren't implementing a lot of these things but now it's like you know transaction is clear very fast a lot of transaction fees are very very low so I also disagree with this assessment that it's it wasn't a huge increase I think it was a very large increase and I think well I think the Bitcoin network has benefited significantly from segue but but what I'm trying to say is if you know we doubled it from this moment in time where adoption was very small doubling from a very very small number is still a small number and presumably like I don't know 20 years from now 30 years from now if the coin really does take off then it will be much more than double from last year right so that's what I'm asking about yeah and and this is why a lot of the developers wanted to go towards said wood because a block size increase only gets you a linear increase you know lightning or an other second layer solutions get you a much like orders of magnitude multiple orders of magnitude increase and this is what's really exciting about it but I mean the this presumes I think is something of something that there's an implicit assumption here which is that you know we need to transact a lot to make Bitcoin useful or that you know people need to be sending Bitcoin back and forth constantly for it to be useful and I don't think that's necessarily true if you're using Bitcoin as a store value if you're using it as a store of value you but you can buy it once and then you can get it out sometime you know in the future but that's only really two transactions not like a million and and you know that's okay that's a perfectly good way to use Bitcoin and a lot of the people on the Bitcoin cash side a lot of people and a lot of these all coins have this tendency to think okay well you know if you if you're not constantly using it to buy coffee or whatever then you're not actually using the currency and I completely dispute that notion but with regard to medium of exchange I think lightning is the superior solution because it's trustless and it's very fast and you know from what I can tell it's it's gaining a lot of adoption your question however was more about what if people don't use it in that way well if they don't use it in that way that means the market didn't really want it and I'm perfectly comfortable with the market dictating which direction this goes and if and and you know that's kind of a speculative question on a speculative question in my mind let's go to the to the end which reference is something that happened in May that was kind of a bit of a sensation when it happened which was you were on a panel with Joe Lubin who's the CEO of consensus systems and amber ball debt who is the former blockchain lead at JPMorgan Chase and she recently left to found her own startup clover and unfortunately the video at least as of the time of this recording isn't available online yet but well so for that reason for listeners who missed it why don't you give your version of what happened during that debate yeah so I thought it was online like two days ago but then they took it off again and might be on that back on now I anyway here's what happened so amber talked about clover for about ten minutes before a panel our panel was only supposed to be thirty minutes so cut out like ten minutes of it we had 20 minutes to discuss and her first question was what you think of my new company to which Joe replied oh I'm really excited and so on and I basically said all I saw were buzz words I don't know what what it is that you're selling or what you know whether or not this solves any problem in the market and because I have been exposed to so many of these kinds of pitches where you know they they promise lots of vague things use a lot of social signaling with respect to what other companies are on our platform or who were working with as a way to sell things rather than the actual problem being solved so that's that's kind of what started that debate and eventually got to the point where you know we were talking back and forth a lot it was a very lively and spirited debate you can feel the energy in the room but before I think that that whole debate I think people were starting to fall asleep because it was like four or five in the afternoon but you know as soon as that came up people started like wow like I can't believe this is going on and the question that amber asked was you know in five years what is going to happen you know with with respect to blockchain and and Joe sort of sarcastically said it's only gonna be Bitcoin I'm just kidding here are all the things that that are going to happen with the blockchain and my response was more or less well you know let's look at some some projects from five years ago 2013 where's master Kline what's uh what storge doing what's made safe coin doing how about you know factum you know what what are all these projects doing they haven't done anything and they have no users most of them are like not used by anybody and you know they had as much hype as a lot of this stuff today so I was like you know what I think most of the projects today will also be complete hype and like most of them won't do anything and I'd be surprised if there was even one I think Bitcoin is going to be the major major thing that's around in five years that anyone points to and and after right after I said that Joe said if we can find some crisp criteria I'll bet you any amount of Bitcoin that you are wrong and he he told me to you know contact him afterwards he tweeted after the panel you know that was fun Jimmy we'll be in touch I've tweeted it I'm twice now he hasn't responded so I don't know what's going on all right well listeners don't know this but I'm gonna explain that we actually did try to get Joe on a last minute but it was too last-minute and I know from personal experience that he keeps an extremely busy schedule so I think if we had thought of this further in advance maybe it would have worked out but I did ask Jimmy to come up with some metrics that he would like to use too for the bet and also maybe names you know something like a time frame and an amount that you'd like to wager on your bed so why don't you put that proposal out there and after this gets published then we can let Joe know and we'll see what he countered offers yeah I've been trying to get in touch with him so he could do this but he hasn't responded so hopefully this this will be a good forum to do this the the way in which you can measure whether or not an app on a phone is popular is with two metrics that a lot of you know app writers or app programmers and app companies really know about which is daily active users and monthly active users I think those would be pretty decent metrics for you know determining whether or not a a block quote unquote blockchain decentralized app or something like that has a lot of traction so I I would I think something like in five years let's if there are five apps that have you know like a mid tier app on Android or iOS would be something like 10,000 daily active users or something like that and a hundred thousand monthly active users some somewhere along those lines you know five apps the five D apps right these centralized applications that use the blockchain that are on iOS or something like that and use a centralized date but something that uses a blockchain like like he was saying that have 10,000 daily active users a hundred thousand monthly active users oh wait I don't understand because it wouldn't that be if it's ten thousand daily then wouldn't it be 300 thousand monthly I don't yeah so that's David so daily active users are basically people that log on every day so there's ten thousand of those that like that are oh no I got it okay but yeah monthly is just people that show up at least once a month so so you you could have something like that and then make sure that you know of all five you know sustain it for like six months or something so it's not like a one-off and you can't game it by like just ping a bunch of people to try it for a month or something the very least it would it would cost them a lot of money to to get them to try it for that long but something like that where you have five different apps the apps that you utilize the blockchain that have a product that where you have 10,000 daily active users hundred thousand monthly active users sustained for six months I think that's fair and I I'm willing to bet him some amount a Bitcoin I don't know what what he would be comfortable with and I was right at what point in the future would you want to check in on this oh five years because that was the that was the question that amber proposed in five years from now and and in fact heard that people at consensus were like hey we got to have you and Joe on a panel in five years so we can talk about what is this 2020 we can start scheduling that conference now I'll be the host so that way um you know I can generate the ticket sales anyway okay okay well it's so great having you and unchain thanks for coming on the show oh and before we go where can people learn more about you and your work yeah so I'm I'm on Twitter at Jimmy's song I'm medium at Jimmy song I write a bunch of articles you can find the code that I'm doing on github at Jimmy song I run my programming blockchain seminar the next one is in Denver and San Francisco and July and probably Chicago and August and Czech Republic Prague and October but yeah those are the ones coming up I also do a youtube show I have a YouTube channel off chain with Jimmy song and I am in the process of writing a book for O'Reilly programming Bitcoin and that's that's going to be fun hopefully I can get that out before the end of the year but yeah those are where you can find great all right well thanks so much for joining us thank you for having me thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Jimmy and check out
