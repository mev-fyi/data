hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no-hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin in August and San Francisco I spoke and moderated a panel at singularity University's Global Summit where a whole section of one day was devoted to blockchain issues after a brief talk by me and then longer presentations by Bill bar height of Abra and Miki Costa of Atlas Holdings group we 3 along with Galia Bernard C of Bank are at a panel discussion on the current state of crypto and how to get user adoption finally the blockchain programming finished up with a taco on blockchain for good-bye Carol appoint a previous guest on my podcast unconfirmed and Ann Connolly blockchain faculty at singularity University all the talks and panels were so great and I was really honored to speak at singularity enjoy the show start engine is a regulated IC o---- platform with a community of a hundred and fifty five thousand plus registered users that's focused on issuing tokenized securities go to start engine comm slash unchained for 20% discount on setup services to want your regulated IC o---- this is not legal advice hi everyone welcome to our block I'm at crypto and blockchain thanks for coming I'm going to talk a little bit about the power of decentralization and then we've got some other speakers and panelists you've probably heard this idea that Bitcoin and other Kryptonian air all you need is some code some computers to run your blockchain and voila money the idea that you can create verifiably scarce digital assets is certainly novel and represents a breakthrough in our history but I actually think that another potentially more powerful development is getting little attention and that is the ability to remake the big businesses that we know today as networks that are decentralized peer-to-peer and user owned yes Facebook Google and Amazon our tech giants and we won't we rely on their products and services day in and day out so probably seems hard to imagine a time when they might be replaced by user driven versions it seems obvious that a business and team with employees who are motivated by stock options could out-compete any challengers that are being built by users around the globe who are just everyday people interested in this project and aren't necessarily motivated by quarterly performance reviews or by a weekly paycheck but to remember the power of decentralized networks just look at what happened between Wikipedia and P Encarta encyclopedia the first obviously was a crowd-sourced version and the latter Encarta was run by Microsoft but now when you search for Encarta on the internet the first search engine results is not Encarta because it no longer exists it's the Wikipedia entry for Encarta yesterday my friend Alex Gladstein of the human rights foundation spoke about the power of decentralization as it pertains to Bitcoin I'd like to also highlight the possibility that user owned decentralized networks can remake vast portions of our economy and while it may seem far-fetched who will be the owners who reap the rewards of those networks that could potentially displace today's tech giants quite possibly we the users whether or not crypto fulfills this vision is an open question after all at the beginning of the internet there was a lot of rhetoric about how the internet would bring peer-to-peer communication and here we are 20 years later communicating mostly over Google Facebook Twitter Linkedin Skype whatsapp meme you know any of these big centralized services so will the crypto communities idealistic notions of decentralisation come to fruition well we see I use their own eBay I use their owned uber they use their own Twitter to listen to crypto people talk it seems like a foregone conclusion but like I said at the beginning of the internet everybody thought the same thing would happen with communication that it would be peer-to-peer so will it happen I can't tell you the answer lies in the hands of people like you please welcome founder and CEO of abre bill bar height all right good afternoon by the way Laura is too humble to promote her podcasts so if you don't listen to unchained downloaded it's the one podcast in crypto land that I listen to religiously even though she hasn't had any on yet so I'm gonna give you my take on where this is all going what a crazy year this has been if you had told me three months before we launched abre into beta that the price of Bitcoin would get to almost twenty thousand and then fall down just you know five thousand over whoever it was and you know there'd be a fork Five Forks of Bitcoin I did it just it just wouldn't make sense but yet here we are so I'm gonna give you my take in the next few minutes on where it's all going and then I'm happy to make it a little bit interactive and I know we're gonna have a longer discussion after the next presentation as well okay so using my exponential technology-based time machine I was able to fly four years into the future before before this talk and I was able to see a couple of really interesting press releases that I want to give you some insights on because maybe you'll want to invest in these companies now so this is a kid I met named Samuel in Tanzania Samuel has got a light in his home for the first time because his family has purchased a new solar system that basically uses their Kenya and Tanzania based and paste the wallets to make monthly lease payments on a new solar panel it's really cool they've now sold four years later over a million of these installations the repayment rate is like a hundred percent because people want the lights nobody steals them because they guard them really well it's the the company is doing phenomenally well the challenge up until now 2022 has been how do we do this outside of these markets because in Kenya Uganda Tanzania everybody has that in pace of wallet so they can make that $5 weekly payment on these solar panels what we really want to do is we wanted to play them globally but how does somebody in Indonesia pay how does somebody in India pay or to rural China so they finally figured out that using cryptocurrency technology they could bring this service global or make the service global so that they could deploy it in over a hundred countries so effectively what they launched is is the world's first pay-as-you-go solar service live in over a hundred countries really cool this is Angelica she's a farmer in in rural Philippines that I met also in my time machine and she actually takes money that she makes and puts it in these micro investing services she actually buys exposure to US stock indices all the way from the Philippines in tiny pennies at a time and over time it's it's it's balloon to a very significant value the challenge for them has been the same this company that provides this service right we have to go on the ground and partner with lots of banks to make this service work in just a couple of countries but now we've figured out that using cryptocurrency technology we can actually make this service work live globally in actually more than a hundred countries and they've done that now it's really fascinating so how is it possible like I have tried to deploy mobile banking services in like 15 countries and gave up because I was I had a headache perpetually for years right but here we are right four years later and they've been able to figure out how to deploy these services right how is this possible right so I figured out what their what they're doing and the service has to obviously by definition be globally accessible but the payment mechanism will come back to that in a second obviously it has to be internet-based but the payment mechanism not only has to be stable preferably in a currency that the consumer understands the average consumer doesn't know what Manero is but but if they're if you're in if you're in Indonesia they know rupees so how do you reconcile the fact that I want to put money in the system in rupiah's but in order to make that solar panel work in a hundred countries right I probably can't use local banks in a hundred countries to make the payment the money flows just don't work so let's take a step back and talk about how not to do this okay so you probably can glance at this for about five seconds and find a common thread these are all currencies that have effectively failed actually I'll take a step back every country every currency in history at some point has failed either that or it's going to fail at some point right these are the ones that have failed spectacularly with the most recent one of course being the Bulevar which more or less capitulated this week right so over time I have counted well let's just go back 100 years right there's about 30 currencies that have failed due to hyperinflation and currency inflation over the last hundred or so years I want to show you because this is gonna paint a story as to where where I think we're going what happens when you start printing money as if it didn't matter right so most people focus on inflation as meaning the cost of goods and services think a little bit differently about it look at the Green Line that's simply the amount of money in circulation now my mother has a 1950 something Mickey Mantle baseball card I think it's worth a lot of money I'm not sure how much it's worth but what it's worth is dependent upon how many there are so let's say she had the only one in existence and it was worth 10 to 10 thousand dollars now if she found out tomorrow there were two in circulation it would stand the reason that card might actually now be worth about $5,000 right but for some strange reason after hundreds of years governments refuse to get that basic concept over and over and over they make the same mistake so here's the u.s. all right look at what's happened to our money supply in the last three years let me just bring up this picture again right now I'm not I'm not telling you what's going to happen I'm just asking you to accept the fact that history leaves Clues right and here's clue number one alright enough of that what happens to our money in the last I don't know 100 years right basically the purchasing power of the dollar has fallen ninety percent in the last hundred years the only reason that most of us aren't up in arms around it about it is either one we weren't here a hundred years ago or two if we were here a hundred years ago we're now dead that's the only reason if we were living to be 150 that'd be riots in the streets because your money would be worthless and you would know it right so the pattern here is very clear money was based upon a commodity but a standard up until the the World War two and what happened after World War two is very clear it is also equally clear so now let's relate this back to my earlier research which said we need a stable some kind of stable store of value to make these global payment systems work is it really finally time for a new commodity standard now obviously this talks about Bitcoin so you can guess where I'm going but I tried to find a parallel to say you know is is there some kind of history lesson to be learned from what happened with the internet itself and I actually did some research it was amazing what I found okay here's a quotient you're actually a friend of mine I'm not picking on Karen she knows payments I would claim she doesn't really know Bitcoin but there's a lot of people don't know Bitcoin and make comments on Bitcoin Bitcoin has only two proven use cases after eight years criminal activity it's speculation and there's so much naysaying hyperbole out there I just picked one it fairly randomly but I went back and searched archives on the Internet itself or news about the internet self and found this I predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophic ly collapse and this is the person who actually created Ethernet okay basically said the india theater i can't basically survive under its own weight obviously the one on the right is easy to prove because it's already transpired that he was wrong and I believe that the code on the left is mathematically provably wrong which I'm going to show you now right meaning I can actually show you provable use cases as to where it is the only technology that can solve the problem today that don't involve criminal activity and speculation now let's extend that internet analogy these are the businesses that have either died been transformed in some way because of the internet right again easy to prove it's already happened these are the businesses that I believe in the same vein will be either replaced transformed killed or dramatically change in some way because of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology and when I say blockchain technology I'm still talking about Bitcoin okay all right let's get this out of the way here's the market cap this is an asset class that did not exist ten years ago right the fact forget about the the volatility swings the most important feature of Bitcoin as it relates to volatility is that one Bitcoin today is one Bitcoin tomorrow okay it's not the price today because if well everything else I'm saying is true it's the fungibility of Bitcoin that matters not its price in dollars but the fact that it didn't exist ten years ago and we're all sitting in fact that you're sitting here listening to talk to me talk about this I've been at this for 30 years I've been in crypto at the CIA finance at Goldman Sachs I worked on the first credit card gate where in the internet I can tell you I've never believed more fundamentally in my life that something is here to stay that has a proven itself yet than this right this is about to change everything the same way I believed in 95 that the internet was about to change everything but what is really the killer app for this well I'm gonna give you three right we're gonna talk about cross-border payments investing and asset finance and then relate it back to what I found when I traveled into the future so let's talk about cross-border payments most of you have heard of the the remittance markets about 500 billion gets remitted on on the grid meaning via the traditional banking system whether it's Western Union or just bank wires equal amount of money gets remitted Underground's people carrying money back home people using ancient hawala type of solutions where they call a friend to give out money etc etc so that's a trillion dollars which generates probably 50 to 60 a billion dollars in FX and and transaction fees for banks Western Union etc etc okay according to our calculations at Abra if you were to replace not even the user facing aspect of it meaning the pay in and payout would still be in dollars and pesos but just the rails right with Bitcoin at least a hundred basis points would go back into the system meaning to the consumer right would and that's at least you know half of those fees according to my calculation today that's an incredible amount of money that basically is completely wasted now the biggest challenge with that is I don't think Western Union would for example would understand a word of what I just said but but eventually they will right and at that point right here's everything everything is going to change from a money transfer perspective because it will be instant it will be practically free here's an example of a service we've been testing in the Philippines that uses what we call cash tellers on the grounds that effectively are buying and selling legally Bitcoin now the most half of the consumers know they're buying Bitcoin because they're using the tellers to invest in crypto the other half are using the tellers to actually get money on and off a phone in a foreign exchange transaction they only know that they're holding digital pesos they don't actually know that the transaction is happening in Bitcoin the teller makes a small fee which is a fraction of the Western Union Swift fees and everybody's happy and on the US side they can put the money in via ACH just like you do with venmo and so effectively you have a simulated cross-border wire that actually doesn't even leave the Bitcoin network all right decentralized investing what does that mean well let's go back to that original example of micro investing what if I wanted a way to invest in anything in India I wanted to invest in Apple stocks u.s. ETFs gold but I wanted to do it in $1.00 chunks it would be very difficult today very very difficult but what if I could give you a way using Bitcoin based smart contracts to hold the value in a very secure mathematically guaranteed way on a smart phone that would solve a few problems one no central company would be holding the money because if you're using Bitcoin correctly you're actually holding the keys well how can I capture the value of Apple's stock in in in a Bitcoin private key that's on my phone right well what I'm telling you is is not only is that possible if you use a bro you've been using just that to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in transaction volume that we've conducted exactly that way so if you hold anything but Bitcoin in the abra a bitcoin is just stored at a Bitcoin private key anything dollars euros pesos ripple Manero - any other currency what you're actually holding is is a multi-sig Bitcoin smart contract that pegs the value of the coin to that asset right how many of you in just did that good I didn't want you understand that so know what I'm really saying is is that I just basically did the digital equivalent of handing you a bunch of gold so that you're holding the gold and then gave you a derivative contract that tied the gold to anything whatever asked that you chose right all on the Bitcoin blockchain so this is effectively what's going on to accomplish that it doesn't matter what the asset is I could do this with baseball cards so long as there is a liquid market for baseball cards why does this matter well this now makes it legal in a hundred fifty countries to invest in something because there's no third party managing custody there's no third party broker we're simply acting as the counterparty to the contract right and no assets have to change hands because it's all happening on the Bitcoin blockchain it's a huge breakthrough ok now I showed you how money transfer can be made global cheap near free via Bitcoin how investing and by the way you can do this even with mash up of assets so if you take a Apple stock and Google stock and you mash them up you can actually create a new coin right doing this a breeze actually built this stuff sounds a lot like an ETF right ok well stay tuned so now I've showed you how you can enable global investing in a way that's not possible without this technology and how you can do money transfer in a way that's not possible without this technology well let's bring and and this screen is the basis for both of those Solutions let's bring those together in another real-world example that completely hides all of this to the consumer but solves a big problem let's go back to that solar panel example remember I mentioned 1 million plus homes East Africa etc etc all again using the local banking system VM Pisa works great I've tried it it's really a breakthrough for those countries and the penetration is astounding right but what about the company and Coppa that want to do is everywhere that can't because there's no single easy way to pay credit card networks are out of the question because in rural areas the fees are going to be 10% plus FX when they have to settle right and half these consumers won't have bank accounts to begin with they're probably going to want to pay with cash well using that teller model I described where I can easily get crypto on a smartphone right abra can not only solve that problem for solar panels I can solve it for any consumer electronic device washing machine refrigerator anything that you can basically put a sim chip in to create Internet connectivity I can now remotely control to say if you've made that lease payment using a simple crypto wallet you can then use the device so we've actually started building this out we call it instant on leasing in in in Europe they they refer to sometimes as Pago for local services like in Coppa and our intent is to build a stack that we open up to the world where anyone can basically turn a device into a hardware as a service business that will work globally Foxconn made an investment in Avro last year explicitly for this reason ok so now I've just shown you three applications of Bitcoin that actually work with Bitcoin today Bitcoin does not need to be upgraded changed in any way whatsoever for all three of these to work now next generation tech like lightning that helped it's scale are going to be great they're going to help this work even better but this works even without that ok so let's go back to our two press releases right global availability of micro investing pay-as-you-go solar service in a hundred countries it's now clear to me that bitcoin solves these problems even if the consumer doesn't know they're using it which is probably the key which I also think is is highly likely to be the case just like your mother doesn't know what tcp/ip is when she watches Netflix but she still watches Netflix all right that's how fundamental bitcoin is to the future of Commerce but because it addresses all three of these issues globally accessible staple store value and its internet-based okay so I'm happy to answer a couple of questions I think we have a couple of minutes so I don't know if there's a mic floating around but if there's one in the back if we don't get to you fast enough we just shout it out I'll repeat but anybody want to ask question shout it out good hi so what about regulators around the world they're trying to figure out a way to I don't know to stop to regulate money transfers remittances across the world because they're actually de facto disrupt the business of Korean barriers so they haven't figured out a way and these these rails bypass a wiki yce or AML process around sure you can't bypass AML any money laundering or know your customer regulation when you touch the banking system you simply can't but what you can do is you can store software on a phone the government can't stop you from storing ones and zeros on a smart phone which for example is what happens when you use Abra there's actually a private key on your phone there's no central custodian so they recognize that they even the Chinese government doesn't stop people from storing private keys on a smart phone to own cryptocurrency right they don't allow public exchanges to access the banking system but they don't stop people from owning crypto most people are simply buying it on the street in exchange for cash using local Bitcoin and other services so the people that are causing that green line up into the right definitely are not excited a lot of them about this but the good news is they can't stop it at large scale they can make blips along the way but long term I have fought every crypto battle Under the Sun I thought export export rules at Netscape in the mid 90s on weapons-grade cryptography we lost and the government's will lose this battle as well and have no choice but to embrace it and hyperinflation will finally be a thing of the past in my opinion may take 25 years but that's okay hi my name is David why do you say that it is a stable store of value despite the volatility and that we notice in the graph pretty reasonable why is it a stable store value for two reasons one because it's fungible meaning the most important quality of Bitcoin is is that one Bitcoin is always equal to one Bitcoin just like one dollar is always equal to one dollar that's just common sense the second is via those smart contracts I can actually in a stable manner store an equivalent value of any asset in a Bitcoin smart contract that's how our app works today whether it's dollars or Apple stock or other crypto currencies makes no difference right most people don't realize that Bitcoin its core it's programmable money right it's not just digital gold abbyr is simply using using the crypto Bitcoin as programmable money the way it was intended to be used I believe we're the first company to figure out how to do that but but that's what it is at its core two questions first is Bitcoin is not very fast yesterday somebody mentioned a network like lightning yeah which should enhance this second question is is there any other currency like Bitcoin yes so I commented on lightning a couple minutes ago but just to reiterate what that is so Bitcoin today it's not this really slow compared to fiat what it is is limited in throughput which has the net effect of you can only process so many transactions and a given time frame there's a second what we call a second layer technology called lightning a lightning Network that basically has figured out how to on top of the Bitcoin network process and a near endless number of transactions and then settle those transactions on to the Bitcoin networks but do it in a way that preserves the privacy and the best benefits of Bitcoin along the way the light your network is now being deployed there's thousands of these Lightning nodes live all over the world what's interesting about it actually could represent a an opportunity for banks to provide services in crypto and we'll see what happens what was your second question again Oh some of the currency it's a Bitcoin yes so there are many crypto currencies some are actually Forks of Bitcoin litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin who you know their properties are they prop they allow more transaction throughput there's other brand-new key theorem Neos is a new currency there's there's literally hundreds of crypto currencies out there all have different kind of technology benefits and advances and things that they're trying to do to compete with Bitcoin we love the technology of having lots of different Kryptos because it propels the whole space forward right and you can go to either abre comm or other places that read about the differences some are trying to solve different problems privacy transaction volume throughput you know IOT connectivity whatever there's a million reasons to create a new currency these days right yeah good questions so so to the two points made to address work how do we reconcile though the large holders of Bitcoin who may not be using the Bitcoin is holding it as Wales and how do we address this issue of Chinese based mining centralization so so both are related actually so I don't know if any of you here and if you're attending singularity I'm sure this would be interesting to you read some of the basic go to you know Roth Barney ins web sites or whatever and just read some very basic tenets of Austrian economics and they wrote about what happens when you have a deflationary assets long before the idea of Bitcoin existed right but what's astounding is is Bitcoin is playing out the Austrian playbook to the letter they actually predicted exactly what's happening meaning massive hoarding right meaning the the the short-term volatility driven by the volume of buyers since the whales aren't selling which is exactly what we're seeing right now right but eventually that the prediction goes the asset becomes so valuable right that people have no choice but to loosen up the purse strings to target to take advantage of their newfound wealth and I think we're three or four years away at least from that happening but in the meantime applications like what I showed you are viable using the tech even if even if the whales are in selling in mass because someone's someone's trading and selling that's all we need the second issue has to do with mining centralization this is a more complex issue but but basically a couple of companies have figured out how to game the system by having ASIC chip s-- that are highly optimized for the proof-of-work algorithms that basically are the game you play in order to win Bitcoin every 10 minutes I think a few things are going to happen over the next few years one the crypto algorithms like the elliptic curve Algrim they're gonna have to change we're gonna have to get away from sha-256 because one it's going to become breakable whether it's the you know high in the sky stuff or just smart NSA employees I don't know eventually it's going to become easily breakable which all encryption eventually does and you move on to the next thing so that will hopefully address some of that the second part is is that as the amount of computing power is growing exponentially yes the chips are becoming centralized but the actual ownership of the hash power is not right so if you actually look at the mining pools and break it down into actually who owns the hash power it is not nearly centralized in any meaningful way I don't like the fact that there's I don't care where they're from whether it's China Israel US makes no difference to me but I don't like the fact that it's one company that's got a monopoly on that I don't trust one company to do anything even advert by the way I would like lots of a breeze out there eventually I just want to be the biggest one right but but I do think that this problem will be a non-problem over time for the reasons that I mentioned and I think the crypto algorithm one is the bigger is actually a much bigger concern than the mining chips because Bitcoin doesn't have centralized governance by definition and that's been a challenge for Bitcoin in terms of actually moving the tech forward so when it comes time to change top sha-256 but we really have no choice I hope it happens quickly enough to to not become a problem I think we have time for one one more question then we'll go back to the next all right so you stopped because you asked three questions in one even though they're telling me to get off the stage so okay so there's 150 live crypto currency exchanges now in different countries and so all of them access the banking system in some way it's it's not often easy the amount of paperwork they put you through and some of them it's ridiculous make you make a video of yourself speaking it's crazy just because but but also to their defense the amount of fraud in in the Bitcoin world unfortunately as it relates to the banking system not Bitcoin itself is very high okay but I am aware of at least a hundred and fifty countries now where you can buy back via the banking system and more coming online all the time I think the key to that question is simply time right second question was about an ETF there are 12 applications pending to my knowledge for Bitcoin based ETFs none have been approved yet I believe my opinion and the opinion of a bunch of insiders is one will be approved in the next 6 to 12 months and I think the reason that one will be approved is this pretty much the same reason why one hasn't been approved is that it's people like my friends that are applying in the first batch and that's not what they want to approve they want to approve the old you know gray hair suit guys who are already running ETF so they have comfort that they know these people right or wrong I think that's what they're waiting for and I think that's going to happen because that's that those are some of the applications that are pending so you will see a us-based ETF in my opinion in the next 12 months for that reason I think there's nonsense but that's what's going to happen and I don't remember your last question custody okay so I can talk for an hour on custody but I think custody is the key reason why institutional money is not coming in the crypto and mass yet and why it's about to I used to work at Goldman I can tell you for a fact they've got a whole bunch of people working on building custody services inside the firewall because they are not going to outsource custody to coinbase or any other company it's not going to happen some of the smaller companies might you know some of the more traditional players might get into it but that's the key right if the buy-side at Goldman wants to sell crypto right now they can't where they gonna put it they have no place to put it legally so as soon as they address that which I believe they're doing right now you will see large amounts of institutional money coming into the crypto space in that 24 month time frame and I think that's why it's one key part of the plan but but there are others but it's a big one I think I have to stop because I'm being waived waived off so I guess we'll see you in a in a few minutes

/ unchained this is not legal advice and now please welcome Jason Sosa CEO of the black box foundation which is working on a new form of capitalism using AI and blockchain hello everyone so for thousands of years we have used tools to extend our reach the Industrial Revolution gave us these mechanical muscles and now the information revolution is giving us mechanical minds at present we have a couple of ways in which knowledge workers across the world engage you have can either work for the man or you can work for yourself and they both have trade offs in a corporate environment we've seen statistics of 7080 percent of people that are disengaged from their work a lot of people are experiencing stress family problems they don't want to be stuck in traffic I had a conversation with over a thousand people from Google Apple Intel people across Silicon Valley and around the world because I wanted to understand what makes what drives them are they happy with what they're doing and what they told me was that they have children they have aging parents and they want to go sit on a beach in Thailand they don't want to be stuck being a cog in the machine we've heard these conversations all day today from a number of other speakers but on the gig economy side there is another challenge it's the feast and famine income cycle it is the wearing of many hats because you have to do it all yourself and you're completely isolated so all the centralized solutions that we took a look at from upwork Fiverr any other app you can think of never really address these fundamental economic challenges so for the last year and a half I've been working with a group of individuals about 60 people from Google Apple Intel from that type of focus really data scientists machine learning and we've been working to solve this challenge in a cooperative way and so we are a consortium an interconnected network of individuals completely independent choosing to work together and what we find is that when somebody's great at sales they usually suck at tech with a great attack they usually suck at sales so how do we balance the skill sets of these individuals so they can really thrive so why does this matter okay so you have a group of individuals they work alone they don't want to work for the man and perhaps 20% utilization of their time and the rest of the time they're spanning doing lead generation going to conferences blog posts and that really doesn't allow them to focus on what they do best so we really see a need to build a new economic model that aligns people's incentives based on intrinsic motivation so in our model we don't have managers we look at managers as a role of you know this is what you're supposed to focus on this is what you're supposed to do and in our model we have a self selection method you have to believe in yourself you have to drive your own focus it's an entrepreneurial mindset and so we have Stuart's and the difference between a manager and a steward is someone who gives a damn and so we built an economic model around this and one of the ways we had to solve this is how do you coordinate and manage people across all of these different geographies with different cultures or different backgrounds with different skill sets how do you do that and that was one of the challenges we had a thing through it which is building an operating system I think early on we saw some of these talks where they talked about an operating system or an ecosystem and one of the benefits of this is interoperability if you ever worked in an organization we have to do accounts payable accounts receivable you understand the complexities and challenges of trying to work interoperable with other organizations so that was one challenge we didn't necessarily look at this as a as a technology problem because that's really the free Bingo square the big issue is the messiness of humans and the economics that drive their incentives so for the last year we've been working on that and we've developed something called a proof of value a standardization of that will allow us on a blockchain to build consensus to have self executing smart contracts from people that are working on deliverables across the world focused on what they do best so we are in the stage at the moment of breaking this into two kind of pieces I'll explain all this works we have a foundation that has this vision the token and then we have this other part which is a proof of business model which takes these economic theories and put them into the real world and we interface with customers and we recognize that customers they don't care about tokens they don't care about blockchain they don't care about AI they have business challenges they have a business case and they have no clue what the capabilities are and they're trying to play connect the dots and so we are able to do is interface this traditional world we call it the world of dead trees paper contracts with this other world of smart contracts so until we have that kind of mechanism or that kind of structure in place we don't really see that you know the blockchain is gonna advance you know fast enough in our time period to be able to test it so I'm out of time I had a five minute window here what he would like to speak you to me afterwards I'll be right toward the back and you can check us out at block box foundation dot o R G thank you very much hi everyone this is our new panel on getting current on crypto and joining them stage will be three panelists Phil bar height of opera who you speak earlier as well as Galia Galia bernard c co-founder of bank are and mickey Costa who is the co-founder and CEO of Atlas holdings alright so we're gonna be discussing what crypto assets are and why many people are interested in their 10x potential but first let's have each of you describe what it is that you do in this phase how do you thought in crypto hi everyone I'm Galia Bernard C co-founder of Bank or protocol bank or launched currency the bank or network token BNT in June of 2017 Bank Court is a protocol that allows crypto currencies to be automatically convertible one for the other so it's a mathematical exchange rate between all currencies in the network which allows for the longtail of currencies to emerge we'll get more into that so I'm Mickey Kosta I'm the founder of access network and we're a decentralized token economy dedicated to providing better financial services to the unbanked so basically it's a kind of two pronged system you have a this network of human infrastructure for banking people in parts of like Africa for example today can just with the smartphone become ATMs tellers to the people around them in their community and they're earning tokens for increased activity there are then using those tokens to vote and guide the incentives and rewards for a global app marketplace of developers because it's kind of just too much stuff to be done on top of that infrastructure and they're using the tokens to kind of have access to those applications and get discounts on services hi bill ba writes you saw me present ever a few minutes ago Abra is a cryptocurrency bank that globally allows consumers to make investments send money make payments all using Bitcoin based smart contracts we have customers in about almost a hundred countries now and we're one of the fastest growing apps for to encrypt though investing and soon other asset classes all from a smartphone so we kind of started this discussion already through the talks but I still want to hear obviously from from Galia and Mickey how would you define crypto assets or cryptocurrencies and also how would you differentiate them from other forms of money that people are already familiar with I'll leave the more technical answer for you I'm always motivated by the kind of result of how this can change the world so to me with crypto assets are as a way for us to as global citizens to coordinate together to solve any kind of problem financial or otherwise right so now you have this ability to incentivize any kind of behavior you want you know a person with the computer can create a trustless environment where people can coordinate to solve a problem and the other exciting thing for me about tokens as opposed to the old financial world is is liquidity right certain things today in the developed world like a car and apartment are when you can tokenize these things you can collateralize them more you can share rights and then you can share and sell them themselves and that can be applied also to our work in West Africa where someone gonna do the same thing to a goat and that's just exciting for I think all sorts of parties private and public and even old institutional people that we sometimes rag on because now you have a whole new asset class from digital memes - you know tokenize the part on buildings that just didn't exist before so it's just allows for completely new things that didn't exist before add to that if we go back to what money actually is money is a tool that we use to collaborate like you said it's a tool that we use to create trust between large networks of people people you might not know personally and most importantly money is a belief system it's an agreement system and so unlike some other inventions like the wheel or things that are are more physical and more defined the invention of money is actually very open to interpretation in terms of what we believe it to be and what we agree on and so Laura mentioned maybe you heard her say in the opening that there's this feeling now that you can create money out of thin air all the money that we use was created in a way out of thin air and these cryptocurrencies are created in a way out of thin air and that doesn't make them not valuable because they still represent some kind of agreement between people and that's what the money is meant to virtualize basically so our work at Bank or is basically around looking at a multi currency world we look at Bitcoin as the first user-generated currency so that's a concept from the internet from consumer Internet whenever you reduce the technical barriers to entry and you let folks approach tools like WordPress or YouTube the internet shows us that you eventually see millions and hundreds of millions of folks approach and use these tools and use them to create content and so Bitcoin and the open source nature of the technology is the first user-generated currency that we've seen and the team at Bangor believes that where you see one you'll soon see hundreds of millions of these user generated currencies like Bill said we today have hundreds thousands probably of currencies and we don't see that slowing down the real question with all of these currencies and with any currency what makes a currency money is that we agree that it's money is that someone else will accept it from you in exchange for something to date we have outsourced this ability to governments or empowered our governments to create these monies for us the the monies of countries are accepted they're recognized by people at some exchange rate or another but in a world with hundreds of millions of currencies what will make any one of them potentially valuable is only their liquidity to other currencies it's only their fungibility as you said to either another currency that you want or a good and service that you want so to answer your question anything is money as long as we agree to it so I think that what bitcoin did is and digital currencies have been around for decades it's just that what Bitcoin did is it change the narrative right up until now the that's slogan for money has been in god we trust' and ultimately let the people in that secret room at the for the Fed Board of Governors make the decisions now the mantra is trust no one verify via the code and play your role in the incentive based ecosystem now that's enabled via this cool technology that solved the double spend problem you know using every comparing an efficient blah blah blah but in terms of solving that problem it's it's it's huge and it's a fundamental shift in the way we should think about think about money and call me I actually wanted you to talk about bankers experience with hearts because I think that's like a really concrete example that people can wrap their minds around yeah sure so the team behind Bank our previously experimented with what we call user-generated currencies or community currencies community currencies you can think of like monopoly money which you drop into a group of people and what we discovered shocking so that when you give people money they use it and we ran pilots all over the world with tens of thousands of users in each group the one Laura's talking about was called Hearts and it was a currency issued for mother's so mother's could join this group they would get hearts when they joined there were all these things they could do to get more hearts like volunteer at the school babysit for other parents in the neighborhood all kinds of things that were relevant to that community and then they could spend the hearts with each other so all the mothers would upload into the mobile app things they wanted to sell clothes bike toys services consultations really over fifty thousand items we saw it at any given time and it was a fascinating experiment because in just under a year we saw over twenty million dollars worth of Commerce take place among twenty thousand people only using hearts so no dollars no fiat currencies exchanged hands how do we calculate it just one heart was worth one dollar that's what we told folks it wasn't worth that meaning you couldn't cash it out but for pricing for ease of pricing a heart is a dollar if you're gonna sell a cake for twenty bucks you could sell it for twenty hearts in this network and what we realized was that when you look at a number like GDP for that year that we ran this experiment you know GDP could be a twenty billion dollars in a small country and in this country it was actually twenty billion plus twenty million that no one was counting because that was economic collaboration that was happening between folks in a currency that wasn't being measured things got really interesting after that year when we started seeing usage plateau and decline and what we understood in pilot after pilot with mothers with children with vegans I mean really a diverse set of use cases in a diverse set of countries was that liquidity ultimately was the breaking point of these currencies what does that mean if you couldn't use the hearts to shop at the supermarket or if you couldn't use the hearts when you went out of your community or on a vacation to a different place the meaning of that money collapsed in your mind right it's like you can use monopoly money in a game but you can't use it anywhere else so we don't think of it as money and that's actually how we backed into the solution we work on at Bank or which is how could you allow all of these currencies potentially hundreds of millions of currencies like hearts and stars and and and things for communities all over the world how could you allow folks to get the abundance that they were getting out of local commerce and yet still have these currencies be globally relevant globally tradable and that's when we moved to essentially a mathematical based solution which as bill said programmable money is the key here you can now solve problems that the economists of old knew were problems but didn't know the solutions to and now with very simple algorithms with very simple computer code you could tell a heart how much it's worth in dollars at any given time based on a really simple formula that says you know if more people are using hearts the value is climbing up and if people are not using hearts if they're selling out of them the value is climbing down and you could make those formulas take in any kind of factor that you think is relevant or that folks in your community think is relevant and that's what we call the longtail is really a world with hundreds of millions of currencies like hearts that are relevant to communities whether they're Geographic whether they're local whether they're affinity based groups you know folks online and in different networks whether their corporate currencies and truly this idea of making money out of thin air is more like making agreements online or in code between different networks of people something that's come up a lot which I also talked about in my speech was decentralisation and we've been talking about you know these like user generated currencies or user incentivized systems and you know you talked about just providing the tools and then people can create their own but how do we get there because a lot of these start off somewhat centralized right there's like an identifiable group of people that are creating this project so how do you get from kind of the original version which is somewhat centralized to an actual is a centralized crypto Network yeah I'll give you my take I think what Micky is doing is really interesting and creating the on ramps and off ramps to I think it's gonna happen in three stages I think that the so first of all we look at kind of the Bitcoin world as my favorite analogy is the matrix right when you're you've seen the movie when you're inside the matrix in theory you don't know about the outside world except for the people that have hacked in and they use these hard lines to kind of hack into the matrix and that's how we use exchanges now exchanges represent kind of the hard-line back into the banking system to get money in and out so phase one is is is that that Austrian playbook that I mentioned before which is massive speculation which is what should happen when you have a deflationary asset that's been created out of nothing right and it's playing out that rulebook and so phase two says okay if the deflationary asset via stops and starts because especially because governments don't like it eventually gets up into the right from a price perspective the purse strings will be loosened because people are going to have massive amounts of wealth they want to take advantage of and people will offer lots of payment services because you know people are going to be incentivized to use their their crypto to make payments and then the third is what I talked about earlier where you see true programmable money in the form of smart contracts and other things enable things like micro contra micro payments decentralized investing networks hardware as a service myriad applications that can't be done easily with that or at all without cryptocurrency but require the first two steps right the press doesn't understand when they write about the lack of usage of Bitcoin that you simply can't bypass the first two steps in creating a decentralized system and it has to play itself out in order to get there right and 20 years is not a long time frame I had reunion last year with folks from Netscape we couldn't believe that it's been 25 years but it has right and and so this time is it's it's it's not that long when you think about how many currencies have failed over the last 250 years to put the right pieces and tollways in place to make all this work in the decentralized model I think the value of decentralization on the long enough timeline is kind of everything so on a technical level you need to have more on chain governance you know how do we coordinating make decisions together but what interests me more and I think will lead to adoption more is is really more of a philosophical economic point right you know if all things are equal in a centralized legacy system let's say like a Facebook right and the service the network effect is the same the value of Facebook and Facebook decentralized Facebook's the same the only difference is decentralized Facebook pays you automatically you know $10 a month or $50 a year based upon your data and the things that are being monetized I you know we would think that economically you would go and join the decentralized Facebook so the thing that matters the most you know I think that thesis is easy to get on board with the thing that matters the most to me is people talk about a long time a long timeline all the time you know what's gonna happen first and I'm a big believer that if you look at the developing world you'll see the value of a decentralized company or service have you know more adoption first because it's really hard to match the value of Facebook today or uber in the US they do a pretty good job right so when you go to the developing world and I'll use we're talking a lot about thankfully today's solar energy so let's go to the developing world and blanketly across the place like Africa some people don't have energy or if they do they're spending about ten dollars a month on it right and there this could be ten five percent of your monthly income that's a lot so now with solar it you know it completely works so if you could have mechanisms to fund solar energy grids a local community can pay continued to pay to use something maybe five dollars a month now there have reliable gee I think it's great to the screen but maybe they don't care it's way cheaper right so now they're beating the legacy value of the $10 a month government-run legacy system that often goes out for like hours a day by the way right and but what's the result now compared back to me at home where I have reliable and got a pro-rata level pretty cheap electricity of a con Edison in New York City I'm not the Cohen or this network right it's now you have these local networks we have you're solving a real problem and people are co-owners and profit errs as users of something that they use and all this and on this note at a high level because that model could be applied to pretty much anything else an infrastructure you know real world level it's a lot cheaper using back of the envelope math to build a Hyperloop somewhere than to rebuild the New York City subway system so I think places where they have real pain points and they don't have a legacy systems a kind of a blank canvas to build things you'll see using crypto economics and decentralized models a lot of this idea of users Co owning things that they use and you have a mix of this kind of free market libertarian ideals that have this kind of more utilitarian outcome by the way just one comment on that so if you look at the early writings from I say this like the religion but I didn't mean it that way like that when Satoshi was first releasing Bitcoin he actually talked about where she talked about whether bitcoin was being released then to it as a result of the financial crisis that was happening at the time and and they said no we're actually trying to prepare for the one that's coming next in 10 or 15 years because like clockwork it is coming right and so let's get ready for that by laying the the rails and the groundwork to be prepared for that now it's interesting so Carly I want you to answer this question in particular because of what happened with Bank or recently and where your I guess they call it the escape hatch key was was exposed so can you talk a little bit about that I know you guys have probably thought a lot about this centralization versus decentralization pain point sure so I'll add that we think decentralization is a journey and not a destination what do we mean by that if you you know go to the essential nature of what it is we're trying to do and different people have different definition of this but we're trying to create systems that are more inclusive that are more fair that are more accessible and that hopefully make living together as humans on this planet a nicer experience a better experience and decentralization is a legitimate cause right because when we see centralization when we see governments when we see central bank's when we see you know over time if we go into back in history kings and empires and and all of the formats that we've taken our own governance centers tend to abuse the power right that's the problem if the centers were not abusing power we might not be on this March for decentralization and so the question becomes not must we decentralize but how do we prevent centers from abusing power decentralizing is certainly one of the tools that we have in the toolbox but now thanks to program ability we also have other tools like open source like transparency if you could see every single dollar that was printed by the Fed and where it went in that moment there'd be much less abuse probably by you know bodies like the Fed they might still do do some bad things but they would have to account for a lot of the things that they do do right it's it's the the call for transparency and so to Laura's question recently at Bank or we used a what you would call a centralized control within our smart contracts which allowed us in this situation to retrieve over 10 million dollars of stolen tokens from the network there was a security breach there was a hack of the system and millions of dollars of cryptocurrency were stolen our central control was used to return the part of that currency that we had control over and so this this conversation ensued about decentralization vers centralization and we came out with a few additional points that we think are really important when looking at decentralization as a concept one is like I say open source and transparency can you see when an emergency control is being used do you know who has the ability to use it are there clear statements around who can use it when they will use it how that will be announced okay so the the transparency of the network is a big factor whether it's decentralized or centralized the second one is fork ability if the code of a network is easily for Keable because it's open source and because all the data is owned by the users then again you you extremely prevent abuse if bank or knows that when we abuse our controls folks can make their own Bank or take all the code and leave that's gonna make us highly unlikely to abuse our own system because the next thing that will happen is it will collapse and the third thing is really the custody of the users do users in the network like in a decentralized Facebook example or in the bank or network do users maintain control of their own assets and their own passwords and their own private keys at all times with bank where the answer is yes even during a security breach when the whole network was down any user could access their own wallet could access their own tokens could take them all could move them somewhere else at any moment even while our network was down and so again whether the central control that we had to activate in an emergency situation makes the network not decentralized is something that we would say look at look at these other parameters if users always have access to their own assets we think that is a huge step towards decentralization and the last thing I'll say is that we think it takes some trust to get to trustless all right so you're talking about the crisis that will come in 15 years will we have products and services will we have teams working in the space that are able to provide progress in this timeframe or will we keep waiting for the perfect solution to materialize perfectly in technology environment that is incredibly unknown and so again some of the tools that we offer to the community as kind of pathways right and the thing about progress is its progressive and it goes step by step often are things like on ramps so we as an example gave our smart contract three years before it moves to its upgradable and immutable state we told the community we think it'll take about three years to monitor the early behavior of the network to make sure that the code is written appropriately to test some of the edge cases that are impossible to test until you go live and this three year on-ramp to immutability is what we think is safe for everyone in the first three years of this network will be the most accountable and responsible for the network safety we use the analogy sometimes of an infant an infant will become a fully self-sustaining human eventually that can feed themselves and live on their own without their parents not on day one and not on year one there's a certain amount of care that it takes for that infant to become even potentially self-sustaining and we think networks especially technology networks written on very new underlying block chains like aetherium or EOS or whatever you're building on written in smart contracts which are a new type of programming paradigm we're deploying a mutable code to a block chain we think that these on-ramps are another tool that the community has in our toolbox to getting where we want which is more decentralized systems not decentralize or dying so we're running out of time but I want to ask one last question here we've been through this like major speculative phase we're obviously coming down from that but when I look at some of the usage statistics even on the more popular projects like crypto kiddies or augur which just launched a kind of a lot of fanfare and they've all got you know like 50 or less users per 24 hour periods and I mean it's just there's just very little usage of these things so how do we go from speculation to adoption I think we need more rural use cases to Bill's point earlier the best technology you don't know how it works I get into my car it works when I watch Netflix it works and I think what's taking us some time is what's a natural human behavior is while it's a global movement a lot of technologists are looking in their own backyard you know how can my life be better and what I said earlier I think that just is really hard to compete with legacy systems I think if we look to places like the developing world where they have pain points longer than I can list and any amount of time you're gonna see those real world uses happen I think what's really important is as we have a real world user base that's using crypto technology under the hood to solve nyrians how is it including the rest of the world and developed world users right so back to that solar analogy can we fund those things and in I'm not kidding with this napkin math in two months can we get a 2x investment I'm outside before this conference today and there's an add-on like the garbage disposal for the paper or something in for a bank and it goes locking your money for 2% CD and inflation is about 2% in America so I think also a lot of the average people here we're lacking and I think will happen on financial stuff first we're lacking access to wealth investments and people over here are a great place individually and communally to invest our money and we just don't have an easy-to-use application for us to to connect to each other financially look I've been in 1993 you had to install a tcp/ip stack on a Windows PC to access the Internet right most I'm sure anybody here under the age of 30 doesn't understand what I just said so which is fine you shouldn't have to and look where we are 25 years later my prediction is is that Bitcoin or its successor will become the payment in settled rail for what become banking transactions of the future hopefully V is something like lightning on top and the average person in this room or anywhere maybe even less so in this room because the savvy people but the average person will not know that that it's using Bitcoin or its successor they simply won't it'll be using the you know fancy-schmancy multi-sig smart contract stuff that I rambled on about before but the bottom line is but good just curious how long do you think it will take to get to the point where people use these technologies that way but not know that they're doing so ten years oh well yeah because it was a lot of liquidity rails that have to be laid first we need more hard lines into the matrix and in developing markets to make it you know really accessible but the large-scale applications which may be collectibles they may be you know new tokens on aetherium they may be just Bitcoin that I take advantage of those rails I think are five to ten years out yeah I think on the on the shorter end of that spectrum five years we're already seeing at bank or we launched a project in Kenya where paper currencies that folks are using in rural villages they don't have access to the national money one of the biggest problems with money is that not everyone has it that's that's the problem and the killer app for blockchain is money lots of money all kinds of money money that people can actually get in their communities and that they can actually use to buy and sell goods and services right where they are it's not financialization its commerce its trade it's living life with the people around you we've already seen this literally this week in Kenya the first tomatoes were traded on the blockchain and folks in a town were given cryptocurrency put it on their smartphone it's true the apps are still you know a bit clunky a bit advanced but that's changing quickly because we have the underlying infrastructure the internet the smartphones and the things that came before and they're using the currencies at the market so that they can trade amongst themselves it's already happening the moment the village next door gets wind that this village just made their own money and now everyone's using it and buying and selling from each other we think it's gonna catch like wildfire great well we'll leave it at that thanks so much thank you so our next panel is gonna be about blockchain for good and I'd like to welcome to the stage an Connelly who's watching faculty here at singularity University and also chair vice chair of the board of blockchain Canada and Cara Lapage Lapointe who's senior fellow at the back Center for social impact and innovation at Georgetown University let's start with an why don't you tell us your background and how you got into crypto absolutely so I've always had a passion for impact and trying to change the world as cheesy as that might be in my younger days I did that through international NGOs so I actually worked with Doctors Without Borders in Central African Republic and and dr congo and the places i was working was one of the most remote places i will ever be in my entire life there was no internet no electricity no water and so we had a staff of about 200 people working for us and when we had to pay them at the end of the month of course they are unbanked and we had to pay them in cash so if you think about how you get the money to pay 200 people the cash from the capital city to one of the most remote places on earth it's an interesting challenge so I actually used to carry nap sacks full of cash on my back through military checkpoints through gorillas run territory then we'd store it in our office and so I've had many colleagues who have been robbed they've been kidnapped they've been injured as a result of doing this work and so for me when I heard about Bitcoin in 2012 the aha moment I had was thinking okay if we could just pay all of our staff with the click of a mouse from Europe all of this work that we were doing to count the cash and put it out would be so much more efficient but fundamentally it wasn't about efficiency it was about the lives of the people that I was working with who would be saved by not carrying cash in highly insecure countries and actually just to continue so then how did you end up working in the space and what do you do now yes so I I focus very much on projects at the intersection of blockchain and social impact so I teach with singularity University and then I'm advising a real exciting company out of Toronto called Bunz that's the online trading and bartering platform they've been able to keep more than two it's the equivalent of two blue whales of trash out of the garbage by using cryptocurrency to facilitate trades between people and their communities so working in that space and working with a couple of NGOs as well oh very cool okay Karen great so I came to the blockchain world through the lens of ethics and technology so my technical background is actually an autonomous systems I spent over two decades in the US Navy and I was working on autonomous systems military autonomous systems so you can imagine there's some ethical debates around that so I got heavily involved in some of those discussions and so that's what brought me to Georgetown University about a year and a half ago where they asked me to come over and start to look at some of some similar issues around blockchain and how it was being deployed in terms of social impact to look at the privacy and ethical implications of that so that is resulted in we actually launched earlier this summer something called a block to ethical design framework so it really is a methodology and a tool that people can use to have a thoughtful and ethical design process when they're developing blockchain technologies for social impact so we've been talking about you know watching kind of more in terms of like the investment aspect the speculative aspect but everybody also talks about how blockchain technology can be used for social good what are some of the more promising applications in that regard I think Alex really nailed that yesterday when he talked about how it's really about freedom it's about freedom of choice freedom of expression freedom of you know financial system and because when you think about all these countries that you know Bill was talking about as well as in Bob way Venezuela if you make money on Monday and it doesn't buy you anything on Friday there's a word for that and it's slavery right it's really fundamentally if you don't have the option to take the money that you earn and put it in something that will actually store its value you're not a worker you are a slave and so when you see this opportunity for people to choose the financial system that they want whether it is their national currency or whether it's Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency that really is freedom and so I think first and foremost that's where I see the absolute benefit but then beyond when you look at decentralization and a lot of the other examples out there the the options for social good just expand into virtually every single industry that we see in the world I think it goes beyond just the financial applications right blockchain first of all let's level set that blockchain is not one thing right there's a lot of different ways to create blockchain technologies and they have very different impacts on people's lives but the other kinds of things that people are using blockchain for to create digital identity systems to do asset tracking now that those assets could be mobile votes mobile voting systems those assets could be if you donate to a charity and being able to actually track where your dollars are going through the charity looking at organic produce you know when you go to the grocery store you see the organic apples on the other apples how do you really know that those are organic well if there was a provenance tracking system through a blockchain you'd be a lot more sure of where it was coming from so there's a whole range of different applications of blockchain in the social impact space yeah I don't know if any of you lived in New York but maybe about ten years ago or so after I'd moved away I realized that or there was a news article saying that this one grocer called healthy pleasures had been labeling non-organic produce organic and I just like all my grocery shopping there when I lived in Newark and I was like oh my god I can't believe it but anyway so I actually want to go back to identity what are some of the problems with identity that need to be solved and how can blockchain technologies solve them yeah so identity I think is a really interesting application of blockchain you know there's over a billion people in the world that don't have any kind of formal identity think about that think about any time you try to access any service in your life whether it's healthcare financial services trying to cross a border what is the first thing somebody asks you for your identity right so if you can use blockchain to start to create secure digital identities that is really powerful or I mean think about even even closer to home homeless populations people are looking at how can you create a digital identity system for homeless population so that you know and they don't actually can't keep track of a of some kind of paper identification they can show up somewhere and have their biometrics linked to an identity system and then that can better access services for them there's an interesting angle to around the privacy of identity so if you think about the last time you went out to a bar not counting last night which was a lot of fun and the bouncer says okay I need to see your ID so you can get in and you hand over your idea or maybe your daughter does whatever it is and the only information they really need to know is that you're over 18 or over 21 but when you hand them your driver's license they know your name they know your birthday they know your address they have significant amounts of information that could help them actually steal your identity and maybe take out a credit card it create a credit card or in a worst-case scenario they could actually follow you home at the end of the night so if you think about blockchain based ID where you could put your fingerprint in your phone and it would just turn green and say yep she's over 21 you don't need to know her birthday you don't need to know her name but you can let her in your bar it's verified yeah I actually also wanted to mention something that came up in one of my podcasts I interviewed Kathryn Hahn who is it former federal prosecutors and that's what her job was at the time now she's one of the GPS at Andreessen Horowitz and manages their Co manages their crypto fund but she touched my podcast about how apparently in the u.s. there's 14,000 legitimate versions of birth certificates out there literally and so she was saying that and this needs to what's called breeder documents where basically with you know some kind of faked birth certificate which would be really difficult for anybody to figure out you know what's fake you can create then like a passport and a driver's license and all these really useful identities that you can use in it to do all kinds of things so I think that's definitely another area you know kind of combating fraud but let's kind of also talk about the provenance issue that you mentioned earlier I feel like there's so many areas where that can be applied what are some examples and what are the problems that that can solve there yeah I mean there are myriad examples we talked a little bit up a bit about secure mobile voting but think about the government applications also in terms of deeds and Land Registry right there's a lot of countries around the world that are exploring if they could put land registries on a blockchain then you know think about how much you pay for title insurance when you buy a house right but you know there's there's always some challenges with this right there's what we call the zero state problem how does everybody decide that the initial information that goes into the blockchain is a ground truth to start with right but there there are other things like think about after a disaster trying to keep track of all of the resources and all of the needs and all of the resources that go into a disaster zone now that's a that's an area where you have a lot of different people who have to access the system have to write to the system have to see the system you know these are the areas that people are exploring for blockchain to see how you can track things especially in these very decentralized environments it's also coming to play with a few companies looking at provenance in terms of elimination of slavery in the fishing trade so you could track your fish back to a company that you know does the you know proper fishing and there's other ones that are looking at diamond tracing so that you can be sure the Diamonds you purchased was not a Blood Diamond so when you really think about it I mean yes it's the supply chain problem but at the end of the day the real problem it is solving or very critical issues around human rights and climate change and these sorts of things yeah climate change is actually where I wanted to go next mister I am curious to know like how do you think it can be applied in that regard to try to solve this massive problem we're facing one of the biggest ways I think first and foremost is in the carbon trading market I had met with someone who worked in that industry and she basically said that when you're trading carbon credits there's actually a one individual in Scotland who sits there with an Excel spreadsheet and says okay these people want to trade with these people and then puts it in there which is ridiculous so if you can start to put these tokens on publicly traded markets so you're not dependent on one centralized body to actually moving them around you can have some massive impacts there I think another way is in in micro grids for solar there have been some really interesting examples here in the US and Brooklyn and other places where people put solar panels and they actually created local trading markets themselves through a blockchain but also internationally I think we've looked at a couple examples throughout the conference of you know you can have solar and people can pay as you go there's a new company bit lumens who's working on this another a number of other companies where you can put solar places where people can't afford that capital investment but then they pay incrementally to actually use that equipment I had actually was talking with someone yesterday about the concept of sticking solar cells in the middle of nowhere in these deserts and the Sahara and that kind of thing and hooking them up to Bitcoin mining rigs so the energy consumption issues not so much of a problem and you don't need to move the energy because they're just running the rig's right there wow that's interesting so obviously you know we've been talking really pie-in-the-sky it sounds like a large tank technology it's gonna solve all these things but kind of as I alluded to earlier in my speech you know people often have really well-intentioned plans they don't always come off that way so what do you think are kind of the potential pitfalls or how do you think some of these plans could go awry well technology is a tool right and it's never a panacea and technology can do incredible things but there's always a flipside right when you develop technology for a purpose there's often unintended consequences of that technology there's also people out there who are eager to subvert that technology for their own uses right so the more thoughtful you can be about some of these things at the beginning in your design process is better but think about digital identity systems you're putting people's potentially personal information into a system that is distributed transparent immutable think back to that example I said about in terms of homeless populations creating digital identity well I'm a veteran I was in the military for a long time let's say you had a homeless veteran and somebody accidentally put into the system that they were dishonorably discharged from the military that means they would be cut out from all of their military benefits if that was the system used to connect them to benefits right so you know mistakes happen people are humans so you have to think through these things at the beginning you know how do you start to create systems where you can make corrections in a system and you know you understand with blockchain you can never erase a transaction you can create another transaction that reverses that original transaction that information will always be there and it can be potentially very damaging to folks depending how it's entered in I think one of the issues I also see in the blockchain space is people have such good intentions and they're so excited about the technology that they're trying to apply it anywhere they can and they either don't have the knowledge of the underlying problem or the blockchain solution that they apply which technically is is feasible doesn't actually solve the problem that needs to be solved so I see this a lot in the case of projects working in the African continent in developing countries there was one project that was specifically related to banking unbanked African women using this particular token and when I asked them how these unbanked African women would get the token they said oh well they can buy it with Bitcoin so how are they gonna get Bitcoin there's two ATMs on the continent at the time you know and so they hadn't really thought through the realities of the actual problem space and we're just trying to apply blockchain to it without really a whole lot of thought so I know you've been working on this like ethical framework for a blockchain what are some tips that you would have for people that want to use blotching technology and apply it in these different ways to have a positive social impact well I think the first thing is make sure you understand the problem that you're trying to solve and understand the entire ecosystem around that problem in the outcome you're trying to achieve and bring in a really diverse set of voices and stakeholders as you're thinking through this because you if you are surrounded by people who have the same paradigm as you do you're gonna approach this problem in one way but as Anna was alluding to if you don't think through what is the infrastructure that this system is going in what's the technology infrastructure what's the regulatory and legal infrastructure but then who are the users what are the user dynamics you may go into a places okay I'm going to use a blockchain to help distribute aid and the unit I'm going to distribute aid to is going to be the family unit okay so there's an adult and there's children well there's places in the world where family units are not led by an adult so if that's the way you design your system that's not going to work right and it really comes down to governance blockchain is a system where you set up you create a set of rules and all the transactions have to follow those rules so there is a lot of power in creating those rules about who has access who controls and owns data and transactions and assets so being very diverse from the very beginning and really understanding the ecosystem of the problem that you're trying to solve I think is the good first step yeah I would also say don't forget history because I've seen a lot of projects out there that again are very well intentioned but are repeating a lot of the mistakes of the past there's one in Puerto Rico right now where they're trying to create a decentralized community and they're effectively recolonizing Puerto Rico and so it's it's you have to be very careful about not just having good intentions but actually having good operations and a good strategy behind what you're doing to actually achieve the outcomes you want to achieve so we actually have a few minutes left for questions are there any questions in the audience hi hi Ann as well so I'm curious because you've been at the interface of this technology and now working with some of the traditional development organizations what's your observation on their willingness to be to use this technology for transformation so it's been a slow road I launched one of the world's first Bitcoin donation programs in 2014 I had tried to do it in 2013 and that was a slow process and even still working with NGOs today there's a huge education gap they're typically less innovative than the traditional world much less innovative than the folks in the audience now and so you really have to go slow start with education start with the smallest pilot project you possibly can because otherwise you know for them the looking at innovative or not guaranteed outcomes and with new projects if you've got something you like okay we're gonna try this new blockchain thing it might fail it might succeed to them they say okay well if we try this and it fails there's lives at stake or there's outcomes we're not gonna hit and so we'd rather stick with this one that's you know a hundred percent guaranteed to give you 80% results versus this one that would be much better but is more likely to fail and so my my real strategy around it is looking at what is the easiest entry point that we can get them into which typically for a lot of organizations from my perspective is charity fundraising get them accustomed to how the money moves how the crypto moves how they can exchange it get them to use it and then start to talk about some of the greater benefits around decentralization and how they can use blockchain in a more infrastructure style implementation hi this is a Jeff Torres from Deloitte I wanted to get your opinion on the application near term for blockchain to support micro lending lending micro lending is that yes yeah you know so Financial Inclusion is one of the amazing potentials of blockchain and so I think a lot of people are working in that space and developing proof of concepts right now and so that's one of the things we hear a lot about now once again how you set up that system is really important and understanding the ecosystem that you're walking into and it's very contextual in terms of the different societies but I think it's a really powerful application of blockchain I think also there's a lot of appetite for instead of micro lending just cash transfers so Brian Armstrong of coinbase launched an organization called give crypto about two three weeks ago and essentially the whole concept is trying to build a crypto endowment fund that will then send cash transfers around the world and I know WFP the World Food Program also has a really successful pilot that they've done using cash transfers where typically when you see famine in places it's not that there's a lack of food it's actually that there's a lack of money to buy food and so they in the past had been giving people food subsequently flooding the market with a whole bunch of food that wasn't required and so that would create more cycles of poverty and famine and so what they've done is moved to a system of cash transfers but when you're actually giving money to people the infrastructure to do that is difficult and you don't really know what they're spending the money on so they've moved to a crypto token model where they can give them these tokens that can be spent at local grocery stores and local shops and then they'll only do the effects transfer with the grocery stores meaning that instead of having to do cash transfers would say a hundred thousand people they only have to do it fort with four hundred stores and so they've they've done this in in Pakistan as well as in Jordan with a number of Syrian refugees and they are poised to save like many million millions of dollars like a member exactly how many but it's been a very successful program and a great example of a simple implementation that just has efficiency gains that will then free up more money to actually go to the people who need it yeah there's another interesting associated application in terms of aggregation of micro assets right I mean there's a lot of places in the world where people don't have enough assets to actually be interesting to the formal financial markets but using blockchain based systems you can start to aggregate those assets and then they can enter into a more formal system yeah and if you're interested in learning more about that UN World Food Program pilot I had the head of that organization that program on my podcast unconfirmed his name is Robert op and he spoke about it and he did I think mentioned dollar figure in terms of savings but I also don't remember it and this was back in May Karen I met him actually at the same conference but yeah he talked about how it was hugely successful and I think he canted that basically the UN is interested in maybe adopting in other areas because it actually has been really really useful and oh there's one back there yeah great to see an all-female panel at this point in the conference and I you guys gave some great examples of the social impact layer of projects in the developing world energy identity having already done all lots of research can you just throw some more examples out because I'm really curious and I think one of my favorite companies that's out there's one out of Vancouver Canada called Wright mesh and they're essentially mixing blockchain and mesh networks so if you can imagine you've got a developing country or somewhere that doesn't have internet access if you have one person that has internet access perhaps through their phone or through their home they can then connect to everybody else in the town and so using blockchain anyone who's processing sort of that transfer of information back to the Internet will get paid a little bit a little micro transaction and cryptocurrency and then everyone in the town has access to the Internet even though only one person actually has that connection so that's a really exciting project that fundamentally is going to open up access to information and access to this your freedom of crypto and that type of thing for populations all around the world so having a largely ocean background one of the ones that's really exciting to me is not just looking at the secret industry from the slavery perspective but also in terms of illegal fishing and how you can start to use a suite of technologies where blockchain is one but also using visual image processing and AI and other technologies and and satellite technology to really be able to track where catch and how much catch is being taken especially you know across the Pacific Ocean and other places and to record that automatically into a blockchain system I think that's a really powerful application great examples right mesh is awesome they raise money there we've got a great team what about carbon sinks and projects where I guess contributing to climate change where there's perhaps corrupt government and how do we empower people to save their forests their jungles have you come across anything around that there's a number of different companies working on the climate change angle where it gets really interesting is when you start to integrate blockchain with sensors so if you said perhaps okay we want to reforest this whole area we'll use NASA satellite data to identify whether or not that impact has been achieved and then that will trigger the payment through blockchain now naysayers will say the only thing that's going to do is going to create a price uptick in green paint so they'll paint the ground set up trees but you know there's took one of the possible outcomes but there's some really neat things that you can do as well with adding sensors to farmland to make sure that it's being farmed in a sustainable way essentially looking at how can you actually take data from unique sources and then use that to trigger payments or to trigger tokenization of data that can then be sold and traded great well these have been fantastic questions thank you guys for your wonderful answers we are out of time but this has been really fabulous [Music]
