research fellow at the Peterson Institute and w1 founding partner at primitive ventures welcome Martin in dummy Colora thank you before we dive into the topic at hand why don't you each give a little background on yourselves and how you came to understand the financial technology sector in China Martin do you want to start sure I arrived in China moved to Beijing in mid-2013 just at the moment when and financial you know a leap a was launched you about so I lived in China during the beginnings of its financial technology revolution and also the beginnings of its interest in in Bitcoin and then decided to go start a book project writing about FinTech in China that I'm almost done with in Debbie what about you yeah so I was born and raised in China and so I did my undergrad like just bad in Guangzhou and so I'm a Cantonese and so that is where the province and stay is the headquarter for tension Nattie's and Selmy and then all this I like many of other just a Chinese tech giant's I moved to us at the age of 20 she so to get my master's degree in Carnegie Mellon University and I moved to barrier so right now so I'm in barrier for about almost 10 years and I spent my first four years in just in eBay as engineer and product manager but that's when I learned about soup row as one of the so s one of the marketplace out there and so there was back in 2012 and I learn about Sutro and then further get into Bitcoin and that's how I got into a crypto and you know fin tag like marketplace like in general so like after eBay so I work as venture capitalist and for like the rest of my life and pretty much cover anything FinTech crypto and marketplaces so have been doing this at crypto related investment for like last four or five years and like like happily involving all this community governance and crypto as investments and trading mining etc great yeah and you also often break news in the crypto space on your Twitter feed which I find really funny because sometimes I see some journalists complaining like hey we were working on a story on that and W just told everybody on Twitter anyway okay so why don't we get into all the events that happened around blockchain in China recently now from my perspective I would say kind of like the frenzy around all this began and when she's in ping gave a speech on October 24th saying that China should cease blockchain so why don't you guys just describe for me kind of like you know what he said what you thought the significance was and then maybe go into what you thought were the other big kind of like Pro blockchain events and initiatives that happen in China word and and you can also give your reaction to each of these yeah sure so but first of all this is actually not the first time that sitting paying like publicly pro so like publicly promote blotching and so I think that's probably like not to the knowledge of like many like Westerners out there and so in Appel I think testing 2017 or 2018 so he actually promoted blotching but in but like doing like a smaller scale just like net so like doing like a smaller scale publicize conference so I think like this time is that definitely like more significant because it's like a dedicated player long speech so in a very core CCP meetings right and and then she said right after meeting so like there's all this like Copley news out there and just say official CCP media outlet talk about it and then so have all these coverages on so the narrative so if we look into his speech but the narrative so like a few things I wanna highlight here is so first of all so he mentioned that fly bludgeon is the future and like China cannot lose the blotting game and China needs to have the leadership position on it and also to I drew in his speech and he specifically mentioned other major nations days out there across the world are accellerating blush and technology development and we have to do so as well and then so he also said we need to focus on helping to establish the bludgeon standard because I personally as a investor in all this a public blotting process and I have no idea what the standard is because everything you know it's a permission listen and so everything form a consensus that based on the community discussion but like Xi Jinping did mention that to further enhance that China's leadership position and we want to making the standard global and then so we want to establish like what the blockchain standard like was so I think is that a few things I wanna highlight so from his speech so like like the overall narrative is let definitely extremely probe watching but he didn't mention a single word of like Bitcoin or any other you know like the actual cryptocurrency out there so if we read between the lines and then also thinking about like what has happened before like China's government is pretty good at this at top-down planning and like infrastructure investment like as we can see all the miracle of this side Metropolitan Development and let high-speed railway etc so like as the economy grows less so like as the economy grows less throws down and China's government needs to further figure I was the nest-like infrastructure level thing changed so for them to make investment on and potentially to get China on to like a leadership petition before like any other countries so I think like technology life AI and life IG so like those are the topics for last few years and like this time so like with I see GPS promotion on blockchain so bludgeon as a neutral data based management technology is definitely being elevated like onto the priority list so as the - generation infrastructure technology that like the entire China will allocate resources so that is my personal take Martin what do you think yeah there's a lot there so going back to before see Jinping's talk I view one of the most important events of China's support or at least interest in blockchain as the the in 2014 when the central bank can be in the group to study digital currency and blockchain to see if there's a way to use it both for regulation and for government purposes and then soon after that the State Council which is sort of the equivalent of China's cabinet included blockchain and a government plan for technology development so I view the the see remarks is a culmination of a whole longer process that slowly feeds up the bureaucracy I think the timing is is really interesting and that you know especially because there's been a sense that much of the hype around blockchain around the world got a little bit ahead of itself so you know I CEO prices have gone down quite significantly bitcoins down quite a lot from its height and though there have been an enormous amount of enterprise and other applications that have been announced there really isn't any that appear to be a breakout success in terms of application for blockchain other than Bitcoin and aetherium and even there you know there are a lot of issues with how many transactions they can handle for example so that makes makes me wondering why did why would this come out now and I think the result it's a result of two things one is the trade war so if you look at how the trade war has extended into technology that the Chinese have found that the United States controls a lot of very foundational technologies for AI for example many of the chips are produced are you u.s. technology and I think that China fears that if foreign countries especially the US are the ones designing the standards are controlling the basic technology for for blockchain even yet even though the applications are further in the future they view that as a potential threat to to national security and that's why I think we see the phrasing as a core indigenous innovation technology that's the the phrase that the CG being used near the top and then the second is as a response to Libra which is also somewhat related where China doesn't want an American company like Facebook to be able to create a global blockchain networks that other people then build on which might get in the way of China's attempts to internationalize the room and be and have its tech companies go abroad for example in fin tech markets all around the world so they want to be leading the standards and and potentially helping even other countries develop their own blockchain based digital currencies and other systems so they don't have to depend on something like Facebook and can get get hopefully get something out before Facebook succeeds and that might actually work yeah so I want to add on to that so I so from my personal opinion and I don't think Libre is like significant enough why do I should require large aside just as these level attention and it's a good like hour-long talk like during the CCP succour meeting and I also like Facebook has been like face perhaps being spending life like three four years and you say Sakura has been trying to be friendly with all this side Chinese Garman and let officers and like basically trying to make Facebook accessible in China market and like which like didn't pull it off and I think it's just a coincident like probably so like the timing itself like looks like seems like a response like Judah Libre because it's just a second day like AB CD Zuckerberg so it's just second day after DS uh cover hearing right but so but from my personal opinion like the digital remedy has been developed for like five years and it's actually close to launch and then CCP happened to have that meeting as well and then so it has been scheduled long before and like so everything is it's kind of like a very perfect timing in response to Libra but but like but I think like China like previously never responds to any just a company from private sector for any specific policy out there so that's just my personal opinion Merton what do you think cuz I saw you tweeted something else I mean I think in a way maybe both of you are right I think this was something that was in the works for a long time but I I'm pretty sure I did while I was doing the research for this show and I'll just have to look for it afterward I do think that there was some statement saying that libras spurred them to kind of like hurry it up little bit like they you know had been working on this for a while but then when they realized that libro you know came out with its white paper and that this might launch next year then they kind of it just made them hurry up a little bit more and I think maybe actually where I disagree with you tubby is that the reason why I think they might pay attention to this even though they might not pay attention to other you know moves by companies is that you know Facebook's user user base is bigger than the Chinese population and it's literally the history to figure this out I I think it might be one of the only entities on earth where they can say that so but anyway actually both I wanted to go back to a previous point you've both made which both of you basically said that you felt that China essentially wanted other countries or you know technology groups whether it's like you know companies or organizations or perhaps even some of these decentralize networks to follow their blockchain standards do you really think that that's like a realistic expectation on their part that people might do that and and why do you think that is their motivation so it's potentially realistic because you can imagine a world in which if China launches a digital currency that works well and it's successful and if they have for example you know like $0.10 system working with tax authorities to to deal with better tracking of invoices if you have these domestic systems that actually work really well then there's a sense in which China's trading partners especially but also maybe some of the financing destinations along the belton Road and others who do investments in China might want to make sure their systems are interoperable with the Chinese systems which are say proven to work and I can see I can see that happening at least in in some limited scenarios there are some real questions around to what extent they will actually be willing to decentralize and allow some of the anonymity or pseudonymity that has been the feature of blockchain based systems in other applications but but that's that's really an open question I'm a bit skeptical about their ability to either promote room and be internationalization or get others to sign up on its standards but I know that in in other areas like for example in 5g Chinese companies have been extremely active in promoting standards and I think that Huawei for example is part of many international 5g standards notwithstanding the security concerns that many governments especially the US have voiced about it yeah actually let's keep talking about this standards issue because this actually leads to like some other questions that I had like about the significance of the cryptography law you know I was kind of curious like what that said and like you know why they have this cryptography law but I'm assuming that has to do with standards and then I happen in it to notice also this news about how they have these 500 different enterprise blockchain projects going and coin desk reported that the biggest categories of the projects are trade finance as that management and cross-border payments and supply chain financing and I kind of thought oh you know they have like this major role in global trade so is this like you know part of their attempt to get companies and organizations outside of their own borders to use you to either use their technology or to actually use their their blockchains that they're creating just out onto wort like martin has set when we think about loitering stander and i think there are like a few different um so they're so they're like a few different layers and like the most fundamental layers and gonna be what's the specific difference in like hashing algorithm right and and when you view a specific blocking protocol and so that is the consensus layer so this so that is the consensus by consensus algorithm layer so i have no idea how China's government can actually push that as I go one singular stander and because so because I just assisting other either public or I said my public or just private blockchains out there and using different consensus algorithms and it seems to me that's impossible and if we move to the upper layer and Apple are gonna be just like at the application layer right so at the application layer I'm not too sure about what is the specific standard is it on like identity is it on like account whatever so is it online so it might be on account based identity and then many other just say across watching just I created risks out there and so it seems to me also it's hard to push out a specific standard out there but like one thing I think they might be able to learn leverages if like consider we have like a China change so it's like a China whatever blockchain and so all the other major scale internet company like Tenzin Alibaba highway so they all a here to death specific block chains like protocol and so they be sold so that they had been developing application on top of that and then also like it would allow like third party so to develop their own applications and which means all the other blocks and developers can instantly tap into like this massive user base and I think that can be a huge traction so like there can be a huge fraction to other third party web watching developers and so either Chinese developer or just a foreign developers because it so because the current problem of why all this a public washing is that there's you say no adoption like the primary use case right now is trading and like all the exchanges like they're like just so they're daily after users is on the low end of say like 100,000 so that's like definitely not internet scale and if you have this share platform and so that will allow you to tap into the internet scale traffic and so like there will be a huge like add-on and so if they want to push for specific less tenders and the porticoes out there so I guess like with the one thing that I'm wondering is with the current Internet in China is this you know like closed wall what do they call it closed wall garden so why would why would the Chinese want I guess I guess like I guess my thinking is basically that if they make things interoperable they also risk then kind of like losing a little bit of control no no so right like under like so like the underlying infrastructure is not going to be interoperable just I think about WeChat right weecha is a closed source operating system and then so you as a third-party developer and you can develop all this I wish had enable program so like what's considered as like a micro program and so like like which has its own ecosystem like just like Apple and we sure has its own my app store right but the thing is like we share as a messenger app or like I say opening system like cannot be interoperate with I faced with messengers I said for instance because I you as a developer you have to adopt the same protocols the underlying like the so like they so like just live right now so all these are a theorem like defy application so can only work on a theorem right and so like there's no Bitcoin defy yes right and so that is after the same thing because the underlying chain and just like the underlying blushin infrastructure like the tech layer like has to be like has to be cohesive and like there's no like just a cross chain theme among the other public watching and so like that so like the third-party developer is basically purely adopt the same consensus algorithm and same and let you say the same blotting infrastructure and then building application on top of it and so that's a very like a typical thing even right now so in so even right now in the public domain okay so yeah this leads me to a question about censorship but but I actually feel like because we haven't actually discussed the digital yuan yet why don't we just dive into some of the details on that because that is obviously the biggest news so why don't you guys describe for me your understanding of you know what this aims to be this dcep which stands for digital currency electronic payment what is it aim to be how will it be structured when and how do you think it'll roll out why do you think China wants to launch it just kind of give me everything that you understand so far about it so a lot of the elements of it are pretty unclear at the moment because we have to rely on a few speeches many of them in private who have had their transcripts leaked to know what's going on so far the plan seems to be at least at the beginning to replace cash to at least a piece of cash and create a system that allows a cash like digital currency to be transacted so that means you know you'll have a digital wallet the idea is to maintain what they call the two-tiered system now which is that the the central bank manages the currency but in terms of what actually touches consumers they're going to be interacting with and buying these at the commercial banks in the country maybe also alley pay in $0.10 that part is is unclear but at least it's going to be like the banks you come in with one room and be and you can buy a unit of this special digital remand be and you're probably going to use some sort of digital wallet what's really important about this is that it appears that the central bank will not actually be providing direct central bank access like accounts to consumers that's one of the biggest question marks in central bank digital currencies going forward because that would totally change the way the financial system functions if you can go right to central bank because most of the money is actually created at the moment in our financial systems at the commercial banks so they're saying well you know we're not going to touch any of that we're just going to replace cash we don't want to compete with a lipe balances you about we don't want to compete with bank deposits which would disrupt the financial system only cash which is already a liability of the central bank so light cash they've talked about having it quite limited and difficult to use in a sense so you can you have a limit in the amount of money you can have in the wallet and a limited amount of transactions you can make to kind of make sure that it mimics that the fact that cash especially in China you know the largest bill is a hundred gram and B which is worth something like between fifteen and twenty dollars much smaller than most countries they made it on purpose difficult to use cash so that it's harder to use it for corruption you know officials get arrested in China for corruption and sometimes we find entire apartments full of bills and the amount of money it actually isn't even that much in the grand scheme of things because the individual bills are worth so little one of the key features of it is what they call controllable anonymity so you can use cash at the moment without any trace whatsoever pretty much you know there's and there's no if you pay in a restaurant in cash then they have no idea who you are you've told them nothing about you and there's no record of that transaction generated digitally anywhere but now the way the Chinese interact and have financial assistance actions is generally through alley pay and WeChat pay which are tracking all of those transactions and also feeding that into questions about how they evaluate you for credit and what they want to market to you and all this so the central bank is coming to people and saying we're gonna provide a more anonymous version of currency than what people are transacting with Olli Pei and WeChat Pei but of course we still want to get some underlying visibility into the system so that people can't use it to launder money and get up to nefarious uses that's another critical question about this how much access is the center of banking to get there are a lot of concerns that this could be used to actually increase the amount of control that the central bank and the government have over the economy by being able to view these transactions individually whether it will use something like smart contracts is that I don't think it will start that way but they have talked about potentially adding it you could potentially automate payment of taxes you could change transaction fees for different types of transactions to encourage or discourage them you could have new kinds of monetary policy tools a lot of possibilities are are open so I'll turn it over to Davi to see what she had what she thinks of this um yeah so from my perspective and I think that's a very important like prerequisite for this digital Reming B is that the China Society has been like has been cashless for like long enough and which no other countries in the world is so advanced on getting rid of life physical cash so by there will be little problem in you know usually education digital currency distribution and like payment interface integration etc so from my understanding like the most intense or just a detailed literature about the design of this digital Reming B was first published in about 2016 so that's in a internal journal from just from PBOC they have like a few chapters about what I think about this did you read mean be like fast forward to now and I think there are probably over like a hundred patterns like over a hundred patterns under PBOC specifically about these your Reming be and like talking about the timeline so like they're I think they're like rumors like floating around saying so it might be launched by November so it might be launched by know so I probably like mid this month and but I think that's probably just a two brush so realistically speaking and I think the Earl is it can launch any just a very smaller scale experiment like gonna be by the end of this year and so I'm not too optimistic about it and most likely so like the chil gonna launch like early last year and from whatever it can be in Shenzhen or a Hangzhou like the full rollout and I think at least it would have another 12 month and because there's a lot of eye coordination and just the infrastructure change is massive and like talking about like the bigger picture just like just like Marting has said but the biggest question right now is whether PBOC like once you use this new medium like this a new median of like cache because it is not physical cache so like online physical cache like it can be fully anonymous and so like people have like you said when people trance out with a physical cache and it can have life pretty much an actual life pretty much actual privacy but if we look at the current major problem of the China's financial situation is the shadow banking is actually what makes the economic just had over economic like on the verge of what expulsion and China Renan has more than 10 trillion black shadow banking asset and all of this is actually out of the so like all of this is outside of the visibility of PBOC if we look at the empty monetary supply of China close to 30 percent of monetary supply is actually under the sector of the shadow banking shadow banking basically our peer-to-peer lending and all this wealth management products that I think side are these are all outside the regular commercial banks balance sheet so I think from my perspective one of the most important purpose for this did you remain be at least domestically is right now like commercial bank as much like has much more power like when it comes to monetary supply and also like monetary policy and then also issuance and I think this can be a major monetary experiment as like it will be the first time so it would first time to make central bank like PPO is a in this case with like the rack inference on the monetary supply and daily economic activities and I think also it would make it possible to have a pro Sol so I think it will make it possible to make the mantra par so - so - probably enable PBOC like they will be able to program like the monetary policy by Severinsen so like say for instance if the Chinese government I wants to quote down my diversity market they can simply do so by subtracting the mantra fall into the specific sector like if we consider everything will be back to n 0 so if we consider a large portion of the mantra supply gonna be for reserve based I think there might be the bigger picture that let PBOC a lie has been thinking okay we need to dive a little bit more into that but we're gonna have to do that after this short break um so we can hear from the sponsors who

the real estate market was getting a little bit too hot and the central bank wanted to cool it down a little bit they could just stop the flow of money and like I I I don't even understand how that is possible so right now it is not possible like because that most of the like the England tree so like most of the Manchus apply so it's actually in the control of the commercial banks and so PPO see has no drag like control right right but I'm saying it yeah yeah with this central bank - look at how would they do that yeah like so assuming everything is that so assuming the entire GDP and the entire monetary supply is on this digital rameen be right so like that can be upper extreme case but let's assume that and all the commercial bank and they will have their account like so they will have their like just a note or like whatever so they will have their account like with the PBOC because I all the commercial BAM will be the distributor of this so like all this digital remain be so they have to basically ask for the approval of issuance and then like us the approval of like any circulation of this digital remain be right and then like the entire ledger gonna be on the private cloud like all Phoebe OC and so like that's why people you will have the overall visibility on like what's going on like Severinsen also if let this much of the renminbi is actually issued by China Merchants Bank like Severinsen and like a specific end point so if like that end point gonna be sa birthday company or like a local show or look or like a local major China birthday so or like advertise say like developer so they can actually make specific and poems so that is not visible or like that is alright that is not accessible to getting into this monetary flow and so if what everything is on the same ledger so but that will be possible because I right now there's like a disconnection so there's like a disconnection when so when all the commercial bank like talking with their own clients so the disconnection here is the PBOC cannot get involved or I just interfere whenever a commercial ban is so whenever older local commercial banks are interacting with their own clients and then like with any potential monetary output so like there can be a very like extreme case but I think if partial of the monetary supply and land zero gonna be on this block and rail so there's a lot of things that can be creative yeah yeah I mean and I obviously we're getting a little bit into speculative territory here because you know it's not like the whole entire money supply will be in this digital currency but I do take your point that the central bank definitely will have more control over the money supply and possibly over credit creation so I just yeah when I was reading a little bit about that it did make me wonder if that could if the rollout of this dcep could affect kind of the growth of the economy which frankly probably has been fueled by a lot of this em--to activity what do you guys have an opinion on that yeah I I want to add add a little bit to this to this context that that dove you was mentioning which is that there's generally a perception that Chinese companies are tools of the state you know if you talk to people in Washington DC for example and assume that that the Chinese government can get access to whatever data it wants on on on anyone at any time and my research into the financial sector shows just how wrong that is in in many cases the people at the central bank have been frustrated for years about their inability to get Ali pay and $0.10 pay to share data with them on the transactions that are occurring and if you look back at the aftermath of the financial crisis in China they they tried to clamp down on the banks lending but there was so much pressure from other actors like local governments to keep the credit taps flowing that the bank's just move everything off their balance sheet and started using all the shadow lending and the authorities just kind of let it happen so there's an enormous amount of activity that occurs in China which the government can't really see and despite all the surveillance cameras and other things that have grabbed a lot of headlines in many cases Chinese private companies are able to stand up to the government and they have their own powerful political backing and play sometimes the bigger they are the more they have to play in these factional political battles that might you know make make a Chinese entrepreneur sometimes much more powerful than then a Chinese government official depending on you know how highly ranked they are and and one of the things that could change with that is you know as the Chinese government has made it clear that they want more control and more ability to to access data and there's a big question as as to as all these new infrastructures are built will the company's ability to resist data requests and continue to exist in China and I think that's a big question that's really important yeah that's a really nuanced to picture that I feel like we don't normally Chi you know I feel like you're right that the conception is that the big Chinese companies are kind of just like it not an extension of the Chinese government but I actually want to go back now that we've kind of discussed the structure of the dcep to talk a little bit more about some of the themes that were coming up earlier in the conversation like about whether or not China could use this digital RMB to internationalize the currency and help it gain adoption abroad you know there's a lot of talk when you read some of the materials online about how they have this belt and road initiative and how that it you know will connect 65 countries in Asia Africa and Europe and I just wondered like you know is that one way where they could kind of leverage you know this network that they're creating and and push the digital currency and you know if not like or you know whether or not you think they're like I'm just curious how likely is it do you think that either companies or people in other countries will want to use a Chinese currency so there's like a Tron just all over the world so there's a trend of just say the dollarization and so if we look at a global reserve off like US dollar asset like it has been shrinking like overnight past few years and RMB is actually picking up as one of the alternative resource like in some of this as central bankers like out there in the world and so I think most of this the other nation states has to like has to make their own decision but the ultimate goal is always to diversify their own like reserve like portfolio so they have to ask them so they have to ask themselves the question like would I prefer like there a current dependency on like US Federal Reserve or like they might be adding on to more dependency on just ID'd so and just on the PBOC right so i think it will be a very like open question to many central bankers out there but just fly with the trend of like reducing US dollar asset so england foreign exchange reserve and then also given china has bigger and bigger cloud along this baton roll initiative so because like right now so if you go to some of this site Boco Africa countries and like you can see massive like infrastructure investment coming from this a state-owned enterprises and like there's already just say good enough and like huge amount of like tray between Chinese company and local garments and you say and also local private sectors and so I think that this will remain be itself like can actually facilitate that tray like become like more smooth and because like so because it will actually make the intra band settlement so potentially easier and then also if we think even further so did so PBOC might be able to export this so this a digital fee our infrastructure and helping the other like under the Bob country and then basically to help them to the Frog like the Kratt a bass or what the traditional bass that banking system out there and then so the entire Africa countries or some such difference and it can be lagonda all-out whatever so they can actually like a leaf rock and then to have the same level of advancement as what the so as Wadi China society has I think like if I'm CCP and that's definitely in place in my favor so I have a much more skeptical view I think that might be possible in the very long term but although you know I haven't seen the data on dollar reserves going down but I did see that actual international use of the Bremen B has actually declined and if we look back to a few years ago when there was this exchange rate reform in China which also was corresponding at the same time with much tighter capital controls that made the Bremen be harder to use since then REM be internationalization it's pretty much not advanced at all so I think about payment systems usually in the context of network effects you you need and also the the ecosystem you need to be able to plug into lots of other countries and the ecosystem here is like financial infrastructure are there ways for people who are trading different currency pairs especially your currency to be able to borrow in it to be able to freely use it to be able to hedge risk by you know what with financial instruments are the markets liquid to buy and sell and and so far even though the women be you know is part of this existing financial infrastructure with a network that all of the central banks are and and player financial players around the world are plugged into people are not demanding to use the remand be more and I think that's an important sign because if you have a digital currency that runs on some unique architecture and requires a duplication or a completely separate set of infrastructure to be built around it to be able to use it I mean they're going to have this dcep but nobody else is going to have anything and helices to it for a long time and that means I just don't see how that makes it easier to internationalize than using the existing infrastructure especially when much of this is unproven and we consider that one of the main reasons it hasn't internationalized is because China's government hasn't been willing to release some of the control capital controls and free usability of the remand be so unless this digital remand be has different characteristics and as more as not as tightly controlled I don't see how other countries would want to use it I mean they don't want their countries to women be eyes any more than they want it two-dollar eyes I can imagine that they might work together to develop a digital currency with from their own home currency but many of these countries even if they're getting large investment from China still want to protect their sovereignty and be be very careful about maintaining their own domestic currency so I kind of feel like the rebbe internationalization piece there's a lot of demand for a separate architecture than what exists which gives the United States enormous leverage there's talk about alternatives to Swift which is the messaging system that's used for most global cross-border payments but I'm not convinced that digital currency is the at least in the short and medium term the way that this is going to get fixed yeah so I just ported data out and so I looked at the global dollar share of the reserves and versus like the brimming the share of the reserve and actually starting for owned by 17 just so like starting from like 2017 so the dollar share of reserve actually declined from about 66 percent right now to 61 percent and like the renminbi share of the reserve actually increased from 1.1 percent to close to 2 percent like even though it's a single-digit percentage but like if we think from to side like growth perspective so that's almost like a hundred percent growth so I think all the central banker around the world so whatever thought they want to do like to diversify their life so to diversify their reserve portfolio and honor $10 and so other ten dollar Japanese yen and and so all this edge of your suspects and renminbi is definitely like probably the most promising like candidates so they can potentially have on their reserve portfolio and also add on to this payment has never affair and so I totally agree on that on I think from just a strategic planning like Ali pay and Bishop a can potentially ask the children horse so fold this but do Tavia currency or likely to remain be and then to be why do we use like indeed just say outside China and so so it's all about usability and then so it's all about how many offline merchants so can actually accept this payment and I think if like PBOC can actually facilitate that from happening just I have so potential I have a better policy when it comes to falling exchange settlement things like that so that can actually drag the adoption really fast that's my two cents all right so we have so many topics I'm gonna have to move you guys along a little bit more quickly in the backdrop of all this discussion especially around what currencies it is that some of the other countries like smaller countries especially will want to hold as their reserve currencies is the lever question but before we get to the Libra question I actually want to ask about one other aspect of the digital currency the digital you want that martin brought up earlier which was this controlled inanimate ii aspect because i wonder if this also will play into whether or not other countries will want to use the digital yuan and you know he ran in granted i have no idea literally the only stuff I know about China is like what I read in the Western media and apparently you know there were these stories the social credit system that then later other reports said like Chinese Chinese people were saying like this is overblown over you know one report that I saw did say that by the end of 2018 people who had poor Social Credit were barred from purchasing plane and train tickets 23 million times which okay granted it's a huge country but still that sounds quite alarming to to like I think anybody who grew up in a place like the u.s. that that just feels kind of crazy so I just wonder like um you know how do you feel how do you think this controlled anonymity will work how much surveillance do you think it actually you know has and how do you think that will affect you know other countries wanting to use the currency something quick on on that Social Credit so what what you're talking about is a blacklist like if you if you borrow a lot of money and then default on your loan and refuse to pay it back and the court and I Chinese Court judges that you can could pay it back but you are maliciously not paying it back or you're refusing to comply with a court judgment then they put you on this this Travel blacklist it doesn't happen from not visiting your parents enough or like not writing enough positive things about the party of online you know or any or any of that stuff so you know there's a there's an element in which the there's a score that Alibaba creates with sesame credit that's a totally separate thing that got mixed up there isn't like some some number that if it falls below you're barred from it so I wanted to make that clear but in the controlled anonymity part that's an area where there's probably a lot of debate and disagreement even within the central bank about what ultimately this will look like because they really have to do a balancing act here if there's too much government surveillance of it I don't think people will use it both internationally and even in China if you if the Chinese people know that someone at the party is gonna be able to watch every transaction they make they're not gonna use it unless you force them to I would I would think but my sense is what the do is allow you to transact anonymously with very small amounts and then as amounts get higher that you're transacting and the risks of money-laundering get get higher than they will impose more identity verification and that's a similar system that they've used for digital payments where they require more pieces of identity for example and much of it is about just being able to transact without giving any information about yourself to to a merchant that you're paying and also without giving it to the big tech giants so you might want to buy your booze your buy geo and cigarettes with a dcep instead of Ali pay because you might have your sesame score get get lower it a little bit and have a little bit harder to get a loan from all from Alibaba but but but so far it's really hard to know where they're gonna come down on on the amount of privacy they will allow okay so let's actually just turn to Libra since as I mentioned this I feel like this has been part of the conversation even though we haven't really been discussing it so do you agree with Facebook's pitch to the US government that Libra is its best strategy for countering kind of like the threat from China and also do you think that Facebook is being genuine about saying that since as Debbie mentioned you know not too long ago mark was like trying to court the Chinese Communist Party and it does even had this tweet where he had a book by Xi Jinping on his desk yeah so so yeah so I think that the Libra thing if we look at I just said back in the history only why Facebook wants to have this project initially and I think Facebook is being very opportunistic and like Zuckerberg being you know so subtle but being acid businessman and so I find no problem of hinge aside being shaky on a lot of things and just like talking about one story in front of the CCP and then like the other story in so like so like opposite story just when it counts you like the US Congress right and I have like no problem with that but I think he brought us off like the libras office like after five years of like Devi markers with a Facebook and as they had up the messenger like it has been trying really hard just so basically she like push out something similar outside which I pay but like so I think they didn't just do a good job right so that the the in-app payment a transaction just I didn't just say just so they are not able to she like put it off and so like the whole Libra project I think started about one and a half years ago and it's kind of in a rush and I think like face will actually use this like you fo Modi just simpler to for Modi us Garmin and like because we are in like this I geopolitical tension and trigger with a China and like this can be like Cold War 2.0 and so like so to be honest like the best way so like to be honest like just that you think from us perspective in order to make like the digital version US dollar leading the game and I think the easiest way is just to like have the fat like like so I think that the easiest way is that the fascists allow all this at private sector no matter is Libra no matter is corn-based no matter is terror and an awesome outsiders that enough like stable corn one on one backed by like US dollar and then like those a stable US dollar coin can be the interface and then so they can compete with each other and then so to better user adoption better user experience and but as long as side the back hand is all packing to US dollar so that is how the US dollar can actually have the sole I have the leading position of this digitization of the money game like it doesn't have to be Libra like even though I agree Libra has a very massive like user access and so I think that the other thing is Libra wants to bypass the current US commercial banking system so like that's why at the very beginning by the 27 genesis know or like you said the genesis partners and none of them are actually commercial bank and I think the US government should also support major commercial banks like JP Morgan and and like the other like actual commercial banks out there and then allowed them to have their own just like digital US dollar coin so their own version because at the back end is Ashis $2 and so in that way that can actually further enhance that a dollar position but in the whole digital world and they don't have to align or just I being extremely supportive online any of this a party from the private sectors Martin what do you think so I would say there's a grain of truth in what in what Zuckerberg has said because if you look at we chats attempts to expand abroad they've pretty much all failed mainly because Facebook and whatsapp already dominated communications and chat in all those countries and that was the basis for we chats you know that was a spearhead for that for their ability to create a super app in China and compete with a leap a they use this advantage in chat and Facebook's user base is enormous it's all around the world so you can imagine that that this would be a great way to head off Chinese FinTech companies and Chinese financial institutions ability to to expand their success in China abroad and that's what some of the Chinese have explicitly said that you know a PBOC official noted that ultimately it could be that if Libra succeeds it's just going to be the dollar that that ends up winning but I don't necessarily see that geopolitical potential advantage to the US as a reason to just allow Libra to go forward because there are so many unanswered questions about how this will work and and it's really unclear whether the existing regulatory system around the world could handle the seneschal challenge that that could result if though over 2 billion Facebook users suddenly immediately find it easy to use Libre in their in their existing apps if it just gets pushed out to them you could imagine that that say in countries like my middle-income countries or or places like Venezuela or turkey whether there's a lot of inflation that people might dump all of their domestic currency for Libre and that could be extremely destabilizing for those currencies I'd of I don't expect that it would have much impact on the on the advanced economies but China is really afraid that of a scenario where you know it's easy for China to ban Libre and and have it not be a threat to China specifically but if it catches on and becomes a unit of account and important for the digital economy all around the world except in China they don't want to find themselves in a scenario where they're isolated or find themselves having to let Facebook in to avoid being isolated yeah yeah one thing and and this actually goes back to earlier when I was saying that I thought that I had read that one of the officials involved in Libre in the dcep did cite Libre is like a motivation and yeah I see here mu Cheng Chun who is the head of the PBOC s digital currency Research Institute said quote if Libre is accepted by everyone and becomes a widely used payment tool then after some time it is entirely possible that it will develop into a global super sovereign currency we need to plan ahead to protect our monetary sovereignty so I do think for this reason actually that the possibility that Libre might instead be released as different stable coins pegged to a bunch of different fiat currencies that that could kind of mitigate that fear that the Chinese have and frankly increase the potential that the digital yuan does end up having more power globally than US lawmakers might like so we're running out of time but I actually really just want to ask a question about Bitcoin alex clad scene of the human rights foundation came on my other podcast unconfirmed and he said that he thought that all of this will end up being a blunder for she's and ping because he basically said that you know to learn about blockchain you end up learning about Bitcoin and the Chinese will be more attracted to Bitcoin than they will to the digital yuan and you know I kind of brought up oh well you know in the past people had said that they thought that the internet would open up China and obviously that hasn't really happened and you read these articles where Chinese people are just like I'm happy with that or not I have they're like who cares about Google and Facebook and you know whatever so you know do you think but but Alex was saying that money is a different thing so do you agree with Alex that this could end up being kind of like a gateway to Bitcoin and if so like do you think that that will have some kind of effect on the power that the Chinese Communist Party has on China so I think this blossom blossom from see definitely help like just this generic just a Bitcoin awareness because blotching impact Qantas are two concepts they're like interrelated and it's very hard to isolate one from each other and like we can see from all these are recent educational material released by CCP and so they actually have to prefer so light so they actually have to refer to the history of like blockchain and then actually mention Bitcoin because traditionally like in like last few years like the narrative around Bitcoin amount just that average Chinese is like Bitcoin is a scam and like crypto is a scam and I think a list like this kind of a narrative like can be eliminated but like we have to keep in mind add the average Chinese citizen so and then I also buy Chinese culture is very prompt to authoritarian statement so I think if the message from why the Chinese Communist Party is okay blah and is good digital remain be ascared I think most of the average like citizen will just prompt into this Chinese version due to currency but I probably not Bitcoin and it might be in the very long turn when like the Chinese economy like like probably meltdown and then people are not happy with their current living just a situation things like that I think whenever there's a potential solvent via crisis I think that can be a just a cognitive like awakened moment like for the local Chinese and so they might be considered okay so probably bitcoin is out straight the plan be like the other thing to keep in mind is Bitcoin is already very expensive like in the eyes of life like any newcomer of this site so just like any Chinese citizen so like who's new to digital currency or a cryptocurrency like the average annual household income back in China is about so it's about ten thousand US dollar every year so whoever is new to Bitcoin in China and I think 99.9% of the chance that like he or she will not think so like he or she will basically think Bitcoin is already too expensive and then it is said to volatile and so what I should buy into Bitcoin and then just instead like so instead of like probably buying to stock and just I'd probably stick with my current just a daily Reming be activity right and so I think there's a huge gap and just say there's a huge leeway before the Chinese to this and eventually consider Bitcoin as like a store value yeah I think that's right and there's also the fact that Chinese government has cracked down so much on crypto currency exchanges made it difficult to buy Bitcoin in China you can still do it through through some peer-to-peer methods but but it's not terribly easy and many of the ways to buy it might appear quite shady for an average Chinese person but I think it could actually you know this push to blockchain might actually backfire in another way which is that this is a very new technology that that is mostly unproven for for most of the applications and if there's too much investment in it and too much of an idea that you know that the top leader has said we need to apply it so we're gonna apply it whether it makes sense or not it could actually lower Chinese growth and make things less efficient by trying to jam blockchain into areas where it doesn't make sense especially if they're not willing to decentralize and and use it as the technology was originally intended so it's very hard now to be in China and be a blockchain skeptic which i think is an important viewpoint that needs to be there and these discussions but Noah that kind of article would now get censored because your your disagreement with with the top leader and I think that's a bit that's a big problem I would definitely agree with that oh my gosh that's that's a hugely important point anyway okay so we've covered so much but just one last quick question I wanted to hear from each of you on what your prediction was on how this global digital currency space race will play out so I think my prediction is giving all this resource allocation and I think China will be the first one to launch a nationwide scale um just digital fiat currency like the US on the other hand because they don't have less strong enough like incentive like given like the current US Dollars leading position in like so in so in our global economy um I think us gonna be behind and so there will be probably a second year so second-tier nation-state difference um potentially Canada or potentially Singapore I think they will also catch up to the game as well that is my prediction do you think Libre will will be a player or no I think that Libre they have to be US dollar pact and so if like they can be a hundred percent US dollar pack or line not a basket off like the other currencies I think they have a chance too so basically should she like get the approval from like us so from so from the US government I think that's like a big if okay and Martin yeah I would tend to agree I think that generally the way that blockchain is developing in the u.s. there's so much regulatory uncertainty that I don't think my most of the you know I think it's going to be held back there compared to places like like Singapore Libre is a big question mark I would actually think that some of the smaller countries and smaller central banks are going to be the first to issue central bank digital currencies before China like maybe Sweden will do it before China and actually countries like or guai have already done pilots where they've put a central bank digital currency in the hands of they've actually done pilots where regular people can use it so trying to wit if it comes out with a pilot won't be the first to do so but it might be the I think it'll be the first major economy to to end up doing so but I think Libre has more of a shot in the in the short and medium term to be successful internationally okay great all right well we will check back in on how you guys did thank you both so much for coming on Unchained oh no no no sorry I'm sorry actually before that where can people learn more about each of you so so far just for
