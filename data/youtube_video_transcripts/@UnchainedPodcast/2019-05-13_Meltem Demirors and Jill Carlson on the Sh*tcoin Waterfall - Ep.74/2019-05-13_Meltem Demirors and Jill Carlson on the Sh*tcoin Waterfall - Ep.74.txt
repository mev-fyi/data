is a skeptic's episode part 2 and my guests are meltem two mirrors chief strategy officer for coin shares and Jill Carlson an independent consultant welcome meltem and Jill thanks Laura great to be here hi Laura hi Jill for listeners you didn't catch my first skeptics episode with Preston Byrne and Angela Walsh I urge you all to check it out I'll link to it in the show notes this crypto downturn has sparked some hilarious commentary and Twitter from meltem and Jill so I figured it was a good time for a second skeptics episode meltem you were a guest on the podcast previously but for those you haven't heard that episode and also because the crypto space moves so fast and you've been up to new things why don't you tell us about your background and what you do in the space absolutely I'd love to you and thanks for having me again Laura and thanks for coming up with the skeptics episode I guess I'm proud to be a skeptic alongside friend bill so I got into crypto I'm through Bitcoin I went down the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole is so many of us did in 2012 I actually got into Bitcoin because I started using it and as I started using it I was really blown away by the implications that open permissionless financial mechanisms and financial systems could have for people all over the world I was in graduate school at MIT at the time getting my MBA and studying syntax and quantitative finance and as I was leaving graduate school I thought about going and working at a fin tech startup or adventure and that just really didn't seem as interesting as crypto I met Barry Silbert who was starting to work on this idea called digital currency group we teamed up spent three years there helping to build and grow that company and the portfolio of companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology space that we invested in left in January to invest on my own via personal investing vehicle called Athena Capital which now has two dozen portfolio companies which I'm really excited about and in May I joined coin shares which is a digital asset management firm to focus on bringing new products and services to the crypto asset management space primarily focusing on financial management practices and treasury services for crypto firms and I SEOs yeah and the CEO of that company Danny masters actually was also previous guest in the podcast although he spoke about the topic of the Bitcoin ETF which just feels like eight years ago in the crypto space as we all know it did not get approval from the SEC so I don't know if people want to will want to go back and listen to that show but I should have him back on the show because he's actually a super interesting guy so Jill let's turn to you you were also previous guest on my other podcast and confirms most we actually didn't dive too deeply into your backgrounds so why don't you tell us how you got into crypto and what you do in the space yeah and thanks again Laura for having us on I started out my career on Wall Street where I was trading emerging markets dead and unlike meltem I didn't get into crypto by using it myself but I got into it through some friends of mine who are also working on Wall Street but who were based down in Argentina which was a regime that had capital controls and all kinds of very restrictive economic policies in place at the time and they were the ones who were using Bitcoin this is back in 2013 and they of course called me up and we're very excited to tell me all about it how they could get their money offshore for the first time and get what felt closer to dollar exposure for them for the first time in about a decade and that was kind of the lightning bolt moment for me where I first understood you know okay there's actually a compelling use case to this thing I've been hearing about at the time you know is just starting to creep into the mainstream media so bought some at the time rode the wave up in 2013 felt like a huge genius for about six months and then felt like a total idiot in 2014 and when that first hype cycle got washed out but it was really that experience actually of losing money that made me kind of go back to the books and say okay I actually have no idea what I invested in here let me learn some more about it that's when I fell down as Melton calls it the proverbial rabbit hole I was applying the Graduate School at the time to study political economics and by the time I got there I was absolutely hell-bent on writing my dissertation doing research on Bitcoin instead of the somewhat dry economic research I had applied to do wound up doing that following that I got a job at a start-up in the Bay Area working on kind of the enterprise blockchain side of things chain for those of you who might be familiar with it and then I've spent the last year freelancing working independently I started out helping out some friends who had just run an ICO and have gone on to work with a whole bunch of companies in the space so I'm kind of the business strategy side of things so this is going to be a super broad question but I I know you guys have so many interesting thoughts on what's going on in the space now but I just want to start with kind of like a high-level overview from each of you of what your main takes are in terms of like what is going right and what's going wrong in crypto well I can kick that off and Jill you can chime in anywhere shy so I think the biggest problems are are focused really on moving beyond speculation into actual utilization and to me there's a whole lot going on around winning hearts and minds and that just hasn't started to happen yet so the things that I just see that I'm concerned about is the need for actual proof of products market fit so we all talk about how amazing Bitcoin is how amazing a Syrian is how amazing all these protocols are and how they're going to change the world but we've seen zero actual adoption outside of speculation I think the usage numbers on gaps are extremely low right now and while I think everyone fully appreciates this technology is experimental I think the amount of money that people are raising this idea of quote unquote fad protocols and the need to incentivize developers is something that's gotten completely out of control and completely bastardize to a degree where it's really really just disgusting the sheer insanity of the ICO fundraises we're seeing is just ridiculous did us need to raise four billion dollars with this really problematic structure they have did telegram need to raise 1.7 billion dollars kick which is the messaging app they raised a bunch of money with their ICO and now they're not going to do any blockchain thing with it just these structures are so problematic the disconnects between valuations and actual public markets is hurt this and retail investors other ones that are losing out and so everyone loves to talk about how decentralization is democratizing access to finance when really it's just the rich getting richer and I'd love to talk a bit about the disjoint waterfall which is basically my C system that I'm working on backing up with research around how capital really flows into ICS early on all of the smart money quote-unquote or privileged insiders get access to these tokens at massive discounts and then there's massive wall our fall where they just dumped further and further downstream and make lots of money while retail losses out and then I think there's just this massive disconnect between the way we speak about this technology we speak about it in terms of creating this new paradigm in terms of creating new markets new business models but we're still using old finance ideas to try to capitalize it so crypto hedge funds venture firms nothing that we're doing on the capitalisation side is really new and to me that's a massive Motiti do something innovative which is why I'm spending a lot of time at Coyne shirts thinking about new models to financially sort of motivate people but also to capitalize these ecosystems in a manner that's actually compatible with the overall ethos of crypto currencies so I will leave it at that and pass it to Jill yeah I mean not to be boring but I agree with a lot of what Madison just said I think that there is a dynamic at the moment in which the market is completely and utterly over its keys in terms of valuations yes we've had a whatever it is 70 plus percent retracement and on the theory am in Bitcoin things like this but nonetheless you know looking at the valuations for these things whether it's the private deal flow that you know is going around or the the public token markets the valuations are just insane for the level of product market fit that we have with any of this and yes it's early days yes you know we're building out the protocols for a long way away from having good and user products but and it's not just about usage of daps you know I would say that bitcoin is an end-user product of blockchain technology that has been around for a decade at this point and who's using it you know okay sure people are using it as speculation the odd person is using it to buy things off of the dark web but you know you always hear and I said this when I was last song you always hear people say oh well you know for people in China you know trying to get their money offshore for people in Venezuela using the store value that's not happening at scale and so we have all of these hypotheses about where there might be product market fit with this but we've yet to see that really take off and we have yet to see people in earnest working on it because the the lowest hanging fruit and the way to be most successful and the way to capitalize on what's going on is not to do the hard work of driving adoption it's to just write up a white paper and you know go pound some pavement around the angel investing community of Silicon Valley and raise a five million dollar you know free ICO deal and then go out into the market and raise whether it's 200 million or four billion from from the rest of the investing community for a token that may or may not have any utility to it and so you know I think that there's this notion again that well you know we're in the early days and right now you know these things are being targeted at developers developers are not the end user of your product maybe they're the end user of you know the developer platform they're certainly the end user of you know something like aetherium and you know obviously building out smart contracts and apps etc but if it's just developers all the way down you don't actually get anywhere you don't actually drive any fundamental value you have to have end users of the DAP or of the token or of whatever it is that you're creating and right now we're just a very long way away from that still okay yeah I agree with a lot of what you're saying and yet at the same time because of some pretty well-known theories around how new technologies develop particularly I'm thinking of Carlota Perez is for a book technological revelations and financial capital I do feel like this is not particularly of a sand that a lot of this is just the way a lot of these revolutions happen so do you do you guys agree with that or do you feel like this is different I think I'll start I think that that's true I think that this is part and parcel to the way that technological revolutions happen I think that the magnitude of what we see going on is compounded by a few different factors but the one that I'll focus on here is just the market as a whole where we've had this dynamic now for the last ten years or so where central banks are just pumping liquidity into the market as a whole and that has taken a search for yield to its logical conclusion which includes you know people just throwing their money into crypto currencies and tokens that were not sure have have any fundamental value to a degree that I don't think that we would see otherwise we might have seen this kind of hype bubble occur but but the magnitude of it is concerning to me meltem and I'll just echo what Jill said I think we are in a market where everything feels overvalued we look at the Dow Jones you know we broke 25,000 people thought that would be the top but we continued to run we look at markets people are looking for momentum people are looking for yield people are looking for new opportunities new strategies and everything in our world right now is really over it feels overvalued and so when you have this massive pile of money that's been created which by the way I love it when people say oh well crypto you're just making magical Internet money well guess what's gonna be a magical paper money I think the parallels are kind of interesting but I do think the macro-environment is something that we sometimes forget in the crypto space I think overall one of the biggest criticisms that I would levy again just the crypto ISA system overall myself included at times and I think Jill and I often have conversations one on one when we spend time together before we try to help each other stay cognizant of this is we're operating in a very localized context there's a San Francisco crypto community that has its own kind of beliefs it's very tribal there's a New York crypto community that's very tribal and has its own beliefs there is a Singapore community Korea community Berlin community and there are all these little sects and tribes in the crypto space but I think what we always forget is there is a global macro context to all of this as well and that's what I think Jill is pointing out here in the broader context of what's happening in financial markets what's happening in political markets what's happening socially in these countries we're seeing a populist uprising we're seeing growing wealth inequality at the same time increasing numbers of people are being lifted out of poverty more and more people are getting access to the Internet we're seeing the democratization of access to all sorts of resources happening in different places around the world I think these factors combined together have created a really interesting dynamic and we see these factors play out in the crypto community where our channel for discourse is Twitter our channel for information sharing is medium our channel for engineering work our channel for sharing technical innovation is github this idea that you can simply fork some code or simply write some lines of code on top of another protocol ie aetherium to create a new smart contract and create basically money out of thin air all of these factors together I think are creating this perfect storm where we've created weapons of mass destruction when it comes to financial engineering and to me right now the phase were in is a lot of the people that are in crypto right now are either from the tech community or from the finance community and when you have finance people trying to grok tech and tech people trying to grok finance that end result is going to be a whole lot of financial engineering and so as a result of that I think what's being reflected in the crypto community right now is largely focused on financial engineering and I've talked about this a lot in terms of artificial supply strains and artificial demand curation which i think really interesting but I think her this evolved what we really need to think about is what is the social engineering that we need to do what is the political engineering that we need to do what is the actual sort of user behavior that we need to drive and change and that to me is really hearts and minds battle no one's really talking about that's really interesting um one thing though is that I know you guys do see that there is a solid use case which is store of value and where are you seeing that this really has the potential to take off and I think Jill you mentioned that you are even putting in somewhere to try to make that happen yeah so you know not to sound like a broken record here but I think that in part this is informed by my backstory of how I got into the space where it was literally through some friends of mine living in Argentina who were using Bitcoin to diversify out of the Argentine peso which they'd previously been unable to do and now in Argentina that's not an issue anymore they have had to change president etc but in Venezuela it is a very serious issue where they're in real hyperinflationary mode right now we're talking quintuple digit percent inflation month over month we're talking people not being able to get just you know basic human goods toilet paper we're talking people literally resorting to the barter economy actually you know people bringing goods to exchange for services because it's just it's futile to try and use their local currency and so yeah I've basically taken the last couple of months to try and do a whole bunch of research about what is actually going on on the ground there there are some really interesting initiatives that a handful of companies and projects have undertaken to actually do the hard work of driving adoption and I've teamed up with a friend of mine Alejandro Machado and then also Zuko Wilcox and some others to start to do some research into how we as a larger crypto community can support these initiatives and you know also maybe do some some work of our own in just how we can educate people in Venezuela and countries like Venezuela about the other options that are out there for them if if they do choose to diversify I don't know have you come up with this have you come up with those strategies yet or is it still something to be worked out working on it it's it's a very complicated issue as as you can imagine you know not least of all because of dynamics of rules and regulations of of dealing with countries like this both on their local government side but also from the perspective of you know US sanctions things like this but you know I think that what we've concluded is that it there is a need for these types of educational initiatives as I said there are some really interesting companies doing work on the ground specifically in Venezuela a company called Air TM has done a lot of work they have about 20,000 daily active users of their wallet verified in Venezuela today this is a crypto currency wallet sort of hybrid integrates with some of the banking system and so you know that's really encouraging to see something like that but there is definitely still as I said a gap in terms of educational initiatives getting more people on board it ideally not just sort of the upper-middle class - that has access of course - you know more resources around these things but also at you know actually working on - the democratization of Finance which is something that everyone loves to use as a buzzword in this space or democratizing finance for banking the unbanked it's like well are you or you know are you just raising four billion dollars for your I see oh wait till I just want to I want to back off up what Jill said because I think Jill distrait some really important points here so to the points about actually doing research and gathering empirical evidence and using a more formulaic and methodical and data-driven approach I think this is to me the next phase of spreading the virus with people like pompano there's a little bit waiting to happen so there's a lot of hand waving that happens where people like to get on stages and I love going to conferences where people will get on a stage they'll talk for 45 minutes and all they do is speak in platitudes John I like to joke that we could literally write a Telep just using quotes from people's talks or white papers and I really think in order for this technology to work it has to do something that's demonstrable as it was saying and so to me really the next phase of evolution in the next phase of really reaching a broader market is gathering some of that empirical evidence so that instead of standing on stages and hand waving we ensure that people actually back up the claims and statements they're making with empirical evidence and also historical context this is not new financial engineering is not a new thing we've been doing yeah this is my favorite thing this is my favorite thing is when people tell me that well you know with cryptocurrency now there's going to be no way to enforce capital controls and like financial engineering to get around capital controls has existed since capital controls were developed as a policy like there's nothing new Under the Sun and you're not going to yeah the usage the usage of a cryptocurrency to be the capital controls is not high at all you know why because people do it through other means of financial engineering that is actually much easier for them to access so really absolutely well real estate is number one because we literally need you know I have to get KY CML to send a $10 transaction to someone for real estate there's no KY caml so the let me finish this thread so I think the empirical evidence is massive and I think again we need to become more data-driven so we can actually have defensible arguments the second component that I think is really important which chilled speaking about in regards to education and advocacy to me that really comes down to user experience and it comes down to the way we communicate the problem is is that when people look at cryptocurrencies and this is my favorite game to play with my friends but also to play when I go to non crypto events did you spend a lot of time in one question and I always like to ask well I do actually I have a life kind of I like to ask people what do you think of crypto and it's actually my favorite game to play with some of my friends work in media and work in sports and industries that are totally separate from oh and I'll show them something I'll be like well what's what's the card on oh what's the Tron what does this mean and the way they view crypto is it's this really inaccessible confusing thing and I think people in ministry deliberately try to use really big words try to overcomplicate concepts that are really quite simple in order to make themselves seem like visionaries or to make it seem somehow more challenging than it is we need new language mean new ways of communicating about this technology we shouldn't have to launch into 40-minute primer on how a blockchain works when we talk to people about cryptocurrencies that's not how we talk about the internet it's not how we talk about apps it's not how we talk about anything really so I think again there's this math effort where we focus so much on developers and incentivizing developers in this idea of fad protocols and incentives for developers that we've completely forgotten about communities and users watching protocols at their core are networks and networks at their core are about strong communities it's about people collaborating in physical and digital and virtual space with people sharing a set of values and people sharing goals and in order for communities to form you have to really think about communicating is to think about messaging you have to think about creating purpose and to me the hardest battle to fight is hearts and minds what's the battle we're losing because no one trusts anyone in crypto no one trusts anything they hear because so many people have gotten burned so many projects have defrauded people so many projects and entrepreneurs have abused there's been many many broad-scale systemic violations of trust and they continue to happen repeatedly and these abuses of trust or sometimes even perpetuated or propped up through social signaling and virtue signaling from Silicon Valley elites and venture capitalist elites and hedge fund elites and it just further perpetuates mistrust of the financial system and I think crypto has actually ended up becoming the very thing that we railed against when we started building Bitcoin awesome to jump in there I you're touching on I think the great irony of this whole space which is that if you think about what a blockchain is fundamentally it's relying on incentives it's relying on economic incentives and it's relying on people to behave as rational economic actors right and I think that people who work in this space and have worked in this space for a while have this bias for they want to believe that everyone is a rational economic actor where they want to believe that you can just use a token to bootstrap community because people will have skin in the game it's all of these two lab isms as we've talked about many times and you know oh if you give them a token then they're gonna be invested in the community they're gonna want it develop spot for them they're gonna want to use the platform but it's not as simple as that people are not just these machines where you put in a token and you get out in action you know okay yes to a degree people tend to be rational you know on mass but people also have hearts and minds as they're saying you need to be able to communicate with them you need to be able to sell them on things and you can't just rely on this you know rational actor theory to get the behavior that you want out of your ecosystem or your community or the people as a whole yeah let's take a pause right here we're gonna discuss some of the ironies of the blockchain space EEO security tokens fad protocols and more but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors if you're an institution managing crypto assets you need a secure custody solution digital asset study company or DAC is the leading purpose-built institutional quality cryptocurrency custodian DAC leads the industry in security and service experts in the tech cyber security and investment worlds Dax founders built the system that today's major players in asset management rely on DAC is in production on over 90 tokens secure efficient egress transactions that's DAC custody with DAC visit digital asset custody for more info imagine this you dedicate countless hours of hard work to creating a smart contract only to be hacked in mere minutes if you think that can't happen think again we hear that ten billion dollars has been raised through smart contracts but over 300 million of that has already been compromised hackers are hungry for more so security is not just critical to your success it's an absolute necessity and that is where quant stamp these standard for smart contract security comes in with a team of security audit experts dedicating to the feeding the bad guys the quant stamp of approval is your solution for safer smart contracts find out how we can be the gold standard for security at quant stamp calm now it's time to

weighted lead the charge to inspire educate and equip young women with a competing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities it's your career own it with appreciate sponsored by the GC protocol I'm speaking with meltem de mirrors and Jill Carlson so let's talk about this irony of the crypto space sort of recruiting the old one malsum you tweeted new money just like the old money but with different rich in charge yeah awesome neato I'm curious to hear your take on what we're seeing play out so far just pretty much as you put it I seriously was obsessing their torpedoes putting this together but I agree with you that you know so far what we are seeing in the space is that it's similar to the old financial system which is that mostly men primarily white and Asian men are getting rich on this new form of money so an yet at the same time this technology has the potential to be democratizing so what do you think can be done to remedy that sure so I think there are two key things that I'm really spending a lot of time is thinking about I think this first is is that the crypto community really needs to stop making moral arguments to defend itself I think this is the biggest damaging thing about crypto is we try to come from a morally superior place we try to take this moral high ground when we talk about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency using words like decentralization censorship resistance and I think one of the criticisms I've gotten looks I talk about crypto and I think I'm fairly transparent and honest on when I speak but maybe I'm not is that we sound like we're living in a dystopian and ran novel and really we don't come from a moral high ground we see what's happening where people are pumping and dumping something people are shilling people are you know using deliberate misinformation to raise capital from unknowing uneducated investors we're engaging in a lot of behavior that could be classified as predatory or quote unquote amoral and so I think we need to stop using moral arguments and start using empirical evidence and data-driven arguments to help people understand why crypto currencies matter I think that's probably my number one biggest thing is can you see we need facts when you keep saying this about how we're not using empirical arguments what are some kind of because a lot of times I think actually what you're referring to may be our faeces where it's like you know because this hasn't been built out in its being built people are theorizing about what the future will look like so what are some examples of you know statements that people make or theories that they have that you feel like should be backed up by empirical empirical evidence that protocols thought protocols but when he made that argument he and by the way for listeners who don't know this was a thesis that was put out by Joel Manero who is now with placeholder ventures he wrote this blog post when he was at Union Square Ventures but I did a great episode with him you guys should go back and listen to it and I will link it to it in the show notes however the thing is that when he wrote that he actually did use some empirical evidence which was he said hey for most periods in bitcoins history if you had invested the same amount of money in coinbase versus bitcoin you would have come out ahead of heute invested in bitcoin so I do think there was something empirical there that kind of been there ghosts yeah yeah so that's exactly the example he used was coin base versus Bitcoin that is a hundred percent empirically true now at the time that he wrote it I believe this was way back in like 2013-14 initially correct me if I'm wrong but I don't know I think it was 2016 Oh was it that recent oh my god crypto years it's like dog years so even in 2016 though at the time that he wrote it that sort of made sense as the two things that you would compare returns on Bitcoin versus coinbase the way that people tend to use the fad protocol argument today is to justify the token that ish coin that they're building on top of aetherium to say that well you know some of this is some of the value is going to accrue to this token it's not just going to yeah or it's going to accrue to the token it's not just going to accrue to sort of the rest of the services and things being built around it now if you're building a protocol like Bitcoin where you actually need the token as the incentive mechanism to make the whole thing work for sure that makes sense to me because end-user product is Vic coin if you're building a decentralized application and then just wedging a token into it that's actually going to be harmful to user experience and that is not a fundamental part of the mechanism design of it then you're gonna have a much harder time convincing me that you need that token if you're building coin base and you're wedging coin based token into it then you're gonna have the same problem as if you just issued coin based equity versus Bitcoin you know you're not creating something that has some fundamental inherent value outside of the good or service that you're providing to the end-user it's it's a kind of false dichotomy that people have created out of fad protocol theory and are there any particular dish coins that you feel like really exemplify this oh god don't make me name names this is my problem but I think so there's an element's what we're saying here so look it is easy to sit on the sidelines and and criticize right so do I do want to include this caveat so Jill and I have been working in the space for a fairly reasonable amount of time I spent a lot of time working with these project and I fully appreciate how challenging it is to do something new and I don't think either of us are saying there isn't value in experimentation and coming out with new ideas and I don't want this to feel like an ad hominem attack against people who are trying to bring new ideas to the forefront I just think that we as a community have to do a better job asking questions no one seems to question anything and that's really what bothers me is I've seen perfectly smart rational people that I respect whose been successful in other industries come to crypto and it's like something in their brain just stops working and they start spouting off these random phrases that are meaningless without really understanding what they're saying I mean really what we're advocating for is not a complete dismissal of people trying to bring new ideas or people trying to articulate things in new ways into this ecosystem I think we just need to see people starting to think more rationally and people starting to provide arguments that are defensible and if this is experimentation let's run it like an experiment typically what happens in the experiment is they form a hypothesis you come up with outcomes that would either reject or support your hypothesis you run those experiments and then you share the results with the broader scientific community and then other people take that thread forward and continue to refine the hypothesis in crypto we've rejected all of that like the dumb leading the blind and somehow this has become accepted I think that our industry will be much more successful to be taken much more seriously if we just acquired better experimentation practice into what we're doing and I just there's such a big opportunity here and I hate to see us throwing it all away just because people are trying to optimize for personal gain either through wealth creation through cruel of some form of power or social signaling or through quote-unquote crypto Fame because people tell me all the time like oh I'm crypto this coming from meltem those who told me someone came up to me in the West Village the other day so my favorite one is a Baldy someone gave her finger guns and was like hey blockchain to the point here I think that you know one of the really interesting things about crypto and one of the things that does make it so much fun to work in is that it's so multidisciplinary you have people with hard finance Wall Street backgrounds in the space you have the VC philosopher-king thought leaders of Silicon Valley you have the hardcore academics who are trying to do some of the rigorous research that Melton is talking about both on the economic side the legal side and then of course the actual technical distributed systems in cryptography side you have the people who got into it because they were trying to buy drugs on the Internet in 2011 and woke up one day in 2017 a very rich man you have this very wide diverse spectrum or woman but you have this very wide spectrum of people and actors and I think that you know one observation is that the VC kind of philosopher king and queen community tend to be some of the loudest voices and that is the community that is spouting off hypotheses on medium which again as Melton said do have value I think that where the frustration comes in is probably from Wall Street crowd and you know those of us who have some degree of economic background in the space who are craving something a little bit more empirical to sink their teeth into and you know that that work is important as well but I will say just to try and balance out the conversation a little bit I don't think that you can just put all stock in whatever numbers you can come up with speaking as someone who tried to do some empirical research on the usage of Bitcoin this is back in 2015 when I was doing my master's thesis on this it's really hard to get data it's really really hard to get empirical data and meltem I know that you know you're as someone who's doing work on this right now you know this as well so it's not I think for total lack of trying it's not for just total navel-gazing that we're talking about I think that there are just fundamental challenges in such a nascent space to have you know concrete data points to be able to point to you for any of these things but I don't think that's defensible because this community is so collaborative what I've found the reason I use Twitter so much is because it's a really great place to crossover ideas for example one of the species I was looking into was the circularity of capital or this idea that you know we have investors investing in VCS who then invest in crypt currencies and those cryptocurrency products and invest in ideas and those ideas invested me cheese and this marvelous recursion in hospital and so then again like I put a tweet out there and I said hey I'm listening into this I think this is really interesting are there analogues to what happened in the tech IPO bubble in the 2000s and I got a lot of great link backs people sent over some research studies but do you think that there is this great mechanism we've created we've created this awesome super vibrant sometimes slightly toxic general community in crypto that's like an amazing crowdsourcing mechanism and I have found that if I'm trying to work on specific research hypotheses I can quite easily reach out to people either on telegram or on Twitter or even write about our medium and get data I just I think the problem is is that we have been drinking our own kool-aid for so long and because we had this massive bull run last year people confused getting lucky with getting it right and there's certain things we've gotten right but there's a whole lot we're getting wrong we need to keep asking better questions and I think as a whole we have stopped asking questions because we've started believing our own hype and that is really really yeah and I am sure I've seen you both on Twitter be critical of crypto economics and say it's not even a thing I actually disagree with you on this so I was curious to know why you you don't think it's a thing so I'm a coach economics fun here's here's my issue with it everyone loves to talk about coke anomic sand again it goes back to incentives and fad protocols and incentivizing developers and ecosystems I'm number one saying Oh ecosystem growth is a really esoteric metric like let's specify that of it saying decentralization is really esoteric let's specify that a bit and I've talked about that a lot in my writing and I think Jackson Palmer who created dogecoin has done a great job with his website are we decentralized yet.com where he points out all the different metrics we could use as a proxy for decentralization and how not decentralized things are but I think that the broader issue here is look we've spent decades working on understanding debt financing we spent decades on working on an understanding equity financing and in both of these models when you raise debt capital you get assets on your balance sheet on one side on the left-hand side of your ledger on the right-hand side you have a debt to someone that you have to repay there's a liability when you do equity financing same thing you get assets but the equity in your company is owned by other people in token financing what we're doing is we're creating assets on the right hand side of left hand side of the balance sheet pardon and we're doing it in the form of not only treasury capital or assets that are raised that's in the form of our own tokens because we keep a portion of the supply and there's no offsetting liability on the other side of the ledger and that doesn't work you can't print money out mental banks do it when people are capitalizing on projects but we're not central banks and again I think it it doesn't mean that it's going to be liability or equity I just would love to see more critical thinking about how we develop the practice of token financing and the conversations people have are completely irrational and they're pseudo intellectual let's take it back to the practicalities of how firms function firms have accountants they pay taxes firms have internal reporting like we need to spend time on the nuts and bolts of how companies work and how firms communities work you can't just create money out of thin air in perpetuity that's not going to work we don't have militaries we don't have a nation-state Laura I want to see if I can convince you sorry go ahead Melton I finished rant over I want to see if I can convince you about the crypto economics token ah mcc's debate of whether this is a real thing because I think what Melton is saying in all of this is that there's nothing new Under the Sun financial engineering has been around forever I would argue what we're calling crypto economics has also been around as it what it is is mechanism design there's a field of economics and game theory called mechanism design it's an engineering approach to designing economic mechanisms or incentives poured desired objectives thinking with media and that's that's all it is that's all that token ah mcc's is right and I I'm not saying that liking this kind of thing didn't exist before obviously it did I mean economics and incentives existed before what I'm saying is that now you can create little systems that are kind of built around one service right maybe it's like file storage let's say and you can have this token at the center or that if you design it correctly should enable groups of people that are not otherwise organized to put work into the system that will enable this service to be offered and some people will maybe make money from it other people will use it and so then you have this like little economy that's been created and there is no corporation at the center and which is a you new and unique thing and so in that regard I feel like that's new I'm not saying that you know mechanism design isn't new I would say our ability to experiment with mechanism design is absolutely new in in this way that you know you can watch these things play out in a real-time see what works see what doesn't see what fails disastrously and you know we can for the first time absolutely create systems that leverage mechanism design in our real lives in a new way but it's a little bit akin to the law of the horse and the law of the horse was a term that was used to kind of rail against the idea of having law of the internet or cyber law in I think it was like the mid must have in the mid 90s and the idea was you know if if you had all these laws in place and then suddenly like horses came along you know you you wouldn't and you know you have all of these cases dealing with horses and you know people stealing horses and racing horses and so on like you don't suddenly say oh well now we need to have the log horse you say ok well we have these existing laws that are our principles and framework now we just need to apply them here and I think that the same and my biggest point with this is not to sort of myopically nitpick here about you know the way that that we talk about these things but I think it comes back to what Melton was saying earlier on you know maybe 10 minutes ago or so about winning hearts and minds and the way that we communicate with people about this because that does matter and if we choose as a community to come up with all new terms for things that already exist in one form or another it's going to make it that much harder for people to enter the space and you know that would be my argument for why we really need to come up with ways to talk about this in frameworks that are already existing ok we're gonna enter this like lightning round sort of because we have so little time and there were so many other things I want to ask you guys about so let's start very quickly with a OS you Jill you called there four billion dollar fundraise sheer insanity why there's no way that we look back on this in ten years and be like oh yeah four billion that was totally reasonable for us which I gotten in then there is just no way and the the thing that I really want to highlight here is it was Nick Carter who pointed it out to me that we have no way of knowing that Yost has not been contributing to their own ICO which would mean that they would be sending themselves eath into their ICO they would be receiving those eath themselves and then they would be also issuing yose to themselves thereby self-dealing and you could say this of many ICO is but we've no audience we have no frameworks in place to be able to check in on any of these dynamics it's hugely problematic problem number two with EOS twenty-five cents of every dollar invested is being invested in venture capital where the GP or the LP the general partner or the limited partner participates in the profits of that venture investing activity is cos its investors or its affiliates doesn't benefit the community in any way other than quote-unquote network effects so very well okay yeah I mean I definitely see that okay Milton at the very beginning this conversation you mentioned that issue coin waterfall but did not go to detail in it I want to hear what that is when waterfall very simple idea I'm actually working on creating a beautiful interactive graphic which I hope to share with everyone the way it basically works is team gets together they pull in some crypto quote-unquote influencers go around to crypto VCS and hedge funds to collect some big names they do a pre pre ICO raise at a grade five to ten million is Jill said massive discount to the icos to the part in early investors next round they do after doing a little bit more work and writing a little bit more white paper in latex fogs which is the you know font that people use the white papers is they go to bigger groups of investors that are less educated they now mark their tokens at 10x 20x sometimes even 100x in the case vicinity sell it to more investors now they're ready to go with their big ICO do big marketing community building quote-unquote effort they sell to the general public or an even larger audience of qualified investors or accredited investors and everyone who's already invested invested pardoned gets in and a massive discount then the token starts trading there's liquidity everyone's dumb I've looked at 30 different icos that have happened over the last three months at the token issuance within the first seven days 80% of all tokens purchased in the ICO were traded in most of them so the velocity this stuff is really high everyone jumps to capitalize on the post I feel liquidity pump and then the people who are left holding the bag our retail plan for uneducated retail investors people who got hyped about the coin who are now stuff you know having given their capital back to all the investors that I'd weigh my more information so basically the idea is that every buyer in the crypto market who buys a ish coin is buying it because they believe there's someone dumber or less informed than them who will be the buyers last resort of their bags or their tokens the question is if we're in the market we're in right now who is that buyers last resort for some of this stuff I think that's going to be tested very soon once we have the continued fair market and if we have another bull market I think we'll see this continue for quite some time that's the issuing waterfall yeah and there's a another crypto podcast I listen to I will not name it unfortunately I know they maybe listen to my show but they do joke about this kind of thing because I think they buy some of the issuance and and they fully I admit that you know that's what they're waiting to do is to just sell it has somebody super than them I don't think that's funny I mean look it happens in every financial market right I'm like some math unwashed the unwashed masses are always the virus of last resort and there are tons of financial institutions and very wealthy people who are now respected who built their entire fortune off of doing things like this this is financial engineering at its finest I just think the challenge is is again if this is what we're doing we can't use moral arguments in a moral high ground to try to claim that cryptocurrencies are this divine beautiful perfectly designed social mechanism yeah and I agree with you it's not funny which is why I didn't want any in the podcast here which I feel bad about because there you know it's it's entertaining in other ways but yeah I don't condone that kind of activity so Jill I know you're critical of security tokens which are like blockchain traditional equities meltem is critical of yeah oh melt image I actually think they're pretty interesting but oh okay so why don't why don't you make a case for and then ultimate can make the case against look I think that there is a case to be made that blockchain as financial infrastructure is interesting I think that you know a lot of people this is the reason they got into it with Bitcoin is it is a new model of custody it is a new model of who you have to trust which third parties or groups of third parties you have to trust I think that old-school Wall Street systems are overdue for rehaul I think that there are lots of problems in place there I think that if you look at traditional Wall Street FinTech you're already seeing in different ways that don't have to do with decentralization but you're seeing a move towards more peer-to-peer trading and securities issuance and all of these kinds of trends that map actually quite nicely it's a trends that you see happening in the blockchain space now we've seen one cycle of kind of attempts at this company I used work out I think is doing the best job of any of the companies in the space attempting to do kind of the enterprise Wall Street blockchain play but there are tons of others are three etc who you know I've made a foray into this and I think that securities tokens are going to wind up being kind of the next generation of enterprise blotching for Wall Street what does it look like not to issue new assets on new infrastructure but to issue old assets on new infrastructure and I think that'll actually create really interesting things for Wall Street and and the dynamic at play there but I do I will say I will call y'all I think that were many years away from seeing that become a reality in enforce Milton come at me Milton let's go alright hold on let me crack let me crack my gear up here okay so I was actually having a talk with one of my research interns about this this morning he's working on analysis of ICS versus FTO so initial coin offerings versus security token offerings so IC over to vespi oh and the key differentiators look I think one of the things that enables people to raise IC o---- at a really high valuation is this really a cetera concept of network value and building community and ecosystem etc with an F co security token that incentive doesn't exist unfortunately the form and function that these security token offerings will take is that they'll only be able to be offered to accredited or qualified investors likely many of them will not be offered in the United States and so this whole idea of decentralization and democratizing access to finance will be largely a play for people who are rich it really won't be accessible to many people I think the second thing is because you don't have the network effects because you don't have this community idea because you don't have this because some value concept that factors into valuation a lot of the premium will get squeezed out of security tokens really the premium that will be left is a liquidity brief based premium which again if you're a private investor and you're used to investing in a liquid private securities illiquid private placements illiquid private offerings the idea that you can now have more liquidity you don't have to wait two to three years for your banker at Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase to find someone to buy you out as a commercial real estate trust or fun investment you made in Tucson esoteric project that doesn't really align with your investment mandate anymore that's potentially interesting but I think again to me this is doing same old finance just with a different substrate and so I find it fundamentally uninteresting I also think that you don't need a blockchain to issue security token you really don't you can just use a Google spreadsheet like Susan I really don't think there's much that's innovative about taking a security and tokenizing it now - I think there's money in it absolutely will I be participating in helping people create security token probably do I see any problems with it structurally no do I think it's interesting or innovative in any way not really do I think it's sexy absolutely not will I be spending a lot of time thinking about it probably not so just being completely realistic I think this is more let's use crypto and blockchain as a buzzword to market old finance doing it the same old way just with new extra stuff in the middle and that's fine look I'm not trying to jam on anyone to try to make a dollar everyone's got to eat everyone's got to make a living I just find it fundamentally on it I'll take this up with you offline I think I have to take the Goldilocks position because I basically agree that it's definitely not as sexy as kind of the more utility token model which you know which will power are sort of like these big decentralize networks that offer services that are now offered by companies but I do think that there is some merit in making tokens tradable 24/7 365 or not toget securities and and also in you know enabling certain types of securities that are not possible now guys I don't know what you're talking about Wall Street's back-office is so sexy I can't even tell you ball so I will be bringing you a shirt in San Francisco that says Laura we're not Bitcoin max I like that I like that so you actually referenced working in the space and I actually kind of wanted to leave on that note because both of you have written about either freelancing or working a crypto and I actually get a lot of people who just randomly message me and say like oh you know I listen your podcasts I'm interested in working in the space so what job advice would you guys have for people who either want to work in the space or want to work on a decentralized project I just wrote a blog post about this on low and behold medium where it's called so you want to work in crypto there's a lot of great advice in in there about how to get involved what channels to how to search for jobs I'll let you'll reflect on this some more but I think finding a job in in the crypto ecosystem has never been easier but vice I always gives people is get engaged comment on things follow people on Twitter be in the places online and offline and physical space where people are hanging out and just contribute your time your energy or your thoughts and I think people really respond to that well but Jill I'm sure you have a lot of ideas here I would also just say just start reaching out to people you know find people on Twitter or medium or whatever find a way to get in touch with them and just coal coal and just say hey I'm really excited about this topic that you wrote about or that you seem to think a lot about or that your company is building can we chat because you know we've been pretty negative I think about a lot of what goes on in the crypto space over the last hour but the thing that I love is that people are just so excited like you can't get people to shut up about it you know you go out to drinks with people in any other industry after work drinks constitute of like a little bit of office place banter and then you know talking about other things going on your life in crypto people will not shut up about it and they will be excited to get on the phone with you or exchange emails and exchange ideas and you know that I got a credit a lot of people who took my cold calls a few years ago when I was first getting into the space and and even meltem you do to a degree you know when I was a little bit more green a few years ago you know take me out for drinks and you know chatting about a lot of these things that you know were at the time even more experimental than they are now but that we were both really excited about and and just start getting to know people it's it's awesome it's great in here come on in dive in and the water is fine yes I totally agree with you all right so for both of you where can people learn more about you and your work the best place for me is twitter @ underscore Jill Ruth is my twitter handle that's also the only thing that I sometimes for apply to on DMS LinkedIn has become a crypto bucket shop so don't try to find me there meltem I'm on Twitter like Jill so I'm melt underscore dem I also spend a lot of time on medium writing and then under the pointers handle you'll find me as well and I do try to insert the M as so long as they're not too creepy I think I'm usually I've gotten some really funny one and then I think generally at crypto events I like to hang out and working on and I try to do some floors I can so if you see me out at a comfort and sort of meet up for at a crypto event would love to chat I always like it when people tell me what they're working on or say I have ideas and then um yeah just engaging in dialogue I love arguing with people conflict or just a costume industry to the West Village yeah I spend time in the West Village so if you like so it cost me well I'm getting my morning coffee okay okay great um well let us know if that happens all right well thanks to both of you for coming on Unchained thanks Laura thanks Laura this is also nice my god I cannot alright thanks so much for joining us today to
