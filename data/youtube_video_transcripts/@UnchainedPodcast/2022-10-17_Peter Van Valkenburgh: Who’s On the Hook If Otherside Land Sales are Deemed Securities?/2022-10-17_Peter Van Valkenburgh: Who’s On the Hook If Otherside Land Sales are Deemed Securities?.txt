if they were deemed Securities and there was a settlement or if it went to court and a judge found that that was a proper distinction by the SEC that they are securities the issuers would be on the hook for unregistered Securities issuance because they were supposed to do disclosures or else fit into some other exemption like only selling to accredited investors or things like that which to my knowledge most nft projects don't do whereas a lot of token projects do do now out of abundance of caution the assets to the extent they trade on secondary markets wouldn't be able to trade on secondary markets like coinbase or or Kraken or things like that they'd have to trade on National Securities exchanges and alternative trading systems that are supervised by the SEC and the purchasers well you're not doing anything illegal when you purchase the security even a security that's unregistered um because you're sort of considered the victim in the sec's eyes
