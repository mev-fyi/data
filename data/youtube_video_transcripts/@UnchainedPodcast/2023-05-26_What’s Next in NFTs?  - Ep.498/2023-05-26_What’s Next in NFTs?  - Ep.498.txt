[Music] foreign welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The cryptopians I started coming crypto eight years ago and as a senior editor at Forbes was the first mystery media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the May 26th 2023 episode of Unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy trade and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description stator Labs is a multi-chain liquid sticking platform with 40K plus D5 Partnerships across six chains soon they'll be coming to ethereum with their LST ethx visit statorlabs.com eath to sign up for their ethx Alpha list today's guest is Luke miles founder of mint.fun Welcome Luke hi Laura thanks for having me the nft world has been all about Bitcoin ordinals recently but you're launching a new product on the OG chain for nfts what is mint.fun mint.fun is a aggregator where we show every nft project on ethereum that's releasing right now like on the primary Market uh like new mints um in one interface and from this interface you can uh mint directly onto like smart contracts so yeah we we show nfts that people are launching today and we let you mint them from our website it's kind of like the Reddit of web3 or like I like to think about it that way because we show the current moment of web3 and let you kind of interact with it right from our website and so why would users be interested in mint.fun what problem are you solving for them yeah so we solve a couple of different problems one problem is like I think people I mentioned this kind of Reddit use case I think that um a number of people kind of want to understand like what are people doing with nfts like what's hot what's going on right now so just as like you know kind of a view interface like oh like these are the mft projects people are using right now I actually have heard from a lot of people even um like project creators like hey like it's really important for us and our strategy to get noticed on this like mint.fun home page just as like kind of a visibility thing because people want to know what's going on the other problem we solve is um Discovery is like kind of the first thing we saw the other problem we solve is interacting with different smart contracts and things like that so we actually build the interface for um nft collections automatically we can take a smart contract and we let people knit right from our website and so the advantage to that is a couple of things I think in general web3 front end like the websites themselves are getting better but for a long time like most front ends like didn't work on mobile or would have like really subtle weird bugs or they wouldn't work with like this one wallet so just by having a very polished front end we kind of we support like every wallet um we support mobile really well over half of our traffic is actually mobile web um and I think that's because we support mobile really well which I think is higher than most uh web3 dapps or websites um and then like the final thing we solve is um kind of uh security um so that's one nice thing about mint.fun is when you see a project on mint.fun and you click like the mint button you can be confident that what that will do is mint an nft to your wallet as opposed to like you know maybe sign away your assets or you something like kind of sketchy because we're also on our back end verifying what's going on we're like okay this function mints and nft it's not going to be doing anything else so those are kind of the three things we kind of help with like Discovery like actually helping you you know go from Discovery to minting an asset really fast and then we do you know vetting and security just on a technological level and so how does this differ from like a blur or an open c the primary difference between uh blur or open C is the main use case for blur or openc is the secondary market so usually projects have already released and people are you know trading the assets you know Post Release or or they're not generally available we focus on the moment that nfts first come out the primary market so our focus is just almost entirely on how can we help you discover the stuff that's still releasing um you know you could imagine a scenario where like you know one common like story is like oh like you know the crypto punks like you know it took like a few months to Mint out and that's because you know the market was much smaller not a lot of people knew about it we can kind of service those moments as they're happening like in my opinion nft mints are kind of like really exciting like cultural forces like this is a really fun moment and so by focusing on that that's our that's how we're different blur and open C are both great at like kind of the secondary trading experience and I think we can complement those products um also back end is this really challenging in the sense that like I know for exchanges that um integrating coins from different blockchains can take you know a fair amount of work but is it that since everything's on ethereum that basically and it's all falling in the same standard that it's pretty automated for you or or is there more complexity to that it's both like probably easier than integrating different chains and like harder than like building a Marketplace it's like kind of it's in between um so the way uh it works is there is a standard for nfts on ethereum uh you know ERC 721 or ERC 1155 those are standards that you know are composable and easy to build upon the thing that there's not actually a standard for is how do you create an nft how do you mince an nft how do you sell an nft so the clever part that we do is we actually look at okay looks like nfts are being created here at this contract and then our software kind of parses what's going on and then turns like looks at this chain looks at the Smart contract and says oh like this is this function if you call it and send it this amount of eth you will get an nft back and so the the thing we solve there is like we automate like the entry point to like minting an nft um so that that's kind of the clever bit that we figured out and we can even do this without having access to the source code or the ABI like we can do it if if you don't see an option on etherscan to do it and so that's yeah so it's kind of like somewhere in the middle between like you know supporting 20 blockchains and like you know supporting like the the standardized functionality of nft contracts yeah I mean in my personal experience and I'm not an experienced nft person um but I have minted nfts on etherscan so prior to mint.fun what were the main ways that people minted nfts yeah yeah so I think there's a couple of ways I mean I would say the most common way like number one is people would make websites like one-off websites and as I alluded to earlier you know sometimes even really great ethereum smart contract developers don't know how to like make a great website like that's kind of a different orthogonal skill set so probably number one would be websites and so some would be great some would be poor uh maybe again maybe it wouldn't support the wallet that you decided to use and then yeah etherscan I mean I think those are probably the two main and then of course like you know the longer tail like platforms like you know you can think of like the like the foundations and the Zoras of the world the manifolds all these platforms where that kind of give Creator tools I think that's kind of what the landscape looked like a couple years ago it's still what it looks like now although I will say that like we've seen for example smart contract devs like they don't want to put together a website they're saying hey you commit or nft on etherscan and I've seen this happen organically like maybe a dozen times someone in the replies is like actually you can also admit this on mint.fun and then the smart contract developers like oh yeah here like I'll share that link because that's a lot easier than figuring out the etherscanned UI or something like that yeah yeah I mean for me as you know like uh yeah I just cover crypto which is different from like being in crypto um it is uh a challenge when I go to try to do these things and it's like I know in theory what they are and everything but then the actuality of trying to use the tools is a totally different ballgame um so you also launched a reward system called Fun Drop what is that yeah so fun drop is our reward system we thought it would be really fun to experiment with different ways of rewarding our users um so we launched this uh mid-april the way we launched this was we we announced the fun drop uh like this like series of rewards and we said okay if you want to be part of these rewards you can mint a fun drop pass which is an nft that has no value um it just kind of your membership into the program it's actually sold down like you can't transfer it it's just it just meant to be like commemorative to show that you did something on chain uh and on chain is really important to us as a product you did something on chain to join and so that was like really really exciting um in the in the first month that we launched the Fun Drop pass you know just announcing the pass really and we showed a leaderboard with like points uh we gave people points both for the retroactive uh ethereum usage and continued usage of mint.fun we saw about 200 1000 passes get minted in the first month um which was really cool to see like 200 000 people or 200 000 wallets I should say signed up for Rewards and the idea that we've been doing is so we've been giving points for again uh ethereum activity before we started the Fun Drop um using mint.fun and we've also been encouraging people to keep up like a streak on the website which is like mincing an nft every day just trying to make it like a fun little like game of how can you get to the top of the leaderboard how can you keep get points now you know one question we get a lot is like okay well what are the points good for um like you know they're just they're just numbers in a database they're not the points themselves aren't even on chain or tradable well the points um we've been giving out weekly rewards based on the points so we the first fun Friday was on I think it was May uh May 19th yeah it was the first fun Friday which is our like now we're giving rewards for the points stop me if you have any questions but I can just I'll just wrap this up and say that we uh we announced the first fun Friday with um an nft drop that was like an exclusive nft drop um we gave that to about half of the people admitted to the nft to kind of make it somewhat exclusive and then we gave an even rarer version of that uh to um like I think I think four or five thousand people we put on the allow list so we worked with this pixel artist numo he made this really fun animation of a arcade machine and we we uh we kind of gave that out to every single person who had uh met that criteria the other really exciting thing we did um which has been like really fun is we announced this thing called gas rewards and on uh the 26th which might be the day this comes out we're going to be giving uh the first gas rewards to the users which more or less we're going to be reimbursing people's gas that they've used to keep their streak alive on on the website we're still you know we're doing the mod the math like we've been modeling this out on our end um you know paying for people's gas nfts can get very expensive very quickly um and we don't view this as like the long-term goal we definitely don't have unlimited money to give out but we thought it would be cool to again like give people a reward for you know participating on the platform and like you know hey you've been missing nfts every day you've been supporting the tough fund you know gas has been kind of all over the place lately like can we give you a rebate and so we're going to give out the first uh gas words on Friday we're going to keep uh revisiting uh you know what that means in future weeks but the the long term or medium-term goal over the next several months is we will also launch mint.fun on layer twos where gas is a lot cheaper that's another thing we're building towards SO gas rewards right now is kind of a way of saying thanks while you know us and all the other nft platforms you know migrate from more expensive ethereum layer one to layer two technologies um I talked for a while so I'm curious if you have any thoughts or reactions or you know from there but that's what we've been working on it's been a lot of fun and people have been very excited about it so it's been exciting to work on yeah my main reaction is that it reminds me that for certain Banks if you use a different ATM then they will reimburse you your ATM fees so it's something like that um but you're right that in the case of certain banks that do that I think they're doing it because they save on brick and mortar branches and um in your case you know as you mentioned this is probably not sustainable because you're not like saving other costs that you would have otherwise had right yeah um so anyway we're going to talk about the wider nft Market but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible meet stator Labs the non-custodial multi-chain liquid staking platform transforming the liquid staking landscape with over 120 million dollars in assets staked and more than 40K users across six chains stator has partnered with 40 plus top D5 protocols like Ave balancer Etc with a unique multi-pull architecture and tokenomics effects their liquid staking token on ethereum Empower stakers everywhere to run a node with as little as four eighth and earn 35 more than solo staking sign up for their ethx Alpha list today and be the first to know about 1 million dollars in D5 rewards back to my conversation with Luke so nfts were the Catalyst to the last bull market but we're not quite in that same Mania that we were in in late 2021 and early 2022 so how would you describe the last 12 months in nfts yeah I think the last 12 months have been you know it's been kind of like the you know evening off of the cycle I think that there was this moment and you know I wasn't around for like the Ico uh bubble that wasn't exactly something I was participating in but I I feel like you know with what I do know there might have been some parallels where it seemed like there were so many nft projects that you know sold their nfts on this like vision of like we're gonna have this like really really fantastic road map and like here's what the project is you're going to like we're going to do great things with the community and I think some projects actually you know made good on that promise I think you know probably the best example is the Bassy uh the Yuga Labs you know they you know they have their eight best they're they're making their video game you know they they it seems like they're doing like they're doing the road map that they promised unfortunately it seems like a lot of other projects you know weren't so lucky I think 2021 was the year where he saw a lot of these kind of like pfp projects that once had a lot of like attention um say actually no we're going to like you know we're gonna decentralize the community or we're going to like actually not do the road map or you know it turns out we don't have as much money as we thought and so 2021 I think was marked with a lot of I would say kind of like uh you know we woke up to the maybe a more unpleasant reality especially you know if if trading volume goes down if um there's not as many secondary royalty or revenue streams um and if you know even just the price of ethereum is like not where it once was you know I think that um I think 2021 was kind of like a a repricing moment across the board um the the the positive or the upshot or the thing that also was happening I think kind of like mid 2021 towards the you know end in the beginning of 20 or I've been saying 2021 and I mean 2022. uh um but yeah I meant to say last year 2022 I think there was like this huge repricing and then the beginning of this year 2023 the end of it to the beginning um there was also kind of a moment where open editions became really hot and that that actually seemed really interesting to me for a couple of reasons um one because it kind of marked a shift from like um this like pfp project being like the primary like hotness and nfts where like okay like everything has to be like this like hype you know Tenny for uh pfp project I almost feel like one of the last big pfp projects was probably paradigm's art gobblers project which like saw this immense hype and then it leveled off kind of quickly for a couple of reasons that I won't probably get into right now but point being is it kind of felt like something shifted where the idea of like the pfp project being like this organization that's going to do a road map for you is kind of now like dissolving more into the like back into the single um Creator narrative which I think is like probably good because I don't think all nft projects should or can be companies to thread it back through to open editions probably the most successful recent example of this is um Jack butcher's visualized value um his like checks project which started off as a series of open editions uh released on I think both Zora and manifold's platforms and those I think he kind of released those as a um a satirical response to kind of what was happening with Twitter and the check marks plus I think that like his like his style of like explaining stuff through infographics like it all was kind of a perfect storm with also people wanting to Mint open editions and then I think he just kept building on it and just added more and more mechanics I think actually um you know he he's doing like more auctions he's making physical pieces and I think that's kind of like a like a refocusing where you know I think he had done nfts before but I think this like Edition format we're going to actually you know make a Time window where as many of these nfts as you want can be minted there's not necessarily a road map but like maybe we'll build some cool stuff later is kind of becoming more of the norm and I guess like to summarize I think this kind of heavy model of we're going to create this like big nft project for the roadmap is kind of evaporating in the sense of okay no like nfts maybe shouldn't be these 10th floor assets or maybe not all of them can be these 10 8th floor assets so let's like let's try to make nfts that are larger weight and fun I mean to give other quick examples of like you know open editions I've seen a lot of attention um when coinbase announced bass they they made an open Edition that saw a ton of mints I know nouns uh they mentioned an ad um and also I think world coin I I think those examples are both interesting because it shows a lot of appetite for these assets but on the other hand um like I I have wondered if some of the the excitement around those uh three I just mentioned are like it because people want um some sort of token to speculate on like you know the base open Edition uh it kind of happened in the wake of bass announcing also mentioning there's no token for the base chain and then we're gonna do an open Edition I think there was a moment where people thought oh I can speculate on this nft instead so and I I think that that also I think bass really tried to stomp that out but it I'm I'm digressing a little bit but what I'm saying is like I think people are now kind of figuring out how to speculate on these like lighter weight assets and I think hopefully having a lot of fun along the way and I was curious so like with a limited edition typically that meant it was capped at like 10 000 or 7 000 or whatever so like in the open editions like how many um nfts are we seeing minted yeah yeah that's a great um question so like is it a lot more than like 10 000 or yeah yeah no it often is um so I think uh usually the way that the most common release format is like a timed open Edition where okay we're gonna have a week as many convenience in the week so for the most successful ones we've seen you know anything from ten thousand to I think like uh coinbase recently had a uh like we stand with crypto uh charity commemorative nft that had has like hundreds of thousands of mints I think that um people yeah they they see a lot more uh quantity because I think people like collecting these you know I guess like souvenirs or stamps um and it doesn't really matter that there is like a huge um limit or a huge supply I think people want to just collect these assets so that's been an interesting shift I also think that you know maybe we're towards the end of open Edition season just because gas has been so high and like collecting these you know cheaper free assets became a lot more expensive but I'm also maybe this would be a good time to also talk about where like layer twos are going and what that could mean for nfts unless you have more questions on this topic no go ahead um yeah I mean I don't have any Grand big predictions I think there's something in the air when I talk to other um Founders and Builders working in the nft space I think that layer twos um such as optimism such as the upcoming base which is also built into optimism and there are others um layer twos are potentially about to have a moment I mean you know it's kind of like a knock on wood like this is the summer of layer twos I think some people have been saying for like the past three years or something like that um so you know I think that it's very possible um layer twos will have a moment um in the next few months I I know a lot of platforms I've heard you know through the grapevine people are seriously deploying their platforms to optimism seriously considering base um again those are the top ones I hear but the most I think polygon is also you know remains to be a very viable option um and so I think that you know nfts um you know they went from this moment with like the Apes and the punks of being these like really expensive like super desirable luxury assets and I think the shift we're seeing is they're becoming like a lot cheaper like okay like let's just like collect something to commemorate this fun moment and because they're becoming these cheaper assets like across the board it means that you know the economics of paying 15 to collect you know 15 in each to uh to in transaction fees to collect one of these assets makes a lot less sense now and so um I think Layer Two is kind of are poised to have a moment alongside the like the broader shift we're seeing in nfts so well it remains to be seen what I can say is mint.fun uh is building towards uh integrating layer twos as I mentioned earlier because high gas and expensive gas is very crushing to the like the the this wave of experimentation we're seeing in nfts and ultimately I think you know the name of our product is mint.fun and we think it's important that people can have fun like collecting crypto and nfts so we just want to enable that yeah and so you're adding layer twos on ethereum but obviously we've also seen a lot of activity on Solana and Bitcoin for nfts so I was curious if you were gonna add those chains as well so I I definitely like have been carefully watching um ordinals uh I think that they're they're you know potentially one of the most interesting use cases of Bitcoin ever I mean I like Bitcoin as an asset but you know as an application uh chain it's definitely not had a ton of you know huge moments and ordinals is really awesome yeah like the first couple weeks it launched I um I like I synced a Bitcoin node and ran the ordinal software you know did in the inscription it's something that I we definitely look at um I think it's not something that um we're going to support you know right away but I mean who knows I think that like as more and more activity moves to bitcoin or even even Litecoin uh like that could be really interesting for us to support I think for us the way we're thinking about it is okay all we support is ethereum mainnet so we kind of need to like build the product around supporting multiple chains and then the conversation gets a lot easier I actually recently made um a dune dashboard I could maybe link it to you I tweeted it recently that shows all of the chain like layer two chain nft activities and someone kind of thought it was thought as being silly but I also put Bitcoin ordinals uh like like the nfts I even excluded the the uh I think people are doing like people are doing like uh like fungible coins on ordinals so I excluded yeah BRC 20s crc20s yeah the name was escaping me so I'm like I I just kind of showed that as a baseline because actually like yeah there's more activity than on bitcoin ordinals for nft assets than like a lot of layer twos right now and so I have the hunch that just for a number of reasons because I've again I own some ordinals I've like interact with it it's kind of my job I think to at least see what's going on um I think that there's I think we will see more adoption with ethereum layer twos mostly because I do think Bitcoin ordinals are like pretty difficult to use on like a number of levels and I think they're really cool but I I it is cool to see people like magic Eden other marketplaces um support them uh like and build stuff that I think some people didn't even think was possible a few months ago so it's really exciting because I love experimentation I love when people have fun I I think what's something that we will probably if we do support it it'll be a little bit later but I definitely like keep tabs on it and with Solana nfts um it's to be honest with you I I haven't actually done as much digging in Solana uh with nft specifically it's just not something we get a lot of um requests for weirdly in Netflix and we've got more requests for Bitcoin ordinals it's just when we talk to our users like people care a lot about layer twos you know we've even had some requests for like ordinals and things like that um we just haven't seen like you know kind of a broader like kind of artist or community on Salon in the same way but it's again I I never say never it's just it's probably something we'll support down the line if we do it yeah yeah I think that wave was really more um earlier before mint top fun was around um all right Luke this was a
