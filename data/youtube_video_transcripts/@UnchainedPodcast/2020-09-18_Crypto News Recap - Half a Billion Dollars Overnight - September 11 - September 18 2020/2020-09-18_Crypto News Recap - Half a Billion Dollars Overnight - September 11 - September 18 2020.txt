prompted him to return 38 000 east to the project's treasury fund nomi wrote in a post i would like to apologize to everyone who i have caused troubles to he said i was emotional i was greedy i was afraid i made bad controversial decisions under pressure and it hurt everyone i failed your expectation and i am sorry nomi went on to say that whatever reward he deserves for creating the project

the sec in a settlement announced this week the sec had accused unicorn of raising 31 million through its unicoin gold token sale in violation of securities laws in a press release the sec said that while the firm promised to use the funds to add more features to the platform it failed to register the sale of the tokens which the sec alleges were offered as investment contracts sec commissioner hester purse who has long been an advocate for cryptocurrencies dissented the resolution pointing out that unicorn was not accused of committing fraud but rather a registration violation and that its punishment will effectively force the company to cease operations due to this registration violation as she has in the past she advocated for a three-year safe harbor for token issuers saying that in unicorn's case it would have been able to use the time to identify new uses for the token and expand its user base next headline why bitcoin cash may fork into two again a contentious disagreement within the bitcoin cash community threatens to split the network at the time of the upcoming semi-annual upgrade one side called bitcoin abc created a funding plan that would redirect eight percent of the block reward to an address controlled by bitcoin abc for intersect for infrastructure development but only as long as the miner was using the abc client any block not redirecting funds to the abc address would be orphaned meaning it would not be added to the chain by the abc miners a new forked node called bch node instead follows the chain with the most proof of work and does not redirect eight percent of the block reward to the abc wallet that of course means that blocks mined by the bch node client will be considered invalid by the abc miners hence the risk of a split more than 50 of bch blocks are currently being mined using the bch end client giving the bchn miners confidence that they will have the chain with the most proof of work however the question remains of how the bitcoin how the bch network might continue to fund itself without this infrastructure funding bitcoin abc is essentially responsible for creating bitcoin cash and has tried to rely on donations for funding over the past three years with little success the faction that created bchn is protesting that bitcoin abc hasn't proven enough value to the community to warrant what they argue is a tax furthermore they say this infrastructure funding proposal will give too much power to a single developer team we will see if bitcoin cash splinters yet again time for fun bits crypto normies are
