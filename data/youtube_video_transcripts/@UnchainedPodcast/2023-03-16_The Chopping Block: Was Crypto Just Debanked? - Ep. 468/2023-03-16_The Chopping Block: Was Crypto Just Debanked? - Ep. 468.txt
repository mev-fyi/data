not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to the shopping blog every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day first up we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound we've got to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and then you've got myself I'm a Steve the head height man a dragonfly so all four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see trappingblock.xyz for more disclosures okay so holy [ __ ] it has been an insane week I've gotten so little sleep over the last like 72 hours um so we're recording this on I guess uh this is Tuesday Morning us time I'm actually in the Middle East right now so it's it's Tuesday night for me but um we've just gone through one of the most intense periods of kind of both macro generally especially for those of us who are in the US and are dependent on the US banking system but also for crypto that a whole lot of craziness has happened over the weekend um so let's let's let's kind of start from the top and just recap for those of you who are asleep at the wheel or who don't really follow what's going on in crypto um the big story was the collapse of Silicon Valley bank so I'm not going to reiterate everything that's happened there's been a thousand explainers on Silicon Valley Bank but just the very very short version Silicon Valley Bank is a big bank that uh not sorry it's not a big bank it's like a mid-sized bank it's like the 16th 15th biggest bank in the US um but they Bank a huge number of the startups that come out of Silicon Valley so the thing like 50 of all startups and fifty percent of all companies that IPO uh that are in the technology sector bank with Silicon Valley Bank so Silicon Valley Bank uh ended up having a run in the bank on Thursday such that the bank was taken over on Friday morning by FDIC FDIC is basically uh one of The Regulators of Banks and they basically said look uh you are now insolvent the government is taking over the bank and we are going to run this thing going forward uh this freaks out a huge number of people who are in the technology sector who realize they no longer had access to their money and the Assumption was going to be that uh by Monday morning either one the bank was going to be purchased two uh the bank was going to be basically wound down uh or three that uh there was going to be some kind of fed backstop or FDIC backstopping the bank so that everyone's gonna make their money uh everyone's gonna get their money back but nobody knew what was going to happen and at the time there didn't seem to be at least on you know Friday Saturday not a lot of signaling from the fed from treasury or from the president that anything was going to happen that this wasn't going to be just another bank wind down now Silicon Valley Bank is the second largest bank failure in American history uh it is a it was a massive bank with over 200 billion dollars in deposits and the fact that they were involved in banking so many companies um made them somewhat unique because over 90 percent of all of the uh deposits at svb at Silicon Valley Bank were uninsured meaning that FDIC which normally insures two fifty thousand dollars of all Bank deposits would basically ensure almost nothing that would come out of svb and so if everybody at svb was basically just like Hey we're going to sell the bank we'll see what we get back the bank obviously had a lot of losses in their portfolio whatever we get on the bank is what you're going to get back and so a huge number of startups many of which are in the crypto sector bank with svb and basically no longer have access to their money didn't know if they were going to make payroll didn't know if they were going to you know have their have their uh their Runway or their bankroll basically cut in in half or even less than that um but it's not just startups it's also big companies that happen to have a lot of money with svb um so for one uh Circle so Circle is uh the company that that does usdc which is one of the largest stable coins in circulation USBC it turns out one of the seven banks that they used was svb and svb they I think they announced on Saturday uh that svb held 3.3 billion dollars of circle deposits and when people realized that USD uscc part of the uscc uh reserves were held in svb all hell broke loose and all of a sudden usdc depegged dramatically it drove all the way down to 88 cents over the weekend as people were massive Panic selling trying to get out of usdc moving into tether moving into Bitcoin and ether um and it caused a huge amount of Mayhem in uh on-chain on-chain activity uh which we'll we'll get into uh shortly so just very quickly just to end the in The Saga on Monday uh basically on Sunday evening the FDIC Treasury and the FED uh made a joint statement saying hey this is unacceptable we are going to make sure that all Silicon Valley Bank depositors are made whole they also shut down Signature Bank which is another transactional bank in crypto which he does uh one of the other Banks besides silvergate that banked a lot of crypto companies uh that was put into receivership on Sunday night and uh but they basically said look we're going to provide extra liquidity backstop for all banks make sure the banking sector in the US is going to be okay especially for midsize and Regional Banks which were the primary uh uh the primary place where people were worried about their deposits but uh and that caused uscc to eventually repack and and regain some confidence but not after having it caused enormous amount of thrash over the weekend and also raising expectations for uh the FED cutting interest rates sooner than otherwise expected and so now the expectation for interest rates is much lower than what it was because we've seen you raise interest rates too much guess what things break and in this case it was Silicon Valley Bank and a lot of the mid-sized banks in the US that broke so that's a very very quick summary of the high level of what happened over the weekend um I want to dive into what happened with usdc when uscc depacked a huge amount of stuff broke uh we saw a huge amount of dye being minted a huge amount of all the stable coins that were using uscc on the back end such as maker Dow and frax had huge issues and they themselves depeg pretty dramatically over the weekend what were you guys seeing in just all the Mayhem that was being caused on defy from uscc losing the Peg and going down to 88 cents well I think there's a lot less that went wild and defy than when Wild on exchanges and globally so in comparison the impact on D5 I think was actually quite subtle and muted compared to the impact on the rest of the world the total amount of volume on exchanges both you know centralized executions and decentralized exchanges trading USD coin went through the roof whether that was you know um on centralized exchanges or you know curve plus you know volumes across the board were just wild because there's never been such a volatile moment for USD coin period full stop um tether historically has t-pegged a few cents a couple times um but because there were so many questions about the redeemability of USD coin whether or not on Monday people were going to be able to redeem it to what potential losses it was exposed to you know with 3.3 billion dollars of USD coins Reserves at Silicon Valley Bank the combination of fears about irredeemability plus you know solvency plus uncertainty around how USD coin could be redeemed whether it be first come first serve and if there was losses you know the last ones out would eat it or whether you know there would be something that would be proportioned across all users all this uncertainty led to the price of it going far below any possible losses you know 88 cents if you do the math assumes more than the assets at Silicon Valley Bank are vaporized it assumes you know roughly five billion dollars of their reserves are um missing and the reaction was just crazy so you know I I saw the biggest um impact of this just being you know frenetic trading of USD coin I mean I feel bad for everybody that sold at 88 cents or you know around that range um but it was driven by a very rational fear it was I don't know if I'm gonna get anything out of this you know whether I'm a U.S resident and I'm not gonna be able to redeem it or whatever just I want to get out what I can right now right this second and worry about the rest later and so the exchanges were the number one you know I think like focal point of the impact of this DPAC event in default you saw you know as we've started to talk about you know a number of systems have to react to a asset that was generally stable becoming unstable most of D5 is set up or the expectation that assets are volatile um and are designed around that accordingly but you know I think the biggest impact actually comes from Maker Now where you know roughly like at this point two-thirds of the dye Supply comes from USD coins so everyone's been talking about how ustcoin depeg died depeg equally die in USD when we're trading almost one to one the entire massive d-peg event because um there was these flows where there's an Arbitrage where you could take USD coin put it into die mint more die and then sell that die for anything more than the USD coin was worth and so during this debeg event the biggest you know defy impact had to have been on Maker Now um you know I I don't know who individual addresses are but people on Twitter were saying that Justin's son minted like a billion dollars worth of dye or something like that you know but all of the spare capacity in the peg stability module um to create that using USD when was tapped out and emergency proposals were very quickly created to change the way that dye is created and redeemed um in response to the DPAC event and so you know maker Dow had massive event um you know exchanges like uniswap and curve were completely unaffected platforms like compounds took proactive steps um USD coin was temporarily disabled um for new users existing users could continue to use it but as a preventative step new users were no longer able to supply USD coin um Ave I believe um the was it arbitrum or optimism one of the markets they basically like completely turned off and you know all of these different systems had to account for this just like out of left field radical devaluation and what everyone's considered a stable coin and how it impacts our systems but frankly I didn't see anything truly Break um in D5 you know the most important thing in my mind is that even with this Black Swan of all black swans USD coin which everyone thought was stable depegging massively in an incredibly short amount of time 12 in minutes and hours everything stood up um pretty well I didn't see any knock-on effects of the system failing as a result of USD coin depending so pretty impressive performance it's important to understand the mechanism here because just because Circle did not have access to three billion dollars of deposits in and of itself should not have made USD coin depeg right so if you remember um what was it it was like two three years ago that tether had this uh crypto Capital event where like crypto Capital was some like payment processor or something in Europe that like stole their money or whatever and they were you know I don't know there was under some investigation there was some weirdness right and they lost a bunch of money and um tether didn't actually uh you know attend the d-pad for a little while but it was like fine after that and the reason why is that the thing that keeps uscc stable is not having Reserves it keeps usdc Sable is the Arbitrage and the thing that actually caused the d-peg was not that circle like didn't have the money was lost svb blah blah blah whatever the reason why it depeged is that coinbase decided to pause all conversion of usdc over the weekend now the reason I suspect and I I don't know if they publicly have explained what what exactly happened but the reason why I suspect this took place was not because svb was used to redeem uscc on weekends but rather because there was so much demand for people to pull their money out that the only transactional Network that still could support withdrawals and this brings us to the other story about you know the the two the two banks that basically have gone down last week the two banks that had 24 7 settlement for a digital asset uh uh uh customers were silvergate which had a 24 7 Network called sen where you could basically settle with other people who are using silvergate any time of the day 24 7 just on their own Ledger right this is these are not 24 7 wires because wires don't clear 24 7. but uh you could just trade you know sort of swap balances on their Ledger um the other one was signature and signature had a system called uh Signet or like it still does a system called Signet which allows you to trade 24 7 as well um and so silvergate was obviously shut down last week which we talked about in the previous show uh with Hayes and so with with silvergate down it's only Signet that's left and I have to assume that what happened was that they had so many Redemption requests on Friday when seeing all the craziness going on with Silicon Valley Bank that people were just trying to redeem redeem redeem redeem redeem uh uscc and probably you know if they also had 3 billion on signature that 3 billion was probably completely burned through by the weekend and so by Saturday they're like we have no more money left on Signet we can't actually redeem anybody on Signet you have to wait till Monday until we can wire you money on one of the other banks on which we still have cash and so because of the loss of silvergate that is actually what probably indirectly caused this inability for them to redeem people and cause uscc to debeg not actually obviously Silicon Valley Bank triggered everyone's fear but it was the it was the inability to redeem because the vast majority of um you can see actually from the through the weekend is that the uh the queued up redemptions for a circle actually were enough to be to be Redeemed by all of their cash Reserves yeah I think it's pretty spot on I mean in total three billion usdc was redeemed I think from Friday through Sunday and so it's exactly what you said like the create redeem our bloop is broken and so everyone's looking for something else to flee to you can't flee to USD and so they're just going to all these other different assets going to tether things like that yeah I mean uh I I wouldn't say defy actually was completely scot-free there were certainly a couple incidents there are a couple things to note um here the first thing to note is uh Native usdc doesn't exist on all chains so some chains uh main form of usdc's synthetic usdc and the synthetic and Native U.S the bridge USC and synthetic usdc deviated quite a bit which is in part you know don't worry I didn't sleep all weekend because I was spending all this time trying to like and you know we were spending a lot of time I mean I think people just lost confidence in the the like Liquidators weren't liquidating bridged usdc on some lending protocols because basically like Avalanche was the main one where we saw a lot of this uh this type of stuff where people were like instead of liquidating hold positions they were liquidating like very tiny chunks uh repeatedly because no one wanted to take large size risk in uh the synthetic because there wasn't as much liquidity for for going between the two like people pulled all their LP like the lp shares were drained in a lot of different pools so the liquidity so you know this is why we spent I've spent all weekend we you know our team was really focused on uh understanding like which protocols were really sensitive to all these LPS who are pulling all their uscc liquidity and bridged usdc liquidity from other chains so Avalanche arbitrum optimism obviously had these kind of like flight liquidity flight that sort of eventually came back by Monday morning but there were definitely were things you know ethereum mainnet you know that is the gold standard like very few people pulled right curve did 10 billion dollars of volume or whatever but off ethereum mainnet uh things were very very wild uh in a way that I think reminded me a little bit of the Solana the the FTX day when like everything was depegging um no one wanted to hold any of the synthetics and it turned out they were right then because after FTX uh it turned out that like a lot of synthetics were actually supposedly custodied by FTX like the the Solana wrapped BTC and then it turned out they they didn't exist and so I think the market also had this huge getting spooked of the the wrapped in synthetic versions and you just saw like liquidity vanish much faster off ethereum than on ethereum so there were definitely like these second order effects uh that caused risk on some of these other chains to like really grow way faster than it did on ethereum ethereum LPS actually were extremely profitable but liquidity providers on other chains it was it was it was a very kind of harrowing weekend let's say I'm sure someone took some there are some sources that you can see that took some extreme losses that had some of the protocols had paused or done other things you might have they might not have so so I guess I would say It's A Tale of Two Cities ethereum was uh you know very safe uh but like everywhere else was like much more of a uh Doggy Dog uh liquidity free like uh you know pogrom I don't know how else to describe it it was it was violent it was violent like the med pools were violent off a period sounds like pandemonium I mean we we also saw during that time was the incredible amount of on-chain activity of people just trying to run for the hills and get rid of their usdc um a lot of people just wanted to take their ufcs people a lot of people want to just take usdc off ethereum move it to ethereum mainnet you saw the bridge transactions all going One Direction um that's another thing that was interesting so a lot of the liquidity that was on these other teams it was just everyone just wanted to go everyone wanted to go back to ethereum yeah and that that caused this kind of panic on some of these other chains that right and probably luckily quite a lot yeah yeah yeah yeah it was a pretty uh popular um Mev transaction that was floating around uh where someone would think was trying to swap like a few mil usdc to usdt through like kyber or one of the um sort of long tail aggregators and and they they [ __ ] up one of the parameters in the swap like the slippage or whatever and they ended up losing almost all of their money um because like they got you know sort of dust usdt in return so people were kind of panicking and like just trying to market sell usdc and then obviously when liquidity is drying up fees are going up that's kind of what you get yeah like like in the car in the kyber case in particular there was like one particular pool that was routed through that only had two dollars of liquidity and so the the user took like a hundred almost 100 slippage which is which is exactly what like effectively like stuff like that uh I think some of the aggregators indexing wasn't working correctly um and it was way worse off ethereum mainnet uh and so there was a ton of stuff that went wrong off ethereum mainnet so I I wouldn't call this I wouldn't give this an A plus let's put that yeah but I I suppose like the closer to ethereum mainnet the more it was just like good old-fashioned panicking and um people made a lot of money like like think about curve LPS curve LP is made out um I think they're nominal amount earned was like 10 to 12 per day while you were while it was de-pegged and it came back so yeah they're just holding from the from the bottom too no no this is on top of that yeah right like I'm saying they they they did they they they they didn't know the curve out curve LPS did really well um but off ethereum is not that's not the same story right right that makes sense yeah I mean so for us you know our experience with this whole drama was especially intense because dragonfly we actually bank with svb and so on Thursday so you know zooming back from D5 back to the normal world on Thursday so actually we had two Banks our first bank was silvergate and our Second Bank was SUV and so on Monday we're like oh [ __ ] silver Gates going under we should pull our money out we pulled our money out successfully from silvergate put it onto svb and we're like okay confuse okay SBB is like a real you know super legit Bank like everything will be fine and then Thursday we start seeing this news at like oh SBB there's like all these rumors about oh there's this phone call and the guy like kind of sound panicked and he didn't seem really great um and people are saying like oh pull your money at an svb and I'm like oh that's crazy it's actually you know Silicon Valley Bank like what could possibly happen and then as we see the stock starting to tank we're like oh [ __ ] maybe we should take our money out and so we start withdrawing all of our money on Thursday trying to wire it out and um there was there was actually we didn't have any other Banks set up because we just gotten off of silvergate basically on Monday so uh trying to get the money into another bank which wasn't enough time to actually onboard anywhere so we decided to pull all our money into coinbase and the idea is that we're going to pull our money into coinbase coinbase uses a combination of banks like you know silvergate JPMorgan cross river and once we get our money into coinbase you can this isn't exactly a bank but we could then convert it into usdc and then use that to continue our operations and so we were literally getting debanked uh as a venture fund and and our solution was literally to use Sable coins because we had no other we had no other realistic option to get back Banks and to be able to like fund our ourselves but then although we queued up the wires on Thursday Friday the bank was put into receivership and the wires hadn't been processed yet so we were basically in the same position as Circle which is that we had queued up wires before the bank was taken over but the bank but the wires weren't processed so the whole weekend I got like you know two hours of sleep at night it was one of the most intense weekends of my life I was just trying to figure out are we going to get our money back as a fund and so we were like we didn't know we were going to make payroll we didn't know if like we'd lost LP money it was a really [ __ ] intense weekend um so you know I I think look either way it was quite likely that something was going to happen either one the Fed was going to bail things out or that there was going to be a buyer or that you know uh or or that they were gonna honor wires that took place before the bank was put into receivership which apparently is common although it's not guaranteed um but either way I mean we were just kind of staring down the barrel of a gun uh the whole weekend so seeing all that also seeing usdc you know deep pegging and I think all these things and D5 just like you know uh all these assets drawing down it was uh it was one of these moments for me that I was just like Jesus Christ how much do we have to take him to be in this industry yeah you know that Meme where it's like it's like uh uh someone who's like yeah I've been trading two years in crypto it hasn't aged to me at all and then it's like a picture of a really old person I feel like that after this weekend I can tell you I have to tell you I do too this felt even more different um to me than other Market calamities in the past where you know [ __ ] is going crazy because this isn't just like people's fun money this isn't just like someone's portfolio going up and down like svb deposits and usdc like you know these are funds that companies are using for operating expenses for payroll um and so you know over the weekend I don't have people asking me hey what's happening with the coins it's like hey like this is the money that I'm using to run my startup like what should I do with my corporate treasury do you have any banking suggestions should I like put it all into ether because usdc is going to zero it was like it felt a lot more existential than I think some of the other uh Market events yeah I mean the interesting thing that I observed was crypto people were obviously the most vocal on the internet about this thing because you know crypto people never give up a chance to be like haha of the normal Financial system sucks right but uh which you know whatever it's just I I don't feel like anyone should that no one deserves a Victory lap here you know it's like everyone lost for being honest um but the interesting thing I would say is like the people who in my mind were most affected and this maybe gets to some of the political observed political changes over the weekend uh we're definitely like biotech companies because svb is actually very famous for doing biotech operational expense operational Capital funding and a lot of Biotech companies uh not only kept their money at svb but like the conditions for svw sbv svb to give them loans was basically like oh you have to keep all your corporate treasury there then we'll give you these loans and they were sort of like double dipped uh and a lot of those people would have defaulted this Monday morning um had had this not happened and that would have been that would have been much bigger than the tech stuff I I you know I I get the the New York Times wants to just like be like oh these Tech Bros got like a free bailout or whatever but there's a lot of other Industries especially I think once Elizabeth Warren realized um that svb bought uh Boston private which is like one of the biggest uh credit um uh uh sort of local banks in in the New England area that Services biotech companies for instance uh she suddenly changed her tune about like oh like yeah kill this Bank kill the spank to like oh actually my constituents need to be saved as well I thought that was that was like that was one of the funnier things I saw this weekend and that's why I think this like this like continuing narrative that oh it's like we saved the tech Bros thing is like not realistically true the problem is Silicon Valley Bank has the worst [ __ ] name of any Bank history you know the greater Bank of California uh the the bailout would have come like Friday evening you know but it said yeah it's like the whole weekend I I think people underestimate how many other Industries they serve like between Wineries and biotech and stuff like and like I just found the the the way people were talking about it and using it to bully pulpit their their political thing a little bit wild and like just this misguided like not not actually looking like the numbers it was finally on Saturday that Silicon Valley figured out how to message because I feel like it was Saturday that I started seeing like all these like threads of like you know I'm a I'm I'm a Founder like a young woman I started my first startup I finally got funded I've got 12 people working on this new like you know better way to do Logistics and now none of us are going to make payroll and you know these people have kids and they have this and they have that and it's like okay yeah now you finally grounded this in stories that people give a [ __ ] about rather than you know so I mean look I obviously I was very nervous but I'm a VC who gives a [ __ ] about me like they're you know people people are not gonna people you're not gonna resonate with like okay crypto startups and Tech startups have a bunch of money there and you know okay they have less money now whatever screw them um also the the VCS on Twitter were obscenely embarrassing like that that was just like that is true the the David sacks and and Kyle can this thing I feel like is like just a question here on our sister podcast uh I would just say it was just quite embarrassing to read some of that stuff it shows how tone deaf people are uh it did remind me a lot of 2008 uh not in the good ways and in spite of the fact that it was like a much more reasonable crisis than than what was written so I really I really hope that they they learned some lessons you can tell that they're eating some Humble Pie right now um but we'll see how long they'll last yeah yeah I mean at the end of the day like obviously at the at the center of this where you know a lot of startups and we we chatted with a lot of folks in our portfolio who are very exposed if if uh if SVD were to go down so it's it's great that things normalized now the other thing is that you know sort of again looking back over the week so we lost silvergate earlier in the week signature was taken over on on Sunday and with with signature signature is the interesting one because there's now a lot of uh rumor and innuendo going around that signature was kind of a kind of a hatchet job is that actually signature was was maybe potentially fine uh the signature actually had enough liquidity to be able to meet all the redemptions that were coming in over the weekend signature was one of the banks that was under pressure earlier in the week in their stock price along with First Republic and a few others um but signature according to uh Barney Frank who's actually one of the co-authors of the Dodd-Frank Act uh he was on the board of signature and Barney Frank said in an interview that when uh when the Department of Financial Services came in and took over the bank um they were they were they were initially not planning to take over the bank they initially were like um we're kind of watching but we think that things are okay we're going to go ahead and let you guys keep operating and then midday they sort of changed their mind and decided never mind guess what we're taking it over we don't we don't trust you anymore and um so Barney Frank insinuated that he thinks the reason why signature was shut down was to punish them for their crypto activity and because signature was so associated with crypto even though if you recall a couple months I think it was a couple months ago signature announced that they were going to be basically off-boarding some of their crypto clients to reduce the the concentration of crypto deposits in the in in the bank so now it's it's it was reduced to something like 20 or less of their deposits were coming from crypto so the majority of it was you know non-crypto which obviously crypto is a volatile depository base um and so you know Barney's claim is that hey I think that they were coming after us because we're crypto uh the New York Department of Financial Services denied this uh they said no you know the reason why we took it over is that we lost confidence in leadership and their claim I think it seems a little bit of he said she said thing right now they claim that we were asking them for real-time data they stopped providing it we didn't have confidence that they actually had enough visibility into their own kind of withdrawal queue that was building up over the weekend um and that was why we decided to take over the bank just because like we just we just weren't sure that they actually were really running it can can we point out that it's a little bit ironic to say that a bank didn't give you real-time information about their withdrawal queue when a blockchain is literally designed to be a denial of service resistant way for you to get a queue of withdrawals just want to point that out here like there's an irony to that like statement you know from the DFS every single D5 protocol you have radical transparency in any Observer could look in real time to see the health in the state that is right well apparently that was not true signature according to the Department of Financial Services we'll see what plays out because almost certainly there are going to be lawsuits over this one because uh you know signature was had pretty positive equity on Friday when markets closed and um I think the the if if it is true that signature was fine and they were put into receivership anyway uh you know illegitimately obviously you know now people are going to get uh and also I should say that the uh in the joint statement by fed FDIC and treasury they also said that signature deposit is going to be made whole implying that signature was also a failed Bank um if in fact signature was fine and they would be able to continue operating as a going concerned there's probably going to be lawsuits and all hell to raise about this uh but now that I think that the seeds of the conspiracy have been sown I think crypto is now convinced that uh the banking Regulators are are coming after crypto Banks um do you guys think this is right do you think that this is overblown what's your what's your read on the signature uh situation here's my view in a non-conspiratorial sense um the three banks closest to crypto are no longer in existence and no other Banks regardless of the health of their balance sheet or systems have gone under and I think the root cause of all these Banks going under was they all bought bonds at the wrong time you know all of them really had marked the market losses which they didn't have to account for and I think most likely every single bank is in one way or another in the same position where interest rates were low they loaded up the assets either balance sheet with long bonds and they took a horrible loss it's just that these crypto banks are the ones that were forced to account for um those assets through the withdrawal possibility most other banks are probably equally as insolvent or suffering from negative equity they're just not forced to account for it and you know I think you know from a non-conspiratorial sense um you know I I think it was easy for Regulators to just say like hey you Banks were going to have to be placed in a receivership because you're insolvent where if they could do that with any bank today for the most part they could do that maybe not with JP Morgan but they could with probably any other Regional Bank or any other midsize Bank in America it's just that they chose you know in especially in the case of Signature Bank to Target institutions that they felt like targeting and I will say you know to be to be fair we did talk about this on last week's episode about the idea that like the the accounting standards for not even just uh the bonds that they bought but also the agency mortgage-backed Securities and stuff how those get marked is like a dark art and somehow like the regulator regulatory bodies have never just been like hey you just have to say what the price would be if you had to sell it right now and we've never been able to agree on that since 2008 because the US government doesn't want people dumping its bonds and I and I think like we're just like in this very weird limbo where like Regulators never want to force Mark to Market uh which is never going to incentivize Banks to actually do it uh except banks that have heavy transaction volume flow EG blanks that service speculative uh trading which one thing actually one thing that Arthur claimed in the last show which is which was actually incorrect which as we we all learned this over the weekend that that Arthur claimed he claimed but by the way he was mostly right about almost everything he said but this one thing he got wrong which is he said that uh Banks hide their Mark to Market losses in their whole maturity portfolios right so when they buy bonds and they basically say I'm going to hold this until you know if it's a 10 year bond I'm gonna hold it for all 10 years um that you know they basically do these these claims that they do these tricks like hide it from on their books um Banks actually report all of the stuff like if you if you go read the 10K for uh the 10K what is it called uh whatever the I don't know what the [ __ ] form is called whatever these things are called these these quarterly disclosures from Banks they actually list all the mark to Market unrealized losses from their whole maturity portfolio now they don't list it in the overall Equity of the bank right because they haven't realized the loss and so that's their earnings there's an encounter earnings don't reflect the earnings right the earnings are reflected but it is basically like you know you add two numbers together and you have the mark to Market losses right it's it's all reported there so it's not a secret but but I will say the following which is that ETF uh rebalancing rules and portfolio rules generally usually just are like hey I have a dividend this is how much I'm going to rebalance they're not like Hey we're going to actually look at the unrealized earnings and construct our portfolio of like the KBW ETF KBW index from that and so there's actually this weird thing where people are forced buying without ever accounting for these losses and that forced buying comes from the passive investment vehicles that just have to buy these stocks so there's also this like very weird it's a very tangled web where like the accounting is there but it's not really like realized in some sense like the financial instruments don't ever price it in and that part I always personally have found a bit sad right no that that's true that's true but that should get armed away right like people should ultimately like if they actually understand the true value of the of the asset relative to like the force buying like markets should figure out [ __ ] out can you explain Dogecoin to me that that's going to be the next show is going to be I explained Dogecoin to tarun while we're both on huge amounts of acid the the number one thing I I learned in recent weeks that I I never understood there was this there's a dog coin which is extremely popular in crypto called Paws Inu p-a-w-s-i-n-u and I always was just like okay like there's a million of these emu coins every time there's a hack like for instance like the Euler hacks we'll talk about literally 30 seconds later there was an Euler hack Inu coin made um I don't understand exactly why the shibi new thing but pause that you knew is very special because it's uniswap backwards which I only I only realized which is like and it's that's actually why it's got so high yeah so anyway my point is these markets aren't efficient that is the one that actually sounds efficient is that yeah you can swap in Reverse should be worth a lot okay wow um okay I don't know I don't know how to transition from from that but uh I think we talked about the Euler hack Oiler hacking you should we talk should we talk about the other hack okay um well the one the one thing that before we before we end this this Saga of crypto banking I mean it's definitely the story is not over um with the death of signature and the death of silvergate it's very clear regardless of whether you believe the story that there's a sort of operation choke point 2.0 thing happening um it is true that crypto has gotten significantly debanked over this week we should see especially with the death of signature and Signet um you know transactional Banking and crypto basically meaning it's 24 7 settlement stuff has taken a huge hit we no longer have a 24 7 settlement system for crypto I I would guess that probably something will pop up fairly soon that will you know step in to try to replace them but for now uh so cross rivers that's right so crossover is the one that seems to be uh that circle is going to start using as their transactional system I think um uh coinbase also uses them uh J uh there's also JP Morgan BMW melon that that uh uh also being coinbase uh sorry coinbase encircle respectively but a lot of banks May respond to this by saying like wow the bank graveyard is full of people who touch crypto maybe I should be more careful about touching this stuff um and so my guess would be that startups are gonna have a much tougher time getting banked by a lot of the big players after what we've seen over the last week there are a few banks that are crypto friendly like series like Mercury these sort of Neo banks that are they're much smaller and more Nimble um but a lot of and there's also you know BCB group and you know a number of other players in Europe that are that are quite crypto friendly but um I think the banking story is going to be we're going to feel the reverberations of that for a while especially when it comes to crypto companies you know being able to on-ramp and off-ramp effectively what's your guys view on this so I have a claim that you know in the same way that stable coins are a little bit like Euro dollars even though obviously because their accounts are held at these Banks they're they are held locally but they are a little bit like Euro dollars in that their dollars sort of held on chain if we view on chain as like the foreign Bank um that people are trading I've never understood one thing which is like when will it actually make sense for foreign Banks to be custodying the dollars that backstable coins like tether does that right but we have no clue where they are but imagine like a a version of circle where Circle opens euro dollar Accounts at you know Credit Suisse or something else maybe we should pick someone more solvent uh PCB or something like that um and they oh they they store the dollars there you wire to to Europe I mean obviously still connect to Swift and they just charge you a higher create redeem fee because like obviously the the cost for the European Bank are higher uh I'm surprised we haven't seen that you know like somehow we focused on making Euro stable coins but why not just make the US dollar stable coin custody outside the US it might actually just like avoid some of these issues I don't know how much it would solve these issues I mean if anything I think right now for us for usdc in particular I think the reason why they they are um why it makes sense for them to use you know us commercial Banks is because so much of the role of uscc was to basically be as different as possible from tether like if you were just using kind of euro dollar Banks like it's kind of like okay is this really that much better than tether like how would I know whereas the fact that they use bny melon and you know all these like very kind of stalwart things um is part of what makes them one more trustworthy and that's kind of their branding is that like where they're more trustworthy stable coin but then also second um to the extent that they want to be the beneficiary of domestic stable corn regulation it's by being above board and you know you know being very squarely within the US regulatory purview I think that's pretty essential to their strategy and and it seems wise to me at least for now I'm just saying someone else could do it you know like paxos now actually has very good reason to go do this because they just lost but I mean there's still quite a bit of boc but my point is the growth story might not be there right it someone will do the euro dollar stable coin I just don't know who it's going to be I mean it's tether right tether is already it's they're crushing it tether is doing it uh I I think like all of the new regulation I think like that it was it the EU today release like the smart contract regulation that closed like all smart contract developers have to include pauses in their transaction what stuff like that to both of your points actually you know it's like in in you know these kind of times there's obviously like a flight to safety and flight to Quality and you know normally would be a flight to usdc and then it would be like a flight to USD in reality like tether was actually trading above a dollar um you know doing a lot of people are trying to get out of usdc and so it's clearly the demand for this like offshore dollar stable coinish thing maybe you could be a little bit more polished but like you know I would argue that's probably like the most sort of senior safe thing in the market based on sort of what they're at the Market's pricing it yeah that that makes sense okay well we'll see what happens um I mean the one the sort of the last element of the story was that after we saw the bailout and an enormous amount of instability to take place on Monday you know a bunch of runs on Regional Banks a lot of a lot of worry about smaller Banks having their having massive deposit flight to the large Banks um you saw basically the the kind of um the the Embers of a banking crisis taking place in the U.S a lot of fear about is this going to spread like wildfire to all the regional Banks and now the expectations for interest rates is that they're basically going to turn a corner before the end of the year and interest rates are I think right now the the curve is pricing uh they don't even hit five percent before rates start getting cut so we're now looking at rate Cuts before the end of the year if the market is right um and if that uh the the other thing that you saw is you saw Equity markets rally and you saw crypto absolutely rip so Bitcoin was up like something like 18 in a single day uh which is one of the best days have had in quite a while and crypto's still up today crypto uh uh Bitcoin is up at 26k at the time of uh us recording the show and I think a lot of this just a response to interest rates interest rates I think is what's driving most of it for crypto crypto massively outperformed um the s p or or the NASDAQ and actually now I just you know it's funny because I was just talking to uh some investors here in the Middle East and uh you know a lot of them are like oh you know since FTX things are really bad and I don't know if like this is investable anymore and I was like okay hold on I gotta show you something I pulled up trading View and I charted Bitcoin versus the NASDAQ since the day before FTX collapsed and actually in that time the NASDAQ is up about like I think it's like six percent and Bitcoin is up 18 since before FTX collapsed so actually Bitcoin has outperformed the NASDAQ in that time despite what you might read in the headlines despite what's been going on globally in large part because Bitcoin and crypto generally is so responsive to interest rates and uh I think the the change in expectation of interest rates despite the fact that interest rates are higher now than they were at the time of FTX um crypto is just done you know just rallied massively over the last uh 48 hours so anyway we we don't have that much time left so I want to make sure that we cover the story about Euler Finance um so Euler Finance uh by the way not Euler it's pronounced Euler uh but it's it's spelled like Euler so if you if I if you hear me say Euler just imagine it's spelled Euler in your head um so Euler Finance is a uh it's basically like a you know on-chain lending protocol it's got some fancy you know tips and tricks and cool stuff it does that's a little bit a little bit different and kind of more Nouveau than uh compound and Ave uh so so Euler was hacked uh over the weekend and let me see if I can explain this hack because I sort of read it very very briefly to ruin please correct me if I'm wrong but basically um the way that this hack worked was that uh somebody uh basically they borrowed a bunch of a certain asset using a flash loan and after borrowing a bunch of that asset they then uh there's a function in the contract that allows you to donate the asset like donate an asset to the contract for some reason like basically just say like hey I just want to give you this because I love you and you're great uh and so they donated a bunch of the asset and for whatever reason this donate function did not check that this would not put you underwater and basically in default on your loan and so they basically did this Force themselves to become in default on the loan and Euler does this fancy thing where if somebody is like really really deeply in default it gives a really big incentive for you to liquidate them because the idea is that if somebody's a little bit in default you only need a little incentive to liquidate them uh so you know a lot of protocols like you know the old school way to do this was that you just have a fixed percentage so you know if you're if you're if you get liquidated it's like five percent flat doesn't matter if you're like one iota in default five percent screw you that's too bad you got liquidated uh whereas Euler does this like kind of floating thing the more in default you are the bigger the bigger the reward is and so they they put their own account into massive amounts of default using this bug in the donation function and then they took another account and liquidated themselves got this massive reward and made money uh from the protocol is that a fair understanding of how this exploit worked to run yep okay that's a good description yeah so there's a Judicial thing my thing my understanding is it's sort of like a dust collection feature um like there are a lot of a maker there are a lot of cdps that are heavily underwater that nobody is liquidating and it's just sort of a crew and this sort of lets you sweep all that you know basically into the protocol I see I see okay that's why that's there so there was 183 million dollars stolen which is a big hack but I mean I don't know we're also a PTSD at this point that it's hard for anything to register uh this donation this donation thing was also something that uh showed up in uh in Ave when like sushi and X Sushi diverged um and so like there's sort of there's actually no way of sort of preventing it um for some annoying technical reasons so they just happen to have an explicit function but you could have just sent the money to the wallet that the pool is in um so it's not it's not it's not the function makes it sound like oh it's like a built-in feature that made it that do this but there's a way to do it without explicitly calling it so just wanted to point that out but I think like one of the issues and you know I think I I you know while obviously most of the the panic and fear and pandemonium of the last few days was people talking about svb the second pandemonium I guess you saw on Twitter was a lot of people like flash loans are the devil and bad and there's sort of this trade-off like how could we how could you know can we just ban them and I I think crypto is this type of thing that's a one-way function like a hash function like once you've unlocked something existing and people find Productive uses for it even if there's bad uses people are not going to stop using it right like the code exists people know how to use it I mean people have been trying to uh ban you know flash floods just sort of making these like moral arguments against them basically since they were um invented and obviously the market is the market that people want them they're extremely useful in many different scenarios just for making things more efficient but some protocols do try to basically ban flash loans by preventing uh smart contracts from using the protocol right you have to have an eoa to open a position or to trade or whatever um but with the rise of account abstraction and uh yeah 4337 you know more and more people are going to be using a smart contract wallet and so I bet those are going to have to get rolled back and like the protocols that thought they were safe from flash loans are now going to be exposed I'm gonna have to figure out some way to send pardon their their protocols going forward yeah so I'm right now uh this reminds me a lot of people who who talk about like when their Market crashes talk about banning Short Selling right it's kind of the same like sort of the same Instinct that like oh if we just like stop this one thing that happens sometimes when bad things happen that the bad things will stop happening and ultimately even if you ban flash loans there are people who have enough money to go do this attack you know there aren't a ton but you know one way or another you'll find a way if you have if you have an exploit you'll find a way to to actually exploit it and so um it's funny because right now I'm I'm in the Middle East and I'm I haven't I haven't spent much time here before and uh you know it's a weird place to be learning about all this stuff because the Middle East has its own version of crypto and its own version of all these different concepts that are kind of filtered through Sharia law in a lot of these places and I was learning about this about like Sharia compliant defy Sharia compliance like like so it turns out like one of the one of the rules in Sharia that I'm I'm coming to understand is that interest is not allowed you can't pay interest on anything right and so if you want to do now of course like that doesn't mean there's no Finance in Islamic countries there obviously is but they find ways to sort of mutate or like you gonna grab this thing put it over here and do something you call it some other name which I'm like oh that's like what D5 does like that's like you like tokenizes one part of it and you give it a new name and then it's like oh it's it's a defy Innovation there go ahead you know in 2019 when I first heard about pool together which is a old school D5 protocol that some of you may remember it's sort of no lost Lottery like you put in money the protocol then takes the pool and puts it into compound takes the interest and then gives it away as a lottery winning to whoever deposited um the Islamic bonds are the same way they basically don't pay interest uniformly to all capital providers they do it as a lottery and the lottery is not users in in by depending on which particular Imam you're asking uh there are obviously some that are like this is all users get out of here but there's some who will be like no no no Lottery is fine it's fairer than Distributing it uh evenly because then it's not you're not really then you're then you're just charging for a service as an individual instead of uh pooling together Capital to oppress the single borrower uh so there's sort of uh there's a lot of very funny stuff I I highly recommend reading about it more because yeah I I in in the in the Deep uh bear market last time another piece of uh trivia is um Virgil Griffith who is uh arrested for uh helping North Korea learn how to run ethereum nodes um was uh famous for for going to the to I think it was Saudi Arabia maybe it was the UAE and getting the government to um make ethereum Halal in some weird way like like it was like a totally like it's it's uh like each staking was not viewed as uh a userist Endeavor and so I think ethereum is I learned about this yeah I was talking to somebody over dinner who's like an expert on um like the the rules around Sharia Halal Haram for uh for for proof of work and so apparently proof of work is halal meaning that it's it's allowed because you are because you are you are being paid for work so actually Fiat money apparently is Haram because Fiat money you just like make it out of thin air it's not made of anything valuable so nobody worked to create Fiat money and that means that technically it's Iran now no country is actually like that hardcore to actually ban Fiat money but technically like imams will say like yes technically this is Haram you shouldn't be using it but whatever you know we got to live in the world um and so in there there are countries actually where they ban Short Selling because Short Selling is Haram but so they find some other way to like do short selling but vanilla Short Selling is is not okay because of the interest that you're paying to the borrower or that you're paying to the lender um but so there's a there's a there's a huge project in the Middle East that I'd never heard of until I came out here called Islamic coin and Islamic coin they raised something like 400 million dollars and the whole idea behind Islamic coin is that it is a Sharia compliant ethereum Fork and it's even no no I think I think I thought it but it is it is running as a tender Man chain it's closer to ethmos or oh you know about this yeah okay okay yeah yeah yeah okay it's very famous very very famous fundraise uh partially because I think that uh the one coin woman is somehow hidden in this yes apparently it's like all Russians who are who are running it and the whole idea the way it was explained to me is that uh how so like how do you make a blockchain Sharia compliant like what does that even mean and she's like well well you know the thing is like you don't know what people are doing on the blockchain so there's a committee of uh like there's a committee of sort of validators who are like uh you know basically like imams I guess and they approve every smart contract that gets deployed onto the chain to check whether to be a compliant and only Sharia compliant contracts can be deployed and then you can interact with those as you as you see fit that's I as far as I understand that's the core idea of Islamic coin so it it just goes to show that the world of blockchain is a very very big place and I had no idea how much money there was chasing the stuff but it's pretty massive so anyway that is totally relevant to Euler Finance but I guess the reason why it was connected was like Banning uh Banning flash loans which I guess because the reason why they came to me is that flash loans are only Sharia compliant if you don't have to pay fees so only do idx flash loans are Sharia compliant but the other ones are not because you put that on the website I'll see if I can get Antonio to put that on dydx it uh it makes sense though you know all this Innovation because it's um with like a huala networks you know where they do like the peer-to-peer payments that was really the world's first sharded blockchain and so you know it's out of that you have all this this Innovation um it is true although huala unfortunately in the US I would not say that around the TSA in play just as a a a a note for the those who are often harassed at airport checkouts security yeah yeah okay so let's let's bring this conversation to a close uh we've been through a lot it's been a really harrowing week what what do you guys think hey we're making jokes now come on I know I know look I mean things are okay now these are okay now prices are up usdc is back you know we're back in business but I I think the the the moment of introspection I think for the industry particularly is probably most around usdc uscc was probably you know for the industry on the whole the biggest kind of um you know uh uh reality check about how much crypto is intertwined with traditional finance and how dependent we are still on the banks and uh you know the the Bitcoin blockchain the very first Genesis block has inscribed into it Chancellor on brink of bailout for the uh Chancellor on the second brink of bailout for the banks it was literally when a bank was getting bailed out that Bitcoin was created and once again we have a bank getting bailed out but this Bank instead of being the the Genesis moment of crypto is actually showing the cracks in the thing that we've built um and so how do you guys reflect on you know the the uh lessons for crypto looking forward for how we get stronger from what happened over the last week well I definitely think this is one of the great reminders for people about like why crypto even should exist um so many sophisticated well-intentioned people over the weekend had no idea if their money was going to be there come Monday and that's mostly what Bitcoin and crypto assets were designed to present prevent which was this like uncertainty due to someone else having the control and not you as the user or the market participant and I think it's a really loud reminder the second thing that I think is Vindicated and reaffirmed coming out of this weekend is you know all of these Banks were being shut down because of opaqueness and uncertainty about their balance sheet and inability to trust management and all of these things and we were sort of joking earlier in the show when we said like oh but D5 fixes this but it does right a D5 protocol would have been able to present to Regulators the radical transparency of knowing exactly what the you know health of the market was or the withdrawal queue or whatever it is right and it really does prevent a lot of the same sort of issues that were at the heart of these bank failures and so I see this as just a nice reminder and wake-up call for everyone building in this space that we're headed in the right direction even you know if moment to moment you know it doesn't feel like that Tom any take yeah I mean there was also a lot of sort of handwringing over the weekend around um oh you know this is why we should have never you know used usdc and you know makers going down the wrong path and having so much UCC exposure everyone should use you know Rye or use liquidy um it's like you know there's a reason why people don't you know use these things there's a number of different you know protocol flaws scale flaws Etc but I'm hoping that some of that energy is funneled towards more I mean effort around building you know decentralized stable coins and more Diversified stable coins or maybe even a true proper you know euro dollar stable coin or something like that I think it's it's not I think very productive to uh sort of like flash loans sort of moralize around what you think people should do and instead ideally you direct that efforts into more research and more building and uh you know making the the making your vision a reality is that is that a new term recording flash loan moralizing yeah yeah wait wait wait wait wait wait it should just be flash moralizing because this used a flash loan and a flash mint because you know okay we should we should we should it's a flash thank you for clarifying that um yeah I think my take is like you know I've never had all these people who hate crypto call me over the weekend and be like man I really hate the banks I'm like man do I have a product for you uh but like it was like it was actually funny all these people who like the November 12th were just like texting me like haha [ __ ] you like you're this crypto sucks like AI is way better blah blah blah like people like that all I will say a lot of them ate some Humble Pie this weekend um uh which you know I'm not trying to have the shot in Freud I'm just trying to say like you know you can't you can't just like immediately dump on crypto and then like suddenly be like oh no like what could ever solve the problem of solving dos attacks against Bank withdrawals you know like so I don't know I find that funny but on the I think the long-term thing is like stuff like the Euler stuff I think is you know I think yeah to Tom's Point there's a lot more like Research into the types of mechanisms to build that we need to do and a lot of that boils down to like some new technologies that a lot of people on the edge in this industry are working on that you know haven't made it to to usage but like those things I think in the next two to three years once they're live and in production should really help mitigate a lot of these kind of issues over time um I I think things like the Euler mishap are unfortunate but they actually provide us a lot of really good lessons and we have a lot of new techno technological tools that people invested in and are getting to production scale that I think will be you know very useful for making sure that users can't do this to themselves and also that these Protocols are able to add in new complex features without kind of introducing a larger attack surface area yeah I think the the events of the last weekend you know crypto has this sometimes uh overused you know uh Trope of banking the unbanked and um much worse Chagrin we found ourselves we found ourselves unbanked over the weekend and it's a very it's a very strange feeling to have money but not actually be able to access the money not be able to do anything with the money and the idea that you know for us you know a pretty you know regulated Financial firm that our best option was to try to get the money into crypto as fast as we could um I think is telling of like where we're at right now with respect to the the evolution of of both uh you know the traditional Financial system and of cryptocurrencies the reality is right now the two systems need each other the two systems that are played with each other and this is also often how I think about when people ask me like hey do you think that D5 is going to be um you know you think the D5 is going to like eat everything in finance like personally I don't think so I think that the two are going to sit side by side with each other but a lot of what Defy is fundamentally uh good for right now today is that D5 is sort of like a floor it's a floor of financial connectivity and usability that's always there it's always there everywhere in the world 24 7. and if your local banking system or your local Financial system which has a lot of things that defy can't do right it has uh credit it has you know it knows who you are it has you know all this sort of uh this Rich history that doesn't necessarily translate easily into a blockchain setting um but there are times when like the normal Financial system is like way up here and D5 is like here it's like the solid thing that's accessible always everywhere at all times and sometimes your financial system is gonna just [ __ ] you know drive into the ground and be totally unusable and when that's there you can always default back to D5 it's like this sort of uh it's this default that's always undergirding you as competition but also as a fallback and uh I think that that's true in a lot of places around the world where you see a lot of defy adoption today it's because D5 is here and when D5 is here and you've got a terrible Financial system D5 is actually better than what you've got right or if you've got if you're even if you're in the first world and you've got a failing Financial system yeah D5 is now better than what you got and as D5 gets better and better that floor is just gonna rise it's just gonna rise and rise and Rise every single year that we start building more and more stuff but in the interim Defy is better as the sum of Parts it's some it's better with centralized stable coins with real world assets with you know all these off-chain uh you know identity Primitives that are being built um it's going to get richer it's going to get more robust over time but we're not there yet you know and I think things like oil or Finance show us that there's going to be failures along the way and there's going to be you know learning moments but ultimately it's um I think Vindication not that we not that we won not that okay hey this shows that this guy is better than that guy but it shows that all this stuff is important all this stuff is really important like traffic needs to get better Define needs to get better but both parts of this equation um are important to what we should have as a human civilization going forward uh and if that's if if it's that clear within America that it's certainly true for the entire world so all right I guess I'll leave things there the real question is is the Sharia floor different than the non-charia floor and I leave that for for us to discover Sharia Flores real floor is that you leave your shoes at the door you don't wear your shoes inside that's that's the Sharia floor so uh anyway we'll go ahead and wrap it up there thank you everybody I I know it's been a crazy week I hope we helped you understand a little better what was going on until next time see you everybody [Music]
