michael morrow chief executive officer at genesis welcome michael hi laura good to be here let's start with the big news this week tesla bought 1.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin and also added bitcoin as a form of payment you started genesis as the first digital asset trading desk all the way back in 2013 which was quite a different era in bitcoin and the industry back then looked quite different and so i just wondered given your experience in the trenches of this industry for so long what would you say is the significance of tesla one of the biggest companies in the world putting some of its reserves into bitcoin so you're right um we started the first otc desk in bitcoin back in 2013. so call it you know eight years ago now um and you know if you were to say hey you know tesla or any company like that would be putting bitcoin onto their corporate balance sheet um back then i don't think i would have believed you right you you think about trading firms you think about asset managers and hedge funds um corporates you know that though that wasn't sort of a target audience certainly at the time um and you know but like we and and i'm excited to kind of talk about this because the the tesla thing is is a result right it's it's a build up and an evolution of the asset class um as well as kind of the market infrastructure which led to tesla's investment in in on bitcoin that got announced this week and so it's certainly come a tremendous you know uh evolution and progress within the ecosystem and and the exciting thing about it is yes it's great you know elon musk and tesla and a billion and a half big number this is just the beginning right and you know i love to kind of chat about all of that today yeah so your company actually has a new offering that relates directly to this news but before we do that why don't we just give the audience an overview of what products and services jennis has been offering over this time so um as i mentioned we started our bitcoin trading desk in 2013 really kind of catering towards high net worth individuals and whatever sort of adventurous institutional accounts wanted to buy bitcoin back in 2013 um and and this is when the price of bitcoin was around 80 and you know for for us you know we said hey there's no block trading in bitcoin really kind of happening and the only real exchanges that had volume were mount gox and bitstamp right that was pretty much the only two that were around at the time and we said okay if if bitcoin is to be an institutional asset class um we were a broker dealer so we had sort of the regulatory oversight from scc and finra let's be the broker dealer in bitcoin let's be the trusted regulated counterparty and try to get as many of kind of the the hedge funds and institutions and high net worth guys kind of get involved right so and you know we started it knowing that like hey maybe bitcoin goes to zero and i know we still talk about that today as a possibility um even though every day that you know bitcoin doesn't go to zero it's it becomes less likely that it does but back then that was a real thing right the possibility of an 80 bitcoin going to zero was far greater than what it is today and and frankly you know mount gox happened right in less than a year after we traded uh launched the desk and so and we're like oh maybe this is it maybe this is kind of the bitcoin zero moment um after kind of the big hack and and you know but like over time trading was really what we focus on we said hey let's try to build some holders let's kind of transition bitcoin from the early early guys right into the real early guys um and saying okay let's kind of help facilitate that transaction um but otc trading was all we did right in in from 2013 to 2018 really and and why because the market wasn't ready for anything else for us to try to build kind of the traditional institutional market infrastructure in bitcoin in 2014 16 and anything else other than block trading would have been premature 2017 changed the game the last kind of the bull market really yes it was retail focus and we saw a lot of kind of the icos and whatnot but it really kind of you know raised press awareness um it certainly raised attention of gps at hedge funds and who really kind of took notice of kind of crypto as an asset class really for the first time and got involved personally and once they got involved personally in kind of 2017 it opened up the possibility that maybe they'll put it in their fund right and the institutional kind of the pie of institutions willing to get involved really kind of increased at that point in time then we launched our lending business in 2018. that was really a function because hey now there are more institutions getting involved maybe people would want to hedge maybe people would want to start shorting and we've really kind of been of the view that a two-way price discovery is perfectly normal natural and healthy for the the ecosystem to ultimately survive and evolve into an institutional asset class yet there wasn't a way to do it right we had bitmex for a long time as kind of the derivative platform for hedging and shorting um cme introduced the bitcoin futures product at the end of 2017 but in early 2018 there was no way to do in the spot market and so we said okay let's create this borrowing lending market around crypto we get you know stock loans and and and borrowing stock exists in other markets let's bring this to crypto so we launched our lending business in 2018. and then we bolted on custody um in may of last year we acquired a digital asset custodian called vault based in the uk and then we also launched a derivatives trading desk so we we got involved in facilitating transactions of options uh in crypto also in may of last year so what we are today so we are a crypto prime broker we are we facilitate spot and derivative transactions both buying and selling we offer the ability to borrow and lend crypto and us dollars backed by crypto collateral we also custody assets for third parties we have clients um taking advantage of the ability to buy on genesis lend some of their assets through the platform or have just genesis custody as a one-stop shop prime broker platform geared entirely towards institutions and so your latest offering is genesis treasury how did you come to launch that and what does that service offer so you know for for for a long time i think when we thought about possible buyers possible people who might be interested in the asset class as i mentioned corporates were not really on a road map um and and really you know i think michael's you know michael saylor and microstrategy kind of like changed the game um as it relates to possibilities of what bitcoin might be able to do and and really when he you know and his firm kind of took their their firm position in bitcoin and and obviously kind of doing it at the scale and magnitude that that they decided to kind of jump you know i said jump in with both feet i feel like if he had more feet than that he'd jump a little more right like you know and and and really doing it i think i think it really kind of said though well wait a minute you know maybe we're we've been missing out on a potential market segment here maybe we've been hey you know too narrow in thinking about who could do this who could own this um and so we said okay let's start targeting this let's let's say hey if you're a corporate ceo cfo or treasurer um now there's this idea around bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset is a thing it is happening and it should be on your radar because if you don't other people will and and to date the market has given you credit the stock market has rewarded you for having bitcoin on your balance sheet or having some sort of bitcoin or blockchain play uh as part of your products and products and services and said okay let us be the one to educate you let us be the one to tell you how all of this works the trading and the custody aspect yes of course but these are corporates these are larger companies with compliance departments with finance and accounting and legal let us hold your hand let us explain to you everything you need to know and really kind of pass on all of the knowledge that we've gained in our eight years of doing this to help you allocate some percentage of your corporate charger into bitcoin i think that's what really what this offering kind of this this effort is really all about all right so we're going to talk a little bit more about corporate interest in bitcoin but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto

the story that you told is i actually thought you were going to say that you started getting more queries but it was more like proactive from your end um but then would you say that with all this news that you know this interest has picked up and if so what has that looked like inside of genesis i think the the the the beauty of of of bitcoin really and i'm reminded of this all the time um is that like you know we're a new york based company um with a lot of kind of and and primarily our trading clients on the spot side are sort of us-based so we tend to really have this like us based lens when we kind of look through various market opportunities what's been fascinating about this effort is as we were thinking about launching our kind of our marketing effort around treasuries to your point we were getting simultaneous inbound requests and the inbound requests from corporates were international we were getting interest in saying okay yes i get what michael you know michael sayle or micro strategy have done but i can do this if i'm sitting in latin america i can do this if i'm sitting in southeast asia right the corporate equivalence of when says casaras or something absolutely because there's kind of the patient zero right in the corporate world and kind of the michael sayler's and said i subscribe i believe that makes sense to me um and yes i can sit you know somewhere around the world and do this and so what we realized was kind of the opportunity is really global and it's not really like industry specific right any level of company public or private have the ability to do it and so we've really been hard at work look bitcoin you know hit you know it's all-time high this morning um yet again and and there was lots of news around you know b and y melon and kind of their the crypto custody product and all of it at the same time you know so we're busy servicing a lot of trades but we're really all so busy answering these questions from these corporations um how do we do this what do we need to learn um help me educate my board right and so it really the transaction is the last piece of it it's really kind of the education and kind of getting them comfortable with the entire process that we're really really busy doing and you spoke at microstrategy's bitcoin for corporations event last week would you say that that kind of kicked off a new wave of interest or did you see that based on even like news from square and mass mutual and rougher and the others um like would have been kind of the catalyst that you've noticed it's interesting so um the the inbound requests um and and kind of the corporations we've been working with preceded the mic the the microstrategy event um however at the same time the bitcoin for corporation event really kind of allowed people to appreciate is that is is kind of the you know bitcoin as collateral narrative um and and what i mean by that is you know we launched our lending business you know three years ago um and you know a big portion of our current lending business is folks that are posting their bitcoin that they've purchased as collateral and borrowing us dollars against it and the idea that bitcoin is good collateral is new certainly as treasurers and cfos are getting up to speed on bitcoin in the asset class i think a part of them are like okay great let's say i lock up whatever 5 10 20 of my corporate treasury reserves in bitcoin let's say i do it what if i have us dollar expenditures what if i have to tap into my treasury to meet some expense or to do something else um related to corporate development um do i have to sell my bitcoin right and and obviously selling the bitcoin to get it us dollars has has tax consequences um up or down and and i think people are like wait a minute i can get access to us dollars without selling my bitcoin um is is a newer concept and i think so people now are like so i'm not locked into bitcoin and i don't have to actually sell it to get liquidity um is part of the kind of the education process again as people really learn how far this industry has come this was not a thing 2015 2016 this ability to kind of borrow and lend against bitcoin as collateral is really sort of a manifestation of just the last couple of years of development that's happened in the space um and that's what i tried to highlight you know in my session um with at the microstrategy event was hey you can borrow against this and arguably bitcoin is the best collateral in the world um for anything being that it trades 24 hours a day seven days a week and it trades billions and billions of dollars every day and what other asset can you get liquidity on a 3 a.m on a sunday morning right you can't um except except in bitcoin i so i totally understand everything you're saying i can imagine there would be this demand i just wonder how the conversations would be different if it were kind of like um you know right after what looked like to be some kind of peak um because you know we've all seen bitcoin tends to trade of course in this upward trend but there have been times when it's probably been trading below um what its value probably is and then above also you know uh what what its value probably is and so what do you imagine a conversation would be like with a corporation at that time um would it simply be that you know the the ratio of any loans they might take out has to be within a certain range or that you know what they put in a bitcoin should not be money that they would want to touch for x number of time you know time period or or whatever i think all of the kind of the volatility market risk related to kind of putting bitcoin in their balance sheet is also part of the education process right um you know microstrategy went kind of like full bore 100 of their corporate treasury and took out debt on top to go buy more bitcoin right um that's on one hand however their timing is so good that this is you know probably probably not going to be an issue for them but anyway that's probably right but at the time you know that's a significant risk as a publicly traded company to be able to do right and then on the other hand you had square that i think put one percent right of kind of their corporate treasury into bitcoin so and there you go you have one percent to 100 percent there is now a full spectrum of possibilities and i think some within that band a company is able to figure out what level of participation in bitcoin is comfortable for their risk appetite right that's uh and to kind of be able to deal with the volatility and two as it relates to the loan to value question as as related to the loans yes your loan to value absolutely matters which is why for us um you know we are certainly lending at you know um over collateralized to genesis so folks are posting more in bitcoin as collateral than they are getting in in dollars in the loan and there's you know obviously margin calls should the price of bitcoin fall meaning the price of the collateral falls within a certain band and they'll be posting additional collateral to genesis at the same time ltv also affects the interest rate right um the the more they are putting as bitcoin in collateral um the the less risky alone it is certainly to the genesis um and so we were able to offer a lower interest rate for the client to be able to to do with their us dollars so ultimately you know there is an ltv conversation to be had and and there are certainly benefits to posting more bitcoins um and kind of be able to enjoy that us dollar at a lower rate but frankly what else are you doing with your bitcoins right it's it's sitting in cold storage in in some facility um and so this is a way for them to be able to be put some of that bitcoin to work and another issue that publicly traded companies holding bitcoin will have to deal with and so this is from my understanding so please correct me if i'm wrong about any of this but for with gap accounting rules um you know the value of the bitcoins by the end of the quarter will be determined by the lowest value at which they were traded in the quarter and so obviously that seems you know like a negative aspect for those corporations but is there any other way around it or is there any situation in which that could be a positive or do you think that potentially the rules around this might change or yeah i think you're referring to kind of the lore of cost or market um as kind of the accounting methodology within gaap to account for bitcoin as an intangible on your balance sheet and and frankly you have to do it this way as a corporation because investing in bitcoin is not their core business right um if it was their core business then the accountant treatment would be different um but for this you know they have other business lines in fintech or tech or it related businesses and certainly gap accounting kind of gets companies to react that way it's good in a way because um you know most of these companies are not playing this for the you know the short-term gain right the the you book the asset on on on your books and certainly if it trades down gap accounting forces you to kind of recognize the unrealized loss um and kind of book it that way but if price appreciates the the highest you can book it at is the price you paid for the asset and you can't really realize the benefit of it until you are either selling it in in and kind of realizing the ultimate gain accounting itself i don't think actually drives the reason for an investment decision and it certainly shouldn't be the reason why you do anything is kind of either favorable or unfavorable accounting treatment ultimately these companies have conviction these companies are willing to put um you know especially these publicly traded companies are putting shareholder valid money into working bitcoin have to have that certain level of conviction so yes um you know the accounting is kind of the temporary what does it look like on your balance sheet but the ultimate reason to do it is much greater than that is kind of the idea around hey we really kind of believe in bitcoin and this is a long-term hold play and so i don't really kind of need to mark to market my intangibles um all the time to kind of appreciate show what you know how smart an investment it was that we made yeah that makes sense yeah for um any shareholder who would freak out about that then they probably don't understand the value proposition of bitcoin so all right well so i wondered you know from your institutional niche within bitcoin what do you expect to happen over the next year so i mean i i said earlier right at the beginning about um you know tesla's investment kind of just being just the beginning um and and it's funny throughout 2020 throughout last year we talked about um the the macro investors kind of the legendary jump you know paul titor jones and the and the stanley druckenmillers kind of coming out and saying hey i i'm long bitcoin or i'm a believer in bitcoin gave cover right to other macro guys to start investing in bitcoin it was no longer strange um and i really do think kind of the elon musk and jack dorsey coming out and saying but put bitcoin in the balance gives corporates cover um to do just the same there and and frankly it's it's funny now the media narrative is why aren't you putting bitcoin on your balance sheet cfo you know it's sweet it's it's turned around so much so that like every interview right now that's happening that question gets asked and so i fully expect um companies to continue to to do this um and as i said earlier the the phenomenon is global that this isn't just a u.s only thing i think we'll continue to see um the the corporates kind of putting bitcoin onto their treasury especially in countries um where their fiat value is kind of depreciating much much faster than just kind of holding the us dollar yeah yeah i expect the same i actually honestly saw a few mainstream stories going the other direction and i was like i don't think you're talking to the right people because they don't know what's going on a lot of companies we're working with um and this is this is a movement this is happening um and like i said i think it's one of these you know you either kind of run with it and adapt uh or get left behind yeah i agree all right well this has been so fun thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you so much for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around
