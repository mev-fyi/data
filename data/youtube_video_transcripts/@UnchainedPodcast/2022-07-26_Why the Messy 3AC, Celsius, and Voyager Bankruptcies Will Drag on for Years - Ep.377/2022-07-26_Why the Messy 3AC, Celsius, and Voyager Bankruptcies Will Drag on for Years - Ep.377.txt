hi all just a quick note before we begin this episode is an interview with a bankruptcy expert adam levitan and an insolvency expert wassey lawyer it's an incredible conversation on how the bankruptcies of three arrows capital celsius and voyager will go down just wanted to note that we recorded before friday afternoon which is when ftx offered to allow voyager customers who opt into the program access to some of their funds early as long as they create ftx accounts so in case you're wondering why we don't discuss this proposal that's why however in discussing it posho wassie lawyer said it was an incredibly shrewd move and believes that it's a signal that sam bankman freed thinks the crypto markets have bottomed otherwise enjoy this incredibly illuminating discussion of how the

of celsius voyager and three arrows capital here to discuss our wassey lawyer a hentai anime penguin in a suit i mean a lawyer specializing in restructuring and insolvency and adam levitan georgetown law professor and principal at gordian crypto advisors welcome wassie lawyer and adam hello it's good to be here today hi everyone it's good to be here today as not darth vader we're just gonna dive right into what appears to be the meatiest issue and that is something called custodial funds why don't you just define what that is for the listeners and why this is such a big issue and i think particularly in celsius and the voyager cases yeah sure i think the point about custody funds has been it's been thrown around a lot recently because well when you've just deposited an assets into a company or bank that has failed i think what you want is you want to cast the relationship because when you when you when something's in custody the title to that asset doesn't actually pass over to the to the companies you have deposited with so what what that means is that when the company goes to insolvency those assets are segregated and it doesn't go into the general pool to pay back all other insecure creditors so you get well these those that have assets in custody you would be able to get those assets back so i think that the starting point here is a question of what is what is this stuff right you so you have customers who placed funds with say celsius or voyager and the question is whose property are those funds do they remain property of the customer or are they property of celsius or voyager and if they are property of celsius or voyager then the customer has a claim in the bankruptcy the crest the customer is just a creditor and is going to get treated differently in the bankruptcy than if it's the customer's property because if it is actually the customer's property it will actually ultimately get returned to the customer how fast that's you know there may be a little bit of a delay but the customer will get the property back if it's the customer's property and this is going to be one of the big questions in both celsius and voyagers bankruptcy and it may be different answers in each bankruptcy and it may there may be different answers for different groups or types of relationships so for celsius for example it has the earn product and the answer there may be different than with celsius's custody wallet so just to be clear the urn product is like an interest earning product exactly and with earned celsius's terms and conditions is quite clear that you're making if you're using earn you're making a loan to celsius there's on for earn i really don't think there's a lot of ambiguity that it's not customer property for the other for the custody wallet that's where i think it's much trickier oh and so the quest the custody wallet is essentially like celsius just storing your assets and then it gets pulled and then it's harder to make a claim that you have specific funds in there exactly um laura i think the equivalent is depositing assets into a safety deposit box and deposit it into a bank i think that's probably a good parallel i think that's i think that's right the the when you think of a safe deposit box that's what we we call a bailment it's like when you uh check your coat with a with a coat check valet or you give your car to the parking valet it's not the parking valley's car it's still your car the parking valley you know is supposed to park it and do nothing else with it not to not take it for a joy ride the problem is if the parking valley has taken it for a joy ride and the car gets totaled at that point you're a creditor of the parking valet and there may be a bit of an element of that going on in celsius because celsius seems to have co-mingled the custody funds with uh with other funds and there's you know a billion and a half hole or so in celsius's balance sheet wow so their terms were saying that the customer would have this custodial relationship if they use that earned product but on the back end because no no oh wow no no i don't i don't think that's exactly right laura i think they were quite explicit with the earned product that that it would look a lot more like a loan the the issue is with the custody product that is where all the questions are coming up right now because i think uh recently came out in one of these articles uh what was actually being said in the uh bankruptcy court and it was very clear that what with with the earned products the product or you're generating a yield on it you you're sort of the term used wasn't exactly right giving up legal rights to it but you're giving up proprietary rights to it you no longer own it you've lent it to celsius oh oh so those are the funds that are co-mingled but i think all of them are coming gold is the problem so we have two two categories of funds what was it supposed to be that when you loaned it that those would be marked as yours or that those would be pulled together and and then you kind of you know lose that claim of saying like these are are definitely mine we have these two different groups are two different products we have earn in custody with earn by itself pretty clear that it is a loan being made to celsius with the custody it's the the terms and conditions are a little less clear but there's a decent case that it's supposed to be called the main customer property i just need you to finish out that thought when you do make a loan to celsius does that mean then that you that you lose that custody relationship yes then you then you're just a creditor you're taking counterparty risk on celsius when that happens when it's custody you're not meant to take counterparty risk the equivalent is if you went to a bank and you put a million dollars in a bank and then you put a million dollars into the bank safety deposit box if the bank goes under you are a unsecured creditor for the amount of the million dollars you deposited into an account whereas you can claim back what's in the safety deposit box i.e the four million dollars because that property was always yours oh i see okay the problem is that celsius seems to have commingled the funds that were uh deposited in the earn capacity with the funds that were deposited in the custody capacity and it's as if the stuff that's in the safety deposit box got mixed together with the regular bank deposits exactly so essentially they they weren't following what the terms of their agreements were is that right i'm not sure that they were actually violating the terms of their agreements they i believe that celsius did indicate that it was going that that it might that it was that funds might be co-mingled i the problem is yeah co-mingling itself wouldn't be a an issue if you don't have a shortfall of funds it's when there isn't enough to pay everyone back how do you allocate the losses do you allocate them on maybe a pro-rated basis among the custody and the earned customers or do you allocate them all to earn and say look the custody stuff we never actually touched so what's your theory both of you about how they'll handle this i think i think the practical implication here right is if you look at this celsius sort of assets and liabilities that they put up on their sort of alex czynski's chapter 11 declaration they've allocated 180 million in custody assets 180 million in custody liabilities so if it turns out and that's why they asked the judge this question if it turns out that those custody assets liabilities are meant to be segregated anyone who put crypto their money whatever assets into custody would be very happy about it because you'll be able to get everything back you get one for one if it is not treated as a custody relationship and the guys who put assets into custody product turned out to be unsecured creditors then they would share in the pool with all of the other general unsecured creditors so that's how it worked practically yeah it wasn't clear it wasn't real clear to me from the machinski declaration how strong of a position celsius was actually taking on on this issue certainly the way they kind of very high level balance sheet breakdown that was presented in the declaration um lines up with the way that wassie lawyer you know characterizes it but i'm not sure if that was like a really a very deliberate thing or not um the uh celsius celsius's bankruptcy filing does not seem like it was you know put together super carefully it would seem like it was kind of a thing that kirkland and ellis had to do in a bit of a rush and i i'd be careful about reading too much into you know any particular words that get they that get used yeah absolutely one for later but absolutely there's a clear difference between how the celsius filing looks and what the voyager filing looks there's a really interesting divide by kind of also under the surface between the um custody and the urn customers the custody customers are all domestic american accounts so if you are open if you were in the uk or australia or finland and you wanted to deal with celsius you were dealing with celsius only as an earned customer and i don't think that's something that's likely to shape the legal treatment but it's a factor that's lurking in the background where you know maybe there's a temptation to treat domestic customers better um i don't think that's gonna play out but that that there's at least a possibility there well i mean it sounds like the custody customers already generally based on the definition come in with a stronger position right absolutely it's not that they necessarily win but they have a i think they have a decent argument whereas the earned customers i don't see any way that they're going to end up being anything other than just general unsecured creditors and so how does this all apply to voyager because we've only really been talking about it in relation to celsius but i imagine voyager has a kind of similar situation yeah um i think that the with voyager i think it probably it's going it's going to apply in a similar way and in voyager all their crypto holdings were co-mingled voyager was less clear in its terms of use though than celsius so if you were depositing funds with voyager they didn't have kind of two separate products instead the the voyager uses language that kind of indicates well it's your it's still your crypto except the facts are that they get to use it pretty much like celsius and that's that that's the trickier situation if you instead of having you know having two clear categories voyagers sort of sitting in the middle i suspect what the treatment in voyager is going to be that it gets treated like as if it's um property of voyager and that's the position that voyager has been taking is that this is this is the this is their property not customer property but even if it ends up being treated as customer property and this is a really key point it's only customer property to the extent that voyager has the assets to the extent there's a shortfall those customers are unsecured creditors for the shortfall yeah absolutely yeah and can we just discuss why it is that retail customers are lower uh in the pecking order than institutional investors they're not i guess no they're absolutely not um it all depends on the terms of the the arrangement and to the extent that anyone else lent unsecured to if an institutional investor led unsecured the crypt to celsius or voyager or 3ac for the matter they'll be exactly the same as the retail investors if they had security then they would have re security or collateral then they would have they would have recalls the security of collateral so all unsecured creditors have the same priority they all stand alike so i don't think any of that i don't think there is any secure i'm not sure that they're well need it's not clear that there is any secured credit voyager doesn't seem to indicate any secured credit and celsius i think when the by the time they filed they paid down all the that they paid off all the defy the defy loans that may or may not actually be secured yes um they paid on all their d5 loans prior to the filing because the d5 loans were all over collateralized so it made sense for them to have more assets in their company's balance sheet and you know not to have it but your question about sort of insolvency priority unsecured creditors tend to be dead last like they are they last and the way you get priority over that is well there are preferential creditors created by statute i'm not sure what it is in the us but normally it's you know taxes you know taxes old um employees you're forgetting the most important one the the you got to pay the gravediggers it's the administrative cost of the bankruptcy of course the cause of bankruptcy is come up first oh yes kirkland atlas get paid first um they already made 3 million oh that's just scratching the surface i mean they the the the administrative costs of a bankruptcy can get it will it will be high it will be absolutely yeah yeah no i mean uh like in the short amount of time that this has been going they already made 3 million i saw an article like i would expect the total fees here for professionals to be over 100 million laura that's why i've been i've been in the room with discussions like before people fall for chapter 11 and uh normally add credit aside and the that is to the extent it's possible for them they would sometimes just track it in chapter 11 because once you try them in chapter 11 all the creditors go okay all right fine let's not do that please that's terrible because there's gonna be so much value leakage to professional fees ahead of me and i don't get to do anything for months okay yeah yeah i mean you know i just like seeing that that bill that kirkland and ellis sent in for three million and then thinking about the various customers who you know they have like a hundred thousand in there or seventy thousand or whatever and i was just like oh this is obviously not good for them but anyway i did also when i tweeted about questions people had for you someone who was a celsius customer asked how did it work if your bitcoin loan was liquidated while the company was frozen and it was not possible to send in funds to protect it or close it off can that be reversed and funds retrieved during the bankruptcy process let's see if i have the scenario right in my head here so prior to bankruptcy someone had borrowed money from celsius right no it sounds like they were in london they wanted to they wanted to pay out they wanted to pay it off so it sounds like this is a borrower from celsius has a third group of folks who borrowed money from celsius and posted collateral for their loans and that crypto and the collateral they posted i think may have also been co-mingled with all the other crypto holdings so it sounds like they couldn't pay it off and some this is someone who wanted to make a payment and celsius wouldn't accept the payment yeah because it was frozen yeah i think that they probably just have a uh an unsecured claim against celsius for breach of contract agreed and so then they i don't think they get their crypto back i think that they they have a dollar claim and how much that will get paid is anyone's guess so think of if you're claim if you have a claim and it's allowed that's like having an entry ticket it doesn't mean that you're gonna necessarily see any value it just makes you eligible for a distribution in the bankruptcy laura maybe it would help if we just did like a minute on kind of an overview of chapter 11 of the process would that be so i'm going to try and do this in like one minute and not talk too long here's kind of the the very the very nutshell overview of the us bankruptcy process when a debtor files for bankruptcy first thing that happens is something called the automatic stay this is an basically like an injunction against any attempt to collect from the debtor outside of the bankruptcy process at the same time there is a new legal entity that's created it's called the bankruptcy estate and the bankruptcy estate has title to all of the debtors assets no matter where they're located so what we're doing is we're bringing all the assets and all the claims against those assets together into single forum and hopefully having a more orderly process the bankruptcy estate in chapter 11 is managed by an entity called the debtor in possession or dip it's not a pejorative and that just means it's the pre-bankruptcy management running the show but they're wearing a different hat the hat that they're wearing now makes them fiduciaries for creditors and shareholders so creditors will file claims with a claims agent for the court stretto is the claims agent for voyager and celsius and if you don't file a claim celsius or voyager probably going to just schedule it according to their books and records and claims are deemed approved unless someone objects but celsius and voyager very well may object to certain claims so they're going to spend some time looking at all the claims and if celsius or voyager want to do anything outside of the ordinary course of business they need court approval so they if they don't normally you know scratch the scratch their head they need to go to the court and make a motion for permission to scratch their head for the 100 first 120 days the debtor has the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganization or liquidation that 120 day period though can be extended to 18 months so and it often is so there's going to be a window where only the debtor has the choice of kind of how to move going forward but there's going to be a very important kind of counterweight to the debtor there's going to be set up in the next couple weeks a thing called the official committee official creditors committee that's a body of a representative body of predators that's selected by a department of justice official called the united states trustee and the members of the official creditors committee are fiduciaries for the creditors they represent they will hire their own attorneys and financial advisors and if you kind of think of how the courtroom's going to be set up instead of being one table for the prosecutors and one for the defendants you'll have one table where there's going to be the debtor's council and typically one table where the committee counts uh the official committee's council will sit that kind of gives you a sense of the the relative weight of the parties now here's the thing that's often not understood well about bankruptcy it's the role of the judge because there's a bankruptcy judge and the bankruptcy judge is like a referee not a quarterback the judge decides on matters put before him and that means you need to make a motion for the judge to do something you're asking the judge to approve or disapprove of something the judge is not making the plan the judge is not deciding generally oh this is what's fair and what's not it's that there are very specific issues put before the judge and if there is an emotion before the judge the judge isn't going to act on anything the judge has hundreds of other cases going on other big other bankrupt large business bankruptcies lots of consumer bankruptcies so this is kind of a situation where it's hey tell me what i need to decide right now and i'll figure it out and if it's not an issue that's immediately before me well i'm dealing with other problems and this is a process that's going to be slow it's going to be expensive because the debtors attorneys and financial advisors their fees come out of the top the official committee's attorneys and and financial advisors all of their fees come out off the top and these administrative expenses is paying the grave digger that's going to probably in a case like this easily turn into 100 million maybe two would be my guess in that range and that's money that's not available for customers uh and that's just kind of the cost of the process well yeah i and how long do you expect both the celsius and voyager bankruptcies to take so it's important to note that celsius has not found a plan of reorganization yet but voyager has so voyager has provided a lot more sort of details around what they intend to do maybe i can let adam talk about how these plans work since he's done such a great job voyager didn't voyager didn't exactly file a plan of reorganization now so they did they did kind of a a funny move yeah they they when they filed they they included as a filing of the court this half-baked plan except the actual way the chapter 11 process works is you can't you have to what you're going to have to do is ultimately solicit creditors votes on a plan the creditors are going to have a vote you cannot solicit their votes until the court has approved a disclosure statement about the plan and a disclosure statement's gonna probably in a case like this be a hundred hundred fifty page document that's gonna do everything from laying out the history of how the debtor got here to summarizing what the plan does how it treats every kind of claim what the debtor's business model is going forward and it's supposed to give creditors adequate information to be able to vote on well on a plan do they like it or not just filing a plan doesn't let you do anything you need to get a disclosure statement approved otherwise the plan is just a piece of paper that sits out there so i think what kirkland and ellis did and this is something k e does quite frequently ill file kind of just a a placeholder plan to give an indication of where they're thinking of going and to try and frame the conversation it in no way binds celsius to that being its ultimate plan celsius could change direction on on a dime and it doesn't bind anyone else it's just a conversation starter okay so when do you think we might get the formal plan i think that's going to be some time especially for celsius um voyager is simpler voyager just has a voyager's got the problem of figuring out the status of the customer funds once it does that i think you know the voyagers big issue is that you know it was making its loan book was ridiculously concentrated like 58 of its loan book was three euros capital which is just like the insanity of that is beyond description so if you were a bank in the united states you are limited to lending if it's fully collateralized 25 of your capital and surplus to a single borrower if you figure a bank's capital is eight percent we're talking therefore about no more than two percent of your assets to any one loan and like people go to jail when banks mess that up like that that's why paul manafort is in jail in part because he he was defrauding a bank to get to go beyond the loan limit and here we got 58 of their loan book which is pretty much all their assets going to to one borrower and 99 percent are you know over six counterparties like it's just nuts so if they yeah there's going to be a big question can they is there any model which they can reorganize on and i'm rather skeptical because like this is a business that's built on customer trust and who on earth would trust become a company that did such a bad job with risk management to ever do and to ever get this right in the future you know maybe their tech stack was decent i don't really know but if it was decent that's something that someone else can buy and uh pair it up with better risk management so the bottom line how long is this going to take with any of them it's a huge guess i think we're looking at uh for the these kinds of cases we're probably looking at something in the in the that's approaching two years and how long it actually takes for final distributions could go on longer and when you said that voyager had a simpler case than celsius is it because the fact that it wasn't the commingling and it really was just the fact that you know they had this one huge loan that defaulted i think so celsius celsius has um there are suggestions that there may have been more funny business going on with celsius voyager just seems to have been incompetent on risk management celsius seems to have also had that problem but if you look at the the kefi lawsuit and the some of the letters that are being submitted in the docket there there seems to be a sense of some people that mashinsky was doing something beyond just being being a bad risk manager yeah i completely agree there i think it looks like why voyage have gone over us exactly as adam has said they've just extended this massive massive law into trials capital and otherwise everything was sort of ticking along apart from their exceedingly crap risk management and based on sort of the indicative plan it looks like they just yeah their plan is look we're just going to move the default risk from on 3ac or at least you know we'll move all of that onto onto the account holders instead so the draft plan basically says look you're an account holder and we owe you money we're going to give you a bit of cash a little bit of crypto that we have left we're going to give you some voyager tokens and we're going to give you whatever we manage your share of whatever we manage to recover from triangles capital so when we recover anything with trier's capital it doesn't come into bankruptcy it doesn't come into this sort of reorganized company it goes to a third party and it distributes it to it it becomes distributed to you obviously that's being incredibly optimistic about what you can actually recover from tree arrows capital the chapter 11 plan for for voyager is going to be very closely linked to how the tree arrows liquidation plays out exactly what adam has said on celsius is exactly it there's a lot more sort of funny business going on when i read the filing they kind of went oh we only lost about 15 million dollars on luna we didn't we didn't get destroyed that badly we lost they lost only about 40 million on on the 3ac loan which is you know a large amount but small compared to what voyager has done but then you start looking at all the strange things they've been doing they lost 35k eve just lost it because someone they gave it to misplace the keys you've got a private landing platform unnamed we don't know who this is that defaulted and there is now a loss of like something about over 400 million which they are slowly trying to get recoveries on and one of my favorite quotes in the whole thing is there were certain asset managed asset deployment decisions that were made that in hindsight proved problematic so very vague about that and um yeah we don't really know what what tipped them over it just looks like a series of incredibly bad decisions yeah yeah definitely with the celsius one even when i was just writing questions for the show i had so many more questions because there were like so many more kind of red flags or question marks there but with the voyager it seemed a little bit more straightforward which is you know not to say that they didn't mess up hugely but i actually will i want to circle back to that question of how much people will be able to get or rather voyager will be able to get from 3ac but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible is your web3 experience hindered by inadequate crypto wallets and

back to my conversation with wassie lawyer and adam so wasseyler earlier when you were saying that a big part of what's gonna determine how much voyager customers get is you know what they can claw back from 3ac what is your sense there of how that's looking for people because we got a little bit of a taste you know a week ago on it'll be a week by the time this comes out on kind of what assets 3ac has it's going to be quite difficult to answer the question exactly what we do know is that from the documents that sort of come out that there is at least 2.8 billion dollars of claims against triarro's capital right now we do know that apparently some it came out some of the sources that the liquidators have secured 40 million dollars of funds 40 million dollars and 2.8 billion dollars pretty massive gap on top of that it does look like trials capital doesn't really have it it may be the case that they don't have that many liquid assets so i think we covered this briefly under the last show laura what sort of assets would they have they would have equity warrants token warrants tokens tokens that are going to be vested i mean they probably hold a trap ton of luna too the yacht don't forget the yacht 50 million dollar yacht but i don't think it's been delivered yet so a half built yeah yeah so there's a ton of nfts they've got and one thing that's going to be quite interesting is how uh these so when i read the recognition in filing in singapore maybe this is for the three arrows bit later order separately it's the question of what happens to defiance funds and what happens to the starry nights funds and what happens to this fund called wobbler so what happens is essentially it looks like 3ac have co-mingled all of your funds into under one single entity and it looks like defiant and starry night and wobbler were actually managed by persons other than three ac so it'd be interesting to see the liquidators how the liquid is rock up to these guys and say hand over everything your funds have been liquidated because you're part of a structure that has been so horribly mismanaged i feel quite bad for those guys actually but monsieur lawyer here you've been following 3ac more closely than i have when the liquidators say they've recovered 40 million does that mean that means that they have the you know it's either cash that they have control of or they have the private keys for whatever for the digital assets not 100 sure on that one but that's what this so that's what's come on the report so they've recovered quote unquote 40 million of assets so i i take it then that for all the other assets it no one no one knows at this point or at least the liquidators don't know who has the private keys i think it sounds like and and we have to read between the lines here right because this is all from the for what the liquidators have told the courts of you know the us and singapore when they're applying for recognition so what we do know is that it seems that sue and kyle have not been very cooperative and presumably these are the guys that are holding a ton of those keys but at some point you expect them to play ball but it does look like you know as of the date when the liquidators apply to the singapore chord and they weren't very cooperative and no one knows exactly where they are well apparently they're going to dubai this is like yeah where all the people who are fleeing something in crypto maybe they just paid off maybe they just paid off the yacht and they're just sailing the seven seas now yeah i think the yacht is still yet to be delivered and in europe maybe that's exactly where they're going because if you read the filings they screw 30 million dollars away to uh typing sean entry they're related to 10 million dollars to an unrecovered wallet and the cost of the yard is 50 million maybe the down payment was 20 hopefully at some point we will find out more on their whereabouts or if they end up in dubai we'll we'll just hear about it so i did also want to then circle back to this other question related to the one that the customer with the bitcoin loan at celsius had so as you guys mentioned in that case likely that customer will get dollars back and what's your sense of you know how likely it is that a lot of the crypto assets in any of these firms will be turned into dollars and what's your sense of whether or not the customers would prefer to have crypto assets versus dollars okay i think just to jump in here first i think there's a different process this is a question that's very relevant to both you know all three of celsius voyager 3ac but again to draw a distinction triac is in liquidation so it's going to be liquidated it's not going to exist as a company after the process is done whereas celsius and voyager fell for chapter 11 and what they want to do ideally is to continue as a business afterwards so it may be the case that in the plan of reorganization eventually goes through that you get a mixture of crypto you get you get distributions in kind which is in crypto or you get it in cash whatever the plan turns out to be this becomes a much bigger question for triarro's capital because if i've lent bitcoin into three errors capital maybe i want bitcoin back maybe i don't want a us dollar amount and there's a question of when i convert the bitcoin to us dollars if the liquidators do choose to do so so i've looked into this a fair bit but i know adam has been to say about it so i'm just going to throw the mic over there hope i know how this works at least in the us okay so in the us there are kind of two pieces we have to look at first is what is your claim and then second how can that claim get paid regarding what your claim is it doesn't matter what form you you extended value to the debtor it gets dollarized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing so for celsius you're looking at you know the value of the year the crypto that you were owed on july 13th and presumably you know we can get it down to the minute of the bankruptcy petition but it you know if it's bitcoin it's around in the 20 000 range voyager on july 5th actually turns out to be right around in the same range so if you had you know one bitcoin parked with with celsius you have a claim for 20 roughly 20 000 and it doesn't matter that bitcoin today might be at 23 000 your claim is for 20 000 so you don't get any of the market rise on the other hand the market falls your claim is still locked in at 20. the problem is if the market falls they just don't have the assets to pay you that 20. so this is this either way you get kind of rope it up here either way it works badly for you now that's the bad news on the what is your claim side the better news for you is on how your claim can be treated a chapter 11 plan can be a plan of reorganization or a plan of liquidation usually chapter 11 is thought of as being reorganization but businesses of any size that want to liquidate we'll use chapter 11 because it's more flexible than chapter 7 management stays in place in chapter 11 and chapter 7 it gets moved out a chapter 11 plan can pay you in any form it wants it's just as law it has to give you value that is at least as much as you would get in a hypothetical chapter seven liquidation but if the mark that uh you know you that value is as of the effective date of the plan so you just have to see what the market values they could pay you bitcoin they could pay you in coin the only question is you know do they have the votes for confirming the plan if you vote again and this is a majoritarian rule exercise so it doesn't matter if you vote against a plan if they get the requisite votes and a plan is approved it binds all creditors regardless of what they want and to the extent you're not paid under a plan you cannot there's no one you can try and collect from it afterwards your the deck gets discharged unless there's like a third party that you say is liable as a guarantor and hasn't gotten a release curiously there are some interesting releases in the voyager plan uh alameda um gets a is uh at least proposed to get a release so if there was some kind of a litigation claim against alameda that would be gone and creditors wouldn't be able to try and uh collect from sbf oh well i guess that's um maybe because i think they were an investor in voyager so is that just something they negotiated from i assume that this was cut i mean they have they're kind of wearing all the hats they have uh like they're the single largest equity investor with but it's like a nine and a half percent position they are the second largest loan counter party and then they also extended credit back the other way with 75 million which under the voyager plan seems to be classified separately and you know basically just canceled out okay and yeah because i thought there was something about the way that it was structured where it was meant to prioritize the customers but then it it like didn't they didn't implement it or something like that i you know i i don't know if the loan agreement looks like that that certainly consistent with how they the uh the voyager placeholder plan treats it that is that it putting in a separate class than other than customers and then saying that it gets no it gets paid nothing in the uh would be consistent with that kind of treatment but i don't know if there was if there was some contractual agreement before the bankruptcy about that so i believe there are customers writing in uh saying that they would prefer that their crypto assets not be dollarized do you think that any of the bankruptcy judges or or any of anyone really that involved in the bankruptcies will have a sympathetic error to that or do you feel that they'll just follow the you know what what the law says it's not the judge's call on this the judge doesn't decide with what the contents of the plan are the judge just says yay or nay about whether the plan is confirmable so there when ultimately there's gonna have to be a planned confirmation hearing it's like a little mini trial and the judge is gonna have to decide whether the plan meets a whole list of criteria and if it does then the judge doesn't have any discretion about confirming the plan even if the judge thinks the plan is a bad idea if it's like do you feel that they'll be sympathetic no that the decision is made by you know just simply voting against the plan the account holders the unsecured creditors can simply say this plan doesn't work we want a different plan but as long as there is plan exclusive the plan as long as the debtor has plan exclusivity it's the debtor's call what's in the plan so the debtor right now is determining what's on the menu and you can decide whether you can decide whether you want to order or not what's on the menu but it's a collective decision you're bound by the collective once plan exclusivity lapses then you know any creditor that wants can come in and propose a plan and how long is that period up to 18 months 180 and it's uh it's extendable up to 18 months though yeah so how likely is it that you think celsius or voyager will be sympathetic to that desire and make that part of their plan so laura i think it's incredibly incredibly difficult for anyone administrating a bankrupt estate to start dealing in all these different currencies so i think it would be quite difficult for them to figure out you know this whole returning bitcoin returning eve returning all of these various coins along with us dollars so it'll be difficult i'm not sure how i'm sure it'd be quite different because in the tree arrows case it has to be dollarized at some point with the chapter 11s i think it'd just be administratively difficult to deal with so many different crypto assets i think it goes that's a really important point the administrative difficulties but also if you're holding all these crypto assets you're holding assets that are quite volatile and yes they might go back to the moon or they might they might fall and if you think if you think that you're if you're putting your hat on as a fiduciary for creditors and shareholders that probably pushes for dollar rising and just making you know selling off all the crypto do a slow sell-off so you don't crash the market and push down your own prices but do a slow sell-off turn it all into dollars and pay out the dollars and that's certainly the easiest way to do it you can imagine there will be some unhappy customers with it but once if you've dollarized it before you propose a plan then there's really there's not much the customers can do to complain right there are there is no correct crypto left right i mean i just think what you said about being a fiduciary that's like seeing it from a non-crypto person's perspective because the reason that these people want to keep the crypto assets is because they don't care about the dollar value they care about the crypto so it's like one eighth is one eighth and that's more valuable than any amount of dollars so for them it would be like well i don't care what the dollar value is because you know i i just want the eath um but anyway i mean i understand what you're saying i would say that i would for a typical uh for a typical kind of uh hold on for dear life person i think that's true except these that's not the if you're putting your money in celsius or voyager it's because you're looking to get a dollar return right maybe you take it maybe you're willing to take the payment in kind in is you know they're a celsius um a token but ultimately you're looking to get a dollar return so this is a this is a different kind of investor than someone who's just buying bitcoin and hoping that the market's going to go up this is actually the type of investor that's a little more risk averse because they want the fixed dollar return rather than just pla watching the commodity price go up and down this is a much bigger issue with trials capital actually because of the investor profile there and how this thing is going to play out and um so i thought it was a fair bit and sort of shout out to god be good because he's been discussing this with me and it's come on some pretty amazing ideas and thoughts about how this would play out because what you have is now you've got investors that a lot of them i mean from all of these sources it shows them extending btc denominated loans and these are large large amounts of bitcoin and when three arrows went into liquidation bitcoin was trading at what between the 80 to 20k range closer to 18 probably and since then bitcoin has rebounded a bit and over the next two years plus plus whatever however long this liquidation takes bitcoin price could very well recover so according to and this is based on a very brief read i am not a bvi lawyer but based on a very brief read of how bvi insolvency works if you've got loans and other currencies you have to change it to us dollars when you found a proof of claim so you have to dollarize it and this is something that people will sort of be thinking about going i don't really want to have my bitcoin to normally loans you know essentially liquidated at 18k and then two years later bitcoin's like 100k maybe sue is right and the supercycle is a real thing so so so that that's an issue and sort of startup again gone be good here he sort of he sort of went well but if you looked at bitcoin all these crypto assets as a commodity then what do you what you're what you're suing for you could be suing for non-delivery of the commodity and that is a contractual claim it's not a liquidated claim so there isn't a number to it at the moment but then this still opens so this opens the door possibly to you getting maybe possibly bits of the upside if bitcoin recovers but at some point this unliquidated claim still has to be dollarized there needs to be a number ascribed to it and it's a question mark as to when that point of time is if you ask me probably requires a lot more thinking around contract law and individual circumstances etc listeners might be wondering why if if this is the british virgin islands you would dollarize to us dollars and it's because the british virgin islands have used the us dollar as their official currency since the 1950s um it's a weird weird situation but i think it's just about geographic proximity but based on my reading it doesn't look like bitcoin is defined as a currency or as money under the bgi legislation so the sort of commodities based interpretation could be could hold some weight here oh interesting well so we'll have to see how that plays out one other topic that i wanted to be sure that we talk about is there it might also be a possibility of clawbacks of pre-bankruptcy transfers oh yes so yeah what kinds of transfers would be classified that way and then how would we determine whether any of those should be clawed back there there are two categories that actually three categories that are worth talking about probably the most important from a customer perspective are what are called avoidable preferences and the the idea is that certain transfers made to creditors in than um the 90 days before bankruptcy can be unwound basically and if you're an unsecured creditor the transfer is unwindable there are some defenses um and the most the most important ones are there's a game minimus amount that you know it's just not worth litigating over and then there is an ordinary course of business defense so if the transfer was in the ordinary course of business of both the debtor so you know if you took money if you withdrew money from celsius let's say that's a that's a payment to a creditor because you you celsius owed you money you withdrew you withdrew your funds in the 90 days before bankruptcy you have that might be in the ordinary course of celsius's business to pay withdrawals right that happens all the time with uh presumably with celsius but it also has to be in the ordinary course of the customer's business and that's where i think there's an interesting question right it's not weird to think that a customer might withdraw funds at some point but if the customer had been holding funds holding funds holding funds and never withdrew until this one moment i think it's kind of hard to say that withdrawing funds is is actually in the ordinary course of the customer's business so i think that's an issue the court will have to that court the court will have to figure out if uh celsius or voyager pursue these prefer avoidable preference actions and i think they're likely to do so because there's a substantial pool of money that could be clawed back that way once that money is clawed back if it is then the folks whose money got clawed back they have unsecured claims in the bankruptcy so you thought you got out before the bankruptcy and if you didn't get out before in the 91 days before the bankruptcy or more you might get dragged back into the bankruptcy that's the most important group there are two other things that can be clawed back another thing what are called fraudulent transfers not it doesn't have to be actual fraud this is just you know transfers made to hinder delay or defraud creditors i don't think that really exists with voyager but maybe with celsius especially with trans transactions with insiders maybe there's something there and then um the other really really interesting thing in the background with uh for celsius is going to be the treatment of the of the redemptions of the defy loan collateral so defy loans are characterized as being collateralized and we think collateral oh it's a secured loan well it's certainly functionally secured but bankruptcy law doesn't care about functional security it cares about whether a loan whether if there is something like a security interest hasn't been perfected and that's a term of art meaning that you've taken certain legal steps that lock in the priority of a security interest if a security interest has not been perfected it can be avoided it's gone it just becomes unsecured these d5 loans seem to have been secured through just basically a smart contract protocol that's not going to cut it with bankruptcy that means that they can be treated as unsecured loans and therefore because they were unsecured loans you can treat the redemptions as preferences and you can claw back the the redemption payment the problem is these d5 protocols who are you clawing it back from right it's it's going to be a freaking mess yeah you're trying like you're trying to is going to be a huge mess figuring out how if at all it's possible to claw claw funds back from a d5 protocol um i don't know what the answer is but there there is potentially a lot of money at stake and that you know if this were 10 million dollars it might be this isn't worth figuring out but when you're talking about hundreds of millions then there's a lot of pressure to figure out a way to to claw back money from it from from everyone who uses a d5 protocol i mean like just from the perspective of the smart contract itself my answer is like that's not possible do you know what i'm saying funds can be true well especially with ether um it's quite easy to track balances right you see more money there you see where money you know everyone who put money into a pool you see here they get the money out of the pool i think you can trace that now can you actually figure out who the who owned those wallets right that's that's another mess yeah and that's incredibly illuminating to be honest i've never really thought about the d5 loans in that way it kind of went oh well i guess you i guess you're i guess well good for them they over collateralize they manage to get out but the way you sort of framed it i think you you you're absolutely right that there would be subject to some sort of clawback claim there and how you do a clawback against d5 protocols and dowels laura i think we're gonna need about three hours i'm gonna do three hours and a couple days of research and then i'll let you know what could work the unincorporated daos might be treated as general partnerships where everyone involved is jointly and separately liable or maybe they're not i mean it's you adam you need to be careful saying that about everyone in the dow being you know jointly it's every liable because maybe you're giving the u.s terror holders an idea about suing every single lunar holder in the world it may not make sense to sue everyone right you only see the deep pockets but it's also going to depend on how a dow is set up if if a dao is um you know some daos actually have incorporated entities and some don't and the general partner argument is only for the ones that when there's nothing incorporated i have to say even for the beginning part of your clawback description it sounds like that would just require human individuals you know to send back these crypto assets which like you can't for you know you know like those famous instances of like people being arrested and then they won't reveal the private key like i mean i mean that even just sounds super messy well if you yeah it's messy but the courts do have the power to hold people who do not comply with court orders in contempt and that means among other things you can you can you can put them in jail right i'm just saying that like plenty of police have arrested people who still refuse to give up their private keys so yeah yeah i think practically you'll be very very difficult but theoretically you could get a court order saying pay this amount back and you know if you don't you're in contempt of court potentially you could go to jail for it until you review your private keys pay your money potentially yeah i'm just saying like you know it doesn't sound easy to do the smart contract to me sounds like nearly impossible but people are are difficult in their own way uh different from smart contracts but you know like even a two-year-old can can be really difficult to manage but anyway one other thing that i was so curious about with celsius was as everybody has noted on its balance sheet they said they valued their cell tokens or sell tokens at 600 million dollars that was insane yeah that was insane absolutely insane yeah so i mean i've tweeted about this i think the whole is actually 1.8 billion it's not 1.2 billion how can you just create your own car and describe it 600 million when the market cap is nowhere near that yeah the market cap is about 215 million yeah something like that yeah yeah or at least when i wrote this grab 215. so i was just wondering like first of all would uh the bankruptcy kind of judge or whoever's kind of looking at this would they just consider that like blatantly lying or is there some way to explain how this number could be justified or like what what's your take on what they did there where it stands right now it doesn't really matter what they with you know what those number those numbers in the machine declaration when they if and when celsius ever proposes a um a plan a plan it's going to need a disclosure statement and it's going to need to have some discussion about what its assets are and it's going to have to explain itself if it's putting any value on the celsius tokens okay so at the moment this is why it sort of seems pulled out of thin air and not even related to the market capital yeah i mean as much you said you know he puts in a little uh graphic in the declaration of unaudited um high-level financials okay yeah so then the other thing i wanted to ask about this plan was celsius's intention to basically save itself by mining a lot of bitcoin but they need the court to approve them finishing building out the mining center first of all what's your sense of how likely it is that that will be approved how feasible do you think this plan is at helping celsius recoup its costs and yeah just like i don't know a part of me when i was reading all this i was a little bit like i feel like a lot of this is so similar to how they ran their business you know what i'm saying in terms of like the pie in the sky yeah but i was curious to hear your thoughts laura sort of reading the whole thing it does look like what celsius has done is they just want to build a mining business and they've taken a ton of funds from depositors and basically just channeled all of it into the mining business and they're hoping that this is this mining business is going to take off i think they're considering an ipo and then that would all magically pay out and they'll people pay back off depositors loans i think they think that this is how they'll recoup their losses but anyway yes or at least that's what they're claiming the initial reading it almost seems like if you're deposited to celsius you are investing in your mining business to be honest just on initial reading oh i i think more than that i mean so usually you look at you look at the financials of mine of mining companies and usually they have a good deal of debt that is just uh to fund the acquisition of their mining rigs celsius doesn't have that debt and uh at least that's you know usually it's uh done as a basically a lease of the rigs is the way it's structured the reason they don't have that debt is because they finance the rigs with customer funds so the good in some ways that's the good news for celsius as a mining business the rigs don't seem to be collateral for anyone what's not clear to me is how high bitcoin prices have to be before their mining for their mining business to be profitable if bitcoin is at 20 000 the cost of production might exceed the value of any bitcoins they can get and so profitability of the mining business is hugely dependent on the price of bitcoin and then this is a pro the problem that all miners have is that it's an arms race so um there was just an announcement this week that one of the one of the rig manufacturers had been able to come up with a next generation even more energy efficient um processor and you know what i don't know how big the they had the savings of the energy savings are there but one possible implication is everyone who's just invested hundreds of millions of mining rigs bought outdated technology that won't be able to compete and they're gonna have to put in more money to buy the next generation of rigs it's an iffy business and one of the challenges any crypto company is going to have in a bankruptcy is that a bankruptcy plan cannot be confirmed by a court unless the court finds that the plan is feasible this doesn't mean that the plan is a surefire thing it's it's going to necessarily work but it basically has to be that it's more likely than not that the that the plan is going to work then that the company isn't going to need to be back in bankruptcy needing further financial restructuring and if you have an industry where the viability of a business is so heavily dependent on swings and asset prices that gets trickier it's not unprecedented we have that with like oil and gas for example but here the mining it's you know it presents it presents a real challenge given that oil and gas it's not unrealistic you know the volatility of oil and gas prices is small compared with bitcoin let's say another thing i wanted to ask about was this kefi lawsuit we briefly mentioned it earlier for listeners who don't know it was filed by jason stone who's a former money manager for celsius they did not have a formal contract between them but he was handling lots of money hundreds of millions of dollars don't you find that it's funny itself right you know here's the the money the money manager who's gonna manage you know enormous sums and yet can't be bothered to have a formal contract i was i was having crypto capital deja vu do you know what i'm talking about with the tether case like tether ended up having to loan hundreds of millions of dollars to the parent company because they had entered into some business agreement with crypto capital which was like a sort of shady business in europe and crypto capital had hundreds of millions of dollars of theirs and for whatever reason got tied up in some kind of i forgot regulatory governmental something or other and so tether ended up giving this massive loan to to iphone x as the name of the company and the new york ag called them out being like you're saying that you're fully backed but you just lent all this money out did it and so in the end they just i think had agreed to like give transparency reports after that but i think they might have had a small fine but anyway point is there was no contract between iphone x and crypto capital so it just uh reminded me so much of this but essentially jason stone who also by the way was like a non it was what was this it was like 0x1bt or something it was like a popular twitter account but he alleged that celsius manipulated markets and didn't institute basic accounting controls he also accused the lender of being a ponzi scheme he cited certain instances where for instance you know he knew that they had taken a loan from tether paying like x amount of interest but then were promising uh customers that they could earn even more in interest which like literally makes zero business sense but anyway um so he is now suing suing for damages for an amount to be determined at trial and i was just wondering how likely is it do you think that stone seized any money and how would his claims be prioritized against that of customers this is first of all just to just to point out this is probably one of those asset deployment decisions which in hindsight proved blob map problematic obviously absolutely ridiculous that they are managing this ludicrously large amount of money without a formal contract so that bit of it is probably true because if it weren't um celsius would have caught it all the garbage the rest of it i'm having for adam to sort of expand on it but if what is being alleged is true it's obviously these things of terrible terrible mismanagement but then again this is this this is a one-sided statement at this point so we have to see how this one plays out yeah still um unfortunately for stone even if everything he says is true all he is is a general unsecured creditor and he stands at the back uh you know back of the line with all the customers he um the fact that he filed a lawsuit doesn't get him anything special okay so we're going to try to do the last few questions sort of in a rapid style i was wondering for the state regulators regulators that are now investigating celsius if there's any enforcement action or anything i'm just wondering how will that affect the bankruptcy or i don't know if they're just kind of unrelated or what you see there depends what they're seeking um bankruptcy stops any attempt to collect money from the debtor but if the state regulators are seeking let's say a cease and desist order or um something is some sort of prohibition on machinski engaging in business in the future right that's not stayed by the bankruptcy they would be able to proceed just in parallel with the bankruptcy then okay and something i was just curious about was a lot of people are taking issue with how both celsius and voyager did marketing it's been called out for instance that alex machinski the ceo of celsius often wore a t-shirt saying banks are not your friends when you know clearly celsius is like a type of bank or the day before they pause the withdrawals he tweeted at someone who had been saying like hey i'm hearing people are aren't able to withdraw from your platform and he tweeted back do you even know one person who has a problem withdrawing from celsius why spread fud fear uncertainty and doubt and misinformation so you know things like that versus like voyager and talking about your funds are like your usd is fdic insured which now the fdic is actually investigating this so you know do you see like kind of issues with marketing playing any role oh i was gonna briefly say a huge see a huge slew of potential misrepresentation claims across the board and because because of the way all of these companies operate right um and i'm not saying just voyage and celsius but also triers gabriel even tara it's basically entirely based on customer trust and confidence and when you're running out of liquidity to start paying off people what you see all of these guys do with celsius voyager and you go back further with three ac um what from the filings you see sort of jew and cow and their employees telling their counterparties and then you go back further to go quartz sort of tweeting right what you want to do is you want to trust try and maintain confidence and make sure that people don't all start leaving because when they all start leaving you have a real problem because when you have a bank run but then there's also a question of how accurate the information that you sort of put out uh in order to stamp the bank run and i think this is a question that will take a while to be decided there's certainly the possibility of misrepresentation claims some of them might be against celsius and some might be against mashinsky himself to the extent that it's a claim against celsius i don't think that gets that that that changes anything because if you celsius already owed you a hundred thousand dollars how are you harmed by the the misrepresentation that you didn't yank the money the day before the bankruptcy one it would have been claw and when it probably would get clogged back anyhow i don't think it changes what your your claim is in the bankruptcy it's sort of like you know two two breaches of contract don't get you anything more than one breach of contract where may be different though is if there are misrepresentation claims against mashinsky himself and where he is personally liable those would not normally be covered by the bankruptcy that's not a claim against celsius it's a claim against machinski presumably any celsius bankruptcy plan will have really third party releases in it which will deem celsius's customers to have released various third parties including machinski but that's going to be a hard-fought issue and lurking in the background is the u.s law on the on the on the availability of third-party releases may well change before this bankruptcy is finished and this is um this is a really uh hotly contested issue in uh purdue pharma's bankruptcy with the sackler family there's an appeal pending of that right now and we could see we could very well see a change in the law that would limit uh mashinsky's ability to get a release in the celsius bankruptcy okay and i did have people tweeting asking things like whether any of the co-founders or ceos of any of these companies so you know machinski or stephen airlink of voyageur or kyle and sue what are the odds that any of these people doesn't need jail time knew that question is going to come up and [Laughter] and and right before this i went and gave myself a 10 minute primer on what singapore laws look like when it comes to sort of criminal liability for all this i'm not that sure about the u.s but based on what has actually come out there's a few ways this plays out first of all the monetary authority of singapore has sort of issued a reprimand to the three errol's founders and just one quick question so i believe sue and kyle are american but you're saying it's just because three arrows was based in singapore or they were they were they were in singapore at the time they were doing these things so uh presumably singapore criminal law would apply because they were operating three arrows capital out of singapore they were um the mas montreal authority in singapore issued a reprimand to i think sue and carl maybe just three arrows i'm saying that they had breached the securities and futures act i believe the provision referred to potentially carries a jail term of up to two years if convicted if convicted that's the the main point under the general criminal law i think the uk you have quite fraud but i think in singapore it just comes as a general category called cheating and i'm just going to read it down because of it in front of me by deceiving any person whether or not such deception was the soul or main inducement fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver or cause the delivery of any property to any person or to consent that any person should retain any property or intentionally induces the person deceived to do or omit to do anything which you would not do or omit to do if you are not so deceived and which act or mission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to any person in body mind reputation or property is said to cheat so that is a complete mouthful and sorry for sort of inflicting them everyone but essentially there is a question of whether some of the behavior which you see in the correspondence to the f to the affidavit that came out from the three ac liquidators that sue and carl may have sort of misled their investors as to the state of the company as to the state of the finances of trials capital and therefore induced these customers to keep their funds within trials capital when they otherwise want to put it out and this is and this sort of comes back to the sort of article we're discussing earlier before this call right where stuart carl said the vendors were comfortable for financial position but the fact is based on everything we've seen from all the whatsapp messages and discord messages and telegram messages and whatnot it looks like they just straight up lied about the exposure to terror and their financial position so there's a question there but the issue of this criminal stuff is who actually brings the claim and i googled this and i read through this very briefly the prosecutor in singapore to bring the claim so the attorneys general chambers has to bring the claim and they have a discretion as to whether or not to bring it and this discretion will be based on you know how likely it's going to succeed you know whether it's public policy it's the best interest of public policy etc so the gating mechanism of whether anyone's going to go to jail is whether or not the attorneys general chambers actually decides to prosecute okay yeah and i think the blockchain letter sort of would be another piece of evidence or at least and that's what they seem to be trying to imply blockchain.com in terms of the deception and so maybe adam you can answer from schinsky because i believe stephen airlink probably is canadian the fact that their citizenship is not going to determine what law applies right that it so and it's there could be criminal violations potentially in more than one jurisdiction also you've got i think you need to divide this into pre-bankruptcy behavior and behavior in the bankruptcy for pre-bankruptcy behavior three euros capital yeah there's some indications that there might there may have been there may have been fraud whether that arises to the level of of uh criminal fraud in singapore or in the us you know it might they might it might if you have kind of an underlying fraud that can then be the predicate for wire fraud or mail fraud those would be federal prosecutions i um i have no idea if there's any interest at this point from the department of justice of even touching this stuff celsius also if you know if you look what's in the kefi lawsuit you might there's some implications of fraud there too and that that you know if i were machinski i'd be a little concerned about that and then uh celsius has another weird problem in i think 2018 or 2019 celsius entered into a consent order with the state of washington for engaging in unlicensed money transmission among other things and the consent order basically celsius just promised it wouldn't do it wouldn't it wouldn't do that in washington anymore celsius stopped taking uh having washington state of washington accounts after that consent order doesn't really spell out what washington thought constituted unlicensed and the money transmission but presumably if it was unlicensed money transmission in washington it would also be that in many other states and celsius doesn't have a money transmitter license it is a federal felony to operate a money transmission business in the us without a state license so there may be there may be a another problem there for celsius again it would require the department of justice to actually think this is worth pursuing and they may just say you know look we've got plenty of other fish to fry why you get into this whole crypto area which is pulling it has is politically charged and left the market sorted out in some way that's all the pre-bankrupt they seem to like doing the crypto cases in my opinion but anyway they like doing that like the hat you know the the hacker cases or the you know where it's in the money laundering cases this is different that's the pre-bankruptcy stuff i don't see anything with voyager yet that indicates anything other than a voyager just seems stupid but not criminal you don't go to jail for being stupid otherwise this country would look very different so but there's also that what the question what happened in the bankruptcy the um if you knowingly and fraudulently conceal assets or books and records related to assets from any basically custodian or officer of the court that is a bankruptcy crime in the u.s and that is might be a problem with three arrows right if they don't if they don't turn over the um the private keys if that you know that arguably that's knowingly and fraudulently withholding from custodian or other officer of the court and for any recorded information related to the property or financial affairs of a debtor that you know you can be looking at up to five years of jail time for that the hook for the uf with the for u.s law there is that there is this title 15 case that got filed in the southern district of new york and title 15 cases are really meant to just kind of be a mechanism for coordinating bankruptcies that are primarily outside of the us it's a it's the main show is not new york but to the extent they're assets in new york it creates a coordination mechanism but that's enough to trigger u.s bankruptcy uh crime statutes given that the the main show is outside the u.s i don't know if anything i'm happy to sort of jump in here because i was just scrolling through this and yes there is that there is a criminal offense for dishonest and fraudulent removal consuming of property to prevent distribution of creditors so there absolutely is that equivalent in singapore we expect most of the rest of the world so if they start being incredibly incredibly non-cooperative um it may seem that they may have to run off to dubai or somewhere else just to stay out of jail although there is a question of whether there is a dubai i don't think dubai has an extradition treaty with you no it doesn't i've looked into this one it doesn't have an extradition treaty yeah i mean so i don't know if you saw in the bloomberg article they are in the process of moving to dubai so what does that say to you they're worried yeah they want to get away from singapore they want to get away from the mas uh they definitely don't want to be the u.s they just want to be i mean dubai is like the place where you go to if i mean it's it's got a pretty dodgy reputation right a little bit oh yeah totally nothing that can't be cured by sponsoring some soccer teams okay then how long do you expect each of these bankruptcies to play out two to three years i think yeah two to three years is probably about right these are not going to be fast i mean it's hard to give a real accurate uh guess at this point but two to three years i think before we see a plan confirmed um how long it takes for all the assets to be fully administered fully administered that could take much longer yeah i i think the sort of precedent we may have for this is i mean just look at the mount gawk stuff right it's taken absolutely years to play out um was it 2014 something like way before i even did anything crypto related or knew what crypto was that's when it all happened and on the mount gogs thing actually there's a there's a fairly interesting point here given the length of time it took because the i believe the bitcoin that was sitting in mount gold this goes back to the question we're discussing probably close an hour earlier the the the the bitcoin in there have appreciated massively in value in the last eight years or so and they actually it looks like they've actually come to a fair distribution where that there has been some sort of civil rehabilitation proceeding such that the pres that such that the creditors seem seem to be able to enjoy the upside rather than the companies magically becoming solvent mainly just by bitcoin price appreciation so this may be good news for the 3ac creditors maybe there is a solution somewhere where you don't get liquidated at 18k when bitcoin goes to 200k or whatever it is we're hoping do you think it's likely that celsius and slash voyager or you know either one of them will eventually be up and running again as a business unlikely and want to see lawyer do you have an opinion i don't know it depends they clearly want to they clearly want to because it's chapter 11. but i think adam's comment is coming from yeah the fact that you know you need confidence to operate a spec find the filing of 11 yes they may want to but you als even if they even if kirkland and alice looked at this and said you have no chance of reorganizing they would still file them for 11 not for seven oh i see okay last question now truly as you all know co-founder xu xiu of three euros capital said that he was creditor of three arrows for five million dollars and uh co-founder kyle davey's wife kelly chen said she was owed 65.7 million what's the likelihood that sue and then also kyle's wife receive anything as creditors to be honest it depends on the nature of the loan agreement or of this arrangement um it could not be a legitimate loan it could be just them claiming that they will owe monies because for the the evidence we've seen that's sort of put out is you know a very short email a document that literally says okay we've confirmed that we owe you this amount of money can the shareholder legitimately be accredited for company yes is this the case we don't know is it likely they're going to be let up out of all this i really doubt it because we can go into this more detail but only like keep at them with all of the potential clawbacks against carl and sue i could go on all day about it you know potentially wrongful trading fraudulent trading unfair preferences which operates in a very similar way to to what adam described early on um preacher directed duties there's a whole list and there's the personal claims they're going to be showing up against them as well so so so um yeah i think we probably need more information there but could it be legitimate yes but is it really we don't know you know i don't know enough about british virgin island liquidation proceedings to know how how they would be treated i can say that in a u.s bankruptcy case you know there's first the question is do you actually characterize the relationship as a loan as wassy lawyer was saying or do you do you say well it's actually more like an equity contribution or maybe it's just both and there is nothing there but even if you say it's alone um you know you you would expect to see insiders in a chapter 11 case you'd expect to see insider positions classified separately from other creditor claims and probably subordinated pro and which means in this case you know it would be getting nothing so i would expect for celsius for example that celsius insiders are going to be putting it would be put in a different class and will get no recovery that i i can't imagine mashinsky walking away with a penny from celsius adam can i ask you one question please i'm sorry i've been dying to ask you this question on on the on the voyager sort of um sort of draft the way they sort of set up their their creditor classes is there where they've segregated account holders from unsecured creditors is there a world where you know because of you guys having cross-class cram down do you guys is there a world where account holders say no this is a terrible deal and the secured credit is hit the right majority and they get a crime down of the plan is there a what would that happen yes that there you only need one so bankruptcy voting there are two ways you can confirm a bankruptcy plan you can confirm it consensually or with what's called cram down and that's the plan being crammed down the throats of the non-consenting creditors we also have a pro we have a technique called cram up and you can you imagine what that might be um the with a consensual plan it's a little bit of a misnomer it doesn't mean that everyone agrees to it it means that every class that is impaired has voted for the plan by a requisite majority um a cram-down plan in contrast needs only a single class voting for the plan and that single class could even be a class that has one creditor in it right there uh there are rules on how you can classify creditors there's some restrictions um but you could have a class let's you know maybe it's the uh maybe it's vendors or maybe it's a class just of small claims that votes for the votes for the plan and they force it down on everyone else that's entirely possible all right well we will have to see how it all plays out so you guys this has been an amazing conversation i so appreciate that you shared your knowledge where can people learn
