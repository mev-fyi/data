cryptos very bad good guy welcome Brady hey Laura great to be here you've been a reporter covering crypto full-time since 2017. how did you get into it and what had your background been before uh immediately before I was a general Tech reporter at The Observer which published the New York Observer which is how most people know it uh though I wasn't in the actual paper very often um but I was a general Tech reporter there and I've always gravitated towards kind of the weird stuff and so I would I coindesk noticed me I got hired by Point s in 2017 and they noticed my Ico coverage because I was doing that when that was kind of taking off in 2017 but actually the first well I did some other like tiny sort of lame Bitcoin stories before that but the first real the first time I really dug into what blockchains were I was very interested in Kindles and ebooks like I was a big I thought I think that was one of my favorite topics to write about but one downside of ebooks is you don't really own them they're just licensed right and so um and so that means that you can for example there's no there's no secondary market for e-mart books for example because because you you just license them and that is that is clearly a you know a downside of ebooks and so I was like oh I wonder if there's any kind of technology that could solve that and that's when I learned about work image and Heap was doing at the time on her Mycelia project which was sort of a secondary market for digital music and I was just like oh that could be ebooks too so that's when I learned kind of what a blockchain was and then kind of continue to explore it ever since ever since then and then found icos and then went to coindesk Etc um that is such an interesting kind of early interest in crypto it's definitely not the typical one uh one other thing that I wanted to ask you about is you also have an environmental background and I don't know if this happens to you but when I often meet non-crypto people and they find out what I do one of the first things they ask me is about the environmental impact of crypto and they think it's all of crypto I have to you know clarify things for them but I was wondering what your take is on the environmental impact of proof of work sure I have so many thoughts on this topic you know I feel like most of the most of the green concerns about crypto are pretty unsophisticated and as someone who was in the environmental movement for four years before and I was interested in it for a long time but you know it was professionally environmentalist for four years before leaving to become a journalist you know one thing people don't really get about there's a lot of things people don't get about how energy works but one of the most important things that people don't get is our Energy System especially the United States has a very similar problem to our financial system it's too centralized like it's way too centralized and one of the major problems for bringing new sources of energy online is power lines only have so much capacity and it can be really hard in high demand times to turn things off and on so this is for example a problem that really happened we saw this in Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy a bunch of people had uh solar panels on their homes but they all had to turn those off they had to shut them down in around Hurricane Sandy because the problem was they didn't have ways to shut them off from the grid when workers were trying to restore power for everyone so there's all kinds of problems like this there's all kinds of problems with excess centralization and difficulty with dealing with distribution and so in my opinion you know we know that one thing crypto seems to be very good at is helping people come to consensus in complex situations where people have different competing interests so I think over time it'll be some of the best Technologies for sort of helping to sort out how power should move around the grid now that's a very much a long-term View but I think that much to everyone's surprise one day we will find that decentralized Technologies like cryptocurrency are crucial to actually dealing with getting energy to where it needs to be and having multiple Point sources so uh it's I know it's it's not a sound bitey sort of answer but it's just energy is a really complicated thing and people look at it in this very simple sort of zero-sum way that isn't accurate I actually love that answer it's not at all what I expected and I actually several years ago did write an article about a pilot experiment in which some homes in Brooklyn had set up um kind of like a little um Community where they could buy solar power from like their neighbors and the neighbors could make money if they had the panels and it was done through crypto payments and it was kind of like this iot payment type situation so um that is a fabulous Insight I love that um and because you've covered other things I was curious for your thoughts on how covering crypto differs from other types of beats oh yeah well I mean the main two other beats that I've done really are technology mostly and kind of like local technology to some degree because I covered Brooklyn specifically for a while and then kind of commercial real estate they did a little bit of that at the Observer commercial real estate is a whole different world than uh technology and crypto but I I really I think the tech world and the crypto world were really I think they're pretty similar you know like in terms of their their Vibes and approaches you know it's funny when I started at coindesk you know I brought a lot of the sort of like Tech reporter sort of perspectives and at first they were just like we were not a tech reporter anymore and I was like guys I totally still am this is this is completely a technology story and like I eventually brought them around on it but they sort of thought about it in those early days as more just purely Financial you know um and clearly it was like a lot more than that so I think they're pretty similar I mean you know my biggest overall gripe about all of these beats is just that um I might get in trouble for saying this but just the the dominance of PR firms and sort of the communications industry which I think sort of makes it hard to like really ever know anything but that that's very similar in both worlds yeah yeah well I have a question for you about that later but um but I still want to dig into your background a little bit yeah we'll talk about your background um I also want to ask because you started at coindesk as you mentioned then you went to the defiant and now you've been at axios for over a year so you were at two kind of crypto media organizations and then now you're more like a mainstream organization and I wondered how you thought covering crypto in the crypto media differs from covering it at a mainstream org oh well I mean yeah I mean it's funny I was just talking to my co-writer crystal about this you know axio super mainstream you know uh they're they're they're they love having us there covering it they find it interesting but I mean the biggest difference is you know like most normal people uh you know the folks there aren't they're not living and breathing crypto all the time you know and whereas at coindesk in particular especially early on most people were pretty opinionated about you know stuff so like there was a lot of thought I mean the coindesque slack was a real spicy place um especially in like in like 2017 like I was sort of remembering today like you know sometimes near slack if there's a lot of people who are active you get that many people people are typing message at the bottom um we we saw that at coindesk like a lot back in the day um whereas you know like in a more mainstream organization you float something and you're just like hey is this a big deal or whatever like there's you know there's not a ton of people don't have like a ton of diversion opinions it's just sort of like yes it doesn't seem bad like cool you know do a story you know where is where is it a coin desk would be there'd be a lot more thoughts on things like that so uh yeah it's a big difference but like but for the axios audience do you have like particular thoughts about how you cover crypto for them yes I don't know if it's as informed by what what we I know about the audience so much as it's informed by axios itself I mean axios is historical you know it started as a political you know you know government sort of reporting company and I it's still very it covers lots of things now but that's still very much in his DNA so organizationally they're always interested in any news around politics or regulation or legislation you know because that's kind of in the company's DNA so and I think that that is sort of that sort of does seem to be what our readers kind of respond to too so um you know I wasn't the biggest regulation guy previously you know especially a coin desk like I could just leave all that to Nick because he's so amazing at that but and I did it sometimes but I didn't he is he's so good I didn't I didn't do it a ton so now I'm doing a lot more more of that just because that kind of reflects kind of core axios priorities you know and it's clearly it's like the hottest story this year really so it's clearly worth doing I just have to do some catch-up speaking of hot Stories the day this podcast comes out is the day your new book on the FTX Saga comes out tell us about your book yeah so uh you know it's the it's the first book about FDX and the SPF unwinding obviously there's still a ton the world doesn't know about that what I tried to do with the book is in one place tell people as much as we knew not just about the unwinding itself but but Sam and Alameda and ftx's whole history in the crypto space and try to like present their character uh so that people could understand kind of their perspective going into it and and illuminate I think why they were so game to take as many risks as they did and uh kind of what the their real priorities were in operating this market and trying to make tons of money out of it you know which I I argue very much comes from uh Sam's bigger Vision in the world that he like wants to save the world he was this EA guy and uh so it was worth it to take tons of big risks and pile up a giant War chest because he thought he could do this astounding amount of good for the planet and it ended up doing a bunch I don't know he did some good I mean he definitely gave some anyway but it also did a lot of harm here at the end it appears so that's the story I was trying to tell and when you say that it almost sounds like you're trying to take his perspective did I read that correctly or well I'm trying to illuminate his perspective I'm not sort of trying to take it from his side I do think you know I felt this way about Sam for a long time because as I explained in the book like I hung out with EA's a little bit I sort of I kind of sort of bought into that at a certain point like I was at least interested in it and when I would see people talk about Sam and things he would do I I just saw that sort of people either assumed in the crypto Market in the crypto World either you're someone who's just trying to make as much money as you can which there's a lot of those or you're a sort of True Believer in crypto like you're sort of a missionary right and what I saw in people sort of takes on Sam was they didn't understand that he was kind of both he was a missionary but definitely not a missionary for crypto um but he was also trying to make as much money as he could but because he was a missionary not just for like and I just saw that people didn't really get that about him and so like I'm not defending it I'm just saying that it does sort of explain his motivations you know so something that I just need to ask about as a journalist who's also written a book this is incredibly fast for a book to come out especially on such recent news events so I'm just curious like how did it happen that fast like how did you get the deal that fast how did you write it that fast how did how are they getting it out this fast right curious about the logistics of all that sure well so the first thing is the book was Wiley's idea and they came to me did you have a relationship with them no no oh okay the story is actually it's really funny I said this before but I I think this has not been widely discussed uh you'll find this interesting so I kind of have a relationship with the tech meme ride home podcast I don't know if you're familiar with them great daily podcast the wait the tech meme what ride home right oh no I don't know that part I know Tech me but I didn't know their podcast yeah it's a great podcast it's really more of just a partnership it's a separate company but um yeah it's just great podcast I listen to it most days it's just it's it's kind of like the end of your podcast they just do a daily summary of The Daily Tech news and then sometimes they do longer weekend special editions and so I became a fan of it pretty early on I was hitting up their um host and I go on their pretty infrequently but sometimes to just sort of do like broad takes about crypto and whatever so anyway he he we're in touch and when the FTX thing kind of blew up he was messaging me about it like you know what do you think about it and I had written this funny explanation of it in slack to another co-worker that was just kind of like uh I can't remember exactly what it was it's in the book but it's just it's the thing that ends with a deer in headlight Emoji it it's it was like I don't know it was a funny it was a funny like quick pithy explanation of what happened like it you know within a few days after it and I sent that to him and he was like can I read this on the air and I was like yeah sure go for it and so he read it and an editor at Wiley heard it and he already had this idea of an SPF book and so then he looked me up and he was like this guy seems to know about this stuff then message me and asked if I want to do something I was just like absolutely and then the other piece of it and then the part of how I was able to do it as fast as I did I mean I'm a pretty fast writer I mean that's part of it but like and because I focused on mostly the stuff we already knew I mean there's definitely some original reporting in it but not like mountains of you know not like your book cryptopians which has like mountains and mountains of crypto original reporting it's you know a decent amount of original reporting but not astounding amounts um I did I did what I could do and people aren't getting back to me too because of stuff but um I had also the whole middle part in there about sushi swap I had had an idea for a book on that already and had actually already written a full like 70 page proposal on that and so yeah so I had probably 15 to 20 000 words that were basically I mean I had to change them a lot but um but I had done that whole piece of re I mean I had covered it at the time and then I had subsequently recovered it doing this research and so I just had all that ready so I got to basically do that book actually because what also I had an idea as a book and then once I finished the proposal I was actually like this proposal is basically the book really it was just two weeks I mean like you know and so I had all that kind of done so that also sped me along somewhat and then just it turns out that if you're writing up something that you really basically already know the story you can do it really fast is what I learned and I think the other thing that helped me do it fast is I made this decision and you you've read it so you know this you know this so I I had decided to write a book that had a lot of short chapters in it and that also that turns out to make it easier to write quickly too I learned is like if you have sort of 60 chapters planned um you can just like each night you can just be like I'll write this chapter I'll write this chapter and like you know if you already know it it's like pretty fast so yeah and so what does your life look like during that time because you didn't like take a break from axios right uh I didn't I took a few days off um I just worked all the time uh the time that you saw me at that one happy hour the first time we ever met was basically the only time that I left my apartment for a non-book related reason in that hole in that whole period um I got you I got you yeah I mean I'm not gigantically in demand out there anyway either Laura it's not it's not that hard for me to say but I got really into it I mean like I had a good time like um this is what I've always wanted to do you know I've always wanted to do books and so it was I hopped on doing it and um yeah banged it out so I have to also ask about this Michael Lewis is also authoring a book on FTX as am I um but you dedicated the book to Michael Lewis not me and I was curious why why you did that um I did it I mean it was I did it I mean it's kind of a little bit of a joke right like I mean if you've read the book you know it's kind of a funny book uh I wanted people from the very start to know that like this book is going to have a different tone you know it's going to have like a humorous tone and so I thought that was kind of a funny thing to do and so uh I I mean what I wrote I mean I think the guy's great I kind of think everyone kind of think most writers out there are imitating Michael Lewis I mean he's like the most influential writer from like a pure sentence level writer in the world you know and so I just was I just felt like that was worth acknowledging and I knew I knew people would find it amusing that I did it because I and I so that was why I just I wanted I wanted the book to have a light tone and so it's light from the very beginning and I'll just read what you wrote to Michael Lewis he leveled up business storytelling yeah so yeah no I I um I agree with you like he's one of my idols and so it's a little weird now that I'm writing a book that's going to compete with it so I'm like oh okay this is awkward but only awkward for me I'm sure he does not care at all yeah yeah and Laura I didn't know when I wrote that dedication I actually didn't know that you were doing the FTX book yet I did know like a little bit after it was done but I don't think I knew what I wrote oh well yeah no because I think because you you uh wrote this at the end of December and I yeah my deal was like in the works it was probably going to happen but it wasn't like completely official at that point so I thought you were still doing the razzlecon book so right exactly um no I would I was not I didn't expect that you would to like dedicate it to me or anything I was just joking um well so as you mentioned you you know had some like original reporting in the book but a lot of it was you know stuff you knew so like what are some of the highlights of the book that you'd like to call out for people um oh good question well I think okay so one thing I'll say is you know you know at the start of the book I sort of highlight three moments that I think are really important in the afternoon from later in the FDX story and then after those three moments I'd go back to the beginning and sort of start over and tell the whole thing again then I revisit all three of those moments later on but I think probably FTX employees of the three things I highlight the thing that they would probably be like that's the dumbest thing that he's highlighting there but I stand by it is that I highlight the Miami Heat deal like I I honestly think that Miami tea deal is really important in the whole story of FTS the sponsorship of the Arena yeah exactly um and which in in which you know I quote Sam because he said this to decrypt at the time saying that like it didn't matter if they made any money for the rest of the 19 years of the deal they'd already made enough they could cover the whole deal right right now it was such a hubristic statement you know I mean it was it was as I say in the book like he it he he was virtually asking for the gods to strike him down by saying something just so uh just so prideful you know and I also think we lay I didn't and I saw that you know I can't prove this I didn't write anything about it I didn't tweet anything about it um I probably said it in the coindesk slack but you know I'm not in coined us anymore um I think I did say it there to me it just seemed weird I was I was like I thought a lot of Sam but I was like this is it's too early for a startup to put their name on a stadium it's just too early you know and I remember the.com boom like I remember cyanet in Baltimore and that was dumb that they did that and then they died and um I was just like I don't know this this seems too early and then so I so I thought it was too early and it was like a prideful overconfident move and then as I as I described later and we would become clearer and clearer it became clear to me that Sam got really Addicted to Fame and got really addicted to like hobnobbing with famous people and being seen as a famous person and I think in one of my sources says this late in the book too uh that that the Miami Heat deal was the beginning of that him getting a taste of that kind of notoriety you know and I I think that also helped lead him and the company down the wrong road you know that was the wrong set of priorities so I think the Miami tea deal is an important thing I think the fact that I chose to focus in on the sushi swap story I think probably most other writers approaching the story wouldn't have done that they wouldn't have cared they wouldn't even known about it maybe um yeah I do think they call out for people your um what you were exploring as whether or not Sam was Chef Nomi and then also his Rescue of sushi swap yeah yeah and um so yeah Sushi swap the big decentralized exchange the challenge uniswap back in 2020 that's a wild story for anyone who doesn't know the story it's like very weird I mean it's very deep in crypto but it is like when you you hear the basic facts of it that like there's one new exchange attacked another sort of vetted Blue Chip thing and kind of beat it for a minute but at the end of it they were both stronger than they'd ever been at any time before is kind of you know sort of an only in crypto kind of thing so I just thought it was an interesting story but it's also relevant in that that was in my estimation the first time Sam really became seen as a leader in the broader crypto World a lot of people knew who he was before that you know FTX was important but like he he leveled up in in that moment and sort of being someone who like had more uh clout in in this space and so I think highlighting that I think that's kind of a deep cut you know in his history but is but it's also important so I think that's a crucial thing and I guess the other thing that I would just say is the book has an undercurrent of sort of exploring philosophy as it relates to this space and and the importance of it in this space and it's not like I'd super dwell on that but it is a theme and I I think that's probably also a unique theme of the book If you know that people who were inclined to find that kind of thing interesting might find interesting in there there's also a lot of jokes I want people to know it's a funny book I mean kind of funny it's not like David Sedaris but it's like you know it's it's a humorous book so I hope people like that yeah yeah it definitely calls out kind of all the craziness of crypto um and you have like a a dry uh way of delivering it um so uh one thing is at the end of the book you mentioned that you don't talk much about Caroline Ellison Gary Wang or nishat Singh and you say like you know this was a conscious decision and just to explain for the audience why you decided not to go into all that I mean a I know everyone is really fixated on like who was sleeping with who and what kind of parties were going on but like I don't really know that if people had had slightly different partners that there would have been a different number of billions that were lost you know like I don't know those things are necessarily related to each other so that's a part of why I'm not super into it I also just and I not all of this is reflected in my reporting in in the book because there were some people who talked to me about things that they wouldn't let me cite them um or use it at all but I got a pretty strong impression from what the reporting I was able to do is that it that whole thing all of it every you know from Alameda through everything with ftx's name on it and whatever weird other little companies and other strange names was just all Sam it was entirely you know everything began and end with Sam's Vision they viewed themselves as a organization stewarding this genius who was going to change everything and I think the best evidence that you have for like what a powerful personality he was is you know in the early days when Alameda was just a house that he you know paid for with Jane Street money in Berkeley tons of people came to work on the early days of Alameda you know I think a dozen or so people were there like just sort of all the time not even really getting paid not knowing if they were going to own any piece of the company just because they were excited about this vision and this guy being able to make all this money to do a bunch of good in the world you know I mean that is and I think that reflects sort of the power of of Sam's personality and his Charisma and I think that is really the whole story and nashad and Gary and Carolina of them uh were swept up in that and we're and we're trying to execute Sam's Vision so um I do think it all comes back to Sam that's that's my stance so in a moment we're going to talk about

and so obviously since then there's been a ton of events that have been unfolding with FTX and I was curious to know like which developments or story lines you're following well one sorry one quick thing on the closing just is a fun fact from the story of it is I it was due December 30th I also got my final interview with Sam on December 30th um so I did this like long interview with him and then had to basically go back and not rewrite the whole book but just like reread the whole thing and be like is there anything he said that's relevant here oh yeah there is like you're gonna drop it in rewrite some things around you know change a couple things if you say this was you know whatever so uh so there was a I think I actually turned the final final draft in on like January 3rd wow we had a long weekend you know um so anyway but that was another fun thing that happened um it was nice he was willing to talk to me yeah as Grady was willing to talk to me I do really appreciate that but only only that once I had some old tape that we we had there's three interviews represented with him in there but the other ones are from old tape I just never used um so uh where do I think it's going now I mean it's going to the courts you know and you don't think he'll do a plea deal not based on my conversation with him in December and where I felt like he was defiant and nothing he's showed so far indicates that he will you know I mean he hasn't pled not guilty yet or he hasn't pled guilty to anything yet yeah I I think he thinks is only I don't know because we've stopped hearing from him too he's quit speaking but I I if I had to bet I would say no he won't he'll he'll go to trial okay so it is getting interesting because we're getting into this moment of um last week uh on Thursday you know news came out that the new FDX company that you know the the debtors as they call themselves in the bankruptcy case we're seeking permission from the courts to sue Genesis The Lending unit that was a part of um dcg because they wanted the right to claw back some money that they had given them now this is interesting because Genesis is also in bankruptcy and like you know Genesis is mad at Gemini and they're all mad at Voyager and a bunch several of these companies are in bankruptcy they're not all like Gemini's not in bankruptcy but we just have this like we have this um we have this rat king of bankruptcies that are where everybody all owes each other money to in there and I guess you know I it's it's just a it's just a mess of you know over but I guess I guess the interesting story to me is just like what is going to manage to still stay standing at the end of this and what's you know going to fall apart and and how much money is really left out there in the world and who's gonna get it you know yeah I guess that's the big thing yeah it's sort of like this Cascade and then you're wondering like which is the last Domino to fall and you will remain standing well dcg remains standing that's really the big the big question for the whole world is will dcg remain standing yes and um this so this is after you and I are recording but before this comes out I have a whole episode on all that unpacking all the different scenarios there because yes that is the big question I think hanging over the industry at the moment and so like for your book you know obviously as you mentioned you were only able to do so much especially in that short timeline so what are some of the unanswered questions that you still have about what happened with FTX and Alameda what are the unanswered questions um I should be more ready for that question well wait one one thing I also want to say and what I think is going to happen next just one quick thought there is I also I think FTX will come back so maybe with a different brand but I think the product I'm going to predict that's my hot take FTX is coming back because people liked that Exchange you know they like the way it worked so I think I think it'll come I think it'll come I think that's there's value in that property they'll sell it some you know somebody will do something with it anyway I've heard different people yeah talk about that although then of course I've talked to people who are skeptical of that yeah but is there anything so that would be one storyline to see the uh okay my biggest unanswered question about FTX and I think we know I mean the the superseded indictments that have come out I feel like have made this pretty clear but it's the thing that Sam really harped on at the end of last year and it all and I talk about this in the book it all it all comes out to the same thing but I think from a moral stance it really does matter which way it worked so I I really want to know for sure and like see the transactions or whatever did Alameda just straight up withdraw money from FTX into its accounts and do stuff with it or did the giant hole just come from crazy margin bets they were allowed to do just on the exchange Sam really argued it was the latter and while the different rules Alameda had versus every other client on FTX or obviously questionable to me it is a more damning statement if somebody made the decision we're going to take money out of ftx's coffers and put it in Alameda so they can make other Investments or make other bets then if Alameda just made too big of bets on FTX itself they both lead to a giant hole but to me that is that's more damning if they related to what do withdrawals and I think they I mean I think they did that seems to be what all the law enforcement is saying that they know but there's some question around I think um just that whole thing about how for a very long time when customers deposited money into a bank account in order to purchase crypto assets on FTX it was going straight to alameda's bank account I think that means like when you phrased it as did they take money out of FTX it's like the money didn't even go into FDX it like literally went straight from the customer to Alameda rather than right right right yeah purchasing yeah also that yeah but you're right lit like more of this will be hash out in court um and then I was also curious for your like overall take on Sam as a person like do you think that he you know intentionally did these things that he knew were at least you know against the terms of service of the exchange at the least or you know what what's your take on him as a person yeah I mean well I mean first I want to say you know everyone's innocent until proven guilty obviously it's all alleged but um I think he knew I think and I think this is why it's important to and I don't know how good of a job I'm doing with this now or in the book because it is a subtle thing they're like Sam and people in that world think in probabilities right like that's very crucial to understanding how they approach things like most of us look at things and go like that's good that's bad I should do it I shouldn't do it right we sort of think in binaries right that is very much not how Sam thinks he thinks in a in a much more nuanced way that's very numeric and so he like asked himself any any and I try to explain this late in the book he tries to he tries to like make it as like a real value so like as an example if he thought that there was some donation that he could make right that he thought it was a limited chance that it would actually do any good but if it did if it worked if like he could find free energy for the world and stuff it he would say like well that would be like a TR he would think to himself something like that would be a trillion dollar good for the world so even if it's a a one percent chance that that works out like one percent of a trillion is like what is that a billion or something like that I don't know then that's a billion dollars so anything I invest that's lower than a billion dollars is a worthwhile investment because that investment's worth a billion dollars because it's a trillion dollar potential good if there's a one percent chance and it's worth a billion dollars so I'll put in 200 million that's the kind of way Sam would think about things right if you can does that did you follow that does it make sense it sort of I definitely followed it in the book it's probabilistic right so I think similarly I think there is a world in which Sam told himself when he started to do the wrong thing when Alameda and FTX started to make decisions that were wrong I think some part of his mind Justified it to himself because he could foresee a future in which they did they they got through this hump they got over this you know bad spot that they were in bankruptcy didn't happen and they covered all the ground that they lost they filled in all the holes and at the end of the day they they built up such a giant War chest and did so much good for the world that this moment of harm or sort of risk that they had imposed on their customers that no one ended up knowing about was worth doing morally because the the later good they would do was worth so much and he and he values those things now in the present so if he's like if there's a chance that we can do a trillion dollars worth of good in the future if there's like if I think there's a 50 chance we can do a trillion dollars worth of good in the future that's worth 500 billion dollars right now which is worth vastly more than the 8 billion we're putting at risk of our customers funds at the moment right like that's the way that's the way he thinks and so I think his his larger you know kind of ego maniacal world view but this very probabilistic worldview allowed him to justify these behaviors you know at the end of the book I sort of I do this thought exercise with people where I ask like let's imagine that none of this ever happened and the guy cured malaria and then later he kind of admits you know that he had done some messy stuff would people just kind of laugh it on it block laugh it off and think that he was cute because he's this hero of the world now and it's just sort of like a devil may care attitude right you know and I think there's some chance that people actually might have looked that way in the future if this hadn't happened and he'd done a lot of good later and I think that's a future he was envisioning yeah I get what you're saying I think the one part of it that just blows my mind is this notion that somebody thinks they could just somehow unwind the eight billion dollar hole that they created because like if you think about what that means it's like it's just eight billion dollars at some point in time right the crypto asset prices are constantly changing so like who knows how much it was at any given moment or whatever and it's like all denominated in these other assets that they owe to people and so like it's just so hard when all the prices are constantly changing if to like make it all work and it I don't know I just feel like it's kind of impossible like the much easier thing is to like take people's money and buy the asset that they said that they wanted to buy at that moment then just hold it um so anyway well that's what an exchange should do like no money should leave an exchange it's not a bank it should all just be there all the time right right numerous people have constantly which is like it is mind-blowing that he didn't just go with the profitable business like a crypto exchange can be highly profitable um and yeah he I think that also reflects Sam's mindset a little bit I do think I think Sam thinks I also another way to look at kind of what he did I have a feeling that there was some part of his mind that thought something like and I don't have any evidence for this I'm just sort of speculating based on how I know how he thinks but some part of his mind I have a feeling thought that like for FTX to be worth them bothering with it all over time and for it to really be like a venture worth doing it needed to topple binance and it needed to do it like right now like this this bear Market was the only shot it was going to get because if the next ball came and binance was still number one it was just gonna be it was Microsoft at that point you know I have a feeling he was thinking something like that he clearly wanted to overtake Finance like there's no question about that and I think he thought he didn't have much more time to do it you know so I I think that might have also pushed him to do more interesting just a guess but wait and I'm sorry like but why why did he have to topple Finance because he could have still made a lot of money even if he didn't topple Finance yeah I think I think in terms of right he could have or maybe he thought eventually it was all just gonna one one exchange would rule them all I think he sort of imagined that future or maybe that it wasn't from his perspective it was like be number one or bust and he says this multiple times like he was always happy to go to make the big to Bethel house um the thing he forgot is like it was fine when he was at Alameda and he was always willing to do like bet everything on one big move because that was just his money and investor money so who cares but he kept doing that when he was writing exchange that had a bunch of retail people's money who weren't trying to be investors they were just trying to you know use a service but he kept he kept operating from that perspective but but I think yeah I think he probably thinks that it wasn't even worth it for him to be anything but number one and for it to rule the world because he needed he needed massive scale also on the one other random thing Laura to go back to like highlights of the book I want to say this here on Unchained actually because it's I think it might be I'm not I'm curious what you think and what others who read it think within the crypto world one thing I think is kind of a scoop in the book but I'm not actually sure if it's a scoop or not so I'm sort of curious what folks think is one thing Sam revealed to me in our interview and I couldn't find it anywhere else that doesn't mean it's not or the others just didn't generally know this but he told me that like one of the things that's weird that we saw discussed is people were sort of analyzing the unwinding as it happened is like ways that ftt moved around on chain and one thing so like for example I think it was coinmetrics discerned is that like it seemed that like every time a tranche of ftt would like be released out of its um you know it had it had a timer it had a Time locking period every time it would be released it appeared that it would all just go to Alameda wallets and it was like why is it going to Alameda wallets and one of the things Sam told me in that final interview we had is he was like he was like oh that wasn't accidental all ftt belonged to Alameda that was ftx's payment to Alameda for letting our staff for letting its staff leave and go build FTX like he would he he said no ftt was ever ftx's it was always alamitas and so it was it was always so FDT was always the um the Slender read on which Alameda was built and I don't think that's ever been yeah I I agree that's new yeah I don't think I've seen that elsewhere um that that again just goes to show you um like what d-gens they were like yes yeah yeah um printing this money and then taking out real money with it um so yeah that's um anyway it's definitely it also goes to show you just how intertwined they were yeah so yeah um it's super interesting one other thing that I wanted to ask you about was like during the implosion the crypto Community was Often incensed by the coverage of FTX and of Sam himself by the mainstream media and I was curious what your take was on that do you think that they were right to be outraged sometimes I mean some of it was really weird right like I mean like the weirdest one or I was just like what is going on guys like I mean I understand I understand where a lot of the bitterness between the mainstream and crypto comes from but like for example you know I'm no big fan of the New York Times I'm the last person who's going to go around defending the New York Times all the time but New York Times did a pretty great story I thought that was that dug into the kind of donations that FTX was and and Associated groups were making and how they kind of come up short on a bunch of them and a lot of it seemed to really be kind of self-aggrandizing for Sam like it was really important he got media coverage for these different donations and things like that I thought it was a really negative report that like did not hate Sam in a good light at all you know I was just like woof this I would not want this printed about me and everyone was mad about it because it didn't say like fraudster in the headline and I was just like okay guys like this is not a nice report like who cares you know they're they're like no this is they're they're doing more whitewashing of Sam I was like this story is not why I watched it like he is not happy about this thing like it's just it's crazy so I think there was this this real the victim thing that caught holds you know but crypto does this a lot too I mean a similar thing actually happened to Sam I think I talked about this in the book um I didn't go into a lot of detail with it because it was so brief but when Sam took over the running of sushi swap everyone who was involved with that they were so um they were so gun shy because of what Naomi Chef or Chef Nomi had done to them where he kind of stole a bunch of the money and it's I think it's somewhat debatable even that he stole it but whatever they were just like oh he's gonna rug us like he's clearly just gonna take everything in Ryan he's going to completely screw us over and they just completely flipped out based on no evidence and were just like being super hostile and super kind of victimy about him um through uh through you know until he actually started doing the migration and the migration went great and they're like oh he's the best guy on the planet now and it's just like I don't know it's just crypto has this real tendency to like view itself as a victim and like see everybody against them you know until they get like any proof that they're not so uh I always it sort of reminded me of that moment so obviously this whole last year of crypto has been um pretty momentous for the industry I was curious for your take on this last year of what I've been calling crypto Carnage which you know has seen numerous bankruptcies and failures I mean I think you said it really really well it was crypto Carnage I mean the funny thing I didn't see it coming this bad like you know I remember when the Razzle con I I I like year ends lists I think I'll tell you about me as a journalist I like urine lists of like what are the most important stories of the year I love doing them I think they help me think through like what matters and a lot of people make fun of them but like I like to do them um and so I'm always thinking about them all year long like and when the razzlecon thing came out in early early last year I was like whoa we've already got our biggest story of the year that was that was my reaction incorrect that was that was wrong it ended up being like the 10th biggest story of the year I don't know it was like so so much lower on the list uh but that was what I thought when it happened I was just like whoa you know this is gonna be the biggest thing you know well it's February not true so yeah it was it was really wild I guess my biggest take on this year here's my big take on this year and I've said this other times but here's my here's Brady's hot take on 2022. this was not cryptos.com bust false it's coming we'll know the.com bus when we actually see it and this wasn't it it wasn't nearly big enough it was big for crypto but it wasn't big for the world the next one will be big for the world and that'll be the.com bust but so then what does this year like why did we see all these failures oh I mean this was just you know things growing up in a volatile world and you know this will end up just being uh an important chapter in crypto history but it's not it's not going to be like the defining bust of crypto history that one that one is ahead so yeah and why do you say that like what do you think will happen you think crypto will grow bigger have some point where it hits the mainstream but it hasn't quite earned it and then have a bigger downfall at that point is that what you're saying well kind of I just think you know I have always said uh that crypto booms when something new and interesting comes along you know people people keep waiting for regulatory Clarity and it will that will be important for the market but that's not really good not it's not in my opinion what will drive the next big moment the big moments are always driven by some innovation in the space that gets lots of people excited you know it was just the World Discovery in Bitcoin kind of the first couple times and then it was icos in 2017 it was nfts and kind of D5 in 2021 and something else will be invented I mean down the road that will get people super excited about crypto and then yeah it'll break into the mainstream and just like everything else in crypto it will go way bigger than it really should and there'll be a bunch of irrational exuberance and it'll super explode a little dwarf this time and then that will blow up just the way that booms blow up but like this time too then it'll settle down in my my take is it'll and I'm also I'm getting this a little bit to credit I I can't remember if I had it entirely beforehand but I'm I got this sort of partly from a conversation from Maddie at Z Prime Capital he also sort of has this stance kind of kind of a merger of our two our two ways of seeing it but then after that I think that will be the last wild boom in crypto it'll then it will fall down and then it'll become boring it'll it'll just be a part of the world you know and that's that's the last that's gonna be the last wild run you know it'll be like the internet to become the internet's boring now you know and uh and that's gonna happen to crypto you know so so one more crazy run and and that will be the true.com boom all right okay we'll have to see um later on if your predictions play out yeah um so obviously we're in a big bear Market at the moment and um I guess this is your second in terms of covering crypto how do you think about covering a crypto downturn uh I look to the new stuff um so I and I haven't been doing a ton of that you know I did a lot of that at coindesk I haven't been doing a ton of it at axios and it's always difficult to decide like what to focus on but I'm I plan Crystal and I both plan to start doing a lot more kind of pure startup coverage you know like early funding rounds and just like unpacking kind of the things people are making maybe a little more a little more coverage of existing companies like newer features and stuff but just you know it's the it's the Bittle cliche you know it's it's now it's time to like look at the experiments people are putting out there because because like I said it's one of those experiments that's going to yield the next exciting thing in my so maybe I'll be smart enough to be able to point back and be like see I I told you about that when it was the seed round you know we'll see but um I haven't been do I didn't do that the first year at axios we were doing more kind of like macro kind of things um but now that we're in a bear Market I'm trying to get back more into doing that the more micro things yeah that makes sense we're doing something similar at Unchained so as you mentioned before crypto reporters are bombarded with pitches many of them from PR people but also you know a fair amount of tips how do you think about what is newsworthy versus what isn't well I mean perfectly if I'm being perfectly honest if it comes from a PR firm then that is a big negative in my opinion it really is because I I you know it isn't just me being snarky that is a company that is if if your bet for being successful is sort of how much attention you can get um then you're not that great of an idea you know um and and so the companies that invest a lot of resources in nagging reporters I think that's a great sign that they're not going to matter much and this has a rule of thumb I've had going back to like 2016 and it really has not I I don't have a lot of regrets following it uh I have I don't feel like I've missed much you know so I really favor stories that somehow I find myself and I know every reporter says this but just like if if uh if a Founder is annoying about getting back to me if they're like guarded and they kind of don't really like like talking to recorders very much and stuff I mean that's honestly kind of a signal because like you're you're confident you're so confident in your idea and what you're working on that you're not anxious to be talking to people so I think that's a big thing but I also you know I'm frustrated by the um by the pr industrial complex uh too because I just beyond that I I think everyone is so PR pilled that um just no one talks about anything in a real way anymore like I mean there's a level on which once companies get to a certain size like I don't I know that as reporters we have to hit them up and we have to ask them for comment and stuff but I'm like loath to do it because I know they're not going to say anything it just it's like okay let me let me air this completely pointless like thought that you gave which not only is just like I mean I hate like I hate just like getting a quote you know like I like to actually talk to people and have an exchange you know but even then it's like okay if you're gonna send me a quote I mean half the time they don't not only do they not they don't even they don't speak to what you asked about they don't really even speak to anything and it should be it's because everyone is just so afraid of saying anything because someone might react to it that people end up saying nothing and and I think it's it's that the high amount of power that people in Tech give to this sort of like messaging complex that makes them all sort of think it's better to just never really be honest or open about anything and just sort of like make stuff and put it out there and see what happens it makes it makes it hard to like be able to like do much service to readers in terms of like really exploring ideas so you have written some epic piece in your time um you sent over a few I was going to ask you about a few different ones but since we're running out of time is there one in particular that is like a favorite and that you that has given you like a certain perspective on crypto or like give you some like takeaways about crypto I mean I think my all-time greatest hit is my EOS Story I mean like that I think uh I don't know if that's my most read story but I think that's like the most important thing I've ever done you know um and uh so for folks who don't know you know EOS was this uh smart contract blockchain made by um made by block one the company which you know theoretically raised four billion dollars in Ico there's some questions about that number they clearly raised a pile of money like whether it was really four billion dollars or not they raised a ton and people always had questions about EOS and I covered it kind of as it launched initially in a sort of like sure this seems cool I mean to be honest I I covered it early on because multi-coin Capital who uh I was really into at that time in their early days because they had been they used to be really great sources for me they endorsed it early on so I was just like if they think it's cool I'll dig into it more and then because I do that early coverage I kind of had some sources there and at a certain point people started being like things are going really weird at EOS and uh and then also kind of funny but it was like uh like Pete my old editor and Zach my other editor were kind of like out of town for a couple of weeks and so I knew people weren't going to be like on me to just like put out stories every day and so I was just like I'm just gonna dig into EOS for two weeks and no one would really pay attention and I'm not gonna I also didn't tell them I was doing it I was like I wasn't like uh I was like hey guys I'm just working this story for two weeks I was like they're gonna be away no one's gonna be asking me questions so I'm just gonna work on this and then when they come back I'm gonna turn it in and see what they say and I really wasn't sure like because Pete particularly the editor then did not like long stories like he was not into that and it was pretty long and uh and I thought Zach would probably be into it but I just didn't really know and so like they came back and I was just like I wrote this while you guys are gone and uh and they didn't hate it you know and uh Pete didn't really say much of the time but Zach you know was pretty into it and then it came out and it like really exploded and I got a lot of pushback from block one but like it all of the critiques it leveled have turned out to be like true six times over you know like everything that sort of like said was probably gonna happen has happened and uh delegated proof of stake probably not the way to go uh I guess would be my big take there but um yeah so I think that's probably the most most important one and I did this crazy explainer on liquidity mining which just like was read by some astounding number of people you know and that was also another crazy long one but uh and that was actually an idea of coindesk editors they asked me to do out of this they do deserve credit for that they were like could you write an explainer on liquidity mind and I was like okay and then I turned in like 5 000 words and they were like whoa okay but we'll do this and it turned out to be really popular so I guess that but but I feel um I feel more like the EOS one was more of like a service to the crypto industry than liquidity mining one was so I guess I feel more proud of that one and it seems pretty obvious in your book that you view some of these like newfangled ideas and defy and um you know things like yield farming Etc as um offering at least an alternative if not in some sense being Superior even to traditional finance and I was curious like if I was reading that correctly and what your thoughts are in general about what crypto offers versus traditional Finance yeah I it's a fair question I you know I'm pretty um I don't exactly say Pro crypto but I I do I do write and report from the stands that I think the industry is going to work out you know and I think that there is there there you know which I uh not everyone does uh but that is that is the conclusion I've come to and part of the reason the reason I've come to that conclusion is just really it's honestly you know I'm a little older um I graduated high school without an email address I watched email mobile the cloud social I watch all these things come along and every single time most of the world was like these things are stupid and we don't need them that's what they said you know every time and I saw that happen every time and every time the things didn't turn out to be stupid and the world did need them you know and so I just operate from the assumption that when a lot of smart people are excited about a weird thing like it usually is worthwhile and then especially if the weird thing lasts for more than a decade I'm just like come on you know probably not going anywhere you know so there's tons of people who still act as if like you know any day now bitcoin's just gonna like disappear and go and I'm just like I don't think so but yeah so that's that's that's where it comes from for me yeah we're I think we're like very close in Asia I think you're like tiny tiny bit younger than me and um I have said the same thing I'm like you guys I grew up using like a telephone that was like attached to a wall and had like a long cord on it like um so one other thing I want to ask you about is you've also wrote about how you think that crypto space has lost the cyberpunk ideal and I was curious to hear you expound on that yeah I just think we see you know this is a big thing with Sam for example and this is one of the things in one of my early interviews with him where I started to wonder if the dude really got crypto or really cared you know like because he was so bullish on Solana and it was like so important to just be faster and you know be able to do more transactions and things like that but but I was like you know what does it matter like if you wanted if all that matters is you just want to be fast and do lots of transactions and just do a traditional database you know like why are you even doing a blockchain you know like you've gotta if you if you aren't being truly decentralized and truly censorship resistant then like why are you using this crappy database architecture because it is crappy database architecture except for the things it does do that nothing else can do you know and so I think we see that kind of thing all the time like you know uh like sometimes I'll go to try out new web 3 video games and I've gotta you know I've got to use an email for a sign on and I'm just like this is not what we're supposed to do guys like you know this is not I know you want to be able to content Market to me but like this is not what we're supposed to be about you know and and so uh I just do think you see people again and again this happens all the time just really compromising with the hope of getting to that like Mass Appeal and sort of doing kind of the traditional growth hacks that tech companies do um which reflect a slow chipping away of sort of the core values what's nice though about crypto is like the startups can do that and such but there will always be this like it'll always be based on these open source blockchains that are permissionless so there it can always be built on in a in a in a way that has Integrity uh and and that kind of can't ever stop much like on the web I mean the web is not that great anymore but anyone can throw up a website still you know it like may never get seen because people just stay on Facebook all the time but there is still there is still that option out there which is you know which is nice but yeah I think by and large people are willing to chase the gains they're willing to make a lot of sacrifices of the core values to get there and I just think we've seen a lot of that all right Brady well it has been such a pleasure discussing all of these topics with you where can people learn more about you and your work uh well I think the big thing is they should buy the book guys you know out today so go buy the book uh on Amazon or go to your local bookstore it'd be fantastic if you went there and asked here's the cover for people looking on video and look at all those great bookmarks uh so yeah by the book The other thing is um I would love it if folks went and found the axios crypto newsletter that I and my co-worker crypto Kim do every weekday I think we do a pretty good job of making things understandable and highlighting the most important news of the day and then you know I'm on Twitter pretty Dale on there but um yeah the newsletter and the book are the two two big things and thanks a ton for having me Laura this was yeah this was super fun yeah it was um thank you so much for coming on Unchained thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Brady and his book
