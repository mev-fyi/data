I think if people can agree to a pre-packaged set of terms it'll be pretty quick I think if they don't it's a total cluster if there's lawsuits from the blinkovi twins I mean you know if anything is contested I think this you know gets dragged out dramatically um there's already people contesting some of like the very simple facts that have already come out like a number of creditors have stood up and say like hey you got the amount that I'm owed completely wrong like one example is like you know Cumberland came out and said you know oh it says you owe us like 18 or 19 million and like that's wrong you owe us forty thousand dollars like you know like there's already confusion and dispute of some basic facts and you know there's another one that came out another creditor came out and said 150 million dollar you know credit was you know Incorrect and that you know the filing was an incredibly sloppy manner
