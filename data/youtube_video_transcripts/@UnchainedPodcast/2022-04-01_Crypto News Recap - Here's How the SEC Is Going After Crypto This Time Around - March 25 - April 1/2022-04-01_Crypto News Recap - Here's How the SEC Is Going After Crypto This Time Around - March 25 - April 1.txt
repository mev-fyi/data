[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the sec's d5 shadow attack a 200-page proposal published by the u.s securities and exchange commission on tuesday could spell significant trouble for defy despite not mentioning defy once the sec's proposal would change the definition of a government securities dealer to include entities that provide more than 50 million dollars in liquidity while not written to explicitly mention digital assets the proposal could bring d5 participants like automated market makers and liquidity providers under the jurisdiction of the sec according to delphi digital's gabriel shapiro this is an all-out shadow attack on decentralized finance by the sec shapiro believes that the regulator's proposal would characterize amm liquidity providers as unregistered dealers a felony in the u.s sec will argue that all amm lps are unregistered dealers that would be like saying all bitcoin miners are vasps virtual asset service providers if enforced it would kill the tech many of us warned sec could take this view but never thought they'd secretly rewrite the rules to avoid having to prove it shapiro argued the blockchain association's jake schravinski had a similar take on twitter the sec just proposed a rule that would expand the definition of regulated dealers to include people who employ passive market making strategies that have the effect of providing liquidity to others in addition to this week's 200-page proposal the defy education fund which was somewhat infamously spun out of uniswap's treasury took to twitter to warn against a 591-page proposal that includes danger signs for defy in a nutshell while def is unsure what the final implications that the proposal would be if passed the proposal has the potential to require any organization association or group of persons that makes available a communication protocol system to comply with financial regulations designed for organizations like the new york stock exchange if the cps allows people to interact and agree to terms of a trade def pointed out the language is so broad that even the proposal itself clarifies web chat providers like facebook messenger and utilities like cell phones which could meet the novel definition of a cps would not be required to register as securities exchanges the public has until april 18th to comment which def along with other crypto lawyers has been promoting quite hard on twitter institutional sat stacks substantially increased this week as covered in this week's episode of unchained with jo kwon the luna foundation
