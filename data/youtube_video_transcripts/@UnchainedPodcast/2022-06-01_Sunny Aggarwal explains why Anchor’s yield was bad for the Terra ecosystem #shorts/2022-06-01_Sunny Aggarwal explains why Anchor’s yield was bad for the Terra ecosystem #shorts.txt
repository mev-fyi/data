okay so now about the question about anchor you know so anchor was kind of really what it was doing was bootstrapping the stablecoin right like what happened was there was a lot of stablecoin deposited into it with very little actual amount being borrowed from it because that's not really what anchor was really going for and the yields were a little bit artificial right they were kind of propped up by tfl because their goal was not really to build a lending market as much as it was to build a supply sync for ust yeah terraform labs tfl dfl yeah terraform labs and the problem is actually kind of weirdly enough anker kind of makes building stuff with ust slightly annoying because so we're trying to build this like isotonic system and ust is still a major stable coin in osmosis we'll see what happens you know end of the week um but the to attract ust deposits into isotonic we sort of have to beat the anchor rate of return which is artificially propped up and so it actually the anchor artificial yield i actually think is a little bit harmful to the ecosystem long term because it makes it harder for people to build natural uses of ust and i think that was one of the issues that happened in the terra ecosystem that all the ust got put into this chasing this artificial yield instead of being used in more natural adoption if you enjoyed watching this clip hop onto youtube.com c unchained podcast to watch the entire episode and don't forget to subscribe while you're there you can also listen to the whole show in any of your favorite podcasting platforms
