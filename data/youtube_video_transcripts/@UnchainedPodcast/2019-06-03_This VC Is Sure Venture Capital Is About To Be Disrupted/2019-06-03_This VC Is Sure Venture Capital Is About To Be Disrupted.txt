blockchain capital and Stan Mirage Nick CEO of the Argonne Group an investment bank for the emerging cryptocurrency and token based capital markets the two collaborated on the recent crowd sale of blockchain capitals B cap tokens which represent shares in the firm's third fund which is called the blockchain capital 3 digital liquid venture fund the crowd sale or initial coin offering as they're often called raised ten million dollars for that fund and the B cap tokens resolve a long-standing headache of venture capital the fact that the investors usually called limited partners or LPS typically have to lock up their capital for five to ten years before they see any returns and contrast pcap token investors will be able to sell their shares on a secondary market after 40 days for international investors and for one year for us investors it looks like people were eager to participate in this new form of venture capital as the B cap token sold out within six hours welcome Brock and Stan before we dive into the meat of the discussion I thought our listeners would be interested in hearing that one of the most exciting interviews I've ever had in cryptocurrency was when I walked in a blockchain capitols offices right as Brock's phone number was being hijacked and for those of you who don't know about this this was kind of a big trend it's still going on trend is actually the wrong word it's a phenomenon where people's phone numbers are being stolen by hackers - the hackers own devices which and then they're using those phone numbers to get access to cryptocurrency rock have you ever had such a dramatic interview with a journalist yeah I mean the timing what was interesting and I have to thank you I had a good resolution but far better than almost everybody else thanks to you yeah so uh my phone was not working well and sometimes the reception in my office is a little less than perfect and so right as you're coming into the office I asked my partner Brad I might call my cell phone and it rings and I hear it goes straight to a voicemail for a magicJack I go well that's not my carrier and I'm obviously very familiar with with this issue and I've been warning people and a lot of my public speeches you know the importance of two-factor authentication that were really going to need something like three factor authentication you need to separate device because it's so easy to steal people's phone numbers but my phone number wasn't in my name so I felt I was pretty secure from you know this phones were reporting social engineering you know hack but when my phone was taken yeah you would happen to be popping into the office right then in there fortunately things worked out well for me I was able to contact the exchanges and have my you know accounts frozen across the board the hackers got absolutely nothing from me I was able to remove my phone number from more or less all of my important accounts in a matter of minutes I caught it quickly but normally it takes at least at that point months before you get your phone number back I was actually very fortunate to have you in the office you reached out to t-mobile for a quote which got my situation escalated to the office of the CEO and president and t-mobile bent over backwards to get me my phone number they worked with Sprint and things were resolved and my phone number is now held by the President and CEOs office so we walk into a t-mobile store and you asked me about my phone number I don't even show up and the regular customer service people can't can't see me so thanks to you I've got like this incredible service and I got some gifts from t-mobile well we have a lot to cover today especially around the bee cap token news so Braque can you begin by telling us how you heard about Bitcoin and end up code ended up co-founding blockchain capital yeah well I've been calling in the digital currency or virtual currency space since the late 90s it started out and with video games a game called sanctum which was like Magic the Gathering or pokemon meets chess and they sold virtual packs of cards and you would trade these cards with other players in the same way that you would in a baseball card shop or a comic book store and you know it was very clear in that instance to see that this intangible object had value and the insight being that the intangibility the object didn't make it any less valuable it's utility was just as much as it had been if it were physical and in some ways arguably better because you could play with people all over the world versus just those in your you know local town and so I contacted the game company and said I'd like to buy your virtual packs of cards in bulk and I'd like to basically run a single store you know I want to replicate what exists in the analog world digitally and they're like yeah that makes sense and so I started that business up in the late 90s and then with things like Ultima Online and have requested World of Warcraft in the Second Life I I jumped into that business and I was kind of the world's largest market maker for all of these virtual economies I built up a supply chain of 400,000 people in China that were playing video games professionally to mine digital currency again in games like World of Warcraft or Second Life and I've done tens of billions of dollars of business in that in that category and so it was only natural that Bitcoin was on my radar you know more or less the beginning but it wasn't until 2012 where I saw sort of critical mass forming momentum building and I finally actually fully appreciated the the novelty of the the technology in a way that I didn't in the earlier years but that's when I said okay you know I was asked by people what do you think of Bitcoin and I said well that or something like it is the future I just don't know what the future is now or 25 years from now and so it was in 2012 where I said okay yeah that's clearly the future is now time to drop what I'm doing and I've been working full-time in the space since started a bunch of companies done a lot of stuff in mining then things kind of all over the place but yeah the principle thing that I do is we've been we built a fund a leading fund in this base and we've been having a lot of fun with it so actually I wanted to go back to what you were saying about these gaming tokens you said that you also had people mining those like in China what does that mean cuz I of course I know what mining means in Bitcoin but I don't know what it means when it comes to a video game currency well yeah I mean were the original miners when we talk about proof of work and video games it's a it has a whole new meaning or an original meaning and that is that the virtual currency the swords the shields the horses the castles you know these sorts of things inside of these gaming environments had value and essentially I was making a market for time there were people that had too much inventory on their hands and they wanted to pay rent or buy beer right and then you had people that lacked discretionary time but had expendable income and in essence I was a market maker between you know those two groups of people and so the the people in shop well the problem is I had more buyers and I had sellers and so I eventually had to look at the world and say okay where is the biggest population of people that have a high propensity to game and it was pretty obvious to me that it was China and so I just jumped on a plane and moved to China not having any contacts opened up the you know the Yellow Pages and got an office and hired a recruiter and actually built up a 2,000 employees there between Hong Kong and Shanghai you are paying people to play video games to collect these shields in horse and swords and etc and then you were selling them to people who didn't have time to play the game to collect them so that they'd wait that way they could purchase them to employ in the game is that what I'm understanding III employed hundreds of thousands of people hundreds of thousands of individual people to play these games to do that to meet tens of billions of dollars of global market demand you know I managed you know what looked like an altcoin market of hundreds of currencies across hundreds of servers and different games my main investor was Goldman Sachs principal strategy to prop desk I think I was their first private investment because they looked at their currency trading desk and they said wow I'm managing more markets than they do huh that's really interesting and I was like twenty twenty-one twenty-two I was a very young guy back then huh yeah I I really like that story and I like kind of some of the parallels to the way the market is I guess burgeoning or evolving now in cryptocurrency and I actually then one thing that you sort of alluded to but I think in that story that you are telling about how you decided in 2012 to get more serious about it is that when you found a blockchain capital and if so I know also while I think also broadened barter your co-founders Brad and Bart Stevens how did you hook up with them well so Martin Brad yeah so I didn't start with the blockchain capital the first thing I was doing was mining because I was very concerned about you know regulatory risks and you know is the governor gonna try and shut this down and I know orange is the new black and all but um I just never thought that was my color stripe jumpsuits don't work on me either and so the first stuff I was doing is a lot of things around mining you know I had I think 10% of the batch one Avalon's and you know most of what I was doing was pretty stealthy in the beginning until I got kind of comfortable with the idea that you know let's say the US government disliked Bitcoin the world's a big place and it's actual its market opportunity is really in the developing world so you know if you're smart and you're careful and you're well advised in terms of legal counsel you can do really innovative things in the space and you can sleep at night and in part that's what our ICO is attempting to do is hopefully provide some better guidance for people in the future but the first thing I did is I'm an entrepreneur by background so I built a lot of companies I've run a lot of companies you know you know kind of call it early-stage CEO kind of founder type role and what I was looking at this industry I couldn't figure out what company to build you know I could build one of the me to sort of you know basic infrastructure plays or something different and I saw so many interesting opportunities I didn't know what to do with myself so I decided to start incubating companies and I was building a new company every two months I started tether and go coin and blade and buying Mount GOx and a bunch of different sort of businesses that I was kicking off and I was starting a company every six to eight weeks and then I got up to running you know eight ten companies simultaneously and I kind of call it executive chairman type capacity and I realized this isn't gonna scale either and there was still more things that I wanted to participate in more exposure that I wanted and I could have evolved into more of an accelerator that looks like boost or or I decided that the best way to get exposure to the overall ecosystem was as a fund and so Bart Brad and myself started this and I got to know them going back to my video game days so Bart and Brad were running a 700 million dollar hedge fund when we started watching capital they shut that down to do this full-time with me but they were also you know for the last decade prior to that the biggest in dusters in the video game industry you know in terms of public companies they were the main investor in $0.10 when they went public and you know all sorts of interesting gaming companies around the world and so they were playing World of Warcraft and you know I'm gonna try and tell the story the way they do but they were playing World of Warcraft and they're like wow we're paying bit lizard 15 dollars a month each for our accounts but we're paying this company ige and these other businesses hundreds of dollars a month to buy virtual golden things they're like this is kind of an interesting business I think you know this company might be bigger than Blizzard they're like what's go figure out what this industry is who does it and they went and found the five or ten big most popular websites to buy World of Warcraft gold and then they started making a research project of it and looking at who owns these companies looking at domain registrations and things and what they figured out is I owned all of them and I'd re-rolled entire industry and so they they actually cold called me you know like 14 years ago and they're like alright we think what you're doing is awesome we want to meet you and they came down and they offered me you know a 20 million dollar investment in my company I'm like I think that's that's a sweet offer but no thank you I can do a lot better and they're like why and then I I closed an 80 million dollar financing a few months later led by Goldman Sachs under substantially better terms but they ended up investing in that round and my partner Brad Stevens was on my board and so in 2012 I went to my board of directors for what was the rate one of the remaining businesses I sold my media business to $0.10 I've got a number of exits in that space but we had our main Korean business left where we were doing a little over a billion dollars a year at about 700 employees in that remaining business which was one of the last assets left of that kind of era of my life and Brad was on the board and along with goldman sachs and oak Investment Partners and I said hey guys we're in Korea we've got 90 percent market share the industry is flattening out and there's not really a lot of room left for growth so we got to either expand into other territories and start making that kind of expansion move or we have to start getting into other product verticals I said I want to get us into Bitcoin and goldman sachs and my whole board like me including my partners in the case of brad everybody laughed at me like bitcoin are you kidding I'm like no I'm actually very serious that I think that there's a big thing happening here and we need growth and I think bitcoin is potentially that big market for us I said I want to buy Mount GOx and they're like why I go well mark Corp Ellis and the management team is there's maybe the worst there is and their technology is horrible but they have all the market share we have the management team and you've got the technology so let's go buy this thing and they're like ok this is a joke and it basically didn't entertain the conversation I made an argument said hey I'm gonna send you guys some research about what's going on in the Bitcoin market and why there's potentially a big future here and in our next board meeting I want us to reevaluate because you know I want to have an informed conversation you you clearly are you're taking this as a bit of a joke and it's it's a very serious conversation so three months later we come back you know board meeting starts and I'm like okay I want to buy Mount GOx and they still laugh at me again I'm like didn't anyone read the research that I sent you did anyone read any of the and and the the response essentially was no well the person from Oak then went on and led the circle investment and about a lot of interesting things come to Goldman but I got a hold of my partner's Bart and Brad I'm like you run hedge funds you invested in you know virtual currency video game companies you're you know you know kind of Silicon Valley royalty how how is it that in you're young that you didn't review any of the stuff I sent you and you're still you know dismissing this idea I go it's okay to disagree with me and think that bitcoin is stupid and that buying Mount Cox is a bad idea but it's not okay to dismiss my idea when you've done no work to actually understand the market opportunity I'm presenting to you I'm really disappointed guys you know I can understand Goldman Sachs's response but you you you guys know better you should know better I'm disappointed and they actually were so affected by this conversation they dropped what they were doing and they started contacting every economist cryptographer computer scientist and they went into a deep dive because I I basically said what's wrong with you and there had I've been - in the Bitcoin came back with Brock we want to shut down our hedge fund and come build a venture fund with you and and that's an indication for you tell the story very often but that is the origins of how the firm got started and then I went to Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee and Metro Zak and a bunch of friends of mine in his face this was in 2013 I said hey I'm gonna pass the hat around and let's just start throwing money into all of the cool deals and let's see what you know happens from there and and now here we are five years later nice yeah well I'm glad that you mentioned Bobby and Matt because they are both people who were previously on the podcast and my next question actually was about these companies that you guys have invested in I'm sure as you kind of mentioned in the beginning you know there were a lot of companies that maybe we're in a little bit less legitimate or or just you know not really good investments but several of your portfolio companies have now become some of the top firms in the space like coinbase chains Oppo ripple bitfury BTCC bit Co I mean there's just a long list so how did you guys deserve what would be good investments when it came to vetting the different startups in this industry well the main thing you know I think as a venture capitalist or you know from our perspective at least I can speak for myself and I think my partner's the most important thing that we look for is ultimately the founders it's the management team you know you're investing in people first and foremost ideas and everything else are secondary and Mellisa of companies that you've named the founders of every one of those companies are you know extraordinary you know people doing amazing things and the sort of person that you look at you talk to and you say I think you might change the world and and those are the people that you're trying to support and back and you know I think we've done a pretty good job of picking you know the the best possible people in the industry and you know there's a few deals I'd like that we would be in that we're not in but I think in terms of overall portfolio we backed the best people in the business okay sue I also want to hear a little bit more about what it was like investing in these startups during this period up until you had this idea for the B cap token so what kinds of trends did you start to notice in terms of what entrepreneurs or developers were doing and and also how that might affect the venture capital industry yeah I mean with between each funder period you essentially have a vintage and you know the 2013 and 2014 and 2015 each of these years you know had a different trend and so blockchain capital was the first venture fund in the world set up to invest in this area exclusively and in the beginning it was a lot of Bitcoin companies because that's all there was right in 2013 there weren't I mean the term blockchain wasn't even used very often other than in the case of the block wallet blockchain dot info it was mostly early on Bitcoin companies the basic infrastructure in the same way the internet wasn't very useful until you had you know an internet browser and an email client and a search engine and content and things to read and e-commerce and things to buy you know you needed all that that they call it the bridges the roads the tunnels the basic infrastructure for you know it to be useful and so most of the you know early investments were in you know these kind of now you know iconic Bitcoin companies and say that was the this or the first phase and then it became how do we use Bitcoin technology you know sort of the blockchain the enabling technology to re-architect the the financial world and you know the chains and you know those types of companies that emerged and then this for the next wave as well what else can you do with this technology outside of financial services and starting to look at media and all of the things that we're doing today and we still invest across all of them I mean Bitcoin and cryptocurrency the digital currency side of the business was in a bear market for a couple of years and so we stopped investing in new companies in that area because I didn't know how long the market would be bare obviously we're in a phenomenal bull market right now but in that bear market as a VC it was you know with a lot of companies and those could all end up being starving babies and you know you you you stop trying to take on new companies that may need money because between you know DCG and Pentair and fin dilution all of us that invest in this area you know collectively we don't have a that big pool of capital we do not have enough money to support these portfolio companies we rely in a large part historically on the later stage generalist VCS and the VC market you know said hey ok I've got a Bitcoin or a blockchain bad I've got one or two I haven't seen any exits I'm not seeing massive revenues being generated in some cases markets a little bit flat you know that we were we were in a tough time and so we were focusing on you know kind of the most emerging of things and we invest across all of it now and then obviously with icos and I was a founding board member of the first ICO master coin which was the sort of the project that architected what has become icos and and I've been a major investor in you know a lot of the most important icos I think we owned like 10% of made safe when it went live we put 500 Bitcoin into a theorems crowd sailin owned almost no called a million a third a one and you know I've been doing the icos but in our first two funds we had some large LPS you know kind of big family office types that said we've got Bitcoin exposure so I don't want your you know the fund buying things like Bitcoin in a theory and I said that's fine I would never actually buy those types of things well at the time Bitcoin with with my fund I don't need to charge you a fee to buy Bitcoin I'll show you how let's start by taking you to coin base and you want to buy more and you want to secure more I'll show you how to use bit go and I don't need to make money off you're buying a Bitcoin that you can do on your own I don't feel justified in charging you for that but unfortunately in fun - we were prohibited in our docks from buying cryptic crypto I remember like just pulling my hair out when etherion was at a dollar and I'm like I'd like to make the largest bet of our firms ever made in aetherium at a buck I want us to go by you know all right but I said I want us to buy a million dollars worth and we couldn't get the legal approval to do it and couldn't you know I probably should have gone and got waivers from everybody but that would have been you know at 40 or 50 X returned in a pretty short period of time and fully liquid the IRS on this venture fund would start to look like Chris sockos unfortunately I mean I'm glad we did just fine and I I made that money myself but I'm really excited by our new funds ability to invest in ICS and I'm kind of bummed out that I wasn't able to do this on behalf of my my limited partners I my job as a fiduciary is to get up every day and make money for people and its really disappointing when I'm prohibited from doing so because of a term that was intended to prevent me from buying Bitcoin not other things like aetherium but they fix that with the third fund this takes us up to this time of the be cap token so let's actually turn to stand now stand can you tell us your background and how you learned about and became interested in cryptocurrency yeah absolutely so some most my background is in a mess when banking in capital markets and so I spent most of my career started Morgan Stanley and then worked across New York and London and Moscow and saw the emerging markets develop and become very active overnight and so I followed Bitcoin sort of on and off since about 2012 and even played around with with miners at home and and the kind of the nerd and me likes to tinker with this stuff but never really seriously considered it because I saw how quickly complexity was growing how quickly miners were evolving and always thought it was something that that's sort of a world away but then early last year I started paying attention to you know what's become known as the ICL market but I saw early-stage companies engage in really interesting capital markets activity that you normally you know you normally don't don't see and and I saw all those dynamics playing out and to me there's some examples well like watching through him earlier than watching the damn watching how much interest in garnered and how unique of an instrument it was and the the depth of the market for for compelling asset like that so an ability to raise 150 million in a market that at that time was less than 15 billion in terms of both Bitcoin and everything else that was that was pretty meaningful and the willingness of the community to invest from the grassroots and support a project like that not not only through kind of open source participation and participation in the development but also with you know with their dollars that's pretty compelling and so as we saw more and more products coming to market more and more ICO is happening what was clear to me is that you kind of needed an institutional player to bridge this market right you had very deep technical teams taking effectively a break from their product roadmap for three four or five months to dig into securities law to try to understand what what jurisdictions can I do this in can I not do I need to set up a foundation do I do this in Switzerland can i I'm sitting in the u.s. can I do this in the US and does the SEC have jurisdiction and each one of these companies was doing this over and over in addition to each of them individually trying to find investors each individually trying to find and build a platform for the distribution of the SEO each individually writing their own smart contracts and it was obvious to me just from from the traditional capital markets that what you need is a is an institutional great service provider that helps these companies bridge the gap between between issuers and investors helps them run a clean process that's that's the starts with diligence starts with a clear story for for the coin how investors benefit how the company benefits how the community gets to participate how you think about the governance going forward what are the implications for the company you know 18 24 months from now when they go to look for new financing and then engage directly with investors both those that are smaller to confessors but also kind of the bleeding edge family offices high net worth individuals folks that are already holding some Bitcoin enough thinking about this asset class and so last year that around this time we started the Argonne group which is you know which is our vision for a digital investment bank focused on this new tokenized cryptocurrency capital market and I had the the fortune of meeting brock in the fall of last year as we were kind of experimenting with various legal structures and how to create a clean clear compliant and legal path for an ICO for a company that wants to do it as a true true equity security or true security versus doing it as a use coin or a a more traditional structure and so we're based in LA in braack braack spends a lot of time in LA and so as you talk to the lay community and you know talk to folks in San Francisco and the valley when when the conversation turns to cryptocurrency and Bitcoin it's always it always goes back to Brock so he is that kind of the epicenter of this ecosystem and so I met him through a friend he came over to the office and we had you know I think we spent a couple of hours together and like his insight and vision for this space was was so compelling that I thought we kind of have to work together and so a little you know some time later he asked me to come up and meet Bart and Brad and we had a really interesting conversation about doing you know a first tokenized venture fund part of the thesis is is about the capital market in general look there's that you know the market is large a lot of people are holding core positions in in Bitcoin and etherium and some of these other coins but it's really a market that's starved for product and a lot of those the holders don't actually want to exit crypto in any way they don't want to go back to Fiat they want a product offered inside the the crypto market and and that that's a compelling idea on one side on the other side that the fund isn't purely focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency and so it makes perfect sense for them to lead the innovation in this space disrupt themselves and offer a product to their constituency because if you were a part of the broader cryptocurrency community or just in general if you try to make a bet on blockchain now there's almost no way to do it right there's there's there's no public companies there's no no comparables you can't get access to two to the elite venture funds that typically invest in this stuff and so there's there's really not a mechanism for someone even in the community to really participate in a traditional sense and so creating this product as we talked about it made you know lots and lots of sense and so what is your business model so our business model is kind of a very traditional investment bank and so as we build that we we help issuers issue shares we help investors invest in tokens we're building a platform for for distribution of tokens very much like you know so a traditional online brokerage type platform where you have investors but what I mean do you don't take fees from both the group that's doing the crowd sale as well as the investors in the crowd sale or are you charging only on one side or we're charging only on one side which is it's it's on the issuer side okay but the division for the business is much broader it's about building products that help you invest in this space so what we did with be kept and we'll talk about that in a little bit as it's essentially it it's offered as a security and so to purchase the security especially if you're in the US you need to be to go through an email and kyc process and you need to be accredited and so you need to have a pathway and a platform for people to do that and so creating these other tools and products to to help this investment ecosystem is part of sort of the broader vision okay yeah and I just want to clarify for people who may not know these terms AML kyc its and money laundering and know your customer rules and regulations so let's take this moment to have a short break for an important word from our sponsor on-ramp and afterward we will discuss the beef cap token the best companies in the world obsess

gun group brach so tell me how watching Capital came up with the idea for the V cap token well I again I was a founding board member of Master coin which was the first ICO so I've been very much in the ico market since call it day zero and watching it closely and you know through 2013 2014 2015 it wasn't you know that exciting I mean it was interesting but it wasn't like a trend the model and the the the idea was out there for everybody to image imitate but you know venture capital was still the the main model and what happened is the money plateaued in terms of generalist venture capital coming into the sector in like 25 2015 2016 but the number of entrepreneurs coming into the market continued to accelerate and so there was this this dynamic of a lack of capital you know to support all of the incredible entrepreneurs and things that were happening but you know where there's a problem you know and where there's a will there's a way and so last year we had 64 I SEOs raving at raising over a hundred million dollars and that happened I think more out of necessity you know in retrospect it's easy to look at what why this happened and how the trend emerged it was Adam out of a need there was a void that needed to be filled and the quality of the icos and you know my desire to invest in them was such that it was very important that our next fund was going to be investing in tokens and I was also concerned about the structure a lot of lot of the ICS some of them you know I felt were you know using very convoluted structures for the purposes of you know you know creating used coins to circumvent securities law and I wasn't comfortable with it and my view is that this can be done a better way and so I had already been selling my my partners and you know toying with the idea for quite a while to do something like this and when I met Stan and saw that this was a team of you know Wall Street you know deep bench sort of bankers that had the right securities and backgrounds and I said okay this is this is a group of people that I can get comfortable with doing something you know that's you know pushing the boundaries of what can be done and so I was already on my plan to do it and I said Stan well I'd like to be your first deal I said I I want to do this it's something I've been thinking about doing and you seem like the right people to do it with so let's let's go you know it wired obviously a lot of a lot of time on our part and obviously a tremendous amount of you know legal resources to get comfortable that we've architected a model that we that you know hopefully we've standardized and that you know now others can copy and well the fun invest both in startups and in coins or and if so then what's the break and what's the breakdown the answer is yes right now I still I'm not a fan of most of the ICS I think we're in a bit of a nice sealed bubble and I think that that the deals are raising capital at - earliest stage I don't think a white paper in most cases is sufficient and I think there's still a role for you know VCS and firms like ours for the the near-term to basically provide for seed funding pre seeds seed maybe even in some cases series a but what's really happening is blockchain technology is making it much more efficient for companies to essentially go public and instead of going out and raising later stage venture capital for a series being a Series C in the series D it's my view that you know now companies will be going public at a Series A and Series B level using this technology and it's of course going to start with our endemic community but I think if you want to see at least a minimally viable product get past proof of concept demonstrate that the management team can execute before I think you know giving it to call it the crowd so let's talk about this language that you're using about them going public at an earlier stage this is exactly the kind of language that I hear a lot of the entrepreneurs in this piece are trying to shy away from you know they're trying to de-emphasize this idea that what they're offering as a security so let's both talk about that as well as you mentioned earlier that there were all these different things that you needed to do in terms of legal and regulatory issues that you needed to Rose also can you describe what things you did in order to to get past those hurdles to in setting up the B cap token and make sure that you weren't running afoul of any SEC rules or anything like that well I mean the the main thing is just looking at the world differently instead of trying to avoid being a security instead of you know trying to avoid you know characterizing yourself that way you have to ask yourself the question is called ken can I do it differently you know can we look at the regulatory framework and you know there's the JOBS Act and all these wonderful innovations that have been happening to lower the bar for people to be compliant in the sale of securities so this is you know a trend that's been underway it's very easy to imitate what's been done before so you know with master coin we created a foundation and the ico capital went into the foundation the foundation that was responsible for financing the development in etherium and everybody else were more or less copied our model and and most people didn't spend the time do the work didn't hired lawyers to spend serious money etherium didn't and they were very late and launching and the talaq was very smart to do it wait along with the rest that seemed the way that they did they said we're not gonna rush this break you've got proper attorneys and we've been well advised and we're gonna do it right not fast you know this is brighter can you just describe for me like about launching this foundation and then having the ICO money go into the foundation and describe for me why those seemed like the right choices to make from a regulatory perspective well back then yeah as the you know sort of founding board and whatnot we didn't even get compensated no one got $1 we all had to invest under the same terms as everybody else so that we were probably the most conservative of anyone and I still felt very uncomfortable after the fact you know I'm the this structure is definitely you know bleeding edge and we won't know you know and if I look at you know an ICO on an individual basis some of them I would be very nervous you know if I if I were involved as a principal in any of those projects and because they look too much like securities like is that what you're about yes but then if you if you structure it where you're a foundation then why is it that that is deemed to be safer oh I'm not sure that that that makes it any safer the foundation structure is just saying that the money is going into an entity to support the development of the open source software so I mean that that that doesn't provide for a I think a regulatory sort of comfort that doesn't provide for that you know you have the Howey test which is you know the the main thing that people try to analyze is it a security or is it an an app coin or a used coin and and you're looking at those sorts of things and in some cases you have to look at each of them individually but the main thing that we did differently is we said instead of trying to circumvent securities law is it possible to acknowledge that you're a security can you do this differently can you instead of trying to dance around it what if you just walk through that door and the answer is you can the JOBS Act and the things that have been going on here in the United States to to lower the bar for these types of things to occur is happened and that's what crowdfunding is crowdfunding is the first major step in the democratization of venture capital things like AngelList what we're doing and what the blockchain is able to provide here and this overall just ecosystem of participants is an environment where we can take it ten times further and in orange in our case we use regulation you know ask some D exemptions what are those well these are two exemptions under the SEC regulation S allows you to do things internationally it allows for us to raise money from international investors Regulation D allows for us to raise money from US investors but we're limited to accredited only and we're capped at 99 but those so the big limitation is what we found out is we can do this but the downside is you have to do kyc you know no one had done an IC o---- where uky seed every investor you know we had thousands of people sign up to participate in our crowd sale and clearly the evidence is in the precedents been said you can do kyc and i would advise everyone doing an IC o---- at this point everyone to do that most of your legal most of the mistakes that i think are being made is you know taking money from the wrong places or the wrong people and running afoul of rules in that area and KY seeing your users gives you an ability to basically not take money from people you shouldn't and how many investors did you have total I think in the ICO Stan can correct me we had roughly one thousand in dusters in the deal and I think we entered five thousand but unfortunately you know the we did it we had a very small raise and we kept a cap in place because we were breaking you know I think a lot of new ground and the idea was not to maximize I think if the Dow had said we're gonna cap this at ten million you know the etherium ecosystem would be better for it just because you can raise more money doesn't mean you should right and so we certainly this we know this is an experiment we know where we're trying to pioneer a bunch of new things and the ideal is to do something modest ok yeah and you covered these things so long ago but just for listeners who aren't familiar with them I wanted to flag that the Howey test which brock mentioned was covered extensively in a podcast I did with Jerry Britt oh and Peter Van Valkenburg of coin Center I will refer to that in the show notes but essentially it's a case that how we something versus I don't really remember the full name of this case but essentially it is used often to determine whether or not an offering as a security and there's four prongs to this and then sort of a fifth I guess it this wasn't a part of the case as far as I understand but it's just a fifth test for whether some things as security which Brock has referred to a few times and that's whether or not something has utility so for instance if you purchase a membership in a golf club before the golf club launches that's not considered a security because presumably you're purchasing it not because you think the memberships value will rise after it's after it opens but because you want to use the golf course so anyway there's a number of these different prongs for the Howey test which Peter and Jerry went over in depth in that podcast and the other thing that he mentioned was the JOBS Act which some of you may know is a it's what it is enabling regular investors regular everyday investors to participate in crowd sales and and not have to be what's called and credited accredited investors where they make a certain level of income which is a two hundred thousand and above or have a net worth of $1,000,000 or above all right so there's so much background that people need to understand to to know all the reasons for these different regulations and how that affects the way that these tokens will play out but anyway so I want to talk more about the B cap token I know that you registered the token issuing entity in Singapore can you guys describe for me what benefit Singapore offers yeah absolutely Singapore is one of the few places in the world where there's been a ruling that said that tokens are not securities they're specifically assets and so by registering the issuing company in Singapore it allows us to sort of achieve local compliance in a very token friendly jurisdiction and what is that distinction between securities versus assets it essentially allows you to avoid all of the regulation we're now avoid but that relation is an applicable to you in the context of selling securities so we so everything that's that's typically in place in terms of disclosure and registration and filings etc all of that applies to securities but it doesn't apply to essentially assets and assets and essentially you know things like like real estate or or hard hard goods and so by explicitly saying this is not a security Singapore has removed a lot of legal overhang and legal complexity and executional complexity from from executing a token I'm just a little confused cuz during this conversation I thought that you and Brock were saying that what why don't we be upfront about the fact of these are securities and then now you're telling me that actually they're not securities well so it's it's a complicated legal structure and so the nuance of doing in Singapore it's at one place that's so far ahead of other places in the world that it's done the work and it's now experimenting with with these new tools and so what we then do is we because the fund is in the US and and we're in the US and a lot of that mesons are going to be in the US and in investors were addressing our partly in the u.s. too we then take take that security and offer it in the US as brock mentioned using the the two existing exemptions under the securities act and so he mentioned Regulation D that's been changed by the JOBS Act over the last five years and that allows now things like general solicitation we can advertise and talk about the security that you're selling in a public forum and so that's been a big change and that's that's a path of offering it to US investors are you saying that the be kept token in a sense is defined differently gali depending on the jurisdiction so in the US according to rugby you've offered it as a security but then in Singapore with the way the regulations are there it's defined as an asset is that what you mean that's exactly right yes okay Oh interesting um so I actually also wanted to go back to ask about the investors I know you guys were limited to ninety nine investors and they had to be accredited investors in the u.s. first of all can you explain why that was and then tell me about who the overseas investors were because if you had an eye sounds like 901 I'm curious to know kind of like where they came from yeah absolutely so so the 99 rule is actually specific to offering a fund right so there's another layer to be kept specifically unlike a traditional company because it's a fund and so that so so it it needs to exist under an exemption to the investment Companies Act of 1940 and so to be compliant with that framework you have to offer it to and a hundred people in the u.s. do not have to register them as an investment company or a mutual fund or or something along those lines and so that's that that's the exemption framework that that that most of the professional investment firms use you know like private equity or venture capital or hedge funds and so the 99 limitation came from that piece of the law and then the accredited piece that you you described so well earlier came from the Regulation D 506 C provisions of the law and so the interplay of those two is what created the u.s. dynamic and and so now shifting to the second part of your question in terms of where the investors are coming from we had a really broad participation so it's equally spread through Europe through through Asia Latin America we had some African investors and so it was really kind of fascinating how global this this market is were there any particular countries that were where it was more popular and and maybe even that surprised you so there was there's actually a native an interest from from Singapore there's some interest from the UK there's a lot of interest from from China and and we kind of knew this going in because we saw where the traffic was coming from to a lot of our materials and landing pages broader Asia and it just from Korea and so I think how interesting this is to an Asian audience was really really compelling huh that is interesting so Brock I've often heard you refer to this step that you're taking with the B cap tokens as blockchain capital eating its own dog food and I want to hear you kind of explain what you mean by that and also give me your thoughts on what changes you think this B cap token could unleash in the industry well I mean we're gonna be in investing in I SEOs we believe in sort of the ico market and so might as well walk the walk right and and do something you know the goal of a lot of what this industry from my perspective the goal is to democratize you know the financial system is you know one aspect of what we're doing and to you know a name with equal access for everyone you know complete and total financial inclusion across all of all of its areas it's part of the reason I was an early adopter of crowdfunding I think I still have I think the largest personal syndicate in Southern California on AngelList we've syndicated a lot of deals I believe philosophically crowdfunding and blockchain and Bitcoin or you know all you know working toward call it the same macro outcomes so this is just the next sort of big leap in it and then you know venture capital as a whole I mean these C's invest in innovation and disruption but how often do they innovate themselves I mean the venture capital industry is benefited greatly from technology and the Internet but their model hasn't changed at all so I see how the venture capital industry is going to get distant you know disintermediated decentralized disrupted and so I can sit around wait for some I can wait for someone to come along and disrupt us or you know we can choose to disrupt ourselves and cannibalize ourselves so my partner Bart Stevens after graduating from Princeton was at E Trade back in the mid 90s and running Corp Devon bizdev reported the CEO and you know the e trades got trades for the story of you know how the brokerage business in the 90s change is always a very interesting one to me because you had a dominant big brokerage firm called Charles Schwab and you know they saw these new emerging firms that were gonna you know lower the fees in a big way and they very smartly decided to cannibalize their entire business they put themselves out of business but as a result of having done that the way that they you know dance the you know through the innovators dilemma is there's they still exist today as a result of that and so I think I see how the venture capital industry is going to be disrupted by this technology and you know I'd rather do it to myself and didn't you see a lot of VCS have been calling you asking how they can do the same thing oh yeah yeah nope don't matter Kevin's pretty much been ringing off the hook by private equity people real estate funds anyone with a general lack of liquidity I mean I have so many people coming to me now saying can I do this in my industry and I think the answer is it's going to happen - this is not a Bitcoin or blockchain specific trend this is going to affect everyone the whole fun business anything where there's an illiquid asset and so it's starting naturally you know with the endemic sort of industry and it's gonna be a fund like ours but you know in a matter of I think six to twelve months you'll start to see other things we're on a Venn diagram you have overlap amongst these communities video game related stuff you know really advanced technologies intentional communities you'll start to see these waves but we're the beginning of what will be a trend that I think is going to disrupt all venture all private equity I think this is the beginning of a long story but ultimately one that you know ends in this business never look you know forever being changed and so both of you are pretty familiar now with the different regulations in terms of growth crowdfunding and then you know not wanting to run afoul of the different securities laws and things like that I see are there any particular ways in which you would like to see us regulations evolve so that they're clearer for entrepreneurs and developers and also that on the other side the investors in these different crypto assets you know I think more regulatory clarity I mean the JOBS Act obviously was a good step in the right direction and all of the crowdfunding companies are you know helping to make progress here you know unfortunately you know I mean most I SEOs today the advice I would give is to follow basically the model that we did which is unfortunate because it basically excludes most Americans now we're limited to 99 and they have to be accredited so that the the reality is the the American investor base is the one that is disadvantaged because of regulations that could probably be improved I mean I mean they always they can be improved and hopefully they do you know these are in most cases we thought you were talking about that 1940 act most of the laws were referring to were things to find you know nearly a hundred years ago so yes I think we could probably benefit from you know improved and more modern regulation and you know this is a process I'm pretty sure from the side of the regulator they think that they're protecting the investors because we certainly know that there are a few coins that have been launched that have been outright scams that the SEC has gone after and then there are others that fall kind of into more of a gray area so whether or not US investors aren't at its disadvantage probably depends on where you stand on this well so where can people learn more about you and your work and get in touch with you both well I you know got a blockchain dot capital or blockchain capital comm both of them will get you there and you can learn more about the firm and get in touch with us I'm pretty accessible everywhere I'm around the world pretty much constantly so
