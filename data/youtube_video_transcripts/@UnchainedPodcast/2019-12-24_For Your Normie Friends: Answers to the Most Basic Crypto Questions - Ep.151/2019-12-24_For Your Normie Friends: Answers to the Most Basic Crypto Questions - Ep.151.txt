could benefit from such an episode plus maybe it will take a load off your shoulders to refer people to it rather than trying to do the explaining yourself I solicited questions from my own real-life friends edited down the repeats and tried my best to make the explanations as simple as possible here we go first question from Kate what is Bitcoin a short three sentence answer also a ten paragraph answer here's my three sentence answer in Bitcoin is two things a payment network native to the Internet and a digital currency native to that Network anyone in the world's can either help run the network or see the transactions on it and anyone in the world can also create a Bitcoin wallet for themselves to send and receive the coins Bitcoin the currency has a fixed supply leading many to call it digital gold now for the second part of the question a ten paragraph version which I didn't actually count the paragraphs but this is somewhere in that ballpark and the reason bitcoin represents a breakthrough is that this is the first time it's been possible to send a digital object without simply sending a copy before if I sent you a text message or a photo or a word document I was always sending you a copy with Bitcoin I can now send you that Bitcoin and the whole world can be certain that now you have it and I don't by-the-way self-plagiarism disclosure I've used this explanation before what makes this possible imagine the world was a really small place the size of a village of 30 people then imagine that every time any of the 30 people in the village traded with each other the two people involved in the transaction simply shouted the details of the transaction to everyone else in the village and all 30 of us wrote down what happened and updated the ledger stating who owned how much that in a nutshell is how the Bitcoin software works but instead of people in a village shouting it uses computers running the Bitcoin software that are spread across the globe and instead of handwritten letters maintained by every villager there's a Bitcoin ledger what we now call the Bitcoin blockchain maintained by tens of thousands of computers around the world the Bitcoin blockchain is a record of every Bitcoin transaction going all the way back to the first one that occurred in January 2000 sorry 2009 which is when a couple of computers began running the Bitcoin software so if you in California want to send a Bitcoin to some one in Hong Kong you tell the network to send one Bitcoin to the Bitcoin address of your friend in Hong Kong and then this transaction is placed in a sort of queue this is the equivalent of you being the villager announcing this transaction to the other villagers maintaining their Ledger's the Bitcoin equivalent of the 30 villagers who update their Ledger's with your transaction are what we call miners miners are any computers that run the Bitcoin software and add transactions to the ledger however given that we're no longer in a village where everyone knows each other and has the incentive to keep the payment system of the village updated how do you incentivize anonymous miners around the world to do so here is where bitcoins genius comes in first the Bitcoin software doesn't let just anyone add new transactions to the network it poses a really hard math problem to all the miners who are interested in adding new transactions to the blockchain whichever computer is the first to find the answer to that math problem is the one that gets to add the most recent batch of transactions to the blockchain in order for any computer to win at any given time it has to spend a fair bit of computational energy in order to solve that math problem now here's the first bit of that Bitcoin genius when your computer spends that computational energy to try to solve the hard math problem posed by the Bitcoin software it makes it that much harder for a bad actor to commandeer the Bitcoin network to say create fraudulent transactions because in order for the fraudster to be the computer that adds the next batch of transactions to the ledger they would need to solve that math problem before you and anyone else trying to solve it and that means they would need to put in more computing power into Bitcoin so every single person who runs the Bitcoin software trying to add transactions to the ledger is also strengthening the network security since they're making it harder for anyone else to create counterfeit or fraudulent transactions you might be thinking why would anyone just out of the goodness of their heart want to make the Bitcoin network more secure they don't this is the second part of bitcoins genius each computer that solves the hard math problem and gets to add the new batch of transactions to the blockchain is rewarded with new bitcoins that the software mints roughly every time not roughly every time a new vlog of transactions gets added to the letter which is typically about every 10 minutes for about the first four years the Bitcoin software ran it dispensed 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes for approximately the second four years that got halved to 25 new bitcoins about every 10 minutes it's now dispensing 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes and in what is projected now to be May of 2020 that will dropped a 6.2 5 bitcoins every 10 minutes these decreases in the new supply of Bitcoin are probably one of the factors propelling the Bitcoin price north at the time of the first Bitcoin having a Bitcoin was worth about 12 dollars so miners were winning roughly $600 each time they mined a block at the time of the second Bitcoin having the price was roughly 650 dollars so each miner was winning about 16,000 dollars whenever they mined a block at the time of this recording Bitcoin is worth about $7,000 so each miner who mines a block earns about $90,000 clearly despite the fact that the software is minting fewer new bitcoins with each block miners are earning much much more than they wore years ago lowering the inflation rate of new bitcoins is one of many factors behind the increase in the Bitcoin price the supply of new bitcoins will continue to decrease in this fashion somewhat asymptotically approaching a supply of 21 million at a certain point the halving will make the fraction of new bitcoins being produced every 10 minutes small enough that essentially the supply of bitcoins will no longer increase at that point what will incentivize miners to keep running the network hopefully transaction fees that users pay when they send bitcoins on the network while there are some questions about whether this will be sufficient incentive not too many people are worried about it just yet since the year when the so called block reward the new bitcoins being minted by the software is no longer dispensed that's likely to be around the year 2140 when all of us listening to the show will be long gone by the way one last note I want to make here before we move on to the next question is that the example I gave of how a village could have a payment system in which each villager maintains a ledger is actually from history you can look up rise stones Rai from the Micronesian island of Yap so in a way you could say the concept of a blockchain or a decentralized ledger was first invented on the island of Yap next question my friend Jeff asks wTF is blockchain please explain like I'm the stupidest person you've ever met because I've had at least five people attempt to explain it to me and I still don't understand it at all so Jeff if you just were listening to the last question where I talked about the small village or Island where people shouted their transactions and everybody updated their Ledger's that's actually a really good way to think about blockchains another description that I like is one that I got from my friend William mu gr he likes this analogy he says and he's also an investor an author he says that blockchain technology is to individual Bank Ledger's what Google Spreadsheets are to Excel spreadsheets let's say you and your friends are taking a trip to Mexico and are keeping track of who owes money to whom back before Google Spreadsheets maybe each of you would track it on your own version of Microsoft Excel obviously I'm making this up because hopefully none of you are that nerdy anyway later if you were doing it this way through Microsoft Excel you'd all have to reconcile any discrepancies but now with Google Spreadsheets you and your friends can work from the same copy held in the cloud blockchains are similar but they're even better than Google Spreadsheets because every change to a blockchain is time-stamped and due to the security characteristics I mentioned earlier the likelihood of fraud is low plus blockchains have another feature that make it really hard to change or commit fraud and any transactions that are a few blocks back or older the term blockchain is what it sounds like a chain of blocks each block is a batch of transactions so how do the blocks get chained together this is yet another bit of the genius of Bitcoin every time a new block gets added the data in that block is given a sort of handle that makes it easy to identify the technical term for this is a hash and in some ways it functions like a name since there's a shorthand wait to refer to a much larger set of data but it's even more like your DNA in terms of how unique it is to that data set so if someone wanted to easily refer to you Jeff without needing you to be there fully in the flesh but in a way where they could be sure that it's uniquely you they might use your DNA similarly each time a blog gets added to the chain the DNA of the previous blocks is added as a piece of data this means that you have a snapshot of the whole entire history of the Bitcoin blockchain in every single new block what's really cool is that since this quote-unquote DNA the hash is based on math you can always use math to prove or disprove that each block is valid if someone were to try to go back and change a transaction three blocks back in the blockchain then the math connecting that block with the later two ones would no longer work last bit on this part about block chains earlier I spoke about how Google Spreadsheets are sort of like block chains and Microsoft Excel is similar to the ledgers that banks keep of their customers balances this is why it takes one to five business days for banks to move your money when you make a payment because the various bank letters have to be reconciled and that's because the banking system is not inherently digital it's the same system that's been in use for decades long before the internet and only in recent years have thanks put up websites and mobile apps that give it a digital veneer Bitcoin on the other hand has no legacy system it's native to the Internet it's made of software whose data is held in the cloud not on any single computer the other big difference you should note between Bitcoin and the legacy banking system is that like the Internet there's no one in charge just as there is no one company that manages the Internet there's no one company that manages Bitcoin it's a piece of Internet infrastructure and like and many companies are built on top but there's no CEO of the coin it's just a public technology that anyone can participate in or use this is leading to an interest in so-called decentralized techno geez hacks of centralized entities like Equifax or the misuse of data by the lakes of Facebook have woken many people to the risks of having a single company be in charge of the data of hundreds or millions hundreds of millions or billions of people that's why there is a lot of interest in remaking many of the major centralized web services today as decentralized versions that have tokens at the center incentivizing entities around the world to offer the services that these centralized companies provide us today question from Margaret do people collect bitcoins with the story in history like did anyone get any of Ross Ulbricht bitcoins and keep them as collectibles this is an interesting question for a number of reasons first of all bitcoins are divisible to eight decimal places point zero zero zero zero zero zero one Bitcoin equals one Satoshi which is named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin this means that the coins that Ross Ulbricht owned at any given point in time could now has splintered into many fractions and then they could have been recombined with other fractions of coins when they were used again that however doesn't mean that it's impossible to do what you described because Bitcoin transactions are shared on a public ledger it is theoretically possible to trace the history of Bitcoin transactions I say theoretically however because there are also a lot of technologies that make that harder a lot of people don't want all their transactions to be public and that's what would happen to you if say your wallet address became publicly known people would then be able to easily see what other addresses you transact with and in what amounts this has led to a rise in services called mixers and tumblers which take a bunch of transactions from a bunch of different people mix them all together and spit them out in a way that makes it extremely difficult to trace where the funds are going for this reason it might be pretty hard to find any coins that are still easily traced back to Ross Ulbricht possession however your next question leads me to a related question by my friend Eddie what are the other uses other than currency for blotching technology so as Margaret asked about with a blockchain it's pretty easy to see the origin of something and trace all the transactions in its history this has led a lot of companies to be excited about using watching technology to track the provenance of something such as Fairtrade coffee or to prove for instance that a diamond you're buying is not a Blood Diamond it's also led to an interest in other kinds of financial goods that aren't currency which includes everything from shares and companies to video game goods prior to the existence of blockchains if you earned say a sword in a computer game the tracking of whether or not you owned that sword depended on the game manufacturer recognizing that you'd earned it and kept possession of it and crediting you with that ownership of it with blockchains you can own a video game goods such as a wand and your ownership of it can be proved publicly on blockchain without requiring a company to vouch for you it can also be traded on a marketplace where the price isn't set by the game manufacturer but instead by whatever the demand is for your wand there are many other applications for blockchain technology particularly around financial things both objects of value as well as behaviour and activities and that leads to the next question this is also from Eddie I've heard of a theorem in Bitcoin what's the difference as I mentioned Bitcoin the network is a payment system in Bitcoin the coin is the currency native to that payment system Bitcoin has a fairly narrow purpose it basically does that one thing many people liken it to how email is the first major application of the Internet cerium is a network that enables many of these other applications of blockchain technology that I named before video game goods or shares and companies and some different financial behaviors and activities for example theoretically you could use aetherium to set up an escrow service for home purchases right now there are people and companies who offer such services to ensure that a purchaser doesn't make off with a house without paying for it and that a home seller doesn't take the buyers money but keep the deed but with aetherium you could do that with a software program the software could take the money from the buyer and then take the deed to the house from the seller and swap them simultaneously you could extend this functionality out to a lot of other financial services replacing financial middlemen with software programs at the time that the creator of the theorem Vitalik deuteron had the idea of her aetherium a lot of different developers were trying to use flashing technologies for some of these other purposes however what he noticed is that what they were each trying to build a blockchain for each specific purpose sort of the way bitcoin is dedicated to payments it would be like if you had to plug one hardware device into your computer to use Chrome another one to use Excel and yet another one to use Photoshop the Telex idea was to create a blockchain system that had the flexibility to enable any kind of decentralized application be built on top of it the way our computers today can enable any kind of application that's why you may have heard people call aetherium a world computer it's a computer in the sense that it can power a variety of applications but it's a world computer because as I described in my Google spreadsheet example the things built on it would be decentralized they would be open to anyone just as the Internet and email are open to anyone to use today and indeed since its launch in 2015 a theorem has become a platform for a huge number of decentralized applications or DAPs decentralized software programs that were created by a group of developers exist as autonomous code and don't have a company at the center acting as a gatekeeper or holding onto anyone's data in a moment I'll explain why you've probably heard about environmental concerns regarding cryptocurrency but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of government and

stellar listing event on January 15 20 29 on the exchange now and stay tuned for more listings back to my explanations of crypto for my Normie friends question from Jennifer I've heard crypto or is it blockchain takes an enormous amount of energy and there are these massive computer facilities somewhere cold powering them WTF exactly are people talking about what you're talking about here is the competition the miners engage in to try to solve the hard math problem to win the new bitcoins being minted by the software that is called proof of work or a proof of work consensus algorithm that's how the Bitcoin blockchain and many other block chains ensure that the most commonly held version of the ledger is the one regarded as the single golden copy of the truth it also as I mentioned before secures the network against people trying to commit fraudulent or counterfeit transactions because so many more computers run the Bitcoin software than did in the past there is a lot more competition to win those new bitcoins and that means the math problem has gotten a lot harder bitcoins so-called difficulty algorithm resets periodically based on how much computing power is on the network and it its goal is to keep the interval between each block to roughly 10 minutes if it weren't for the difficulty algorithm blocks that would have taken ten minutes to mine in the early days of Bitcoin would now take a lot less less than a second in fact as of the time of this recording the difficulty is thirteen trillion times greater than it was when the software was first run in January 2009 that means if it weren't for the difficulty algorithm we need to be getting a new block every 10 minutes divided by 13 trillion or what apparently is every 46 Pico seconds all of which is to say that the math problem is way harder than it used to be so it takes a lot more computer power and electricity to find the new block and win the bitcoins that come with it that's why you can no longer just hook up your laptop and run the Bitcoin software and hope to win new bitcoins my knee has become professionalized and miners typically now run computers with chips that have been designed to do just one thing and do it incredibly well solve the math problem that wins them new bitcoins since solving the math problem takes a lot of energy it generates quite a bit of heat when it's running and so that's why a lot of mining equipment is placed in cold areas and also near cheap and renewable energy another question from Margaret is there a way to reduce the carbon footprint of blockchain yes there are other algorithms that are being used that are less electricity intensive the main one is something called proof of stake and variations thereof before I explain how proof of stake works let me just mention one last thing about proof of work which is that over time a Bitcoin winner will win a number of bitcoins proportional to the amount of computing power they have on the network so if you have one percent of all the computing power on the Bitcoin network then over time you will eventually mine one percent of all blocks and therefore win one percent of all the new bitcoins being minted proof of stake uses a similar concept but instead the percentage of blocks you mine is based on what percentage of coins you have staked or have locked up in a deposit locking up your coins in this way it turns you into a miner in the proof of stake system and since people in crypto don't like making things easy miners improve state systems are called validators although not always sometimes they're also called Baker's but let's not get into them anyway however while the terminology is different the concept is similar if you have one percent of all stinked coins then over time you will validate one percent of all blocks and earn one percent of all new ether being minted by the system in a proof-of-work based system to try to create counterfeit or fraudulent transaction you'd have to amass 51% or more of the computer power to force the majority of Ledger's to the version of the chain that you want in a proof of state system you'd have to amass 50 more than 51% of the coins but then if you actually did attack the system the price of your coins would likely fall so someone with that amount of coins would probably not be financially incentivized to carry out such an attack next question from Kate how did Bitcoin get started for years there had been a number of efforts to create digital currency the only thing is that all the previous efforts had various pitfalls with money with one of the main ones being centralization for instance if a company with a headquarters and nameable officers had created a digital currency then that meant that a government somewhere could put a stop to them as I mentioned however bitcoin is decentralized the Creator is unknown but went by the name went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto he she or they email the Bitcoin white paper to an email list known as the cyberpunk mailing list and that was popular with cryptographers and other people working on digital currency another developer on that mailing list named Hal Finney liked the proposal and urged Satoshi to code it up Satoshi mined the first block on January 3rd 2009 and how also began mining about a week later in August 2010 a vulnerability in the code allowed someone to create 184 billion bitcoins but that has been the only exploit in bitcoins history and it was patched up next question from Cain why would one use Bitcoin versus regular currency what are the advantages and risks this is a hard question for people in the US and other places with well-functioning financial services to understand so let me tell you the story of one of the most successful Bitcoin entrepreneurs when says casares the CEO of Zappo who grew up in Argentina he was born into a family of sheep ranchers in Patagonia Argentina a country with a long history of periods of hyperinflation going up he watched his family lose everything three times due to government and bank interventions one story he tells is of how his mom took him and his sister out of school one morning she was a government receptionist in that day she was carrying two plastic bags full of cash it was her paycheck she took the kids to the grocery store and gave each child a list of things to get then they met at the cashier and each time they paid if there was any money left over she would send the kids back to get even more stuff when sits his sister asked why they weren't saving any of the money to spend tomorrow and his mom answered because tomorrow it won't be worth as much this was also during the days when each items price was displayed on a sticker on the item itself because the value of the Argentine peso was depreciating so rapidly once this would also see grocery store clerks going up and down the aisles changing the prices so when says his mom instructed her kids to run ahead of that person and grab the items before that clerk had placed a higher price on them so a lot of people who live in places undergoing hyperinflation see the benefits of bitcoins monetary policy and believe that over the long run it should act as a strong store of value even for people living in the US and other more economically stable countries inflation is constantly eroding the value of our currency for instance a dollar in 1970 is now worth about 15 cents today or in order to purchase one dollar of goods in 1970 that would take six dollars and 63 cents today but this explanation answers why people might prefer to store their money in Bitcoin or why people like bitcoins monetary policy but that doesn't really answer why people would use it in commerce and to be sure because of the coins volatility you have to be in a country with incredibly bad hyperinflation to make saving and Bitcoin worth it you have to not need the money on a regular basis since the price of Bitcoin is so volatile that after you the value of your bitcoins could drop precipitously for instance the price of Bitcoin is currently down from its high in late 2017 or early 2018 which is when a lot of people were buying Bitcoin for the very first time so let's talk about why people would use Bitcoin or cryptocurrency for commerce one reason is that cryptocurrency fees are generally cheaper than the fees charged for credit card transactions however as I'm sure you're well aware the merchant pays those fees not the end consumer so the merchant might be motivated to use Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency but customers might not be so some merchants might incentivize payments via Bitcoin or cryptocurrency by offering something like a one or two percent discount on purchases I know I know this didn't seem super compelling to me either when I first began reporting on Bitcoin but hey Apple card gives 2% cash back when you use Apple pay so this is a thing again I'm sure these arguments aren't super compelling to people living in well-functioning economies however they are appealing to people in countries with a large population that's unbanked but has mobile phones and that describes some countries in Asia and Africa their cryptocurrency is a viable option for people who want to for instance buy something via their mobile device but who don't have credit cards then there's the last group for whom cryptocurrency solves a real need that is people who have concerns about being surveilled through their financial activity as you may have heard during the protest in Hong Kong many protesters have been lining up at kiosks and train stations to buy their subway tickets with cash rather than simply swiping their Octopus cards which could reveal their location and the route they took on the days of protests and be traced back to them while cryptocurrency hasn't take off in any major way in Hong Kong yet I did interview the administrator of HK map live a frequently updated map of the protests around the city he said he's been accepting donations via cryptocurrency and he uses that to pay for the hosting and other operations of the website so is not to risk the site getting shut down however people should be aware that Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies do not provide true anonymity if you're not careful with how you transact with some sleuthing others could potentially figure out how if you were involved in a particular transaction famously this is how the creator of the Silk Road got caught however Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies actions are at least pseudonymous which provides some greater anonymity than transacting through the banking system for those seeking true privacy there are so called privacy coins some of which try to anonymize transactions by default and others of which offer privacy as an option for any particular transaction the other group for whom using cryptocurrency is appealing are those who are trying to circumvent so-called capital controls some countries such as China restrict the amount of cash their citizens can send out of the country for instance some reports from a few years ago attributed the popularity of Bitcoin in China to the trend of using it to bypass the 50 thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that could be sent abroad in general circumventing the law is a big use case for cryptocurrencies for instance North Korea is interested in cryptocurrency and has been engaging in all manner of hacks malware and ransomware to obtain it they're motivated because sanctions are depriving the dictatorship of cash and so obtaining cryptocurrency enables them to get money outside the normal banking system another example as you're probably well aware the first time Bitcoin gained any transaction was with the Silk Road the first online underground drug marketplace Silk Road was not able to exist before Bitcoin because drug sellers couldn't really easily accept credit cards or PayPal still to this day dark web market marketplaces flourish enabled by cryptocurrency before we move on the last part of your question asked about the advantages and risks one key difference between the way cryptocurrency works versus our banking system is that once a transaction is made it cannot be reversed there is no equivalent of a chargeback there is no bank of Bitcoin to call to say hey this is a fraudulent charge please reverse it this is why if there's a hack of a cryptocurrency exchange it is such a disaster because that exchange cannot simply make everyone whole again the risks of trusting an exchange to keep your coin safe for you are high and that's why you'll often hear the phrase not your keys not your Bitcoin or not your keys not your crypto what that means is if you're not in charge of the private keys that manage your own crypto then you're trusting someone else and if they get hacked too bad for you however the alternative isn't necessarily better if you decide not to entrust in exchange with your coins because you're nervous about it getting hacked that no means you are responsible for not losing your coins or not getting hacked fished or otherwise outwitted by a hacker and for a lot of people especially those who aren't that comfortable with the technology coming up with a bulletproof method for securing your own coins can be a big ask so last way I want to answer this question that you asked about why people would use Bitcoin or cryptocurrency over regular currency I actually want to rephrase the question slightly and explain why Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are technologically superior over other forms of money Bitcoin is objectively superior to any previous form of money whether paper money coins gold or seashells it's more fungible than paper money which has been stomped on gone through the wash or bares traces of cocaine it's more divisible as I mentioned divisible out to eight decimal points ether is divisible out to 18 decimal points obviously this level of divisibility is impossible with dollar bills let alone copper pennies is more portable than cash giving someone 1 million dollars in Bitcoin is no more cumbersome than picking up your phone and by that I don't mean a calling your bank and having them do it for you what I mean is that with just a few taps on your smart phone you could give someone a million dollars in Bitcoin and that's without having the stuff a bunch of briefcases also Bitcoin is practically impossible to counterfeit the reason the creation of Bitcoin was so significant is that as I mentioned earlier for the first time in history unique digital assets not copies were created finally Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are programmable money they can be programmed to execute functions when certain conditions are met try that with gold Benjamin or seashells next question from Kate how do you use it there are many ways you could use Bitcoin as mentioned people can mine it though nowadays for everyday people the best way to mine is probably by joining a mining pool where you band together with others and pay for a portion of a mining operation and then are paid proportionally based on your share of what the mining pool earns you can also earn Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through some apps like earn calm or lollies or folds and of course you can buy it outright on an exchange like coinbase kraken which disclosure is a sponsor bitstamp or gemini and then you could just trade it or hold it if you expect that it will appreciate in value you can also buy it directly from another individual via a service like local bitcoins which connects buyers and sellers peer-to-peer style if you already own Bitcoin or cryptocurrency you should decide if you want to trust a company to keep your coins safe for you or if you want to safeguard them yourself if so you'll have to create a custodial wallet which you can do online at a place like blockchain comm or with a special device dedicated at keeping your coin safe such as ledger or treasure you can even create what is called a paper wallet I'm not gonna go into all the ways to manage a custodial wallet but the main thing to note here is that there is quite a lot of Bitcoin lore around people who threw out hard drives or computers that contain a lot of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency and later realized they had tossed millions of dollars worth so if you go this round make sure you know what you're doing and have backup plans that don't also make you vulnerable to hackers finally once you figure out how to store it you can spend your cryptocurrency or pay friends with it a number of stores such as overstock Microsoft cheap air and others accept cryptocurrency and you can also spend cryptocurrency other major retailers such as Barnes & Noble Bed Bath & Beyond Whole Foods and Nordstrom if you get really sophisticated there's quite a bit more you can do especially with ether but that gets into much riskier and more experimental territory so you can try these things after you graduate from being an or me and have fallen down the crypto rabbit hole next question also from Kate what are the costs fees and exchange rates I hesitated to name the price of Bitcoin because the information will be outdated pretty quickly but just to give you an idea of how volatile it is the current price of Bitcoin is about seven thousand dollars and a year ago it was at about $3,800 two years ago it was at about sixteen thousand dollars three years ago it was at about eight hundred dollars and four years ago it was at $400 as for fees that will depend on where you buy it but it's usually a low percentage of the transaction from Jennifer should I be buying crypto or is it a bunch of BS whether or not you buy any substantial amount of crypto is up to you and depends on many factors including your own personal financial situation but I will say that you should at least learn more about it and one way to do that is to buy ten dollars worth of it and learn how to set up and manage a custodial wallet then send some to a friend or to yourself at a different wallet for me even after all these years I feel a thrill when my coins show up in a different wallet within minutes or seconds it feels so magical compared to the days that the banking system takes tom how do I pick a crypto to invest in if you want to buy to invest you should learn more about the coins and see if you think it's worth purchasing or investing for any reason if you're not sure where to start your research I'd start by learn Bitcoin and then aetherium simply because they're the most established and also have the most amount of information about them no matter what don't invest more than you can afford to lose as you would do with any speculative investment next question from Vanessa how do you dip in a toe as you would buying index stocks on TD Ameritrade or something simple like that at the moment there probably aren't enough coins worthy of investment for there to be an equivalent of an index fund of crypto there are however ways to speculate on the sector without investigating each and every coin circle invest allows you to buy collections of coins such as those focused on privacy or payments bit wise investments offers the bitwise 10 but that's only available to accredited investors who have a net worth of greater than 1 million dollars or who have an annual income of $200,000 or more for the last two years or three hundred thousand dollars for joint income a number of companies are aiming to deliver a Bitcoin ETF but the Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet approved one until then you can get exposure to Bitcoin in your retirement account via GBD see the gray scaled bitcoin trust but that trades at a premium compared to the price of Bitcoin since more people want exposure to Bitcoin in their retirement accounts then there is supply there are also blockchain ETFs that claim to give exposure to the sector but first many of these companies only give oblique exposure to the crypto sector and second be aware that company sometimes puff up their blockchain bonafides because the positive press that generates for them but they're not necessarily working on anything substantive and that's it for the questions I
