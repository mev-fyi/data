thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap michael saylor is no longer microstrategy ceo bitcoin maximalist michael saylor stepped down as microstrategy's ceo after leading the company for over three decades the news was dropped last tuesday as the company released its q2 earnings report at that time microstrategy reported a 918 million unrealized loss in q2 from its bitcoin holdings the firm holds 129 699 btc which were bought at an average price of 30 664 mr sailor will be serving as executive chairman and will be replaced by fong li the previous president of the company it looks like sailor wants to go full time on bitcoin as executive chairman i will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives while fong will be empowered as ceo to manage overall corporate operations said sailor even though some people were concerned that microstrategy would dump its btc when sailor was no longer ceo it seems that's hardly the case since sailor has 68 voting ownership and his bitcoin conviction remains unchanged it appears that the market took sailor's resignation as positive news microstrategy stock has risen almost 15 percent since since the time of the announcement followed by an increase in btc and crypto prices in general the solana ecosystem suffered another hack aside from the nomad exploit discussed earlier in the show there was another important attack within the solana ecosystem which affected more than ten thousand users and drained more than six million dollars worth of crypto tokens thursday morning users in solana started to report that their accounts were being drained with their balances going to zero the funds from these wallets were being sent to four different accounts allegedly ones belonging to the hackers the vulnerability appears to have been in slope a mobile wallet application after an investigation by developers ecosystem teams and security auditors it appears affected addresses were at one point created imported or used in slope tweeted the solana status account adding private key information was inadvertently transmitted to an application monitoring service there is no evidence the solana protocol or its cryptography was compromised the incident prompted criticism of solana all the problems with tara one and solana should really be a wake-up call defy has drifted away from cypherpunk principles everyone is just trying to get rich fast with no conscience unpublished code security by obscurity centralized interventions to prop up bad designs etc wrote gabrielle shapiro of delphi digital slope has also launched a bounty program to recuperate the stolen assets they asked the hackers to return 90 of the funds after stating that the team was working with blockchain analytics firm trm and law enforcement it continued upon the receipts of these funds we will not make additional efforts to investigate this matter or pursue any legal action institutions are coming will this be good or bad news for crypto coinbase the largest crypto exchange in the united states had two big announcements this week first it is now offering ethereum's taking to institutional investors in the us through coinbase prime the firm's institution-focused arm using our industry-leading cold storage clients can now generate yield by sticking eath said aaron schnark vice president of product whether this is good or bad for eth is an open question on the one hand there's a threat that ethereum becomes more centralized as coinbase will act as a custodian for all these institutions this means that it will own the private keys to all the state tokens after seeing the ripple effects that could arise from centralized companies not being responsible enough with other people's holdings it shouldn't come as a surprise that there are some concerns about coinbase owning such a large amount of assets the second announcement could have an even larger impact blackrock will begin offering crypto investments to its institutional clients through coinbase prime blackrock is the world's largest asset manager with 10 trillion dollars in assets under management and this marks its first move into crypto clients of blackrock's investment platform aladdin will have direct access to crypto after the news broke coinbase stock rose as much as 35 percent and trading had to be temporarily halted coin stock is now trading at around 100 accounting for a 20 increase since the announcement as was the case with eth staking through coinbase whether blackrock's move is beneficial for crypto is a matter of debate coinbase is obviously one of the biggest winners in addition it could potentially be positive for crypto investors as it creates a path for big money to enter crypto which could push up prices based on arcs simulated portfolios institutional allocations between 2.5 percent and 6.5 percent could impact bitcoin's price by two hundred thousand dollars and five hundred thousand dollars respectively however the centralization issue arises again soon blackrock will control crypto just like they already control the stock market said someone on twitter considering the fact that blackrock manages 10 trillion dollars in assets under management the danger is that it becomes a major holder of btc and other crypto assets making them much more centralized which is not the cypherpunk way tornado cash addresses sanctioned by ofac the u.s treasury department's office of foreign assets control or ofac decided to sanction virtual currency mixer tornado cash for being used to launder more than 7 billion dollars worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019. in addition the us treasury claims that tornado cash has been used by north korean group lazarus which has been behind many of the latest crypto hacks including the 600 million ronin exploit the addresses of tornado cash were added to a blacklist by ofac as a consequence all americans are now prohibited from interacting with tornado cash or any of the addresses on the blacklist coin center released a statement saying today's action does not seem so much a sanction against a person or entity with agency it appears instead to be the sanctioning of a tool that is neutral in character and that can be put to good or bad uses like any other technology in other regulatory news last wednesday a bipartisan bill was introduced by the senate agricultural committee with the intention to make the cftc the primary regulator of the cryptocurrency industry the digital commodities consumer protection act of 2022 would grant the cftc exclusive jurisdiction over crypto importantly it would consider some cryptos like btc and eth as commodities not securities which would put an end to a long debate on that topic there were other enforcement actions this week forced founders were charged for an alleged 300 million pyramid and ponzi scheme by the securities and exchange commission and they allege that it had been running for more than two years rounding out regulation news new york regulators find robin hood's crypto division with a 30 million penalty for
