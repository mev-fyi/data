we met Alameda first before they started FTX sometime in 2018 late 2018 or early 2019 and I actually distinctly remember talking to them about accounting systems and this is you know before FTX existed so this is just for alameda's accounting systems and you know what they were saying is that yeah you know at the end of the day you know we do our best to try and reconcile we spend you know some time half an hour a couple hours I forget exactly how much time they said but they spent some amount of time at the end of every day to try and reconcile the records but then they're like you know at the end of the day sometimes you know you just can't get to uh the right number and you know if it's plus or minus 10 grand 100 Grand which back in the day was a lot of money right you know they said well you know let's move on to the next day right so I think you know you know looking back there were so many different signs like that that I think in retrospect were sort of clear warning signs and signals for the risks that were to come
