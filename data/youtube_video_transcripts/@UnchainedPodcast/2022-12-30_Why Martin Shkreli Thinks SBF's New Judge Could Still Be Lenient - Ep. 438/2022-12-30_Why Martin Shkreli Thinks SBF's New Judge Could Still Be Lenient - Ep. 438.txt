Collar criminal welcome Martin Hi how are you doing well the interview we did last week was my most covered interview ever I believe with everyone from Business Insider to TMZ to the Daily Mail writing about it and best of all it got an endorsement on Tyler Cowan's blog marginal Revolution which was quite the compliment but that is not why I've invited you straight back to the show there have been a number of developments since we published our conversation first Sam was released on bail the consensus is that Sam likely negotiated bail as a part of his extradition and although there was this big headline number of 250 million no money actually changed hands his parents put up their home as collateral it's worth about four million dollars two other Unknown People also signed documents agreeing to pay 250 million dollars of Sam fleas and let's talk a little bit about the conditions of his bill or or just this agreement in general you know he had to surrender his travel documents stay at his parents house agreed to not open new lines of credit or start another business and not enter into Financial transactions of more than a thousand dollars he also agreed to be monitored electronically so I wondered if you had any commentary on what happened here with the bail well um obviously I think you know the the sdny wanted some kind of win uh where they could say that you know there was this quarter you know billion dollar bill I remember when Raj was rottenham put up 100 million in a secured bond which I believe was the prior record but he had 100 million dollars and then I put up five now invariably when you end up losing your case and the Miracle chance that you win that that bail money becomes part of the government's uh you know what they sort of take from you in terms of restitution or forfeiture or something like that so it's sort of one of the things I think most people don't know is that when you do get released on bond you do a interview at the probation office and you have to sort of do a financial form where you disclose I mean I I recently did one myself it's 30 pages of virtually anything you own including even the most the smallest minutia they ask for jewelry I mean they make you itemize every single thing so Sam would be committing a crime theoretically if he misled on that financial affidavit statement um so I think he's probably telling the truth we can never tell uh with with respect to sort of his his current sort of situation and assets and things like that of course if you're a conspiracy theorist and I've heard for many people who believe that oh no he's got some cold wallet you know some storage so forth and obviously I don't think you would write you know cold wallet 200 million you know when you itemize your your list but I think you know so so he's certainly um telling the courts officially what he's told everybody in public which is he's he's sort of uh on his last funds and he's in trouble financially which I think is is somewhat reassuring to a lot of people I think that you know it's okay to fail it's even well it's not okay maybe but to some people they may be able to stomach the idea of FDX failing including with their money if the founder isn't sitting there with you know a big pile of money so I think there's something commendable to some extent about that that he sort of said listen I'm you you know this has hurt me too I'm not sitting here gloating because there are people when on Wall Street or other places when you have a golden parachute the company's failing and you still make you know 50 million 100 we 100 million dollars we hear both the stories all the time I remember the old Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler was uh fired in essence but he was fired with a 50 million dollar paycheck you know which is a great way to be fired if you have to be fired so Sam of course you know is getting the obvious you know treatment the public shame the Specter of a felony and a conviction and he's penniless so or close to it so I think that you know that's that's quite a lot you know and and I think that the fact that he's willing to tell the government that as well I think he is probably telling the truth so ultimately the bond itself with respect to his house arrest which seems like he's going to be on some form of house arrest I'd be really curious you know I have a friend uh Anna Delphi who has a very weird uh condition where she not only is on house arrest but she also can't post on social media which is very you know kind of unique condition and they can kind of impose whatever condition they want right and I think that it sort of depends and then you also be very careful when you're on bond because Bond can be revoked depending on what you say or do so I think we're not going to hear a lot from Sam and he's going to just kind of you know he's now realized how real a criminal prosecution you know is how it feels like what it looks like and he's probably finally listening to a lawyer that's telling him not to talk anymore and he's probably realizing gee yeah I should probably probably listen to somebody like that so I think his confinement and his bail conditions seem again I think it was very pretty generous that the prior judge gave everyone bail there are other judges in that building that wouldn't have done that I think um he is a first time offender he is a white collar criminal there doesn't seem to be too much danger to the community but Flight Risk does you know again you know the judge made uh her decision and now we have a new judge so I think um you know as you said it might have been negotiated but regardless you know with the State of Affairs are what they are and it'll be interesting to see how this new judge will will sort of um treat Sam and why do you think that there were no restrictions put on his internet or social media although I guess it's probably been quite beneficial to the government uh when he's been on the internet let's not restrict him right uh that's what the government's thinking I think that um it's it's rare I in my experience to do that I think the times I've seen that are people who are really dangerous on the internet whether they're computer hackers or their sex offenders uh dealing in child pornography that's the kind of person that a government really says don't touch a computer or if you're going to touch a computer we want to know exactly what URLs are going to and things like that I think for Sam the presumption of innocence which is really important I can never understate this enough everyone's rushing to this conclusion he's guilty it's over Etc I would admit that it looks bleak I I said the other day that you know one of my attorneys uh famously defended Puff Daddy where that situation looked worse than this uh it was so Bleak there were hundreds of witnesses there were uh tons of ways for him to be convicted and he was acquitted so you know never say never and always remember that it's woven into our constitution this presumption of innocent and again I from my vantage point it doesn't seem like Sam is Innocent but at the same time what do I know I don't know and neither does anybody have Discovery they don't have anything that could easily be exculpatory you Sam could have written in a diary to himself you know about all about this stuff months ago and that would be exculpatory evidence if it said things like you know I really want to make sure everybody wins here I'm not trying to take any money I don't need any money like all that effective altruism stuff if he actually wrote some of that down somewhere to in private messages to people he could show that to a jury and say listen I'm not a bad guy yes I'm a bonehead I messed up my business but I'm not a criminal and there are ways to also discredit the testimony of the Cooperators for example for Carolyn I don't see how that how she's even a witness to be honest I think it's very easy to discredit her as uh quite frankly possibly a jilted lover and this is not uncommon in Criminal Court we're that kind of sort of shoving aside of the evidence and say listen you can't believe a word she says you've ever been in a relationship that went sour this is one of those and you can't listen to that I I could see a jury buying that that makes sense to to again you have to put yourself in the shoes of 12 Ordinary People and a little he said she said is something that you know I think the average person says I don't know if I'm ready to to buy that hook line on Sinker so the government's going to need every witness they can get and I talked to a source in criminal defense World who's speculating that uh there are other players in FTX that met with government before her Carolyn and that there possibly could be um Lee deals that were reached uh beforehand and that the first prize plea deal gets no prosecution the second price plea deal gets limited prosecution now the third well prize Well there is no third prize third prize would be life in prison possibly so but we should talk about Judge Kaplan who is kind of like a new face in this you know really interesting yo that was my next question because we went deep into the analysis on Judge Ronnie Abrams and of course then Friday night she accused recused herself because her husband's Law Firm had actually worked with FTX so what's your take on how lenient or restrict judge Kaplan could be if he ends up sentencing Sam bakeman freed yeah I think he's sorry about adjusting my camera there I think he's pretty good pick you know I think positive for Sam you mean or what what does that mean yeah good for Sam yes uh I'm looking from from his perspective so I think you're happy with with Kaplan you could have gotten presca you could have gotten somebody that is known to throw people under the jail and bury them and never to be heard from again you know so Kaplan is the only judge that I'm aware of and I've crossed a lot of judges in my time both good and bad fair not fair uh civil and criminal I've had dozens of civil cases of Federal Trade Commission the SEC different lawsuits uh initiating and receiving so you get to meet these judges and Kaplan is the only judge that I know that was not a prosecutor uh before so Kaplan went to law school clerked for a judge and then went straight to Private Practice he worked at venerable firm Paul Weiss he was actually a defender of tobacco companies which was you know uh interesting this was a time when you know tobacco was really seen as as I don't know what they're seeing us now but really really seen as a Scourge and an evil and major major um victories were won over tobacco companies and multi-district litigation and torque claims and stuff like that so I think that Kaplan then becoming federal judge is again very unusual you know almost every judge I've ever come across and I've had a hard time finding one that wasn't a prosecutor so I think Kaplan can see things from both perspectives he is a very ill-tempered man but everyone says about him is the saying which is if you make a mistake in his courtroom he's going to take you to task he's not very forgiving he doesn't suffer fools he's not very patient that probably is an okay thing for Sam you know his lawyers are to be pretty good they're going to probably not take off the judge they're going to understand that they're they're going to be creatures in the courtroom that know exactly how to make sure that judge is happy so I think that's going to kind of be in slight Edge for Sam I think sometimes you'll see government prosecutor teams be relatively young relatively inexperienced the average prosecutor I would say is around 30 years old they've been out of college for five maybe out of law school of course for about five or ten years if that and you know they can make mistakes and judge Kaplan is known to give it to both sides on sentencing despite this really ill temper he's actually pretty good he's not as good as Old Judge uh judge Abrams but I would say if Sam had an eight of a on a scale 110 before he now has a seven which isn't so bad I think he'd prefer Abrams but I think uh Kaplan is is pretty good and I pulled up a couple of cases uh interestingly kaplan's been around the block on on blockchain as many federal judges have and you know some of these uh cases are uh analogous there's obviously no Perfect Analogy at FTX it's a really really unique story there's you're never going to find a case that's perfect but you do have to remember judges aren't like us fixated on crypto and Bitcoin and all this this ecosystem they don't know much about it they don't care much about it they see shootings they see drug trafficking they see Visa fraud they see hacking they see all kinds of things and so for Kaplan you're talking about a 78 year old man who's a senior judge he senior judges have half the workload of regular judges and if you want to put a conspiracy hat on which I I strongly advise against but seems like the internet's so full of conspiracy theories these days one of the conspiracy hats is there are what 46 judges I think in the southern district and he picked he got a senior judge which is you have half the likelihood of getting because they take half the workload so he had about a one percent chance of getting this judge and you could say that about the other judges you have about two percent chance of getting all of them other than the senior judges but he got a fairly good one there are softer judges uh in the district like rakeoff but in general he he's two picks and he's gotten two quite soft judges again I personally don't think there's anything to it it's just lock of the draw I happen to get a very mean job out of my cases so you know you wonder sometimes uh if if there's you know this random poll that's not audited it's not on a blockchain uh it's this randomly drawn uh judge system and nobody gets to see uh proof of Randomness there but there's no verifiable delayed function or something like that it's not on uh Solana but um you get this judge and then now he's got to sort of go through all these motions he gets Discovery he gets exculpatory material he gets to start making motions uh to exclude evidence or to include evidence or what have you the government gets to and see them back and we're going to get to see Sam most likely come to New York for the hearings the judge can waive that but we're going to start to see in my opinion you can you can kind of get a sense for even in these very preliminary hearings what judge is thinking in my case my judge this is many months before trial she raised her eyebrows and she said it's interesting you know in most of the fraud cases I see I don't I see lavish life I see money spent on cars and private jets and homes and Martin didn't do any of that and I was like this is good you know I love this stick in uh and of course it came up many months from now so we're going to see things now with Sam that are going to be key pieces over the next year uh it'll be a year at least before trial in my estimation we could be looking at a 2024 trial you know could even be later in 2024 like in the middle or the second half that would be quite a long wait but I do think this is going to be you know an interesting case if Sam doesn't plea and we're going to see some of those tea leaves come out really quickly we're going to see judge kaplan's emotional reaction to certain things even a furrowing of a brow or a racing of an eyebrow or say explain that to me more counselor you know those little things can really tip off the way that that judge Kaplan is thinking about and looking about this case as I said he's not made naive to bitcoin um there are other people that are and we had to get their first sense of well what is this stuff you know and kaplan's seen Bitcoin before so that could color him quite a bit um he's been pretty gentle on sentencing there's really I think probably the best analogy you can get on these cases there's two that I thought were really good so there's someone named trending Shavers who Kaplan sentenced he sends them to uh 18 months there's actually a better case uh Jeremy Spence who was sentenced to um about 48 months I want to say he was 25 year old kid he did a classic Ponzi scheme he raised rum three four million dollars and he basically just you know did a classic Ponzi 42 months not bad at all could have been a lot more and it's crypto related this is a much much bigger scheme but in many ways this is a business failure as much as it is a crime and even if one could color it as a crime which certainly it's that's the attempt being made to hear and it sticks you still can sort of say look judge I messed up this is a business and I yeah I used the wrong money but I didn't use it for me I didn't like go sock this money away I didn't have cyan tour I wasn't clearly like planning on this I was just trying to build a successful company and made a bunch of dumb Investments all the money's gone I  up but you know am I a criminal and I think if you look at that story versus this Rhode Island guy who more or less sounds like he had Criminal Intent to begin with you know they're not that crazy apart obviously the size of the money is so much more and the impact to the victims is so much more but the fact that Captain looked at this guy and said yeah 42 months is about right when you could argue I uh theoretically committed a similar crime and got 84 months from also a theoretically very nice judge I think that Kaplan is lack of being a prosecutor is he's an older guy Sometimes some people think that that creates a little bit of leniency he if Sam behaves himself throughout this trial and puts on the respectable case I think he could be looking at a potentially 20 or less possibly kind of that ballpark of 20 years if if he um plays his cards right with the judge and I think he the judge is sort of somebody that could if he's lucky if Sam's Lockheed could look at Sam's younger version of himself or try to identify with him emotionally those are the kinds of things that certainly I tried to do uh with my jury and judge you have to show The Human Side of you you know the judge is going to read a lot about you they're going to be talking about you as the defendant for the next two years so to humanize yourself and show who you really are is going to matter a lot and I think the prosecution knows that and they're going to try to show the nastiest ugliest dirtiest emails if Sam ever texted somebody to go f themselves or that he ever said I'll Crush you or something egotistical like that you know those will all come up and they'll be shoved right in front of the judge and it's going to be a lot of interesting stuff that we're going to get to read in all these motions so if you don't have an account on Pacer uh which is the public access to court electronic records I suggest you make one because this will be really entertaining and no matter what news you get to read um it's all going to be coming second hand for Pacer and Pacer is the official documents and people pass around the documents after they come out but if you really want to follow this closely I suggest uh to everyone listening a Pacer account would be inexpensive way to get a ton of entertainment uh value out of this at the very least yeah and one more question I was a little surprised when you said that you felt that Sam could still paint this as a business failure because from the please of Ellison and Wong it looks like like there was no attempt to keep customer funds secure from the beginning like she talked about how from 2019 which is when FTX launched that they were co-mingling and stuff like that so you still think that despite that it could still be painted as I don't think there's a person in this world that would but if I had to be in a seed I would say I look at JPMorgan I look at Citigroup and I see that they use customer assets to make investments I yeah but but banks are not crypto exchanges you can't do the same professionalism your honor I thought that I could and I I was maybe a little over my skis and or a lot over my skis but I really thought that I would take that money double it our firm would go bigger stronger better and you know it was wrong it was stupid but this wasn't an attempt to enrich me this wasn't an attempt to steal right if I wanted to steal that money I would have I didn't I tried to make investments those Investments failed I have to pay the price for that but don't confuse me with somebody that was going to take the money and run or somebody that was trying to lose the money or something like that that's the I mean we're trying to salvage this right when you're when you're in the defense seat and I've certainly been there it isn't always about winning it's about getting to that softest Landing of uh and in my case it was the argument we we sort of tried to make was okay even if you accept that there was fraud nobody lost money in the end now all our investors made a lot of money so you might have been lied to but on the plus side you know it's not so bad uh and for Sam he's got to do something similar where he says okay I know I wasn't supposed to use the money but my intentions were pure my intentions were to make this a healthy company of course make money for everyone make better Services et cetera et cetera the Counterpoint to that is well you were greedy you took that money to make investments who would the Investments have benefited the largest shareholder of FTX because the depositors you aren't going to share the upside with the depositors right you're just going to use the depositors money to write some lotto tickets and you hope lotto tickets will pay off if they did the money goes to you not to the person that deposited a thousand dollars in FDX because when they deposit a thousand dollars FTX they withdraw whether or not you made money on your silly Investments they still get the Thousand back you know they're you're going to give them a cut of these these startups that you were creating or Distributing or whatever so I think that it's gonna ring a little Hollow obviously and especially if they can pin him down on saying well you knew you weren't supposed to do this if there was an email if there was a meeting perhaps where Carolyn said Sam you know we can't do this and he said you know it's going to work out don't worry you know which is probably kind of what I think what probably happened but um you know nobody knows for sure and we're gonna have to see that testimony again if I'm Sam's lawyer I'm already coming up with plans on to discredit the other Witnesses I had 26 Witnesses uh testify against me roughly maybe it's 30. I prepared a dossier for my attorneys uh of basically an attack plan and an introduction to the person their photo and attack plan here are their weak points here's where you have to hit them and you know Sam's gonna have something not on specifically that's a kind of weird reviews but he's gonna have some information or some knowledge at the very least of what are these people's weak points you know perhaps Gary for instance is nervous person you know that's something the defense lawyer can exploit obviously we know Caroline had romantic involvement with him huge hugely exploitable if you're the government you do not want that as your start with us that is somebody you can put on the stand and say well you know you had a relationship with and she's gonna have to have the Poise of a brilliant actress to say well that was the the past you know and the relationship didn't change the nature of what we were doing you know and she has to have the completely non-plused and completely unflappable on the stand which is not easy to do with a good defense attorney needling you and needling you and needling you you will um eventually kind of Wither and admit yeah I had a relationship with this person but you know it didn't affect the the situation and you know you can easily get flustered on that stand knowing the whole world is watching uh interestingly I don't think we're gonna get a televised case in this in this case if Federal cases are never televised so we won't be able to do that but court is generally an open process so if I were retired and had nothing to do this would be extremely fun it's better than a baseball game right I mean you just go into court sit down and you know uh you can't really really bring food or drink but you know uh you know but I think having a front roast ticket to this FDX trial would probably go for quite a lot of money um there's usually the the right side of the galley where people can sit is done with uh the journalist and the left side is done usually just for the family but you know there's an overflow room where it's sort of monitored but this funny like oh anachronism I guess of court has to be open for the public well about 30 people can fit into a galley on each side so it's not really open to the public so they make this overflow Auditorium well the Overflow has another overflow room if the case is big enough as it was in my case so you know and a lot of this is boring minutia like you know procedural meetings are very boring but you get a glimpse of Sam and you're really sitting could be sitting 10 feet from you or five feet from you and in fact people have been known to Lunge at each other in these open meetings because you're right there right and it can actually be quite dangerous I was recently saw a case where the defendant was so mad at the prosecutor he lunged at her and uh that almost got him remanded and they had to pull videotape and so forth so everything's in this very like closed and uh small environment you know you you can be in the elevator with Sam I was constantly in the elevator with journalists covering my case or or sometimes there were fans times they were people that just wanted to to bend my ear over something and you would have to be like listen you're in the middle of something pretty important here I can't talk to you about stocks or something like that you know so it'll be people like that are that are really trying to just you can get a minute with sandbank and uh every single time it comes support he has to walk down the same street you do he used to walk down the same you know uh opening you do so it'll be really interesting to see how he navigates that I for instance got very flustered reporters those pesky people would would uh put a microphone in my face and ask me like a hard question or something like that and there'd be a camera crew CNBC is going to be shoving cameras in this guy's face for the next year every time he has to go meet the next time is January 3rd I believe where he has to enter presumably and not guilty play um you never enter guilty plea even if you intend to enter a guilty plea weeks or months from now you don't do it on the arraignment date you know even if you have 100 yeah even if you're 100 confidence that you're going to be pleading guilty someday you you plead not guilty now why because in the last in our last conversation station you said that you would urge him to plead guilty like as soon as possible it still has to be negotiated you know so if he went to on January 3rd he went there and he said and the judge said how do you plead and he said anything but not guilty everybody's job would drop because there has to be a guilty plea hearing and that's very structured there has to be a prep prayer sort of remarks from both sides it's a whole orchestrated thing you don't just plead guilty out of the blue like that so he'll be pleading not guilty even if he wants to plead guilty next week they'll still be pleading guilty and sometimes the judge will will throw out your honor we're in the midst of a negotiated you know the useless kind of a euphemism they'd say something like a negotiated ending to this proceeding or something like that you know basically guilty and so they'll kind of hint to the judge the judge will sometimes just ask like is there or is there any progress towards a resolution to this case it's like you can't settle these things in any amicable way you have to you're settling them with with jail time so it's it's a very euphemistic thing but the judge will probably ask that and we may get our first glimpse of the prosecution saying know your honor is no progress or and you know again body language can say a lot and the judge could ask something in response like do you anticipate there will be you know a resolution to this case short of trial and uh again the the prosecutors uh will respond in a way that you know will sort of tell us or not tell us or maybe the defense will respond in a way that'll tell us or not tell us what they're thinking and we're going to get this really rich experience watching these people work prosecutors here this is opportunity of a lifetime um you can make your whole career and then some and become extremely famous in this case or you can flub it the same thing with the defense um you know we've seen with the Johnny Depp trial uh some of those lawyers become celebrities in a way and I think you know this is a time to shine we're going to get to know these people really well the people that will be in the courtroom every day covering this trial will have a treat uh because you you really get to see those personalities the little frustrations arrogance sometimes from some of the attorneys the meekness sometimes of some of the witnesses or attorneys like you get to really see this play uh almost a Shakespearean play envelope before you and again you know for a front row seat it I'd certainly pay money to be there and um just quickly earlier you said that there were two cases that judge Kaplan but we you did mention a second one when was the second one that's similar yeah I think the Spence case was pretty good I I will just add one more thing in the suspense case where the judge gave him a linear sentence because he felt that Judd that that spans the fraudster had redeemed himself quite a bit after the fraud so if I if you're spam the first thing I'd be doing is trying to redeem myself uh you know maybe through uh some kind of not-for-profit or something like that because now we know the judge looks at that he looked at that with Spence and he took that into consideration and that probably could have cut Spence's sentence in half so if you're Sam I'd get busy doing something to to do that the next case is not a Bitcoin case it's very different but again I want you to think about these judges the way through the lens that I have which is through a lot of experience they don't necessarily say okay this is my Bitcoin column this is my you know Murder column and this is my uh thought column or or my uh drug column and this is how I sentence in these three columns they don't think of the world that way necessarily I think that they will look at other crypto crime and and kind of see Apples to Apples they'll look at other judges they're friends with if I don't know uh uh who judge Kaplan is friends with somebody probably does know that and can if you're on Sam's team you probably want to know that ASAP but let's say he's very close with uh rakeoff uh they could be fishing buddies we just don't know he's going to look at well one break-off do with that one case that was really bad you know and they'll sort of Talk Amongst each other what are ruler talk to figure that out so for me the other case that that speaks a lot uh to me is this very strange case of Warren stelman and Warren stellman was a telemarketing uh fraudster and he was from the Caribbean and again you might say what does that have to do with FTX well there's a deeper level of deception here than with with some of the other cases and there were elderly victims and I'm trying to get a sense for how mean can Kaplan be this was a 75 month sentence so uh what is that roughly seven years uh six years six years this uh was a case that was pretty bad he basically prayed about on on elderly victims um took quite a bit of money from them and um uh still only got you know 75 months so Kaplan could have easily sort of you know thrown the book at this fellow Warren stallman and instead sort of gave him a relatively modest sentence you know it's it's actually hard to find too many cases where where Kaplan gives 10 15 25 years it was difficult for me to find cases like that which is a great thing if you're Sam it means that there's a chance you can walk away from this with 10 15 or 20 years you know pointing at Elizabeth Holmes and saying why don't why don't you give me that you know that was a billion dollar fraud we're kind of the same age I actually built a real robust business that business was kind of built on lies I made a big tactical error where I took the comp system's money and invested it and lost it um but that was that's kind of a little more innocent if you ask me then Elizabeth Holmes trial now uh so 12 years you know maybe that's what you hope for if you're Sam I don't think you can do a lot better than that and again with with Kaplan he's not thrown 20s and 15s and 30s out like it's like they're like they're going out of style he's sort of giving these relatively modest sentences so there's a chance if you're saying that you can you can live to see light a day um with Kaplan I think and again it's really important that he behaves himself according to Kaplan himself it's very important that he tries to redeem himself somehow I think he probably thought he was trying to do that uh on his little PR tour um but he really has to make maybe a more Earnest um effort to do that whether that's you know again he's probably limited with his with his house arrest and what he can actually do but um maybe there are ways that he can really help and again I think the best bet other than fighting is to throw yourself into the emergency of the Court plead guilty redeem yourself uh show that this was a mistake and again maybe maybe if he's really lucky he can get something like 10 or 12 years in which case you'd do rough that um maybe 67 two-thirds of that you know you have to do 85 by law but there's other little things you can do to to get a lesser sentence so if I'm Sam that's a big win six years in prison is doable you're not going to go to you know the bad places in prison you're going to kind of have a relatively subdued uh environment so if I'm Sam that's sort of I think your best case and and Kaplan it sounds like it's possible again his guidelines will be astronomical right the guidelines will be you know off the charts but judge Kaplan there was a New York Times article that covered him about 20 years ago that said Kaplan makes up his own mind uh when it comes to guidelines he doesn't consider the guidelines to be too important there are some judges that really were schooled in the guidelines and they treat them really seriously and there's some judges that say you know all that math you know I can't take the individual and all the facets of this case and distill it down to a table you know that's too dehumanizing to do and I think so many judges have gone past the guidelines and said I'm gonna make up my own mind and in this uniquely singular case that makes more sense to me despite that the guidelines will still say sentence has got to life and he's not going to take a lifetime setting to give the guy five years right he's gonna look at the guidelines and say eat that's a big ask how much can I really depart from this I can't let him walk I can't give him five years but it's I think in the realm of the possibility that he can get 10 12 15 which any of that I think is a big win you can do 10 or 12 for any human being can do it uh take it from me but you you can't do you know 30 or 40. I think that's the kind of sentence that you know is really I there's almost no words for it right right but yeah as we discussed last week that is what the guidelines say so um would definitely be a departure if he gets a significantly less all right so in a moment we're going to talk about the plea that's going to take place next week and um but first we'll take a quick word from the sponsors

the description back to my conversation with Martin so as we were discussing you were saying Sam is most likely going to enter a not guilty plea and you kind of talked about how this could potentially go to trial but I think most of us think it's probably smarter at least for Sam if he does if that doesn't happen so can you talk a little bit about the other scenario of you know what so you're saying next week he'll enter not guilty eventually maybe they'll get to a plea agreement is it at that point that he would enter a guilty plea yeah so he'd hammer out so next week I mean it's a 99.99 chance that he just says not guilty or honor and and it's very perfunctory very formalistic um there's not much to it I think the prosecution would you know be shocked if he said anything other than not guilty there's a little debate uh in the community about whether you say you use that time to like add a word or two in you're really not supposed to but if you want to set the judge the tenor of the case like if you're really gonna fight you might look the judge in the eyes and say 100 not guilty absolutely not guilty or honor something with some some gravitas to sort of show the judge that you mean business you might try to look wounded uh that you know this you're shocked that that you're here you know I do think those things matter a little bit but wait you're saying even if he has the intention to later plead guilty well that's that's my point I wouldn't do that if I if I were intending to plead guilty and that's why I wonder if we can read some tea leaves here if he looks dejected he looks beat up if he's just sort of not defiant at all if he looks like not guilty or honor you know we kind of know what's going on his head if he's standing up tall and proud and saying I'm not guilty or honor you don't get to say more than that and you'll be cut off if you try but uh and it's not the time to do it and his lawyers will tell him that I don't think I added any words O.J Simpson famously added you know the absolutely 100 not guilty which was you know the headlines for for days in newspapers so if I'm Sam uh I try you know if I'm not going to plead I'm going to try to look defiant look proud look like I'm sort of surprised and wounded that I'm here this is a travesty I just made a business mistake you can also again I want to go back to what one thing we were discussing because if he doesn't know that using the customer funds if this is a story doesn't know that using the customer funds was illegal or not permitted at the very least he could argue that as long as his mental state was good that it's not a crime and there's so many different charges here and I think we'll see a superseding indictment he might face a hundred counts for instance it's very hard to beat a case like that and I would imagine that they're telling him here's the indictment to page long or a couple pages long there's eight counts plead guilty to this or the next indictment is 150 counts and your plea deal is going to look a lot different and that's the sword that you use if you're the government and I asked my attorney once he said if you have a case with 100 you know 100 Jarvis how do you how do you do that like formalistically like how do you realistically expect a not guilty uh verdict and he said Martin I once heard the word not guilty from Maduro the foreman of the juror 54 times asked to count one and not guilty asked to count two don't guess he actually have to go through each one so if you're saying you don't want a a super scene indictment almost certainly there's a superseding indictment waiting and what's interesting about the way the superseding indictment works is the government typically will hold out on doing that to see how that negotiation is going they're going to call his attorney and say so let's talk about a plea what are we doing here what do you want to do are you going to plead to the whole thing that's what we want et cetera Etc and if lawyer says a bad news for you my client's not bleeding the they say okay you know what no problem we're coming with a superseding indictment we're adding in my case they they have seven counts they added one which wasn't that big of a deal they thought about adding more in Sam's case every single client arguably every single time he pitched an investor is arguably a new account they could add they could theoretically add 200 accounts here if they felt like it um you don't want to make too much of this though if you're the government strategically you're gonna have to prove each count and if your evidence isn't so great maybe you just go with the best stuff and that's enough to sort of give them life the other thing you see a lot of and this is really going to be bad news for Sam if the government thinks about doing this and they probably will is they'll say oh you're a tough guy you don't want to plead guilty interestingly are your parents is your brother tough is your you know Etc et cetera all these people you care about are they tough do you want to put them through hell too because it's not hard to indict somebody and uh the government will often and I think this is one of the reasons I don't like the way the doj works is they will do this happily uh they will say I have a lot of friends I met in prison who said listen they they said pleader or your wife's getting indicted and that's a really hard thing Sam's not married but it's a really hard thing to stomach and they've drug grandmothers into cases if they had to uh because let's say for instance a drug dealer who's 20 years old lives with his grandma and Grandma knew that there were drugs coming and going from the house well it's not hard to put grandma on the stand and say of course you knew this was your grandson you must have been blind not to know and it's a sad thing but the government will do whatever it takes to win and if that means putting a seven-year-old grandma or in this case maybe a 60 or 7 year old father or mother into the witness table or to into the defendant's chair they don't care you know uh so it's something that if if I'm the prosecutor again the dirtiest thing to do I personally would never ever do it but if you're the prosecutor you have to be thinking just how involved were his parents did were they aware of this stuff is there one email from a son to father or son to mother that says Dad can I use customer funds and uh in any email like that immediately it's an indictable crime it's a crime to know of another crime it's called Miss prison it's a very weird word I wager very people will ever heard this word it's Miss prison again look it up it's uh I didn't make it up I was shocked to see this word to know of a crime and not report it that's a felony so you can be charged with Miss prison and it carries jail time and nobody wants to be indicted so if you're Sam's Dad or Mom and you're the government and you're not getting what you want out of Sam you can get what you wanted to say I'm by threatening that again it's not nice I personally think it's unethical maybe even a little unconstitute but it's the way it works and that's why you never want to be in these crosshairs so I personally didn't have a vulnerability like that but I've known many many people in this case where you know there's no nothing protecting indicting a spouse or other people if they wanted to they could say listen well not every single person that worked at FTX you know if these you care about these people are you gonna let them do that Sam and again he might be defiant and say oh you're going to die to everyone die my family I don't care you know I'm going to trial I'm going to defend myself and that kind of posturing can work you know you if you have that kind of posturing you might call their Bluff and say okay indict my parents try it we'll fight that case too and we'll win that case this will all be like a circus so you don't want to over bet your hand if you're the government either you know it can be very very tricky to navigate how far do I push this versus you know because you push too hard you can get a person like Kaplan saying wait a second this seems too much you know you're indicting the parents you're indicting uh 60 people that have nothing to do with this maybe this whole case is a sham maybe I gotta start thinking about this case differently and you don't want that if you're the government you want to hit hit them and hit them hard with factual good stuff and I think there's plenty of that here but again if some burning desire they really really want a guilty plea there are ways to sort of I hate to use the word course but um personally I think it's coercion a government person would say it's not coercion we're just fully Prosecuting the crime of all the crimes we know about and again technically that is their job so it'll be really interesting to see how the parents come out in this um I don't know their involvement they could have no involvement we know that they were on payroll at some point that's usually enough if you're on the payroll of a car of a company that's committing crime you know usually that's enough to say that um that's good enough for example if I was Sam's father very simple question son I saw you bought 500 million dollars of Robin Hood stock I'm pretty sure you don't have 500 million dollars so you've never had a job that paid you 500 million dollars did a bank loan you 500 million dollars that by the way was my uh um that was my uh guess I'm in the startup world I've been in the startup world uh for many years I once had a public company that was worth 500 million dollars I owned 20 of the company so I had a 100 million dollar net worth just on that stock I asked every bank that existed if they'd loaned me money against my stock uh and I said I'll even take two percent so it's a it's got to be a safe loan I have 100 million dollars in the stock it would have to go down 98 for there to be any risk to your bank I was declined everywhere and this is provided any controversy because the bank said listen it's it's a stock it's you know we're not comfortable with this Elon Musk gets a marginal loan uh from from Big Banks it's not easy to get a margin loan on a privately held account let alone uh on a public health let it on a privately held with Sam is a privately held company if you're Jamie dimon you might say I like this kid he's worth 30 million on paper 30 billion on paper Let Me Lend them 500 million you know what's the worst that could happen and obviously as a bank you have to think about what's like Adam that's your job to be really nervous about that and so Sam never got along like that Sam just took his customers money he wanted to buy 500 million dollars for Robinhood no problem customers money I want to make an investment uh he even had the gumption to say I'll lend Elon Musk a billion dollars or something like that I'll co-invest with Elon Musk I'll use customers money you know so my estimation not knowing him personally not being in his friend circle is that's how he was getting access to all these funds his father must have asked him son how'd you buy that how do you have all these palatial things like is Jamie Diamond lending you this money is Morgan Stanley lend you this money is a city group lending this money he's a foreign Bank lending you this money is a private investor saying I believe in you so much I'm willing to lend you this money for seven percent interest or ten percent interest you know when you are have this big paper net worth uh as was the case for me different from Sam couple zero is different you want to spend that money and you're like I'm rich you know why can't I have some of the things rich people have right I'm 100 million dollars on paper and I want to go to apartment I want a better something and if you're Sam you say that and the traditional way to do is to go get a loan or sell some of your stock in this case he didn't do either of those you just did this third route which was seemingly illegal and again his father working at the company knowing his son so well maybe even having flown on a private jet of his songs or seen his son's home most parents visit their kids look around you say wait a second this doesn't look like the apartment you had when you're at James Street this doesn't look like this is weird you're what happened here do you have a salary what's going on and at some point his father must have known some of this was going on or at least maybe could have inferred it and I think that he could have asked us on are you using the deposits are you how are you doing this and if that conversation ever took place unfortunately his father is is is is now also has committed a crime and I think again the government you know it has to know stuff like this and they know they have this Playbook that they they use against drug dealers against Mafia people they have ways of sort of dealing with these very irascible people that are very hard to pin down they have codes of Silence in many cases in the mob and things like that that are kind of hard to penetrate and they can use these tools that they've built up over the years like Rico uh or other things that like using the family as leverage you know there are ways prosecutors can can come to bring to bear a guilty plea sorry if that was a long-winded well but what I wanted to ask was so since you're saying that the best deal for Sam would be to eventually plead guilty and at you know next week he's most likely going to plead not guilty which it sounds like what you're saying is that will kick off some period of negotiation they may be negotiating right now you know and and like I said at the status conference they may say your honor my clients pleading not guilty today but we are engaged in productive discussions with the government and the judge might look down as he's doing this every day for the last 20 years he might say okay when do you when do we when could we expect some kind of a resolution and the parties are looking to it's a couple months yes no I think sooner than that you know the judge's like okay because the judge has to organize the schedule and say do I have to block out six months for a big trial next year you know because he has to preside right so if he's all these other trials he doesn't want to block out six months and say and he might actually probably won't be this meeting but probably around March or April he'll probably set a trial date and even if that's tentative even if nobody has plans on doing he has to do it just in case because he needs a block of three four months this is a really complex case a two three-month trial isn't out of the question even a six-month trial is now the question that would be terrible uh for all parties involved my trial was five weeks and it was longest five weeks of my life so to block out a good six months in late 23 early 24 mid 24 even late 24 he's gonna have to do that and set us a schedule if you're Sam every day free from here to your trial is a happy day um knowing full well that all the days after your trial may be spent incarcerated so if you're Sam you're hoping for something with the 2024 date and you're helping judge Kaplan already has conflicts that he's his 23 is booked up with trials right that's the goal and you're even gonna pitch that oh yeah this is going to be a six-month trial the government's going yeah it's gonna be a six-week trial you just schedule it for you know holiday period right then uh you know and there's tactics to that you you as a defense attorney you don't want the holidays you don't want the summer and there's other people that disagree with this when it comes to a jury we're going to probably do this again Laura we're going to talk about okay well do you want a woman on your jury do you want a guy on your jury every every attorney has their own like little system and tea leaves and it's a rush to sit there and Sam's probably gonna make the final call on some of these jurors and gonna say no you're 17 we don't want your 17 I saw the way she looked at me she's gonna convict me let's get to her 19 you know who's who's uh in in the voir deer which is the jury statements they're gonna have to say things like have you ever had crypto do you know what crypto is there's gonna be really interesting to see people say yes I have money on FTX well that's probably going to disqualify you from sitting on the street but let's say you had money in finance does that disqualify you I don't know did you hear about this it's going to be hard sometimes to not be able to to find people who've never heard about this but you probably can if they're people that say well if you don't know about crypto or you don't have a crypto account is that because you hate crypto and will that color your judgment there's going to be a massive speaking mystery if this goes there uh but again it'd be smart for Sam to settle here and and find a if it's possible right again we've talked about this last time if they are selling and plead a life I can't do that if you're telling me plead of 50 years I just can't you know what what's the point let me at least go down swinging unless spending a bunch of money you know fighting this stuff the other thing that's really interesting here is I understand that Sam's family has some money but legal cases are expensive my legal case was over 15 million dollars some of that was paid by Insurance some of that wasn't uh so it was paid by me in insurance is something that reliable Smart Companies have for their Executives I have no clue if Sam had Insurance apparently they didn't you know so that means a defense attorney is going to have to be paid and they're going to be paid a lot I mean for a marquee defense attorney you are talking about five ten million dollars to go to trial and they want that money now and they will leave the case if they don't get it so these aren't cheap you know folks and I think that you know I wouldn't want to go to trial with an attorney that cost less than if I'm Sam less than a couple million dollars at trial and I think that would be because you have to pay for each person a trial is like really just hiring a a whole Law Firm for months or a year at a time I know it was removed in a similar case to mine the tab came it was fully covered by insurance this tab came out to over 25 million dollars and basically because insurance was paying for it uh the company uh the defendant put on the biggest defense he could which is what you would do if your life was online right um and Sam's life's on the line so if he wants to put on but are you implying that because he doesn't have money to pay that kind of lawyer that he probably is incentivized to not go to trial yes uh that often will come into play uh many um it's not exactly where I was going with it but to answer your question many many criminals will when faced with the prospect of a trial well if they need an attorney to go to trial and you can go to trial with a federal defendant it's not something I would do it's not an exam in his right mind would do either but let's say you're his parents and I don't know let's say you have 10 million dollars do you want to spend every single dime you have defending your son you know maybe you have other kids right maybe you're Sam do you ask your family for that do you say Mom Dad we have 10 million dollars total I need you to sell a house and pay every dime you know in my case that I'm sure to lose you know that's a tough ask I think that's really punitive if you have a billion dollars then you say okay let's spend 100 million defending ourselves let's get the best lawyers in the world and then some uh put every single lawyer in fact I I was familiar with this crazy case uh named a guy named Reza zarab who's a Turkish uh money launcher and this guy was so wealthy that he hired virtually every criminal defense attorney of note including my my lawyer but also Rudy Bonnie and many other very big names and he hired all of them even though you can only bring like one lawyer to question people at trial really I mean maybe one or two he had like 30 of these people and and the reason was resources and links and connections that you know one of these lawyers is going to have a better relationship with a prosecutor one might have a better relationship with the judge one might have a better relationship here one might be able to secure the bill what you know like you you're just like I need them all you know that's the full court press that Sam if he had insurance if he had and that's the business having insurance it's called dno insurance it's a directors and officers insurance and the insurance company would fight it and they would say no the company's bankrupt it can't pay and the trustee would fight and say no we can't use money fraudulently gotten to defend the fraudster no way and so it's going to be really interesting over the next several months we're going to start to see some of the stuff as to who's the attorney what are they cost we're not going to know that necessarily but we get some sense of it and who's paying because it's not hard to get an attorney to you know negotiate your bail and stuff like that the bill for that might be fifty thousand dollars for an ordinary person a huge expense for Sam's Professor parents maybe not but eventually it gets very expensive and it gets into the millions of dollars and the lawyers will be Point Blank and say listen unless you can show up with three million dollars by kind of unlike next month I'm out of here and I've seen many cases where a client a defendant will go through a half a dozen lawyers eventually the judge says this is nonsense if you can't pay for a lawyer we're just appointing a federal Defender and there's nothing wrong with Federal defender in fact in the southern district Federal Defenders are some of the best attorneys there are but they are swamped uh they have a ton of work and um they often have good relationships with the judges because they're in there all the time so some great defense lawyers haven't seen a judge in years and they don't have those relationships whereas the federal Defenders are there all the time and they can really impress upon the judge like I really think my client's guilty or innocent I should say because I've shown you lots of clients and they're not always intimate this guy really believes innocent and that means something coming from a federal Defender it doesn't mean something coming from somebody's not important every single day like a federal Defender is again the federal Defenders don't have the reputation as being the greatest because you know you want that Superstar lawyer the Jose Baez is the best lawyer at trial and Ben brafman my attorney and Mark mcniflo my other attorney I have to give them uh the plug but theoretically If Money Was No Object at all today I would either go with Ben um who did a marvelous job for me and Puff Daddy and many other famous uh clients he's had like Michael uh Jackson and others where Money Was No Object uh or I'd go with Jose Baez who Casey Anthony and um Aaron Hernandez and many other folks have have hired he also seems to be able to tease the not guilty out of the jury somehow uh and it's very much theater you know I think um Sam you know if you go with sort of the Egghead lawyer that's like very smart and technically good that may that person may be terrible in front of a jury you know you really need to tap dance and be a comedian and be a uh an action star and all these different facades that the jury can buy and they end up sort of like an election it's whether they like you more than they like the prosecutor and the prosecutor is making out to be a bad guy and you have to sort of find a way to sort of be a chameleon and and show who you are to this jury and the best people that do that are not always the best cerebral lawyers but they're cerebral in a different way and so it'll be really interesting if we get to travel it'll be a treat especially if Sam testifies himself which is always advised against that'll be an even bigger treat but we solve some wood to top between now and then all right last quick question last week you were talking about how you took the time in prison to learn a lot about crypto and I wanted to ask you how you did that because I didn't know what your internet access was and you also mentioned something about people maintaining businesses from prison this might have been after we had wrapped the interview but I also wanted to ask like if Sam ends up there I don't know if he thought he would be able to do that yeah so he probably could um so I learned a lot in prison in general I still had a staff and the same staff from before has continued throughout till today they used to joke that I was in the New Jersey office I had my prison listen years we didn't have a corporate office there so I had people helping the assistant sending me books family members great friends they would just send me I had so many books I couldn't couldn't read them all or store them all I would have to lease uh space from other inmates I would give them uh cookies and food and stuff like that and they would hold in in their lockers gigantic number of books about crypto including yearbook which I didn't get a chance to finish in prison but uh many other books uh about uh crypto and other things and I would get white papers and things like that in prison I would jump on the prison phone where we were limited to 15 minutes and I'd have my brother go down the entire coin market cap list as fast as he could uh with prices and I had a Contraband cell phone depending on the prison I was at so I could use that sometimes it wasn't always reliable sometimes they have to sit in a toilet at 3am uh on uh blockchain Explorer like looking at different uh wallets and you know I'm also developing my own software are now some financial information software as well as sort of simulation software and both could be uh I think helped by the blockchain but you know the for me crypto is sort of an additive thing to a lot of different software it's not necessarily transformed in some cases it's absolutely transformative in my sort of view of the crypto world and my startups we're focused on taking existing software making it better in a lot of ways that have to do nothing with crypto and also ways that add crypto so I was able to sort of think a lot about well how would I go about you know doing a software startup when I got home and how would I put that together and how would I sort of use the best Technologies and all kinds of things you want the best database right you want the best front end you want the best middleware and crypto sort of adds a little bit um to every software company can use a little bit of crypto to add value to their stack so in some cases it'll be really transformative like in certain Financial applications but in some cases I think I saw BMW today said they're going to do the rewards point system on on the blockchain well that makes sense you know that's sort of a not going to change the face of BMW but it's a little loose that you can use to add your business so that's kind of my general philosophy on crypto doesn't have to be like the sea change that changes everything it can just improve up faster is five or ten percent so I was lucky enough to read so much about ECC and other sort of relatively esoteric Parts about crypto that a lot of people don't know and then also sort of the more mundane stuff I followed nfts and stuff like that I actually onboarded a lot of people uh in onto crypto in prison so I get guys metamask accounts and we bought their first nfts and stuff like that it was a lot of fun you know there were even the day I joined one prison there were a Cadre of prisoners uh trading icos so this was really funny and I was just sitting there like flabbergasted like man times have changed I figured you'd be all like selling drugs or stuff like that instead of flipping icos and they said oh we do that other stuff too so but wait but wait so they have computers or an internet access or this this is contraband cell phone so this is a cell phone you pay 500 to some cases five thousand dollars of cash to um some go between who probably gets it from a corrupt guard at some point and some prisons know they have a Contraband cell phone problem don't really care and they kind of are like it's kind of inhumane not to let people go on the internet but that is the rule and then some prisons are really cracked down on it and they don't accept it Zero Tolerance whatsoever um so if you're smart and you kind of like keep it under your pillow or something like that you know you can you can find a way to get away with it uh but again it depends on the leniency of the person the lower level prisons that are cater persons prisoners with lower sentences they're much more lenient they kind of are like yeah whatever you can have a cell phone what are you gonna do with it you know the penitentiaries the mediums and stuff like that it's harder it's more expensive it's more difficult so if you're Sam and you want to stay in touch with this stuff which why not you could I was there chatting with you know uh I had different uh chat groups on WhatsApp that I would correspond with I had uh I probably went too far because once people start talking about how they're talking to you in prison you know the prison fight could find out and you'd be in trouble that way but you try to keep people a profile but if you're Sam and you go to you got a 10-year sentence or 15 year sentence you could feasibly be keeping tabs in crypto maybe even using theoretically if you had a cold wallet or some other uh wallet you could you know I certainly you know did it myself you can certainly transact a bit you could trade crypto theoretically from inside jail you could even retrofit your quarters into like a crypto trading center where you know you get your buckmates in on the action and you know because they're all looking to make money too so there are ways to sort of survive I heard Sam waxel the famous biotech CEO who went down with the Martha Stewart Scandal that he was he basically kind of made that prison his like new office uh uh so you can you can improvise but of course it's nothing like you know being completely free or anything but it's not impossible to sort of you know stay in touch on things and then also possibly transact um you can also call your family and say hey can you do that thing I asked you to do and uh they'll say oh yeah I did that thing that you asked me to do and that was sort of a traditional way of talking to your family or friends and getting to do things without necessarily you know all the calls are recorded so you can still kind of write down something and say Here's here's my public private key go send this money to you know tornado or something some crazy crime like that you could perpetrate that theoretically still while you're in prison and then and you've asked like did you send it through the tornado or the Cyclone or whatever you come up with some some codeword and they said yes yes it's uh the weather's gotten better here or something like that and and and you know you would do that in the face-to-face visit so there are ways to do all of that and I think if if you get a really bad sentence I think those options are off the table and that's why people are willing to bleed sometimes they their lawyer tells them listen five years I can get you to Club Fed you might have a cell phone that's honestly one of the great things my my lawyer said I said when I was sort of looking at okay what's going to happen here I said I still I hate this idea person I'm not gonna be on the internet to say so don't be so sure and I said what and he said there are ways to go on the internet in prison I said are there and all of a sudden my whole countenance my whole like outlook on life right because I was like when I heard that I said there are you know so I think if you're sad you know it's not the end of the world um no matter what happens there's there's life after this and you know I hope that he's learning from this and and becomes a better person after this um and and certainly for me I I took the you get the time to take stock and say okay well here are the things I want to change about my life Peter thinks I'm doing well and no matter who Sam was before he'll be somebody different and probably better after so again may not mean much to people who've lost money in FTX it may not mean much to people who scorned him but he you know it sort of can only get better from here from his personality perspective and things like that so again at the end of the day I know everyone wants to trash them and and sort of we're sort of watching this train wreck unfold in real time but he's still a human being and I still think he deserves some decency and respect as a person um especially until he's found guilty or not found guilty as the case may be that you know I I hope that everyone can sort of have it in their heart to respect our legal system which dictates that he is until proven guilty and I think that that's something that can be really damaging because sometimes we don't respect that there are going to be actual instant people that don't get that benefit of doubt the doubt and that's truly a tragedy so in this case we don't know if he's gonna guilty but I think you know I haven't seen a whole lot of decency for Sam or a whole lot of sort of benevolence or even just what you would expect if it were you so it's something to think about um for all the listeners all right well parting words of advice thank you so much for coming on Unchained yeah thank you so
