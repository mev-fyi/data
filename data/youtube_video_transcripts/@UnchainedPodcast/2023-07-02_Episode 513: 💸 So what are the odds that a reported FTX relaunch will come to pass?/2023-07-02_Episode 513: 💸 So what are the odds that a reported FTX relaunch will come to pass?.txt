the thing is we buy claims I never want someone to think I'm like chilling for my or like oh it's all going to be death and destruction and so you should sell me the claim for nothing so so it's hard for me to say without someone so take it with a grain of salt I think the odds are pretty low but look if somebody comes up with an unreasonable bid like hey I'll pay 250 250 million let's relaunch everybody that's a creditor is gonna get 60 cents on the dollar and they're gonna get eighty percent of the new co-equity and we're going to get 20 for our 200 million dollars that we pump in like sure let's do it I just don't think looking back at like Voyager and looking back at Celsius with some of the offers were I just don't think you're gonna get there why would someone not pay a lot for some of those customers and then pay a lot for FTX I mean I guess some people say oh FDX is a lot more more profitable because it just had a I don't know like better customers and all the offshore derivatives were profitable
