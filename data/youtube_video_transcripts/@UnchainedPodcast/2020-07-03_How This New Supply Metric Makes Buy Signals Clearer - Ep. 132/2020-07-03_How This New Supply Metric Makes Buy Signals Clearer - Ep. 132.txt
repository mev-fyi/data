manager echoing metrics welcome Ben Thank You Laura for having me this week coin metrics came out with a new metric that addresses a tricky issue with crypto assets especially when it comes to market capitalization but before we dive into the details on that news let's just give a big-picture overview because coin metrics it's actually developed a number of supply metrics as far as I can tell I think there are at least four so why so many what problem or problems are you guys trying to solve when it comes to the supply of blockchain based tokens yes it's it's a super interesting problem and I think that one of the things that we're trying to overcome is that there are just numerous ways that block chains can be analyzed and looked at and observed and when the the most transparent and the most obvious way to look at block chains is just what's looking on ledger so that's the very first supply metric that we came up with and that's what we call current supply and it's just all tokens that are that are observed from from looking at the ledger and then once you start to understand that you understand that that is not the most optimal way to look at the supply that's in the market especially when you're considering indexes which is a lot of what I do and when you're looking to rebalance indexes you're really trying to represent the real market the real market dynamics and the liquidity that's within the market and that's a lot of the reason why we came up with free flow to kind of get a better understanding of what's available to market participants which makes makes managing an index or tracking a portfolio a lot easier for the individuals one of the third ones is the future supply and so by looking at future supply what we hope to do is we hope to have that forward-looking view of how the market perceives or how the market values the issuance of new tokens and high inflation can lead to a depreciated value today so so we kind of look at what that future supply is together to hopefully reduce index turnover and index issues down the future by having that forward-looking approach so there are three primary ones that we have and yeah and so now let's talk about the new metric that you announced this week free float supply tell us about that yeah so free food supply is it's a lot it's a lot of work in the making and super happy to have it out in the public now and available in our community tools but what we hope to do is again there's there's no industry standard for supply across the market and in traditional capital markets it's very easy you look on you look on Yahoo you look on Bloomberg you look in the newspaper and there's just one supplier forget everywhere you go with crypto assets that's that's up for debate and that's anyone's guess at the minute and depending on which data distributor you go to you'll get a different value for the free flow or the supply in the market and what we hope to do was come up with a standardized methodology it can be applied across the plethora of crypto assets that are out there they're very objectively looks at what the supply that's available in the market currently is and the way we do days we look at that unchanged supply that current supply and we we subtracts coins that belong to holders that we feel restrict supply to markets and so but why are you doing that like what problem are you trying to address with this free float supply yeah so the the key issue that we're trying to address or the key problem is that by by having a better understanding of what's available to the market and investors can be more informed on what a what a true picture of market capitalization is or or index managers can have a better indication of how they should be weighted portfolios and balancing portfolios and allocating their their dollars across assets and because what you get is if you were to for example some of the some of the ones that deviate most from their on chain supply a ones like ripple Stella and crypto comm where they have these huge issuances but there's not there's potentially between fifteen and thirty percent it's actually available to markets to trade so by having that this fancy it makes it very hard if you if you take the bigger number if you're trying to allocate and weight a portfolio with that so by looking at the by looking at the free float supply you do get that better picture and you do get that better idea of how what the liquidity in the market is and therefore you can make smarter investment decisions and I should disclose that stellar and crypto comm I know that crypto comm is a sponsor for this show I'm not if I'm not sure if stellar was or it currently is but it has at some point been whether or not that's still true and so when you calculate the free float supply how do you what like what are you taking off the table when you do that like what do you subtract so the weird subtracting big categories of investors that we deem again as though strategic long long term long term holders that aren't providing liquidity to market so the classical ones that we look at the foundations themselves so in a lot of instances foundations are known to hold a lot of tokens at the time of ICO or the time of issuance we're looking at team members going back through the team member wallets it becomes evident that a lot of them do act as long-term holders so therefore we subtract their tokens as well and we're subtracting tokens for individuals who aren't or who do hold the crypto I said without transacting it for over five years so that's more relevant to some of the older older coins like Bitcoin and we subtract I'd say they're the three primary categories and then there are some smaller categories one that's particularly relevant to stellar as we subtract lost tokens or burn tokens so for Stella for example they burned I think it was around 55 billion tokens within the last year and that we wouldn't include in freefloat supply but it's still visible unchanged so therefore there's there's again a reason why why we look at the free flexor buyers opposed to unchain supply when looking at indexes and invest ability and one thing that I found interesting is that it excludes some of the tokens that you say are provably lost so how do you figure out if funds are provably lost it seems at least for some of them it would be kind of hard to figure out how yeah so there there are very few tokens that do fall into that provably lost category and it's not it's not I've it's not an individual saying have proved ly lost my keys but it's more ones like the smart contract failures like the parity wallet like the parity well at hack or like this stellar foundation where they did send it to an a none spendable address and so they're deemed to be proof who lost I think they're the two biggest categories or or potentially the only two categories of tokens that we can see that proof we lost one of the other things we do apply to that we do apply a minimum which i think is a it's a minimum as a percentage of the total supply so that we're not chasing point to Bitcoin that approvable I still write somewhat yes so what we what we did strive to do is we did we with a lot of the methodologies and a lot of the categories of token holders that we do exclude we look to leverage a lot of what's done in traditional capital markets and that has worked very well for us been able to leverage that knowledge okay and I actually just wanted to kind of break out a little bit more the differences between the traditionally reported supply versus the freefloat supply and as you mentioned so bitcoins is somewhat large probably simply because it was the first cryptocurrency so I think a lot of coins were lost you know you hear those stories about people who decided to go dumpster diving but that wasn't it let's see so it's typically said to have like 18 point 4 million coins but the under free float supply it only has 14 point 3 and the difference in markup would be something like you know we we might say like a hundred and sixty billion but in the table that coin metrics had and it's charted it was actually 130 billion if you're using the free float you know as as you mentioned also the XR p1 was was really big that one was 44 billion coins in the standard industry reported supply versus 30 billion in the free float supply that takes the market cap from 8 billion down to 5 billion so that's like 30 percent less but the biggest one actually was Bitcoin SV like the difference the standard industry reported supply was eighteen point four million versus ten million in the free float supply it I was just so curious like why is that one so large yes so so what we did for a lot of the four coins is we look at this concept of what's being activated post fork is an indication of how many people are actually using the network or people are actually providing supplier to the network so if you look at the Queen SV in Bitcoin cash what we're trying to identify is which of the you thos have been activated or partially spent and that gives you an indication of how many people have actually claimed those tokens and therefore have the right to have the right to be considered as sellers or suppliers of BCH or PSV to market it's not to say that that won't change in the future of someone who hold or who held 50000 BTC at the time of the BCH fork or it's not to say that they won't activate it in the future but it's to say with the current knowledge that we have this is our best guess oh this is the best estimation at what can be considered supplying the market all right so in a moment we'll look a little bit more at that difference between the free float at versus the traditionally reported supply when it comes to other coins but first a quick word from the sponsor seem like this show possible in this crisis many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets others seek to maximize the yield on their cash next allows you to achieve both of these goals the company offers instant crypto credit lines against all major cryptocurrencies with interest rates starting from only 5.9 percent APR next so also allows you to earn up to 8% annually on your fiat and digital assets what's more interest is paid out daily and you can add or withdraw funds at any time get started at neck so I owe back to my conversation with them seller Meyer so one other one it was pretty interesting to me was tether so for some reason like in your chart in early 2019 the amount of tether issue did not match the amount of tether in the markets why was that yes so this is this was a super interesting finding that I learnt as well but what happens is when tether new USD T they don't necessarily issue it so they've got the to the Treasury and and similarly when when tethers out there and existing in the market if people send it back to the Treasury so they don't thoroughly burn it at the same time it sent back which means that there can be this big discrepancy between how many USD T is on chain and minted versus how many is actually in the market because the Tevin of Treasury holding it isn't a representation of what's what's available in trading in markets so that's what happened during 20 2018-2019 used to tether treasury started either either minting coins without issuing them or when it got coins back in the Treasury it didn't burn okay yeah and so actually then in that chart it becomes pretty clear kind of how free flowed really is we had just kind of it's relevant for how the coin will trade because the graph then showed a correlation between the free float tether supply and the Bitcoin price whereas the the total supply was was not as correlated so like why and yeah why is that it's just because it was the most liquid stable coin or the correlation yeah I think that's for traders and yeah but I mean there has been a lot of research done around around the supply of stable coins in the market in in relation to the price of Bitcoin and an especially as demand for stable Queens increases there's a lot of speculation that all right sorry supply increases there's a lot of speculation that that means there is demand for USD T on RAM so that people can buy Bitcoin so like that speculation can hopefully be better informed by looking at the free flow figures as opposed to better the Unchained figures okay and in the same blog post where you introduced the free float supply you also talked about some of these you know common valuation methods that do rely on the market capitalization and so the first one that you guys talked about was n VT ratio which is the network value to transaction ratio and that measures the total value of Bitcoin against the value transmitted through the network so when you looked at that using the freefloat supply against the traditional market cap what did you find yes so what we found was using using traditional market cap you've got this natural appreciation of bitcoins market value just by virtue of by virtue of the issuance or the mining activity in Bitcoin but that doesn't again if you're if you're looking at free flow this is more traditional market cap or traditional crypto asset market cap it doesn't necessarily mean that the network's value is increasing if coins that are over five years old that haven't been transacted either and in the market or they're lost of whatever is in there they're just not being introduced not contributing to the trade they we found that by reducing nodes or subtracting those it potentially gives slightly better signal and it gives you a better indication of what the true market cap is for the for the asset class by which you can then measure a ratio of true market cap verses or lick I won't say true market cap the available market cap versus the the transactions so for example if you're if you're trying to measure transactions today versus transactions a year ago there are just more even if transactions haven't changed there are just more Bitcoin that are being mined and more bitcoin that are being created so it does have that natural appreciation so what we found is by having the free flow it hopefully gives you a better or a sharper indication of signal especially in I think at the minute it's the over the overbought region is where yeah yeah people I'll include the link to this post in the show notes because you can easily see the difference and I would say you know as we would expect that the difference does increase the over time so the more recent part of the graph is where that distinction is more clear and yeah I frankly you know I'm not a traitor and I I don't think the traders listen to my show very much however looking at that I was like oh yeah if I were a trader I definitely would probably prefer to use this metric for nvt ratio and then let's talk about the other one that market value to realize value ratio how did that differ when you use the free float supply yeah so so by a similar and by similar logic you've got a market value that's that's perpetually increasing well assuming price stays constant your market value just naturally increases given the inflation rate and therefore again by looking at what's available to the market you what we found was that you get a sharper signal this time on that on that under or on there on the buy side signal where where we've found that you you again have that natural appreciation in the metric in by just looking at what's available to the market you do potentially get a better indication and well looking historically of where where you could look at opportunistic buying entries to become so one thing I was thinking about is like a lot of these networks are looking well I should say the newer networks are looking to govern via tokens and so those decisions could have an impact on things like the emission rate or lock ups or whatever so is your team just gonna continually update these the this freefloat number for all these different coins like I just you know my must be so much work yes so we will look to expand expand our coverage of the assets and one of the new things for me at least working at CROI metrics is there's no there's no shortage of and skill or or no shortage of expertise in the team and what the team has been able to do leveraging most of their the network data capabilities the notes we ran and other or the other metrics we've ran is there's there's real-time monitoring of these addresses so every time we get daily reports for each of the transactions in an hour of any of our tagged addresses so that we can very very much monitor just like have this laser focus on what what the addresses of interest are and we can monitor the inflows and outflows from those wallets and make assessments on the guards to whether they're just cold wallet shuffles foundation wallet shuffles team wallet shuffles or whether they are actually providing liquidity to markets by going to exchanges or recently some of the interesting ones have been a token movements to compound for food yield farming activities like that but not surprising yeah all right well so what new indices are financial products because you see making use of this free float supply metric or any of your other recently introduced metrics yes if we hope to launch at the same bhai 10 in the next ice a month or two and what that would be is that would be our version of a top 10 weighted market cap and that will use free float so again we hope to better we hope to better represent the liquidity of the market through using this metric but the metric will the metric is available for any index that does want to to wait with free flow as opposed to company reported or on chain market cap yeah that's what we had to do it we just hope to provide transparency we hope to provide a standard to the market we hope to provide education so that so that users or participants of the crypto a network can have that or can have an informed metric that does follow a standardized methodology across across the crypto asset class all right well we will look out for that thanks so much for coming on unconfirmed yes thank you so much for having me Laura don't forget to stay tuned for the weekly news recap stick around for this weekend crypto after this short break how much in fees are you paying for crypto purchases now crypto comm is waiving the three point five percent credit card fee when you buy crypto apart from crypto purchases you can also get a great deal on food and grocery shopping with crypto comm get up to ten percent back when you pay with their MCO Visa card no card use the crypto dot-com app to buy gift cards for up to twenty percent back download the crypto TOCOM app today and enjoy these offers until the end of September hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline PayPal and venmo to launch crypto buying and selling you guys so this was actually story from last week and do do a coffee pace error yes I know that's kind of crazy in my recap last week I neglected to include include this story which was the biggest news story last week which is as the headline says that PayPal and then we'll will be launching crypto buying and selling although it's not clear which tokens will be available the service could roll out in as soon as within the next three months alright so now on to the headlines for this week defy hacks continue with half a million dollars hacked from balancer the hacks and defy continued this week with another multi-protocol attack draining about $500,000 worth of tokens from automated market maker pools on balancer the attacker took out a flash loan of wrapped eath on dy/dx and swapped it for a so clogged inflationary coin called cetera ticker sta which meant that there would be a 1% transfer fee charged from the recipient per transaction however the balancer pool did not recognize that with each transaction it was receiving 1% less of Sta and the hacker made this transaction 24 times to drain s T from the pool and then use the last single one-way sth to get the pool to release more wrapped eath and drain that full the hacker repeated this with WB t CS NX and linked the wrapped Bitcoin synthetic token and link for chain link tokens and then because balancer is actually giving out liquidity mining or right now these hacker also obtained more balancer pool tokens and then used to get even more rap teeth if you followed all that then good for you so this actually was similar to the lend FME attack in that this stems from a certain type of technology being used in a system that could not account for that technology and also what was similar is that this potential problem was actually flagged beforehand or known beforehand as someone had previously flagged this as a potential issue to the balancer team in the unbalance er decided to fully reimburse all aquinnah T providers who lost funds during the attack next headline Dex is searching hit a new all-time high monthly trade volume on Dex's reached 1.5 1 billion dollars in June up 70 percent compared to maze volume which was just shy of $900 900 million dollars it's also up 46 percent compared to the previous all-time high of 1 billion dollars in March unis weapon curve led the pack when it came to Dex volume although total Dex volume is still just 2% of the volume on centralized exchanges the block also did a nice deep dive on Dex aggregators such as one-inch exchange total and para swath unsurprisingly prices are best on the aggregators as proposed as opposed to single Dex is especially for larger orders and this week the 0x protocol launched its own Dex aggregator called matcha which i think is a really good name alright next headline the Bitcoin stock to flow theory turns out to be nonsense well the graph certainly looked credible people may have heard of the stock to flow valuation model for Bitcoin espoused by the pseudonymous plan be a twitter account we mentioned it here on the show such as in the Bitcoin having episode and potentially also in the episode with Dan Moore head of Pantera capital on unconfirmed in case you don't recall the stock to flow theories that Bitcoin has an on unforgeable costliness because it takes a lot of electricity to produce new bitcoins and that means that bitcoins cannot be easily faced it then posits that since there's a large supply of gold compared to the new supply introduced to it that gives it a high stock to flow ratio and that bitcoins stock to flow ratio is about half that of Gold's currently but will someday be even higher and that will eventually result in the price rising so the theory seems to make sense since we all know that the new bitcoins minted with every block will asymptotically reach zero eventually however a few posts including an op-ed this week by niko Cordero the chief investment officer and fund manager at Strix Leviathan points out a fundamental flaw in the theory there is ZERO correlation between the stock to flow for gold and its price there's an extremely striking chart and the op-ed that shows this in the op-ed he says quote we believe the models accuracy will likely be about a successful at forecasting bitcoins future price as the astrological models of the past were at predicting financial outcomes Eric Wall the CIO of arcane assets pointed out or he would have opposed chronicling all the people who determined the model was flawed alright next headline Assyrians and investors beat the drum for a IP one five five nine in his newsletter at the daily Quay Anthony says sano of set protocol eath hub and into the ether broke down how he thought that if aetherium improvement protocol proposal one five five nine were passed it would both improve the user experience on aetherium as well as help ease accrue value first eeew 155 nine would make it less common for people to overpay miners fees while maintaining the ability to skip ahead in line by paying a tip to miners there's also a function by which the base fee is burnt so that only the tip goes to miners Anthony breaks down how apps are currently parasitic on aetherium he as he puts it quote there on chain activity does not add fundamental value to Eve what now happens is that the fee basically just goes back and forth between users and miners he explains the cycle this quote user buys eath use your pace V minor takes me minor may sell the fee if back into the market and cycle begins again if a I P one five five nine were to be implemented however since the base fee would be burnt the rewards pay Dantas takers in aetherium 2.0 will be less than what miners currently make an overall that would have a deflationary effect on etherium system the issuance would be smaller than what is burnt on a related note blocked our capitals are appalled we did that he thinks e IP 159 is make or break for etherium he said the reason was because right now the main issue for aetherium and EFI is to get big fast since the paces this space is still so small and he said quote growth and eath markup hast market cap has to keep up with the growth in the market cap of tokens on aetherium or you incentivize a wide range of game theory attacks next headline 500 BTC stolen traced to zap oh and endo Dax resulting in lawsuit a German trader named Dennis Nowak sued Bitcoin wallet providers Oppo and crypto exchange in Indonesia called in o Docs after 500 BTC stolen from him which was about 4.5 million at first time were found of and moved who wallets at Zappo and endowed acts as the block puts it quote while lawsuits arising from hacks and stolen funds are common in the crypto space this one stands out due to the degrees who which it relied on asset tracing firms like chain alysus and elliptic have developed proprietary systems for analyzing watching data tracking the flow of illicit funds and even identifying the individuals behind it but they tend to cater mostly to exchanges in law enforcement agencies the Nowak versus Oppo case suggests that crypto as a tracing may starts making regular appearances in civil law sets - alright time for fun bits first headline daily transaction fees on the theory of higher then bitcoins for record 26 days steven jiang head of research at the blog tweeted a chart showing the ethereal transaction fees have only surpassed bitcoins twice and the current streak is for 26 days and Counting which is a new record he says that since the start of the streak the average daily fees on aetherium have totaled 790 1571 dollars while in Bitcoin they've been at three hundred and forty-one thousand dollars four hundred and thirty similarly it turns out that the ether options market has now reached the size of the Bitcoin options market in December 2018 all right thanks for tuning in to learn
