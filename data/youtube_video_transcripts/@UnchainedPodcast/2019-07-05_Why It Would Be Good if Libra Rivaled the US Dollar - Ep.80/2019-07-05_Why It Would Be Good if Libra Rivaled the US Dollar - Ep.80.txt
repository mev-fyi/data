wrapped David markets of calibra published a blog post answering some questions Michael and I obviously did not get to discuss this blog post but this podcast is still a meaty conversation we talk about the letter to Facebook from the House of Representatives financial services committee plus we draw on Michael's experience covering global economic affairs at The Wall Street Journal but I just wanted to explain why we didn't cover David Marcus's post I still link to it in the show notes otherwise enjoy the show hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the podcaster reveals how the marquee names

blockchain analytics and threat Intel leading exchanges virtual currency businesses banks and regulators themselves use cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is Michael Casey chairman of the advisory board at coin desk and CEO of streambed media welcome Michael hi Laura take me back a Facebook's proposed Libre is being seen as a threat to a lot of fiat currencies and could be especially stable destabilizing for countries with weaker currencies you covered global financial and economic affairs at the Wall Street Journal where you worked for almost two decades plus I know you have personal experience living in countries with weak economies so it was interested to get your take on Libre especially now with the letter this week from the US House of Representatives Committee on financial services to Mark Zuckerberg Sheryl Sandberg and the head of calibra David Marcus but before we get to that particular news can you just tell me what your initial reaction was when you learned about Libre well you know obviously we've been anticipating it for a while so so it was you know something of an anticipated response but I think you know I was pleasantly surprised I think the lengths that they've gone to to try as best they could within the confines of what is obviously a corporate mission and a you know permissioned structure to ring-fence the Libre project Facebook itself which made it maybe kind of conflicted because you know I'm on record as being extremely critical of Facebook I have a very very dark view of the company and its impact on society so I'm very nervous about the role that it could play in this but I I feel like the structure of it is is actually potentially if they can live up to it lots of ifs and caveats in there you know quite quite potentially constructive to both cryptocurrencies but just more importantly because the one thing that really matters is you know Financial Inclusion and reducing global friction in in money flows so you know it I was somewhat pleasantly surprised but I'm inherently cautious given again the genesis that this has come from and as you know a number of governments and financial regulators had pretty much the opposite reaction like pretty negative reactions that were fairly immediate as well to Libra so why do you think that is well whence are there Charlie the opposite to mine either though right because I think it's it's the it's inevitable that your response is going to be you know oh my goodness this is Facebook right the company behind Cambridge analytical or not behind it with a company that essentially enabled Cambridge generally the company that has built an algorithm that essentially has undermined our democracy by you know building echo chambers in service of its own advertisers that steers views away from creditors and brands and that and the people who really do make content in this world I think it's you know it's inevitable to feel negative about this given the data breaches and everything else so their reaction was is somewhat understandable but I think the biggest problem that they face is that they're probably you know regulators don't understand the nuances here and I would want to see the norm I would see I wanna see regulatory effort made around holding Facebook to its word that it it liver to the structure of Libra and the spirit of it as being this external you know open-source model and that whatever fears rightly or wrongly exist around Facebook's capacity to extract data from users is you know it doesn't come to bear because of that structure rather than you know what could be actually be the worst of both worlds where they just focus as as regulators often do on these money laundering risks and the sort of the broad you know concerns they might have about deregulated money and therefore baked into the solution a model that essentially just reinforces the corporate control and the gatekeeping roles of these participants of these members you know you could just imagine regulators focusing on the wrong concerns and essentially in the process you know building regulatory capture into the system because many respects the capacity to build you know innovative permissionless systems is is often undermined by excessive regulation and compliance because that just becomes too costly for the little guys to deal with so you know we could have them overreact and just make things worse in terms of the risk of there being a corporate monopolistic gatekeeping role here or they could play a constructive role in in really ensuring that this is truly you know as close to decentralized as is as possible under the current permission system and that there is no way in fact that any of the members in facebook or any of them can you know control the process and extract data from individuals and so forth that would be that would be a good outcome I'm just not convinced that that these legislators understand the problem and that's what worries me well so now let's talk about this letter that Maxine Waters the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee and other members of Congress sent to Mark Zuckerberg Sheryl Sandberg and David Marcus one of the statements that I wanted to pull out here was they said that Libra and Kyle which is the wallet that Facebook intends to roll out would quote or could quote lend themselves to an entirely new global financial system that is based out of Switzerland and intended intended to rival u.s. monetary policy and the dollar do you think that's overblown or do you think that that is a possibility I would say that that's a feature not a bug the dominance of the dollar is a massive problem in the global economy like it did create so many distortions and it's saying I've written a book about this some time ago I mean it's like unfortunately yes what happens is that every sovereign nation will fight for what it regards as its interest but I think that this model right which is essentially and ironically something that John Maynard Keynes said that oh that there should have been a global system of money built on when he just you know he came up with model for Bretton Woods and he lost out because the US had the upper hand and they made the dollar the centerpiece of the global financial architecture but Keynes's model was a basket of currencies that he called the bank or and and here it is ironically Facebook essentially built Facebook and its partners let's be clear it's 27 other partners building a system that is it's not based on one particular currency it's a basket and I think that's a good thing because it's less volatile for for countries who get exposed to big sweeping exchange rate changes and for all of the distortions that happen in terms of correspondent banking and everything else mean way too much power in in New York banks hands precisely because the dollar has to be the intermediary so I'm passionate about this and I think that is barking up the wrong tree but it's suppose the way that any regulator is gonna say it I also think that you know that there's illusions there to the concern about a financial system and and what they often you know and Lutra I think that letter in fact had the words in there a too big to fail system that's a complete distortion of what too big to fail is too big to fail as a direct outcome of reserve banking of a fractional reserve banking I mean it is the very fact that bank since 2008 right we're talking about the financial crisis and there were multiple hops of counterparties placing counterparties facing counterparties and there was an absolute lack of visibility to the to the credit exposures of all of these institutions and the risk of essentially a massive global bank run that would come from that because you know these banks are not fully reserved that's the nature of banking it has fractional reserves so that would be that's what too-big-to-fail is is that is that you know you have to prop up these banks because the systemic risk of all those intermediated credit connections builds a potential disaster now this isn't the case unless they think then it's easy to regulate this this is focus on the one thing that this is supposed to be which is a fully reserved model now it's a little complicated because it's a basket not a one-to-one relationship but that's a mathematical thing and there's a very various ways in which that can be adjusted for it has to be heavily regulated must absolutely be audited and compliant and transparent but it doesn't create the same systemic risks as the current banking systems there might be other systemic risks for sure because if this just becomes a go to global payments rail but that's what visa is right that's what MasterCard is right what's the difference this is just a payment rail payment rails which parent rail should become a commodity all right we shouldn't there shouldn't be money to be made from payments it should be free and and and and that's that's what potentially Libre offers especially if Libre just is it you know enables a lot more competition on top of either it or other other platforms so I find that line of inquiry frustratingly misleading and and misguided it misses the dent misses the whole point really all right well there will be some people that will make money from these payment rails but we're gonna so we're just gonna take a quick water okay oh yeah so let's do this in a moment so and we're also at that point I want to ask you a little bit more about like Facebook school of Financial Inclusion but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins government-backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy

Unchained and enter the giveaway back to my conversation with Michael Casey so what did you want to save about because you know as I mentioned the validators they're gonna be making quite at least your your previous publication The Wall Street Journal estimated that it could be quite profitable for them to be running nodes so it's not like you know this is literally a community effort you know no no I don't think that we should be deluded to believe that this is is nothing but a profit-making business but you know that it's it's a classic reserve management model from what I gather right that there is a the ten million dollars that you put up front essentially you know backstops funds that come in and as as tokens get tokens get issued Frank right you're running the reserves on the back of that and you can make money at that that's a standard model all reserve models are built on that you know that you could legislate that they can't but that's you know that that's the way that's actually interestingly you know kind of a legacy of the financial system itself that allows you to do that but there's that there's a benefit that one hands over to whoever's providing that service in return for you getting you know a liquid cash payment system but we all do that without checking accounts I mean of course we get a small amount of interest on our checking accounts maybe they could be mandated that they have to pay some level of interest back to to the token holders I'm not sure but it's just it's really not much different from everything that we have we're yeah yeah yeah what's ironic is that what makes this work is the fractional reserve banking system as the source of income for them right I mean right but then again you know holding it all in a cash deposits one play of course there's also tea bills and everything so then you could you could legislate that and dictate that they can't there's only certain places they can hold it in fact that that's more or less what will happen I would think well so there's two kind of takes that you've had I think on regulation of Libra and one is Oh like you know I hope that they don't kind of stymie the development of this this could be a really good outcome certain especially the unbanked but then you know on the other hand you said oh well you know they definitely need to regulate it for these reasons so like in your world if you if you were in the position of the regulator how how do you how would you proceed well obviously I mean yeah so to be clear hopefully that doesn't sound too contradictory I just think that it's smart regulation right so I don't think that it should be regulated in in the context of a too-big-to-fail systemic risk problem and and the some sort of threat to to the dollar and even know what laws we would have to build to challenge that and I and I certainly don't think that you know you should build custody requirements and so forth that might make it really expensive for other innovators to build on top of this so those are the things I wouldn't do I know I'd look at all the bit license problems that came up and in terms of how that killed off innovation and be very careful about that because if you know if you want to avoid these big companies from becoming monopolistic then don't don't put too big burdens on innovators who would compete with them but what I do think they should regulate is you know is reserve management right so they obviously you know strict rules on on on auditing transparency on on what they can do with the reserves right that that that to me is fundamental to the the broader idea of risk within this and and and that that's a key part of it and in data and and trying to build in privacy connection protections in this and actually being sort of pro privacy of course that runs counter often to the AML and kyc demands that the banking system currently has but I think this is a this is the kind of moment for a very smart conversation about what is what are our priorities and when it comes to you know banking the unbanked or or you know Financial Inclusion or how we want to call it resolving the challenge of how we identify under the arc you know the anachronistic current models that we have people in countries that just do not have reliable state IDs and and and systems for checking on that figuring out how to do that in a way that just actually enables them to be included and that you know doesn't burden them that data to me is a great opportunity right now with this that regulators could speak good it's up to think intelligently about you know using some of this technology to manage and assess risks on a broad basis but not sort of build this very excessive personalized kyc model for for people who simply can't live up to those standards unfortunately you know I think the way that the fat.if is going the Financial Action Task Force with its travel rule for crypto it doesn't look like that's necessarily something's going to open up but I do think that this is something that that the face book and its partners at Libre could be could quite constructive in they could have a very constructive conversation with regulators about so it's a smart leaner approach to kyc AML that doesn't say you know shut down Somalia entirely just because you can't figure out who the guy on the other end of the line is hmm yeah it's hard to know what that would look like on the ground but um one thing I wanted to ask you about so let's just get past the regulation issues for a second if Libra were to succeed kind of as he described it as this basket of currencies that kind of I guess removed some of the dollar hegemony and just you know actually was really widely adopted to the point of helping to Bank the unbanked then what do you think what kind of impact do you think that would have like what would we see kind of in developing economies where there are a lot of unbanked people and also frankly how would that affect those governments but on the ground you know the on-the-ground impact as well as that kind of this the second really really important because it will come down to whether or not in those government's they take a smart regulatory stance on this or not and and and what their priorities are first of all I I share all right or at least to say I appreciate some of the cynicism around the the view that that this is really all about Financial Inclusion and not just about you know making a bunch of companies rich they think that's an OK and healthy skepticism that we see III think that that however anything that reduces the cost of value transfers in global money flows that sort of you know does a run around of the distortive you know correspondent banking system will have benefits broadly for global inclusion it will just make accessing and onboarding cheaper and easier so I I think that we need to look upon the prospect of financial inclusion within that broader perspective and not necessarily get to sort of rose-colored glasses about about this all being about the poor that said I obviously care deeply about it and want that to be something that any company working in this space works hard on and it's good to see that there's a number of NGOs within the structure of Libre that might be able to hold that to bear and might be able to put resources toward developers to focus on apps and the like that specifically helped that kind of community and that's a good thing what's going to be interesting like let's take India for example which is very skeptical of cryptocurrencies right and it has its own approach to solving Financial Inclusion it has its own very centralized identity system adaiah which has come to a lot of Cruisers criticism for the hacking risks associated with it and the sort of centralization of bio data that comes in that and is you know a proud large economy that I suppose likes to have its own currency there's gonna be a challenge no doubt to the idea that it's for its people might prefer a non rupee based currency that's more stable than the rupee itself and and that that might be seen as as a risk to their to their current structure I just I suppose hope oh I think there needs to be a really rich conversation about how the payoffs from having at least the payment system as it or at least a global payment system reside in something outside of the rupee is actually really beneficial to Indians as a whole to the Indian economy as a whole and on that basis that it's a pretty it's a decent compromise to give up some of the sovereignty over that aspect of it am i confident that an India or any other country for that matter is gonna willingly do that I not not always I think some countries are going to be much more broad-minded about it than others you know be seen to see what Venezuela's new whoever it is takes over from between something realistic would say to this kind of model because they would recognize the absolute harm that having your own sovereign currency that's badly managed has done to the welfare of the people so Argentina willingly put itself under a currency peg a few years ago it wasn't necessarily the best choice but there was an acknowledgment there that the only way to for the country to grow was to essentially handcuff itself away from having monetary policy so these are tough questions but a realistic assessment of what's in it for your country and ultimately in the long run for your economy is what I'd love to see the part of the conversation here as you can tell I'm saying love to hope to you know not necessarily all that confident but these are the this is interesting for the sake of just raising the conversation having you know all of this is going to be really interesting and hopefully it brings us to a point where we can truly discuss these things like the strength of the dollar and how that's a huge burden to developing countries like India who beholden to the the you know the the monetary policy the United States and just like whether or not those same developing countries might want to defer to a more basket like structure for the simple reasons that the payment that people can have a more stable form with payments for international money those seem to be on on the table for conversation and at least it's good of the discussions now generally going to continue Wow so you you're kind of implying there that governments might actually also prefer something like Libre a basket of currencies is that we're saying before in the sense that like if if you if your own a guy you want you got to look at it I mean there's the cynical way in which many people and the crypto sort of libertarian sorta crypto look upon government is that they're nothing but an entirely selfish entity that is driven around power of printing its own money and part of that is true and and that is that is a concern but there is such a thing as an honest government that says I want to do what's best for my people and if in the if I can see how giving up on that that you know engine of of bureaucratic control that is the printing press I actually benefit from unlocking payment flows then then that's that that's a perfectly reasonable decision for them to make some will make it I mean you've seen countries through history as I said I wasn't Tina did I mean you know that they didn't make the best choice but there's there's a willingness to give up on that where it benefits the population where your long-term economic growth is built upon it so I'm not as cynical to believe that owning the printing presses is something that governments will never give up and I think this is an opportunity to have that conversation now and and that's what I'm hoping comes out of it alright well we will see where this goes thanks so much for coming undone confirmed it was a pleasure Laura thanks for having me thanks
