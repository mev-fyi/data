that was when I was the most disillusioned with Dao's and D5 and the whole crypto space India I just thought looks to me like it's all uh like a fugazi and when I looked at maker I didn't even see how

welcome roon happy to be here you proposed a change to maker Dow that is now going to be adopted and makerdale has been around for quite a while it's very well established so why is it that you wanted to implement this big change yeah maker has at this point I think existed more than eight years and I mean it's really a project that's like a product of the early ideological kind of you know very early days right sort of coming out of the the kind of ethos and the community of originally Bitcoin um and then into you know very early ethereum community and I mean from the very beginning we have been driven by this you know passion and vision of decentralized finance and having it actually do something real for the world right actually impact users for real um and I mean I think obviously that's why many people in the space uh but also at the same time I think you see today that there's a lot I mean there's a lot of stagnation to some extent right this is especially you have we had D5 summer we had the Bull Run yet we didn't actually end up seeing too much sort of real new innovation coming out of it and I actually think that a major reason for that is because of doubts and the challenges and the problems of Dallas but also the massive opportunity of doubts right because basically what dials are is like they are supposed to be this like governance layer that makes it possible to decentralize not just uh you know kind of the infrastructure Finance but the actual the decision making right the the kind of the the the the you know the hap the halls of power the balance of power the the kind of what's going on behind the scenes which is what really matters actually right which is where the real problems occur as well in finance um so that's a sort of meant to be the solution to that right that actually can give us this like utopian future of properly centralized Finance Financial inclusion banking on bank right like more transparency more efficiency all this good stuff what ended up happening is I mean I think Dallas and also just like crypto tokens in general just ended up not really working out so well in most cases right and I think in makers I mean maker is not nearly as bad as what happened in so many other cases right uh but what we still ran into in maker was just that I guess the naive the naive ideal of a Dao doesn't work in the sense that the idea is you have this token you distributed to a bunch of people and then they sort of harmoniously uh you know happily get together and make clever decisions for Mutual benefit right uh well rather I mean that actually sort of works when you're small so you have everybody knows each other everybody trusts each other right uh like a tight-knit community so everyone know you know knows that everyone else is moving in the same direction but then once you grow past a certain size then that kind of breaks down because you don't know you no longer know if everyone else is moving in the same direction and then what happens is you run into I mean what we I guess you we call coordination problems right or kind of like you know strategy of the commons or like the prisoner's dilemma where how that really manifests itself in maker was this uh like sort of this very uh difficult uh time we have sort of managing our expenses and whether anything was actually happening and through all the expenses that the the dial is generating right so like I mean maker is like the oldest style in the world it controls the biggest decentralized stable coin in the world it has like I mean more than 100 million uh like 130 million dollars in income per year currently it has something like a bit more than 40 million dollars per year in expenses and at its peak it was even more like for a long time we actually didn't even like actually our our income wasn't even that high but our expenses was even higher and and like the biggest problem was it was sort of out of control like nobody really knew what are we actually paying for how are we paying for it uh the system was sort of just like chugging along with with this base the basic process being that people make proposals to the Dow uh no longer as it was originally for the sake of the hotel but primarily for their own sake right because what they saw was everyone else is doing the same thing and you get this kind of coordination problem so at the time actually when I mean basically and this is actually at the height of the Bull Run uh that was when I was the most disillusioned with Dao's and defy and the whole crypto space in him I just thought looks to me like it's all uh like a fugazi and when I looked at maker I didn't even see how makeup was going to survive it looked like makeup was completely there was not really a way for it to to sustain itself because it just looked like people weren't collaborating there was no incentive for them to collaborate right the only incentive was uh focus on yourself right yeah I honestly feel like that disillusionment comes for all people who've been building in crypto for a long time during the the height of the bull runs yeah I mean absolutely and of course and the thing is I mean now it's obviously just uh what it really was is like a growing pain thing right and I ended up kind of uh I mean basically determining not to give up on the project and then just being like okay well I guess we need to go back to basics and sort of uh rethink how can you make how can you design a dow to go beyond this naive idea that you just give people a token and then they're gonna work it out basically what I whatever what I looked at one of the main things I looked at is like all the things that worked really well with D5 summer and then like sort of how these failure modes happen in practice as you scale up and as you sort of lose it's kind of like I mean I think maybe the main one of the really main factors in this is this kind of Disconnect with what impact you're having in the dial it's like any particular individual may be doing a whole bunch of stuff but there's not like feedback like maybe they're doing great but they don't really get a reward necessarily beyond what they would have done if they had done they hadn't done very well and and that lack of a feedback just like really you know it's it's discouraging but it also I mean it's also the other way around but if people are doing bad things then nothing happens and then they get really encouraged to just be like okay well then I should just focus on getting more money out of it so what I came up with after looking kind of trying to to um deconstruct all of this essentially right and try to think about it again from first principles was I mean it's a it's a it's a it's a method I call it alignment engineering but it's sort of like it's I mean it's basically it's based on on this concept of like organizational alignment uh and organizational design but applied to a Dao where it needs to be decentralized rather than uh sort of emanating from a from a leadership team right so it's like methods that you use in traditional organizations to get people to be on the same page to work together um you can apply similar ideas to a Dao through this person in our case we call alignment engineering I mean the kind of the tagline of it is that we want to scale constructive participation right we want to as we scale we want to keep getting more people involved and as people anticipate it should always be constructed right so they just keep they just naturally collaborate and if you have more people they're just generate even more value right and they always kind of you know on the same page moving in the same direction right and you do this through well-designed tools that make this easy for them right and makes it sort of natural for them to to work together in a way that actually um is constructive and then uh gamification so you kind of make it an experience to participate right like a contributor to Dao is also a form of user so you need to like gamify uh kind of you know you need to think about the experience they have participating and then you also incentivize finally right so you you design very Advanced incentives rather than just this sort of very simple original uh idea of a Dao of like everyone gets a token and then bam they're all on the same page and and they're it's just gonna work right but if you put these three elements in place right tools gamification and incentives then you can actually give people a lot of autonomy and a lot of freedom to sort of operate and do what they think is best within the Dow as long as you add the sort of the final layer which is governance boundaries so you need to have a mechanism to sort of set some kind of boundaries where you have it you get autonomy you get to um you know make your own decisions and not have to deal with kind of the crushing bureaucracy of a dial which is another frustration of dance right um but there's of course going to be like there's going to be certain rules where basically if you step outside the rules then we know you're being misaligned and it's sort of not I mean it's basically uh it's a little bit like a legal system actually in a sense right that you have a kind of a as long as you follow the rules then all the factors combined mean that we can expect that you're your input to the dial is constructive and it's generating value yeah to me it sounds like what you're trying to create is something like the original or I mean like Bitcoin where um you have this coin and incentivizes Mining which is needed for the network to have security but you want to do it for kind of like other things in maker Dow so describe kind of the whole end game plan and I know there's like four phases a Rebrand sub-dial farming voter rewards governance AI tools so why don't you just walk us through each of these phases well and first of all I mean it's exactly the Bitcoin thing that's exactly what we would like to go for in the sense that that's what we we can't be exactly like Bitcoin but we often call it like a Bitcoin like end game the name endgame is chosen because we want to reach this like Bitcoin like state of a higher level of ossification and certainty and reliability of like the future state of the system right and yeah so so the way we Implement all this I mean all this stuff I was talking about is basically through these like four major different aspects of the alignment engineering so the first one is just like the The Branding and the design of the system and this I guess is maybe like I mean on one hand this is gonna matter a lot for growth and of course growth is like a really I mean it's essential I mean the whole point of this is we want to make this system super robust so that we can grow it really large and it will not fall apart so I mean it would be pointless to do it all without also making sure we focus on growth and um the reason why we believe there's a big opportunity for a new brain is because basically the original brains were just they were kind of made up without too much thought being put into it right and the big problem is there's two of them there's like two separate Brands and they're actually great for like I mean they're great for like sort of classic crypto and also very important to know that they will they will stick around right so nothing will actually happen to mkr or die uh but there will be like this new sort of third umbrella brand that will include a new stable coin and a new governance token um and they will then have kind of the same brand you know so it's not uh two completely separate sort of uh things that that you don't naturally associate with each other but rather it's like is like the brand and then like the Dao for the brand basically I mean one of the reasons one of the things we noticed was that we would go to events and people would be like yeah use diet I love the io it's great and then they'd be like what the hell is maker I've no idea I've never heard of it I have no idea what that is right like there's so many people like that and actually also the Legacy stand the other way around because MBR holders are like I mean NPR right now is like a very unique token in in crypto in that we have this like super low Supply and just like a kind of a very uh sort of a culture that has always been very focused on like fresh like being very rational and sort of there's like Risk Management Focus and that's just also resulted in that a lot of the holders of mcap token aren't necessarily die useless or even like that much of like regular crypto uses um but there's like this very sort of unique and specific type of uh mkr um ecosystem participant and we really hope to change that because that is also I mean getting more overlap between the users and those who govern the system that is by itself also I mean a key step of alignment engineering right because now we naturally get an alignment where I mean the people who could run the system they're much more likely to use it so they're much more likely to like think about what do your users want and how do we keep them safe and that's going to inform their decisions so basically what you mean is like comp compound unit swap you need is that what you're getting at that like literally just the names need to be more similar yeah but I mean you could think of I mean but it could be something right I mean there's like it's like compound and comp and then there'd also need to be something like compusd right that's sort of the in our case we we have both a stable coin and uh a governance token that have to be very similar and the Big Challenge right now is like if you're trying to describe the whole ecosystem there's actually not really a word for that right like I mean the closest would be maker down but the most important part of the ecosystem is die and that's not even contained in the name maker right and then not to me I mean I would go on about I've got all these like so I mean all the kind of obvious issues that came up many years later when I realized this name is actually really sticky and and you know it pops up everywhere and it's used a lot in different contexts and ultimately it was not designed with that much foresight so I wanna I mean I basically think that NPR and die are great brands for like so crypto insiders because they have this history and they're sort of Classic Brands right so they're very valuable and need to be you know maintained and nurtured and serve their Niche basically but for this major push towards growth to what's actually spreading I mean breaking the stagnation of defined crypto that we're in now getting new users involving me get people to stop losing hope in crypto and stop seeing it as just a chance game but instead see some kind of opportunity something exciting to get into that's basically it's it's the right moment to then come out with like a much more well thought through brand that can serve this role of like being the vehicle of all these new features I mean all the later stages of endgame basically and then also just be like simpler I mean and this is kind of Simplicity is sort of it can be hard to see how that's even possible right because I mean maker is famously complex right but what our I mean our approach is we want to be friendly but complex I guess you can say right so and I always keep comparing it to like gamification like a video game right right if you start playing a new video game uh it could be massively complex it could be so many things but when you're playing it it's fun and you're not overwhelmed because it keeps you on like the right you know keeps you on the right track right it slowly lets you delve deeper into the world if you want that or just you can just stay in the very beginning and just never get into any of the complex stuff and not feel like you're doing something wrong which I think is kind of the problem with maker often today is that it's like either you just die and you don't even know what maker is or like you try to understand what maker is and you feel like you know like you feel like you're not even welcome but one thing is like you're calling in a Rebrand but you're keeping the original Brands and then just launching two new tokens right which is a different sort of thing like why why not just rename mkr and and die well I mean so I would say it's a Rebrand in the sense that the website will change for instance right so all it'll it's more like so that so the overarching brand of what it is will change I mean you actually cannot really you can't really uh rename tokens uh I mean it's very difficult to try to do so uh because they have a you know they've got like this sort of identifier on chain that the term that determines the name that's one thing the other thing is I mean there's going to be a lot of people who will just like freak out who you know who will generally uh get a heart attack right thinking that their money is lost or something so you'd never I mean we actually I mean we consider that but in practice it's just the risks the unknowns of trying to do that are are very severe uh I think and then finally on top of that I mean there's a lot of I mean there's five billion die in circulation right there's a lot of users that I'd like that and they that's what they're familiar with that's what they like to use um there's no reason why they should be disturbed right and for MPR I think I mean some people they think it's super cool that it's just like super low Supply token um and and it's just like it's sort of an OG token right and similarly I don't think that there's any reason to kind of mess with that what we can do is because we're offering so many new features and all of these new features are growth focused in particular the the subdial framework which you'll talk about in just a second right we but basically we can we can be like look you can stay with the whole system and not know what's going to mess with you and everything will be safe and nothing's gonna happen to your money and if you want to try to upgrade to basically what is just a new brand uh same security you know same governance same guarantees as the system has always offered you then there's all these new features that you can access but it's entirely optional and you can go you can go back again right so you can switch from die to this uh new stable coin and if you don't like it you can just switch right back and it's so it's completely risk-free right so this I think is actually is crucial in in making sure that there's nobody who gets you know who gets more confused or you know like overwhelmed by It's gotta be it's gotta be fun right it's Gotta feel and it should never feel like you're getting stressed out and and you rather just do something else in this overwhelming complicated crypto stuff right all right so now let's talk about sub-dial farming as a segue to that one last thing to mention about this uh Rebrand of the terms of these new tokens right is that as a part of the Rebrand and so this is by the way this is I think it's called phase one so this is the first change that will come will launch like the end of uh next year and so as a part of that there's the new stable which will get some you know get this new name new brain and then the new uh the new gov token we call it as a codename and the new gov token will be redenominated so that's the thing about the low Supply thing program so there'll be a lot of these new it'll be like they'll redenominate one to twelve thousand so it's kind of like a wrapper like grabbing your your if into rap teeth but you get for one Eve you know for one mkr you get 12 000 new gov tokens up and then you can also go the other way so there's no risk to doing it but the other uh new feature that comes immediately in Phase One in addition to this region nomination is that you will immediately from the moment phase one begins you will be able to farm new golf token with new stablecoin so immediately in addition to having these aligned brands if you hold a stable coin you can get the governor's token for free and so this is a way to really try to get those user bases to Overlay um and then from there we go into phase two which is kind of like the big launch the the phase one we call it the beta launch because that's just like getting the conditions in place for kind of like you know getting the Rebrand in place getting the the a lot of the basic infrastructure and getting these new tokens in place and then when we get to phase two that's the really I mean that's kind of that's the big the big launch that I think if we execute correctly it's gonna change the industry like it's really gonna it's gonna it's gonna be a before or after uh with with these sub that's because nothing like this like nobody has ever done this not even like small experimental projects has done anything as ambitious as what we're trying to do and we are like basically the largest D5 project and we are you know really uh playing with like with I mean the most powerful uh sort of potential and possibilities of what you can do with with D5 and blockchain um that's been discovered so far right and basically what we're doing is we are launching six new dials and six new governance tokens at once and this is I mean a really key reason why we're doing this is because of this content and Alignment engineering that we want to I mean we want to gamify and we want to incentivize and so the key is that we want to kind of take all the complexity all the features of maker and kind of split them off from the core so the chord is really really simple uh and it just focuses on sort of some very basic functions like keeping the the stable coin uh stable and safe and then all these like uh Advanced features and initiatives and things like marketing and growth uh you know and Innovation all this stuff that gets basically split out into these sub-dials and then as a user you can Farm any of these sub devs if you hold the stable coin so now as a as a stable fund user as a I mean basically as a customer of the system right it's an end user you get this like full uh access to like what part of the system do you think is interesting do you want to participate in I mean one thing is that the subtitles what they focus on is like different um you know different parts of the business right so some of them I mean a big split in particular initially will be some of them focus on like deep crypto so there's like spark protocol for instance that's an already like I mean early stages of flesh out some doubt that focuses on innovating on the the you know the classic uh D5 borrowing uh functionality um and sort of is so that's sort of going in direction of this like deep D5 deep Tech deep crypto uh then we also got the rebel assets which is the kind of the big I mean the other big thing that makers really uh you know famous for has a lot of momentum in right now is that we have very very Advanced and large-scale deployment of real assets which is doing really well because rates are super high right now in traffic um and so this is also getting split up into other something else um and and basically the idea is that I mean you know back to this earlier thing I was talking about right that there's so much like we used to have so much expenses so much stuff happening it's totally overwhelming like it's like if you do one thing somewhere you'd have no idea if you actually like if you're doing the right if you're doing it right or not and it's a Togo holder you just have no it's impossible to like you can't both be an expert you know like Cutting Edge blockchain Innovation and complicated questions of legal structure in 30 different jurisdictions around the world but especially not if you're supposed to be like kind of a casual Dow participant right you're not even getting paid right you just have to and it's definitely not like fun and it's like kind of like a full-time job and yeah very few people did that and could really do that so um with the sub-dials I mean we basically try to make it we split it up into these more like focused bite-sized chunks kind of right like projects and then um they will they all have their own Community they all have their own culture or their own design their own language their own you know like the idea is also to tap into actually to to this other thing that we discovered in um D5 summer which is like I mean we actually call it very Simplicity like the nft uh sort of Dimension right like that there's something Beyond just cold Hard Cash there is a sense of community like a sense of of shared values right that that draws people into what's possible with blockchain and immutable infrastructure right so that's also something we can harness and subtitles to ultimately get something like for instance a community that is like look we are all in it together to uh you know make really uh push to the limits what's possible Rebel assets and uh do things like trade Finance or funding small businesses and actually act as like the the the connection between the kind of the bulky economic might of of maker itself and then small businesses in emerging markets that could really benefit from having direct access to this the thing is make ourself will never be able to do this it's way too complicated right and possible to scale but with a sub-dial you can have the subject in between sort of essentially like take the risk of this interaction kind of um by putting up their own capital and make their own decisions with their tokens right so they can vote with their own governance tokens and they farmed and they sort of you know they self-organized by finding the same token now they're voting with this token to bet on business ideas that they think are going to pay and in doing so they can sort of basically borrow cheaply from maker and then land at a higher rate to small businesses in emerging markets for instance and then if they succeed and they get some good yields in return and not and don't have a lot of defaults then they get the most of the reward so now you've dealt with this problem of like this sort of apathy of like it doesn't matter what I do makes no difference to me that we had in the early days now suddenly it's like if you get in a good sub-dial and you make a big difference and the stuff that does well you're gonna get really really rewarded because most of those Rewards will go to that specific subdial which will be a much smaller group right and they'll be only doing that one thing so that's how you resolve for the issue of you know um people when they Farm they often just are there during the time when they can get a lot of new tokens which then they you know dump or whatever to make a quick profit so this is your way of getting people invested so they stay longer term rather than just trying to farm and then move on to the next farming opportunity it's actually a slightly different issue like I actually think so we actually don't mind people farming and the selling them we just want some people will not do that and those are the ones we want those who just sell a token that's actually also fine because the trade-off is if you farm with your new stable then you cannot get the savings rate so there is kind of a cost to getting the uh the subnaut tokens and that is that you're not getting you're not getting a savings rate in cash so that way it sort of equilibrates over time right that is what you'll be able to find with the tokens will be I mean it'll likely be more than you can get from the savings rate since that's that's you know very reliable stable cash right but it will not be I mean but basically at some point more and more people will Farm the startup tokens and the the value you know the yield will go down but it will never go lower than the savings rate because if the savings rate anyone can get that right so if you know if you're farming yourself down and you can get a higher yield switching to the savings rate then you're gonna switch over to that and and this then means that the system is actually it can do this sustainably basically because as people Farm the subnaut tokens they deposit Capital into the call maker system and the core Mega System then allocates that Capital out into collateral that generates a yield and if you're then farming yourself that token you don't get the yield yourself the call gets the yield and uses that yield to then basically create and support the sub-dials and so it's you know so basically you can choose to get a yield cash or you can just get it sort of indirectly as a sub-dial but then as you get it indirectly as a subdial this whole universe of gamification and incentives uh and and possibilities is available to you if that's something you're interested in and and again it's all about making it as easy as possible Right it needs to be really straightforward and by having many different choices there's a greater likelihood that there's going to be something for for you know for people who are interested in in that right so something like real assets or deep uh crypto or even I mean one of the kind of the things we are looking at until experimenting with right now is like it's like a sub-dial that is focused on on the Japanese community and sort of we you know it's kind of like you're trying to take a completely different angle of like instead of making a focus on particular product a product uh then it's more about like a brand a set of values a culture and and I mean and specifically the Japanese crypto Community which is quite it's it's kind of quite distinct uh I mean I guess a lot of crypto communities in Asia are very uh independent but the Japanese communities particularly so due to like language barriers and also like cultural differences something like that but what we what we have found is that there's actually a lot of I mean westerns basically in crypto they think all this stuff are like Japanese values likes uh Japanese like art anime this kind of stuff that's something that's like really that's appealing to them and through a sub-dial it's like you can offer something I mean it's in the end it's just it's just a yield right it's just an interest rate but you can offer it now in a like in a completely different form right like it's something it's not just like rational Cold Hard Cash with no uh like sort of I I don't know fret like gray boring thing that's just like doing math and managing your finances it actually can become like a sort of an emotional gamified experience even right of like participating in something um and and and finding something that sort of resonates with your own values and finally and this is the most important part is not going to blow up in a Ponzi scheme because this stuff happened during the bull run right but the problem is it was abused to create Ponzi schemes and and take people's money and that's the big difference with the subdials is that all this sort of the the economics and the the tokonomics and the the all these like value flows are very you know balanced and and you know they're like designed to to be sustainable uh as they that's the main objective right it's not about like pump and dump it's not about uh getting people to like buy a token uh that you know without knowing what they're gonna get in return rather it's like basically taking the core maker values the call maker knowledge that we build up over all these years and then actually making that available to these more uh I guess like more fun more flexible more um independent communities so that you get kind of the best of both worlds all right so in

you to explore and build without compromise Propel your project and Community forward by visiting arbitrim dot IO today back to my conversation with roon so we've discussed the Rebrand we've discussed sub-dial farming um now let's discuss the other two phases so what we call phase three is a little bit more uh fluid because it's gonna be we're gonna start implementing that immediately uh in fact you could say this is actually maybe what we started doing right from the beginning but so phase three is the implementation and maybe you could say phase three is like the delivery of the governance AI tools and the sort of the core governance infrastructure to a point where the system is able to run autonomously um and you know run without I mean basically without needing any particular person involved right without needing like me being involved or other like uh core team members or something like that um and we already have we're already pretty far in some in some ways uh with doing this because the very beginning of the end game uh was that we uh created this thing originally we called the maker Constitution but now we change the name to the maker Atlas and so that's because basically Constitution has a lot of connotations and baggage that it turned you know we just want to avoid and and it's a new thing it's not it's not exactly the same as a constitution basically it's not exactly the same as a legal system um but it's it's similar and it's it's kind of like a mechanism for creating like at this sort of the outer layers of it it's it's about creating governance boundaries but then you kind of weave those boundaries and the processes and the principles that you you create that are possible within uh this this structure and you use that to basically design um and Implement and enforce alignment engineering yeah so the Alice is this rule set basically that sets the boundaries and then codifies all this alignment engineering the different ways it's implemented in a system a schemification as incentives and as tools that are provided to the participants and it's actually it's it's already in place uh today so it was it was sort of the thing that signified that endgame was actually approved by maker governance was when the first uh version of the atlas was approved uh so that was back in I believe February of this year and since then it's basically what happened to maker governance is that it changed to a format where now the way governance works is that continuously the community updates the content of the atlas uh basically just making it more and more uh sort of fleshed out specifying more and more things uh the the key objective from I mean in the beginning was simply just trying to like codify and document and make explicit all the different like you know processes and rules and interactions that have been occurring for a lot of the stuff we've been doing in making in maker governance throughout the years but a lot of which a lot of it was sort of this informal stuff that wasn't like really official but sort of worse and it was very hard to get involved with right and it was very opaque and so the first stage of the atlas is just trying to document that but the kind of the end stage I mean the place where we want to go with Atlas is it's supposed to actually contain all relevant data for the entire project so that the definition of like what is relevant data becomes uh it's in the atlas and when what that means is it would not be possible to find any information at least in theory that is like useful or relevant to the ecosystem that is not inside the atlas if that I mean the reason why we are so interested in this is because today or rather in the past especially it renews this overwhelming sort of uh hunt to figure out where do I go to get this information like how do I find out who do I talk to like how to do this stuff it was like very sort of opaque you'd have to go to five different websites and talk to five different people and go to some different sections in the Forum or something like that right and then instead the atlas is like it's a single place where 100 of that data is contained and if it's not contained there it doesn't exist like it's not a part of the system well I the one thing I wonder so I I understand um yeah having kind of like a central repository for the information but one thing that confused me was I'm sure you're aware that these newly launched AIS um obviously they're really interesting and they can give you accurate answers but they don't always and sometimes they get creative and so I I wondered why you were going to integrate this super new technology when it felt like a basic search would be better like a really good search do you know what I'm saying or maybe you can limit the AI so it doesn't get like yeah creative with with the answers and basically go beyond kind of what's there absolutely right and I mean and then the first thing to hammer home is that the atlas itself is an AI right it's actually just a whole bunch of data and ultimately all of that data has to be human readable and all the processes have to be sort of possible to do manually as a human um so actually what the AI I mean but it just happens to be that if you put all possible data that's relevant to Dao into a giant fi I mean document or like basically a file I mean eventually you're not gonna it's not gonna be accessible for someone especially someone who's supposed to be you know just having fun and being sort of casually participating and the whole point is we want to make it so that anyone can participate in this right anyone can access this it shouldn't just be the ultra specialized full-times right and so that's I mean that's actually at the stage where like I mean the AI tools come in um they are really I mean they're really just supposed to act essentially as like search uh pattern matching systems that assist humans in interacting with these processes that ultimately are designed for humans and human readable so actually I think I mean uh so for I mean so first of all one thing is really important to realizes this means there's not going to be like one like maker AI or like one official AI system that's like the thing that decides what happens like nothing will actually be run by AI it's rather that humans will have a lot of very useful tools that makes it actually easy to navigate the atlas but at the same time they're gonna have to deal with I mean exactly what you're talking about that there's always going to be the potential for inaccuracy not just from the AI but actually also from other humans right so this is actually just like a normal part of governance um and the key way you you deal with this problem is diversification right so and I mean when you think about it from the perspective AI tools is that you want to have multiple different tools that work in different ways maybe just some that are just basic search uh tools right and While others are language models and maybe something I mean more exciting like uh symbolic AI or something you can use many different tools together right you can use search you can use uh language models and and so language models are particularly good at things like summarizing a huge amount of of uh complicated data for instance uh but in the future also more advanced AI is something like symbolic Ai and neurosymbolic networks and this kind of stuff so that and basically the key is that um humans are the ones running everything and all of these tools are just making it a lot easier so that it becomes possible at some like total casual Outsider to potentially you know completely like master all of the rules of the entire system and sort of be able to say like I'm gonna check out if there's anyone anywhere in the whole ecosystem that's breaking some tiny little Rule and that will actually be easy with the AI tools uh however it will not be correct 100 of the time so if you do that then all you will know is you'll basically know where to pay attention you're not going to know with 100 certainty here's somebody who's like breaking a particular rule but you'll know that here or over here is a good uh chance that there might be something that is you know if you look more into it there may be something that is that is misaligned with the rules and then the final sort of piece of the puzzle here is that as a total Outsider if you can basically sort of prove based on the rules of Atlas that somebody took an action that was against uh the rules as they are as they have been approved by the governance you can get a whistleblower bounty so this and and then uh the people who were responsible for following these rules and operating within the system they I mean that's basically that's the subdials right so primarily I mean the subtitles are the ones that are sort of doing all the the operating in the system and the subtitles have tokens and they have uh you know they have reserves and they have a treasury and they have collateral so when you like so basically they gotta pay your whistleblower bunny um and that means they're gonna you know they know that anyone can come and very easily ask all these powerful AI tools if we're not following the rules uh and they will have to pay so we'll there's you know that just creates this incentive to be very careful about doing things according to the rules right and the sub tabs themselves I mean they're also just made up of people right but they also have access to the same tools so they can basically ask the same tools like how can we operate so that we minimize the chance that we break the rules right again though they're still fundamentally responsible as humans for you know if if the AI is wrong then you know there's no way to like prove that prove that they they weren't intending to break the rules right the fact is they broke the rules so they got to always double check everything in and uh that's sort of the role of like the the humans in the system right is that they are like the final sanity chick and but as long as the AIS systems then perform correctly the humans just understand that they are taking the responsibility they are sort of pushing the button according to what the AI is suggesting then you could think of the system eventually especially as the AI gets very mature as a system that is like you know very rapidly able to iterate able to innovate able to make decisions through uh you know AI driven um uh sort of intelligence right and like thinking and reasoning about this is the data available this is the best possible Choice something like where should we allocate the collateral there's a new proposal we can process that super fast and be like yes we'll we'll we'll um we'll deploy the capital or maybe no we're not going to deploy with you but we'll consider these like you know 5 000 other possibilities and pick the best one out of them and that's the kind of stuff that today is like I mean that's completely out of reach of today's dials right like today's Dallas is like who's the I mean Step One is you've got to be friends with some Insider right and then step two is you gotta wait for two years for some like you know masochistic bureaucracy is it's sometimes called right and and with this kind of approach it's just things can be so fast right and sometimes there will be mistakes right so sometimes it'll go too fast and stuff that will be a little bit too fast and loose or maybe like will just like get used to just rub stamming whatever the AI is suggesting and then one day it's just hallucinating and setting on the wrong path but when those kind of mistakes happen then the overall like the boundaries right the life scales or the governance boundaries prevent any particular action from being like too massive in one go right uh so it's kind of a big part of the system is learning right that if a sub-dial does something it turns out to be a bad decision or a broken AI or something then maybe they suffer a loss um but that's fine I mean they're designed for that basically they've got they're over capitalized they got their tokens uh they sort of I mean so first of all they insulate uh you know maker from taking any sort of loss with all of their own Capital right but also because they're I mean they themselves practice you know well at least they have all the tools available and all the knowledge available to practice correct risk management then it also might just be okay well they will move too fast they took a loss but now they I mean now they know this is the way things can break so now they can sort of integrate that into the atlas and basically be like from now on we know that that whenever this happens we need to do some extra checks because otherwise it can go wrong and what's really cool about this is that this is not just going to be contained in one subdial right now that knowledge will like be available to the whole ecosystem so you again get this like Best of Both Worlds where on one hand you have these individual actors that can move fast and break things right and be very flexible and focus on particular specific areas but you also got this like very scaled up sort of network effect and economies of scale of of like a very large system where you gotta you just need to pay the price of making a mistake in one place at one time and now the whole ecosystem will learn that and will forever be able to access that data and uh and the AIS will be able to sort of think about okay well maybe they're doing something similar in some stuff that somewhere else but they can actually look and see like well there's other stuff now they did something that looks similar to what we were doing and there was a problem uh and and uh they you know they should have done these particular checks so we got to make sure we will do something similar and and the AI tools help the humans also try to sort of make those connections right and sort of search through all the data and then try to integrate it yeah I think I mean it sounds really interesting in that way and it does remind me of how people talk about how AI will be used in healthcare so that doctors who maybe are less familiar with certain things they'll at least have the knowledge that um comes from the experience of other doctors but uh you know a part of me thought well you could have some doubts that do things that are positive for them but negatively impact other sub-dials or negatively impact um the whole system which you know I I think it'll be an experiment for sure um one thing I wanted to ask you though is that Andreessen Horowitz oppose your plan um so why is it that you think the maker Dow Community decided to adopt it anyway well I mean I guess a big reason is that I'm just by far the most active uh you know large holder of the tokens right and I've been doing the whole thing uh uncommentate as well so I'm like a proper volunteer right so I think that well except you have slightly under 10 of the total make mkr Supply I think so yeah absolutely but I mean but the point is that if I didn't think that this would be beneficial because I hold all these tokens then I wouldn't do it right and on the other hand I mean more importantly I'm doing it because I think they will basically be worthless without it right like I don't think that the like basically in the current state uh like adapts will require like um you know I mean basically they they don't they just don't really work unless they are very close to to being centralized the way they currently work right so and from my perspective that's a that's like a dead end like so what we need is a is some kind of answer to this that is more than you know let's just pretend that's not the case or let's just hope for the whales are going to vote correctly or something like that and then I mean I think the final thing is that this sub-down model has immensely like helped this internal friction and drama that that I mean happens in every dial but especially happens a lot well it happens a lot you make it out right uh because and and that's what goes back to the thing of like the sort of the cultural element of of subtitles right that it turns out that in a doubt just like in any organization um I mean so much of what's happening is not rational it's not mathematical or financial it's all about it's like people working together and then some people having trouble communicating because they're different cultural differences or personality differences and and like in a in like a sort of a cookie cutter naive down there's this super dysfunctional Dynamic of if you have some kind of conflict between two people you can like escalate it publicly to sort of the code of public opinion which is just such a horrific yeah it's just such a terrible environment to work in um and yeah I mean it's really that everyone that's worked in the I mean basically throughout the years have been like crawling through the mud and and dealing with this kind of stuff in maker everyone did it because they saw this like lighter than the top of the tunnel they had this like belief that one day we'll figure it out we've got to be able to have some way we can create this like utopian decentralized organization right there's there's like Urban collaborative community and we'll figure out a way to get all the drama behind us and all this like dysfunction and and sometimes basically it's like the first realistic uh sort of answer to how to deal with this because what it means is oh well all the people that work well together they go on the same stuff now those that don't work well together just make sure that I'm going the same stuff though then suddenly it's like the the kind of the conflict becomes like I guess you could say explicit in a sense right and it turns into just competition and in fact a kind of competition where you still end up collaborating I mean I understand like why you're doing it but I don't know if it will necessarily turn out that everybody in One some doubt will disagree with will agree with each other because as time goes on and the Dow coalesces around um a certain purpose then there's going to be people who disagree on you know steps forward um so you we'll just have to see how it works out but I wanted to also ask you about what we mentioned earlier which is your large Holdings of the mkr token and you know to have this one actor that you know has such a large percentage of the supply that's that's a problem for a governance token so how are you trying to mitigate that problem um and or actually just solve it yeah actually I just wonder one thing I just want to mention about something else well so the answer is that's actually faceful so it's like the last phase is once everything else is in place then we get to the point of did we get to this the central issue of voter empathy but I just wanted to make one quick point about the Dynamics of subtitles and there's like the the question of alignment between people right so basically the thing is stuff that as well totally fail they will there will be subtitles that have drama and can function and they will actually you know they will go extinct essentially right they will just not make it they'll not be competitive compared to those that figure out how to work together I mean another Dynamic though is that you do also have the you know you can very easily walk away right so it could also just be that you're like oh this stuff that's not for me anymore but there's this other one that you know maybe is is uh compatible and then you can like you've got somewhere else to go which is not the case in in the in Old School uh make an old school model I think that's right but the most important ultimately is that sometimes they will just die out and then what the system does is just creates more and more so it just keeps creating new subtitles and the rate at which it creates new subtitles depends on how many they already are so the more they are the slower it creates new ones So eventually you get some kind of equilibrium where if they die if a lot of them die it just creates a lot of new ones and then those news ones they're gonna look at I mean effects it'll be you know it'll be integrated into the atlas like what happened that knows that where it didn't go well and what are they doing in the ones where it does go well maybe it's something like you gotta make sure you fly everyone together got to spend a lot of energy on having uh you know meetups or something like that and if you do that then it helps right or maybe you gotta really be laser focused on what is your focus area and if you're trying to do too many things then you get clashes up or maybe it's just there's just some people they're just not suitable and whenever they you you hire those into stepped out they help you know they make it blow up whatever it is you can kind of learn from it right it's kind of an evolutionary process and I mean I can't guarantee it's actually going to work I guess you know maybe they will all blow up in which case uh I think that's simply do not work and that's kind of my thinking with endgame in general that like this is like the last chance if it doesn't work then I don't I don't see how uh the idea works at all basically and but is if we just find a few instances where it works then we've got everything lined up to like learn sort of aggressively uh you know like build on top of that and learn from that and make sure that that's what's done and everything that goes against uh that everything that sort of goes in the wrong direction we can very easily sort of cut that off basically cut it loose and and you know really make sure we're focusing on this singular goal of actually making it work right actually trying to deliver the the true purpose of the of the project right end Okay so phase three the end like the end of phase three three is this I mean that's sort of that's basically the idea is that that's when we are at this stage where now we have a sense of we know how it works we know how to make it work right we know how to make and not blow up uh people so and and the AI tools are are mature enough and the address is mature enough to contain this knowledge and to help to very easily guide people into like you know so it could be something like the atlas contains a bunch of data related to how to constructively participate and the AI helps explain that to you in a way that you're going to understand as an end user so that whenever new people come in that very very much directed towards you know don't um make a bunch of comments about something or like make a bunch of proposals that's going to piss people off right don't do that because that's not going to work well right do something else like participate in this way and that's gonna help you understand how to constructively participate something like that right we'll we we like we'll be able to like grow the ecosystem and and participating isn't gonna require that you like have the right friends or have the right Mentor or something or have the right connection right you actually can sort of just come from outside and kind of integrate uh and it's it's easy and I mean it'll never work 100 of the time but it I think it will be like a lot of design will work because if people want it to work uh and they haven't enough of an open mind that they can fit into one of the you know six sub-dials that one of them is like it's the right fit for them I think all the cards are stacked in our favor in the sense of like that there's I don't think there's going to be many people who I mean if they have a genuine interest I don't think there's going to be many that's gonna not be able to find some place where uh they're going to fit in and when we finally have reached that stage that's when we then can go I mean when sort of phase three is done then we can go to phase four and so phase four is about basically locking down the governance by uh putting in place voter incentives so basically and we go through this system called this Sagittarius luck stake engine uh and so luck stick luck sticking is is like our our word for something it's similar to like the curve to economics right of like you you really lock your assets up into the system in our case it's you you don't lock it up behind a timer you lock it up behind an exit fee so it's like you if you're locked your new uh new gov tokens into the system uh with this I mean if your locks take them then if you want to un unstake basically unlock them again uh you gotta pay 50 of your principal so you can leave the next day but you gotta immediately pay 15 so it's a very steep price to pay right so once you're in like this you want to stay in for a long time uh and the reason why you want to stay in the reason why you want to get in the first place is because you're getting paid to vote uh and the way your paid is through um basically well well it's like a it's a choice so you can choose to either get paid in a percentage of the of the cash income of the system or in sub lab tokens so this is the one other way to become a sub-out token holder is to have uh the well the upgraded MPR new gov token and then lock stake and then get a large amount uh like I mean there's a relatively large amount of software terms you get this way because obviously there's going to be a lot of stable gun holders well not that many luck stickers compared to the stable controllers But ultimately I mean because the rewards for log statement will be so significant uh you know it'll be I mean there'll be uh there'll be a lot of people doing it right there'll be a lot of inflows uh because the yield will just be so so high that even with the exit fee uh it will be um you know it'll be irresistible basically to people who are already like participating in the system and then when that finally comes around I mean that's when when uh whales like me finally can can uh sort of pull back right and not really have to be so active and in theory I could like leave entirely right I mean that's what always that's always been my goal is I could get the system to a point where I could just entirely leave or go on on holiday for a year right and not even check in or anything right and just basically count on that all of the incentives including you've got these lock stickers that are locked in the system they have to vote and because it's expensive for them to leave they're going to be interested in making sure they vote in a way that doesn't damage the system like eight well actually they have to delegate so lock sticking requires that you delegate all right if they're delegating then they can Outsource the voting and then they don't need to actually be active yeah well I mean the way they're active is they're choosing how they are social voting so basically this is all a part of like the atlas and the governance AI tools um there's like a whole system of like checks and balances where basically the what we call the aligned delegates which are these like professional compensated delegates they have to follow specific strategies that are designed by another type of professional compensated participant called the aligned voter Committee Member um and this creates a sort of check and balance where in all cases there's a lot of rules around that basically when you participate as one of these aligned uh well actually they're called alignment conservers right the the number one uh job that they have that they're getting paid for is that they have to make sure that the boundaries of the analysts are respected and they're following what we call the spirit of Atlas so this basic idea that for instance uh I mean one of the things we keep we saw a lot that naturally tends to happen when you delegate is that the delegates tend to think that they should you know have more compensation and and the role of delegates should grow over time right that they should be doing get more responsibility and and this is like I mean it's a total natural thing if you're like on remote control and just delegate power and you're just like oh yeah you'll figure it out I'm not going to give you any support other than just telling you to figure it out yourself of course you're gonna then be like well then I have to you know put things in place so I have a chance to figure it out right that's actually a natural uh response for for people um when they're sort of thrust into that position of of uh of power and authority that they weren't even expecting to get right because that was that's not sort of there supposed to be the the point of being adult right but with with basically an end game as a delegate you got all you know you got this very streamlined gamified process you've got the atlas giving you a lot of boundaries a lot of of you know like data around how what's supposed to be how a decision is supposed to make made and you've got the AI tools to navigate all this and everyone else has got the ad tools to figure out if you're following the rules or not if you're remaining in alignment and so the end result is that as a voter as a luck sticker that's being um you know that's that's basically that can you can choose to lock into the system so you can get paid to vote your user experience is this I mean sort of like a gamified election basically that is like every single year you got to go and you gotta elect basically what you choose is you choose a delegate and then you choose a strategy and it's comparable to like I mean a democracy and choosing a political party and and we I mean right now the word the the terminology we use is that our equivalent of like the political Spectrum is that we got what we call dovish and hawkish governance right and so dovish governance that's like higher budgets you know lower rates lower spreads to users and there's like long-term focus of like let's grow let's get things done right and then hawkish is like lower the budgets increase the spreads right focus on on accumulating capital building up buffers uh sort of securing our financial situation today obviously there's a lot of other uh factors as well but but there is a very hard limit on like what is possible to make decisions about like so the analyst just like forbids you know something like let's change the world let's make it so delegates also uh do marketing and double their budgets or something right like that's a proposal this is like there's just no way that you could ever make that kind of a process because every single AI tool would just be like can't do that that's misaligned you're gonna get a business with a little Bounty for for shutting it down right and it's naturally like there's no way you could interpret the atlas to allows them to know that and same thing goes for I mean something like let's uh also launch uh I don't know derivatives Market from the call or something all of that would it would be the same would be like no way the call needs to be Bitcoin like as we talked about in the beginning right it needs to to stay the same and not get interrupted and not drift and not uh corrupt and just focus on this basic objective of stability and mitigating tail risk and then all that fun stuff and and you know all that experimental stuff go do that in the sub devs right so that's the other thing is if we have that outlet of like we're not saying we'll forever just be like the most boring thing and nothing can happen actually there's plenty of room for that it's just it needs to happen in these kind of uh de-risked sandboxes of the subdials right so if you want to do some phrase experiment then there's a plate there's a there's a time and a place for that where the incentives are correct and if you make a mistake you're gonna basically you know you can't like socialize that to everyone else it's gonna be for yourself specifically and the other participants in the subdial knows that that's what they're signing up for so um we'll get to the question about your allocation of tokens in a minute but why don't we just keep talking about some of the things that you're launching as you guys implement this new end game um that you have the spark lending protocol which you mentioned briefly earlier um you know you could talk about that and then I also you know die recently adopted an eight percent interest rate I don't think that's sustainable um but you know maybe you could talk about both of those things and what you're trying to incentivize so Spock protocol at sparked I was like that's kind of like the first subtitle that got really fleshed out um and basically it was I mean it's based on on the other code base um because it's just I mean basically it's like an attempt to adopt these like very modern uh powerful featured code base um and then uh yeah like use that to to experiment with having that in a sub-dial and then having the sub-dial determine things like what collaterals on board uh I mean we in maker we discovered that we were really really bad at picking collateral types and we paid huge sums of money to onboard all sorts of stuff and then we had to pay huge on the money to off-board it again and like we've developed oracles and we paid crazy gas costs with oracles and then we had to like shut down oracles again and usually we never made any money at all from all of these like random collateral types but it cost a lot of money and I guess even worse it cost a huge amount of governance attention so that's kind of an idea of spark spark dollies it's a Dao that you know maybe by only focusing on that and not being distracted by all the other stuff that we were distracted by maker they'll actually be able to pick the right pick the winners and you know mitigate the losses and if they're not able to then they're going to be the ones paying right it's not going to be the entire dial that'll be paying for this uh and you know maybe I mean it went on for like a year with before anyone noticed basically and that's the kind of the classic dial thing right that you just repeating the same thing and and nobody cares because it's so big that like any individual isn't really gonna have a you know gonna feel the effects of it in in the short run and then so leading up to I mean the launch of token farming for sparked out which is a lot of of interest in that right A lot of people are really excited to to get involved with it um but I mean but we basically want to make sure I mean we want to have as many people as possible to to farm these tokens and to I mean we want to really grow the the demand for for die right for this well for this new stable climb this new brand so we can I mean I guess hopefully break the stagnation in the space and and and you know bring in a new uh you know a new wave of users and show them that there's actually something exciting that can be done that isn't going to be a scam or a hack or something the problem is that right now maker is mostly seen as is right it's like I mean well Dai is used for as a stable coin uh it's not really perceived as a place you can get healed right uh there's not I mean that's because the die savings rate has been zero percent for so many years so even when we increase the die savings rate to um like uh 3.5 which is very sustainable given the the yield that maker can generate from mobile assets nobody really adopted it like the adoption happened very slowly so this new uh initiative called in the enhanced diet savings rate is basically based off I mean basically the difference between how like how like basically that actually everybody that holds diet should be getting the die savings rate if they were rational and if only a very few percentage of them is getting it then that leaves this massive amount of like unutilized dye that is just generating excess yields for the protocols for the protocol basically right like if somebody holds die doesn't get the die savings rate and maker gets to put that into high yielding real assets then maker is going to earn a huge uh windfall Surplus and we've been doing that for like I mean basically the whole year the dice of like die demand has also been decreasing and generally the whole Space has been sort of stagnating right and so in the light of that basically they enhanced diet savings rate is basically making the bet that we're better off investing in growth right now uh than just like holding profits um especially because what we can do is we can kind of like send a signal to the market that look die is actually going to be about not just stablecon it's going to be about yield as well and this is kind of like the first taste in a sense right um but and if you remember then the key thing that makes subdial farming sustainable is that you cannot both get a die savings rate and Farm subdels so we wouldn't actually even I mean in the end we would be doing something like this anyway once we launched this updos uh so we wouldn't like it's not in that sense it's not costing us as much or like it's not taking away our long-term income generation potential because we never counted on uh I mean almost like ripping people off in a sense right I mean I guess we're not ripping people off but like people are not we're offering them money and they're not taking it uh so we're getting the money ourselves and that is not supposed to be how the system works so by setting the die savings rate higher and getting a lot more people in to take take the yield uh that helps with that growth it costs money but ultimately because we'll be doing the subject farming anyway then it costs less money than you think because these many of these people will convert over the subtle farming once that goes live one of the big topics in defy has been regulation I mean it's really been the topic in crypto everywhere um but you know I've seen obviously you're blocking Americans from the yield farming in your new system why is that yeah I mean so like you said yourself right regulation is like and compliance is like really the it's like the biggest thing that everyone's focusing on now and like in the whole in the mega ecosystem like every company every participant they're all like trying to figure this out um and what would need to change in American regulation for you to um you know unblock Americans so I mean that's it's actually really hard I mean the problem with the US is that it's just it's just uncertainty right there's actually no it's not really I mean it's not very clear uh and so it's uncertain um and I I mean I think basically for now this is like the this is like the best uh I mean we we're we're uh comfortable with like the current um approach to this uh unfortunately I mean obviously it's it's I mean it's annoying for end users that a lot of people are upset about this right because they think it's like some kind of discrimination or something like that um but ultimately I mean like I said I mean this is I mean like you said this is the number one thing everyone's concerned about I mean this is the number one thing that could and it's also we're also being impacted by the fact that there are so many hacks there's so many scams right that's just further kind of it means that you really like it's a very good idea to be uh prudent and and you know really uh find the right solutions for this so you're basically it sounds like a couple of things first of all there's no Clarity around the status of tokens how they should be regulated and then second it's that if the North Koreans hack you then you won't face a tornado cash type of um prohibition is that what you're getting at I mean the whole question of uh hacking and tornado cash and so on that's actually I mean that's just that's not really related to yield that's like its own um problem basically but I think I mean I and I I mean yeah and the tornado cash is like its own uh complicated case right with a lot of complicated effects and and Nuance to it um well I mean like I mean again it's ultimately this is an evolving thing uh we have a huge we have this we've got both this thing we call the legal resilience um uh fund basically or the legal resilience uh like process in the atlas that budgets for for just like generally making the system as resilient and as as uh you know strong uh in order to protect users from some kind of like um accidental side effect of of uh of regulatory action or something like that um and then also like legal research right so that we're trying to like adapt and predict what's going to happen in the future how can we improve the system how can we even try to impact things so that that the global regulation of crypto can go in a mall a positive direction and I think like overall the the thing that I have the highest hope for in terms of like I mean basically getting us Beyond regulation being the thing that everyone's worried about all the time and that sort of um is one of the big sort of issues that the space still needs to do correct right I think overall like basically we need to prove that those jurisdictions that Embrace crypto and do offer clear guidelines and do basically make it you know create a good environment for crypto businesses we need to show that they're going to get rewarded big time with legit value innovation jobs growth not a bunch you know not that they then get a bunch of scams um and that's really a major part of our strategy right and there and and it's a in particular South Korea and Japan are two countries that we are focusing heavily on and that's because they have I mean they're exactly in this kind of shape where like they actually provide very good environments very stable environments for crypto um if we can I would love to be able to I mean have basically sub-dials that could find ways to allocate real assets into these jurisdictions and generate good yields um because they're just like I mean they have basically shown that that um you know they're not gonna create a bunch of uncertainty and then in that make arbitrary decisions uh and then be like as your own fault you should have should have known better right but rather yeah I mean not that that's I actually don't think that's necessarily really happening anywhere but the possibilities there in many places in South Korea and Japan they're probably the two best places where it's just like that doesn't seem uh possible the way I mean given the current signals uh that are that are being sent from there and and well and then the other thing is they're large they're large countries right so they're not like some tiny offshore or or just like a place that will very easily get pushed around by other countries all right and so um let's revisit that question about your um you know the fact that you own a slightly under 10 of the supply of mkr what are you doing to either mitigate that problem or just resolve it completely yeah so like I said earlier I mean basically what needs to be in place uh before it's safe for me to I mean potentially uh stop participating or selling my tokens or or maybe just like delegate and go on autopilot what's needed for that is I mean first it's the phase three element of like they need to be really strong rules and boundaries and AI tools that makes it possible for everyone to sort of operate the system without relying on like whales and somewhere like me to to be there if things things start uh you know spiraling into some problems problem right but rather we need to that needs to be built into the fabric of the dial itself and then once that's built into the fabric of that itself then we can incentivize voter participation uh so I mean we want to get I mean you know we want to get 30 40 of all the tokens voting right um and once we get that then basically I mean nobody like nobody's ever going to be a whale that has that many tokens in the system so you're never going to have individuals that are going to have much of a of a of like a essay at that point and even if you did then there would still be boundaries to what they could do like they would still not be able to break uh the atlas um and that's I mean and the final reason why and this is actually I mean this is protection that maker actually has this protection today uh and actually no other project has this but it's basically because we have minority token holder protection right today it's in the form of the ability to completely shut down and settle and unwind the system uh in case so that would basically be you do that in a case of an attack where someone's trying to steal all the money in the system then you can make it so okay yeah you can't steal the money uh we're gonna I mean we shut it down everyone just gets their money back the I mean the big downside to that is that it's still disaster because now the project is dead right um and at the end at the very last stage of end game we'll change that to a system where you can actually sort of put it back together smoothly so it's like a sort of an additional layer of governance that goes beyond the token holding the token voting and that actually allows you to like so basically is if a giant whale at that point says I'm gonna like take all the money for myself or I'm gonna like uh rule myself as CEO of the project and I can vote for that because I have the most students then actually the system can be like well that's against the atlas so it's actually possible for like the entire ecosystem to sort of kind of shut down settle out everything and then reform back together but without this guy and the reason why it's possible to coordinate around that is because the atlas will contain like very specific data around like when exactly is someone abusing their voting power what are you supposed to do in that scenario how do you do it how do you coordinate it so you don't have to like figure it out on the Fly it's like all written down already and everybody can use their AI tools to make it easy for them to understand what they're supposed to do in that scenario um and that way yeah like at the end of it all basically it should be like um like I mean I shouldn't have to do anything I should be needed the system whatsoever right and yeah like I should be able to sell all my tokens and just walk away and uh nothing material should change for the project in that case all right roon well this has been so fascinating hearing your vision for how all of this should transform over the next few years um I look forward to seeing how well it works out where can people learn more about you and your work so of course you can go to makeitow.com that's also a place to if you want to get the the enhanced dye savings rate and get a really good yield as a taste of what succumb with Supply farming if you're not American unfortunately um and then we I mean there's our Twitter at makerdial and then there's my Twitter at Rune KKK if you want to follow for more great well it's been a pleasure having you on Unchained yep thanks so much for letting me come thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about roon and maker check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is
