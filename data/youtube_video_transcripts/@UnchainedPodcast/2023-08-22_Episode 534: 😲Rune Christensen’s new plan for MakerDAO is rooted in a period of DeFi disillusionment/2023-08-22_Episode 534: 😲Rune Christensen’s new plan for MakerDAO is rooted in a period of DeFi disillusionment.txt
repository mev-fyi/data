maker is like the oldest style in the world it controls the biggest decentralized stable car in the world it has like I mean more than 100 million uh like 130 million dollars in income per year currently it has something like a bit more than 40 million dollars per year in expenses and at its peak it was even more like for a long time we actually didn't even like actually our our income wasn't even that high but our expenses was even higher and and like the biggest problem was it was sort of out of control like nobody really knew what are we actually paying for how are we paying for it uh the system was sort of just like chugging along with around with this base the basic process being that people make proposals to the Dow uh no longer as it was originally for the sake of the hotel but primarily for their own sake right because what they saw was everyone else is doing the same thing and you get this kind of coordination problem
