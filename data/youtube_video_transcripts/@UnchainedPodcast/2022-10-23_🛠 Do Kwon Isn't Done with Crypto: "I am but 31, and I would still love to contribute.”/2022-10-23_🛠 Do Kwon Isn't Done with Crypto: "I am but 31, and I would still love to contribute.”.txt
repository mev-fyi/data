one of the things that I hope the next few years would clarify is what happened with Tara was it wasn't a scam like it wasn't a fraud right it was a massive market failure but I think one of the things I want to clarify is I believed in the need and the viability for decentralized algorithmic stable coins more than anyone else and as Founders we are we sometimes have a bias and in some cases Aaron is biased for being bullish right so a lot of people say that I'm an idiot for you know buying Bitcoin right before it was about to crash or something like that but this positionally speaking like isn't crypto made better where any industry made better if there are people that just just a little bit like believe in things and is more optimistic than other people about how things are going to pan out and how things are going to work I I think the most important thing is like we really did try to hold ourselves to a pretty high set of integrity and I think now we're starting to make some attempts to make sure that we provide the right kind of information out there so that people can understand what happened better we are a pretty small organization at this point so there's sometimes going to be things that we won't be able to answer everything right because there's just too much accusations coming out and some without like any thoughtful basis or something like that but we are trying our best like in terms of what it when it comes to my life like I think like I the way that I think about it is I I am but 31. and I would still love to contribute so it is going to be an exciting time because I think you know more of the work that I'm going to be doing is going to be in the cold I get to do a lot more engineering which I didn't get to do in 2021 when Tara was just exploding so a lot of my time was spent in calls and meetings and podcasts while this is definitely probably the hardest uh you know time in my life in terms of the work that I do and the challenges that we are having to work through it is a a refreshing change of pace if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode available now on Unchained
