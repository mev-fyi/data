before we start i just wanted to say for those of you watching on youtube xerox maki prefers to remain pseudonymous which is why he's wearing sunglasses and a face mask so sushi swap has been one of the most dramatic events in d5 recently which is saying a lot because it's been an extremely eventful summer a couple weeks ago sushi swap forked the code of uniswap which was at that point by far the largest decentralized exchange or automated market maker however sushi swap introduced a token on top sushi which would reward both liquidity providers and token holders then the main dev behind sushi swap named chef nomi cashed out after uh generating a lot of interest in the project and a lot of money for him or herself right after sam bankman freed the ceo of a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange ftx who is behind a project that is building index on a competing blockchain called solana made a proposal to build support for sushi swap on solana and then because of the outcry over how chef nomi cashed out chef nomi was forced to hand over the admin keys to sam and then finally after all that there was a migration that took place of liquidity from uniswap over to sushi swap and in the end 1.2 billion dollars ended up on sushi swap while uniswap was left with 400 million dollars so now with that background hopefully the audience can follow along because just a ton happened in the last couple weeks but let's go back all the way to the beginning xerox maki how did you become a co-founder of sushi swap so i got involved in the project by basically like being one of the first person to read the white paper or medium article and from there i joined the discord it was maybe like perhaps ninth person i think and i basically was asking questions to chef numi and sushi swap the second dev and we were like just having like a very honest talk about where this is going is this like just a food token is it just a hot dog or shrimp or whatever is like the the trendiest like meme coin of the day and i was actually very surprised to see that chef nomi actually wanted to push this project forward and like do something different not just a money game so from there i i just like asked if i could join and just be part of the growth of the project and make it like something bigger than ourselves and why did you want to get involved like what was it that you didn't like about uniswap or how was it that you thought it should be improved i never got like an opportunity to work in the crypto industry before i don't have like the resume to basically like be taken seriously i think or just the opportunity like the the people to know the people that are involved in the space i had like no connection i'm like anonymous um so from there i saw an opportunity where i could like leverage like my you know my skills and i think that uni swap like is something amazing i've been like a user since january 9 2019 and the truth is i think they've been moving slowly and there's so many like other like things we can build on top of the ui that i felt that this sushi swap like could be it we could like empower developers to build on top of it and we would like green light their ideas or like features way faster than what uni swap is doing at the moment simply because it was it would be decentralized and so it could attract a lot more people than a centralized team i think perhaps like we just have divergent ideas of decentralized i don't think that the decentralized protocol like or decks like uni swap means that people should just be building on their site on their ui and basically never touch the original one or like do like a very minor update so from there and also like you know the support on on uni swap is very lacking sometimes you go on their reddit or discord and moving very slowly is it because the team is overwhelmed perhaps at the same time like you know if you come on sushi swap when we did the migration we had over like 6 000 support message answered from the community from people like uh managing the discord like nobody is paid here like it's all like because they love the project because like they own some sushi they want it to work so that is the big difference i think and what was your background in crypto before when you were saying you know we're having a centralized i work in a centralized exchange before um it was like an amazing experience that i was offered and i work in growth support um all kind of stuff i'd rather like not name the company but i've never been able to break it inside ethereum or you know like any decentralized protocol or blockchain from your initial interactions with chef nomi and sushi swap who did you think they were and also you know you don't have to say like who their exact identity was but what was your sense of like where they were from or what kind of so i don't want to feed any like conspiracy theories or you know like anything like this um the only things i knew were that we were opposed time zone they were near singapore or asia they were you know like sufficiently technical uh where the cto levels senior engineers um it's very hard to tell i don't want to feed any uh conspiracy i know there's been like project being attacked by some community members i'd rather not say and to be very clear with you the story is not done yet uh we are still in talk with nomi uh there is like negotiation going on concerning the treasury we know he's he feels some guilt and we are not willing to disclose everything once every like the the whole um the whole topic is closed all right yeah we're gonna have to circle back to that in a second but why don't we go back to the precipitating incident how was it that you found out that chef nomi was cashing out 13 million dollars for him or herself for sure so i was doing a maa with like the chinese community at around 4 00 am my time so usually i would be sleeping but since you know like sushi swap i've lost the concept of sleep so this is uh like we need to move fast and you know uh to to make things work so i was doing an m.a with like the chinese community we had like a wonderful question over like 400 people tune in in the wechat and from there some people were just saying hey something is wrong uh there is like someone that like just moved the dev share and then like i just looked on twitter i just looked on discord chef nomi just did like a very cryptic tweet saying that he had like accomplished a lot of things with this project and that he should be rewarded uh nobody had like made him a proposal to get paid um maybe he was being uh uncomfort like scared because of like a bug that we found the migration um code so a lot of things were probably going through his head and he basically just cashed out i was sending him message on discord he was not entering so that's what led me to publish like an old madam on twitter where if he didn't enter me in 12 hours i would reveal everything the whole story um he did reach out to me and from there we are still in discussion for the the next steps yeah and i think the other thing that was surprising was he did this just like a week after um sushi swap launched so it wasn't even like he'd done a ton of work on it um but so at this moment is sush is sorry is uh chef nomi still involved chef nomi is not publicly involved he was there helping for the migration with sam and alameda research he is feeling the aid towards him from everyone he is not proud of his action so he'd rather stay in the shadow for now we are still discussing about like what is going to happen with the treasury um so i wouldn't uh comment on this yet so he does recognize that it was a mistake or he feels some regret yes he does okay but do you know why he did it in the first place maybe he was intoxicated maybe it was the social pressure everyone was calling him a scammer a child and an opportunistic i think uh it's very hard to understand what was going on through his mind and perhaps like at some point if you return treasury you will do like a postmortem by himself and like we'll see what happened on this side of thing but i have like no expectation of him like sending it back back for now uh is it gonna be weeks days month who knows all right well i'm sure a lot of us will be tuning in to find out what what happens to that money but so in a moment we're going to discuss the handover of the admin key to sam bankman freed but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with the latest ups and downs in the world economy

dot hackathon dot org that's f i v e dot h a c k a t o m dot o r g back to my conversation with xerox machi how was it decided to hand over the admin keys to sushi swap to sam binkman freed who's the ceo of cryptocurrency derivative derivatives exchange ftx and also of the liquidity provider alameda research so the next day following the devshare um fiasco chef nummy reached out to me asking if i wanted the key like the administrative um i told him i would rather not because i was not confident in my technical skill to do the migration and transfer everything to a multisig so i instead i proposed to person i proposed andre from wi-fi waifu and from there um also sam because he is someone technical that did a proposal in her discord he had skin in the game so i assume he was he could have been like also a person that could help us a number of people speculated that sam was chef nomi and that he had cooked up sushi swap in order to pull liquidity from uniswap over to project serum which he's building on the solana blockchain what do you think of that theory uh you know i think that's like conspiracy there's absolutely nothing true in there uh we are like literally like just three nobody three anonymous person that you know got together uh some was uh i think understood the power of community and that's why he joined this interesting project maybe he does as uh motive you know with sonar serum uh doesn't interest me i will be the first one to quit the project if this is pushed forward and anyway like he was just involved for the migration and multisig from there the community is going to be leading the project so all of the conspiracy are false and shouldn't be taken seriously in my opinion so when you say that he was only involved in the migration and won't be moving forward what does that mean it for the admin key it means that the admin key is going to be secured by nine people that were elected by the community but he's one of the signers yeah he's one of the designer i'm one of the designer too before the migration on i guess it was wednesday how much liquidity did you expect would migrate from uniswap over to sushi swap i didn't have any numbers in mind i saw on twitter that some people were speculating on 100 million 300 million we ended up with one point 14 million at its peak i think uh which was billion billion well yeah a billion sorry which is like it's crazy i mean i wouldn't have expected so much um the thing is i'm not like delusional i do know that you know uni swap is working on a token we might be vampire attacked by another competitor but as long as we can like from there like we prove the the the concept that like the whole like thing that liquidity is like not the moat that volume like yes could be but like i think the interesting building phase starting now so that's what i'm most excited about so right after the migration sushi swap had 1.2 billion in liquidity uniswep had 400 million although actually by the time of recording unit swap um its liquidity has increased to 700 million and i just was wondering were you surprised by how successful this vampire mining scheme went yeah i was but at the same time i think the community or like every lp that got involved like they were there for a paycheck they were there for maybe the ethos of the project um liquidity with the days of yield farming is just liquid at the moment it's very liquid i think the project that was able to make it a little bit more under luck is wi-fi with their vault and there's like fees if you get out of the pools um so i think we're gonna see more and more of this so people trying to lock liquidity but i was very surprised of the success yeah you personally don't own any sushi why not um that was a it was understood between the founder team that we shouldn't be farming buying selling any sushi because we already had the dev share that would be shared among us and the developers contributing to uh the project which uh one has been a recipient uh before sushi no me um event zippo got actually like granted uh some sushi for his work uh doing like an amazing dashboard uh tracking all of the pools all of the you know countdown statistic election of the multi-c candidates he has been doing wonderful work and he is actually also a multi-signer so i'm very we are very fortunate to have like exceptional community member and zippo is just one of 10 that i could name off on top of my head right now so since that share was supposed to be split between you guys not only did chef know me cash out but he basically also took money that uh people were you know thinking was partly yours yeah um i would rather not go into the details but i can tell you that you know even if chef nomi exceeded his uh his share of let's say or you know the whole treasury we still have like more than i think four or five million at the moment uh at the time of the recording treasury is going well we're not like uh too stressed about it i mean the project is uh speaking picking up steam at the moment we see like a volume of you know eight million on some pairs for like a one year old like a one day old dex which is like crazy um so it we have like better like spread on like the incentivized pool than uni swap which is in my in my opinion crazy well have you been paid at all for your efforts so far or no i haven't been paid at all yet there is probably some proposal that will be coming up i do have a day a full-time day job and i will have to resume this in i think four or five days if like no proposal is accepted i will still be involved part time or as much as i can but yeah no i've not been rewarded the only people that have been making money in this project are zippo and chef nomi how do you feel about working on sushi swap which basically took all of its code from uniswap which is a team that's been working on this project for years i think this was necessary to bootstrap the project i think that is just you know like to confirm the idea to see if there's a market or if there is demand for it uh am i proud of just being like a copy-pasted uni swap personally i think no but from there we can iterate we can become like more we can become like become the best decks from here i think that is like a very strong foundation whatever happened with unisof v3 i think that we will always have uh something special going forward so what is the vision for sushi swap going forward it is a d5 um the apps integration directly on the ui it is like partnering with like indie dapps developers that maybe are currently working at a full-time job but would like to contribute to a side project and are not rewarded for it um it is adding you know like key features like limit orders stop plus directly on the ui there's like many things we can do uh there is also like as you know um the serum proposal is there gonna be one two teams that are be gonna be building on another blockchain perhaps uh am i sold to serum myself not at all i think that if like a team from polkadot wanted to do the same thing and the community voted yes then it would be supported uh we have like dao like that's coming quicker than anticipated there's a lot of work to be done and i'm very um grateful to have so many community member helping on this side and when about the high fees on ethereum that doesn't i mean you you sort of have a kind of let's say fair attitude about switching over to another blockchain but aren't you concerned about the high gas fees on ethereum i mean yes there's solutions i mean is it l2 i don't think so personally because it's going to break composability unless we can't do it right is it going to be a guest token in sushi swap uh lots of things going on uh is it going to be like incentivizing some wallet to make just one transaction a day so it's it doesn't cost anything for them um it's it can be easily gamed we do have like to to check all of this but you know it could be like something like know your farmer from arcades so for example like if a wallet has been interacting with specific dapps for the past six months we can assume that you know they are not a fresh new wallet and mitigate some of this risk uh we'll see you know like lots of uh thing to think uh i'm i'm in there like for the long term so yeah well provided you get funding oh even if i don't get funding i'll still keep working on this yeah yeah it's so much fun i i can tell that you are quite the fan of defy and the way that i can tell that is because of your outfit today and for those of you watching on youtube you will get to see this but um xerox monkey why don't you uh show everyone and tell everyone also so the people on podcast can hear yeah this is a this is a a ud from meta factory and they've been doing like some amazing stuff with merch for a device who have been coping uh a ud from wi-fi some jam pants and you know like uh everything to be ready for um the tokyo wi-fi party with blue kirby so when is that happening oh it's happening when the wi-fi is going to be 100k so it should be like in a few months okay despite covet or uh we'll see i mean from there i'll let the wi-fi community organize that i'm a very big fan of open communities or like a crunch organization that people calls them i hope that sushi can be one of them wi-fi is doing pretty great yam is amazing too um and i think i haven't peaked at swerve yet but i think they're trying to do something similar and i will be always a big fan of like dao's like people organizing themselves doing something similar i've been also like in touch with cream finance a little bit to see what they were doing um like it's just i think people should stop seeing like fork or you know like everything as attack and more about like they're trying to do something different they're trying yes they're inspiring themselves and stuff but they want to just push the ecosystem forward i think that the net positive for like sushi swap at the end of the day is gonna be that uh more developers are maybe gonna go and on and be sustainable by you know like enabling some sort of their share or something like reward mechanism uh maybe we're gonna see also like more more fair tokens because of this all like um you know you can deford at any time though are we gonna see more closed source project perhaps but i don't think that community are gonna support them as much so and at the end of the day i think like a lot of people got introduced to being lp for the first time and that's like very key because that helps everyone that helps like every traders out there it helps like people to get deep in the rabbit though like once you provided liquidity you know it's like easier to um you know go farming somewhere else or if it's not farming like maybe you you will start to interact with some dolls because like now you're in an open organization people are have probably voted for the first time via like snapshot it's like all of this that is like that is amazing in my opinion and the more choice the users has the better it is for them at the end of the day and yeah it's my uh that's what i think is the impact of you know sushi swap at the of the day a couple comments i want to make um one is so just to describe your sweatshirt for the people listening on audio it's a wi-fi sweatshirt and the sleeve says i test in prod and he's also wearing yam pants um which i didn't know existed i'm surprised you're not wearing any sushi merch but um then one other thing one other thing that i wanted to um mention is earlier when you said that we might see more non-devs getting funded by tokens and stuff i actually thought that uh because of house uh chef nomi cashed out that people may not trust anonymous devs going forward as much oh i don't think it's the case i think we were just like um very early and we did some mistakes we're just gonna be devs like doing like more time locks there's gonna be like multisig protection for the funds or you know like some sort of uh to make sure that the devs are not accessible very easily i think this is just gonna be like standard from here like chef know me was like nobody wants that to happen again i think and that is just a lesson for the whole like space i see okay yeah that makes a lot more sense all right well this has been such a fascinating conversation thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break how much
