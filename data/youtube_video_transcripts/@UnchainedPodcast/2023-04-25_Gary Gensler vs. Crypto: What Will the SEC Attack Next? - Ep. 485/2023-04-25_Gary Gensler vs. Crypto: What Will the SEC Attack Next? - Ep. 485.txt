today's topic is the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission and crypto here to discuss our Josh Clayman U.S head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets at linklaters and Mark boyrun Chief legal officer at polygon Labs welcome Josh and Mark thanks for having us thanks it's great to be here with you guys the SEC has been making a lot of waves in the crypto industry recently before we dive into specifics what would you say is the overall takeaway that you have from all of these actions collectively what does it say about the agency's overall stance toward crypto or how that could impact the industry and Josh why don't we start with you thanks Laura so I think what it says is that the SEC is frustrated right if I play Devil's Advocate and I take their side I'd be saying we keep telling you that if you Capital raise using a digital asset it's going to be a security and I think there's a lot of frustration from within the SEC from what I've heard and that these enforcement actions really one after the other are intended to send a very loud message at the same time we're seeing rulemaking which the industry has asked for for a long time and I think the message from the SEC if I were to characterize it is okay you've asked for rules let's see if you like what you get Mark what do you think yeah I mean to me this is just a culmination of years right so we've had enforcement actions for for years that have been worked on we know there's been subpoenas handed out so when you think of when um Gensler um took office right he went ahead and said like I think most of all digital assets are securities and that is kind of your heads up that over the next few years enforcement actions are going to accelerate um and his efforts to slow down the industry are going to accelerate he kind of took a three-pronged approach right his his first prong was stablecoins the second prong was exchanges and his third prong was lending and we see that like very heavily on like the exchange front and so that's not surprising kind of viewed as like a choke point if you can slow down the exchanges then you can slow down a lot of the activity and then on the digital assets front like themselves he's been he's been working on that for a long time and so um it's not unexpected it's it's kind of what you should expect from getting slur based on what he's been saying for the last two years I'm super interested in your answers because I it seems like you're almost saying that even if FTX hadn't happened we would see the same level of activity from the SEC so is that what you guys think or do you think that FTX may have caused there to be you know this High number of enforcement actions the last several months so in my view I don't think FTX changed anything I think it may have emboldened the SEC right it was almost like a license to do more because you know there was also the question you know I think it may have been Elizabeth Warren who said something to Tara Gensler saying something like the SEC needs to get suited up and he was saying we are suited up um and so I think this was really a license to do the kind of enforcement that they had planned yeah and I think I think it's really the impact on policy makers that it had more than on Regulators again I think like this is something that that gensler's been working on for a while I think it's potential that his Focus um or change of focus to actually taking enforcement action against exchanges is a result of FTX but the broader effort against digital assets that ginsler is taking is something that has been in the making since he took office just building on what Mark said I mean I believe that it was before FTX that term against Lawler started saying things like the runway is going to get shorter you know exchanges come in and register and things like that so it wasn't as a result of FTX that that happened but I do agree the the focus on exchanges and centralized exchanges although we're also seeing it with decentralized as well um I think that that really has contributed all right so let's get into some of the details we'll start with the most recent one last Monday the SEC charged bittrex with failing to register as a broker dealer exchange and clearing agency and in the complaint it also listed six tokens that included algo OMG and Dash as Securities and I was curious um you know what you think this lawsuit against bittrex means for the future of crypto exchanges to me it's the battle we've been waiting for right and and I don't mean that positive because I would much rather see uh positive rulemaking or or policy makers take action but in the absence of that you always knew there was going to be a time where centralized exchanges were going to have to face the SEC it's too easy for the SEC to take a position that at least one token that is being traded on that centralized Exchange is a security or reforms part of an investment contract and therefore you should be registered as a national Securities Exchange and so what bittrex looks like is frankly what I think a lot of the exchange actions would look like against centralized exchanges you know while I think bittrex may have been more aggressive than some centralized exchanges the core facts underlying that complaint are the same for all centralized exchanges and so I think the exchanges have been ready to to kind of have this battle I think coinbase has said that very clearly and you know I think there's there's some pretty good arguments on their side there's also some uphill battles based on what existing law sets and I'm sorry there's good arguments on whose side I think there's like good arguments on digital Assets in general right like how you're going to treat them under Securities laws the defense that I think the exchanges are going to have but ultimately the defense comes down to are these digital assets Securities or not um or do they form part of an investment contract I think under like the exchange act I don't think anybody is going to try to argue that there's really any argument Under The Exchange act that you that you shouldn't be registered if these assets are securities I think what I would what I would add to this is you know for a while we'd heard the SEC explaining that digital assets that are securities if they're traded on a trading platform the trading platform needs to register as a national security exchange or qualifies an ATS an alternative trading system but I think what may be a surprise to many in the market but I think we have seen coming is this idea of breaking apart by function right and that the SEC really is saying now look all these different functions The Exchange function the clearing function the broker-dealer function right lending all these sorts of custody you know that potentially these should be separated out and separately registered and I think that's a surprise to many in the market because we had been focused so much many of us on just the question of whether you know an ATS or a national Securities Exchange could even trade the digital assets that are out there given the requirements so I think we're going to see more of this I do think that in the sec's view I can't speak for them right obviously none of this from us is legal advice investment advice any other kind of advice in my view the SEC seems to think that they have it all figured out with respect to centralized exchanges and clearly with respect to decentralized exchanges there are still open questions and hence we have you know the reopened comment period for the proposed expanded definition of Exchange yeah we'll get uh to that in a moment but I just want to unpack you know what you were saying here because so much of the sec's complain against big trucks did talk about how you know in a traditional exchange um a national Securities Exchange there would be all these different functions that would be separated you know Brokers um The Exchange itself the clearing agency Etc and so something that was curious to me when I was reading it was I kept thinking okay so if you're saying that it's like illegal for all these um functions to be collapsed into one entity then it seems like they're saying that coinbase is operations which the SEC had blessed when it allowed the company to go public would also be illegal right or what do you think about that so all alleged right right okay allegedly I mean well we have heard the SEC saying to to coinbase that they believe or at least you know in various forms whether it's a speech or whether it's you know Wells noticed or something like that um saying that they believe that digital assets that are securities are traded on coinbase right and so that is what brings in these other points if at the time that coinbase filed a test one the SEC did not necessarily believe that there were digital assets that were Securities being traded then potentially these these requirements Under The Exchange act wouldn't apply because there wouldn't be a security so I think it does come back always to the digital asset being traded um and whether that age-old question now in our industry of whether you have um a security of one form or another okay but so I don't know the answer to coinbase list Alco or Dash or OMG or any of these others because if so um presumably I mean some of these are definitely older than 2021 which is when they went public do you guys know the answer to that I don't know the answer but I'd be very surprising right if they don't trade algo for example um right yeah but I I mean my take on this is like it's completely inappropriate frankly what what the SEC has done with coinbase yeah and frankly it's more inappropriate with respect to all the retail investors who have bought coin you go ahead and you become a public company and you sell stock to the public when you do that the public is assuming that the underlying business is a business that is operating in a compliant manner or compliant mostly when they build by billions of dollars worth of stock for the SEC to then come around a couple years later and say actually sorry retail investors we may wipe out that billions of those billions of dollars that you invested because when we told you you could invest in this it was in a situation where this exchange never should have actually been able to be operating in the way that they were and generating the revenue that they were right because most of the revenue comes from Trading fees it comes from Trading fees admittedly like most exchanges right you probably have 70 to 80 percent of those trading fees that come from BTC and eth but even the eats in question right you're probably still at like 80 percent of 50 or so on BTC alone which which may be safe but you've got 50 of the business and then therefore future fifty percent of the future cash flows that should never have existed according to the SEC that just doesn't sit right for me when it comes to retail investors I mean if I can play Devil's Advocate and solely just to play Devil's Advocate okay um I think that an argument could be made that the business has has transformed in a lot of ways since the filing of the S1 in 2021. if you look for example at the S1 which I had taken a look at it weeks ago but just some things that stood out to me at the time and again solely for purposes of Devil's Advocate here um you know at the time that it was filed there were about 90 tokens that were listed and coinbase said something to the effect of we only list tokens where we believe there's a reasonably strong argument that the tokens are not likely to be Securities they also said that they were heavily heavily dependent upon Bitcoin and eth and at the time eth wasn't in the headlines as whether it potentially could be a security right so bearing that in mind that's that's one point they also made a pretty big deal within that S1 saying that they had delisted xrp once the SEC brought suit against Ripple and so we've seen later later that year so that S1 was signed I think February 25th of 2021 later that summer we saw the enforcement action against poloniex where basically the SEC said look moderate risk that a token is a security is too much so one could say okay should this have caused a change in the types of tokens that were listed right or a re-analysis also you know there has been a movement and maybe it is as Jason Gottlieb in your earlier session had mentioned you know a bit of enforcement fatigue that people have not been delisting tokens when there's been an enforcement action that alleges that their Securities another thing I would just call out um again just as devil's advocate here is that with respect to staking you know it is mentioned throughout the S1 but it's mentioned as an energy efficient alternative to mining right and about two weeks prior to when the S1 was signed they did acquire bison Trails which would have greatly expanded that business but the financials only report as of 12 31 2020 and so if you look at the way staking is described now it's a much more robust business obviously than it was at the time when staking was mentioned when they did they did however definitely say within the S1 that they're that they did operate nodes on certain blockchains to enable um to assist clients with with staking for a fee Josh I think one thing that you said that was super interesting right is this idea that like do you have to de-list tokens the second the SEC files a complaint taking the position that that it is or settles an action or without anyone admitting anything this was actually key right in bittrex where they actually point to the fact that EOS has traded there and several other tokens that you know there's been settlement uh settlements on or with respect to and I think this gets to the enforcement fatigue concept and really the current Administration if you sit there and you think okay Gensler believes individually right in his individual capacity not not uh for the SEC that most or all tokens because it's it's changed right all tokens other than Bitcoins our Securities then you get to a point where you say well why would I do list that because the bottom line is we're going to get to this ultimate point that we're at where as a centralized exchange I'm going to need to fight this and I can either earn additional Revenue that I can then use for whatever in whatever way including to fight the SEC or I can delist it in a situation where they already are claiming that everything I am listing other than BTC is a security so why would you even de-list it and that's the position that you're in as a centralized Exchange huh and wait so just so I understand Josh when you were playing Devil's Advocate and you were saying that after the poloniex enforcement action that um there's you said there should have been a re-analysis so you're saying that coinbase should have used that action to then assess all 90 or whatever whatever the number was of the tokens they were listing at that time is that what you're saying so I I wouldn't go so far as to say should right because I don't know what they did maybe they did do that right but I would say you know one if we look at these enforcement actions as messages or Warnings together with the speeches that come out kind of like a road map as we go of what could be a security what is a security and I do believe for example that when they're picking out different types of digital assets to call them Securities in enforcement actions they're purposely in my view trying to find different kinds like I know for example I was surprised with Dash in some ways right because Mining and you know it just has a different kind of profile but yeah I mean I what what I was kind of getting at was that if you were to take the sec's position they might say look we've said that moderate risk is too high and how does that square with reasonably strong arguments as your as your standard right should it be a different standard that's sort of that sort of thing oh I see okay well one other thing that I wanted to call out from reading the complaint and this will come up again later when we discuss this expanded definition of an exchange but just reading it it sort of felt like that the agency was ignoring the fact that the technology could make it possible to not have all these different middlemen involved and I wondered do you think it's possible that the agent like do you think the agency basically chose not to acknowledge that like they could have come up with some other way to account for that or do you think like why it is that you think they didn't seem to acknowledge that because to me that felt like a little bit of a glaring Omission I think in this situation they just didn't need to right they were dealing with a centralized exchange um and so they have like probably three facts that are that are helpful for them one of you just walk through the definition of an exchange and the rules and you apply them to a centralized exchange they apply pretty neatly and I think most sexualized exchanges would say the same thing they also gave there's probably two different situations where they'd say they kind of put a flag in the ground to make it pretty clear right so first is the Dow report where in the Dow report they kind of is more of an add-on than anything else but they were essentially referencing the fact that exchanges could need to register right so that was back in 2017 and then you have the ether Delta settlement with The Ether Delta founder where you had a we call it a Dax I don't know that we would call it a DEX today because there's so many centralized components or maybe people might but it wouldn't be fair to call it a text um and and that kind of established the same thing and they like walk through the analysis of that analysis just very clearly applies to a sexualized exchange so there was no need to get into the arguments that a decentralized exchange might make around the definition of an exchange and how you apply the regulations to that definition yeah I think that's a good point that Mark makes I mean I like what we've seen sometimes is this concept of thin slicing where people are doing a small component so you may have a centralized exchange doing all of these things right or you may have folks doing one or another of these things this this kind of it gets to all the fish right in a way right like if you're doing this piece this looks like clearing or if you're doing this piece this looks like being a broker or a dealer or something like that so I do think that that that's part of it as well all right well one other thing that I wanted to discuss about this is the vetrex complaint recounts numerous times when the exchange was urging token teams to not use language that promised you know for instance certain kinds of profits or stuff like that and you know reading it you know I think the implication was okay these teams were actually selling securities but they were trying to hide it but on the other hand I sort of wondered isn't that sort of what the rules are for to get people to not make those promises and so I was kind of curious like obviously there were some instances where they were like scrubbing the language after the fact but I wondered like leaving those aside you know could you also make the argument that what they were doing in a way was showing that they were trying to be compliant or is that just not how that goes so if I were if I were their lawyer which I'm not I mean I would make that argument probably right or I may make that argument saying look even if there even if there were a violation on X did you know it was trying to be you know wiped away so it wasn't a continuing violation each other day um I definitely at least in my personal view I think that if you have problematic statements that might lead someone to believe that you're selling a security probably best not to keep doing it in such a way that you're continuing to sell security with that language right um just a personal thought yeah I mean I think it you can look at it from two perspectives right the first one Laura I think which is the one that you touched on right which is clearly this was done after they already sold the tokens and therefore what it looks like if you're the SEC is okay you were just trying to clean this up so that it doesn't look like you're just trying to hide things is basically what it looks like but the other side of it is what Josh kind of hinted at right which is if you believe which the SEC or at least SEC staff has previously said um and and unlikely to be what what Gensler believes is that you could have sold a token as part of an investment contract and that the let's call it like the wrapper of an investment contract falls away you're left with an asset that is not actually a security and so if you're looking at it from bittrex's perspective and you're saying okay what is it that could have caused this thing to be sold as part of an investment contract so what caused the expectations of these reasonable purchasers to actually believe that these tokens were part of investment contracts and the answer is these statements that make people believe that they're going to profit from something so if you're a bittrex and you believe that a rapper of an investment contract can fall away you're going to go to a team and you're going to say stop creating an expectation of profit and a lot of that is how you're actually talking about this publicly so let's go clean that up that's a completely reasonable thing to do if if that's the position you're taking I don't believe that the SEC wants people to take that position and therefore it is presenting it as like the first option that I laid out but I think that second option is a very real one that I think a lot of lawyers would uh agree with as is a true possibility all right so this is all leading up to what is probably at least in my mind going to be sort of like the Big Kahuna version of SEC versus crypto exchange which is you know whatever happens between the SEC and coinbase so as we know at this moment the wells notice that the SEC issued a coinbase which is a signaling of its intent to Sue was kind of light on details so I wondered what you thought the sec's charges will center around and just in general how you expect this court fight to impact the crypto space I think coinbase coinbase has done a really good job I think in in handling this in a what I'd consider to be a pretty tough spot to to be in and they went ahead the moment they thought that Wells notice put out uh the 8K they're required to put out and then went ahead and kind of had a blog post that they wrote that kind of laid it out and to your point it was really light on what it is that the SC is looking at but but we basically have probably four categories of things right one is just um are you are you an exchange um the second one is staking we saw that with Kraken um the third one is coinbase prime which is basically their institutional platform but it's trading plus custody so very hard to figure out like where to break that down the fourth one sorry is coinbase wallet which is like probably maybe the most surprising right so we talked about that first category uh already then when you get to the second category and you've covered this uh in the past Laura right but is the the staking I think the difference between what coinbase is doing and what Kraken is doing or did is Meaningful in terms of coinbase actually just passing through returns uh and and rewards that you get from staking rather than actually I mean they take a fee on it but they're not actually promising a certain fixed return or anything of that nature there's other like differences there and obviously you have to look at like how the sticky actually works in in different uh on different chains but generally speaking like the facts there are pretty different and I think coinbase is going to rely on that we also saw them update their terms of use following Kraken to actually make this even more clear I don't think it was actually anything new I think it was actually clarifying what was already done again I think like the the institutional side of things I think it's it's hard to separate it from the trading so let's just put it in in that category and then the last one is the non-custodial wallet which definitely is the most fascinating I think the tricky thing with wallets right now is that they do a lot right just back up right like six years and you had a wallet that stored your private key on your browser and you signed transactions with it and that was it and now we're at a point where a wallet is also allowing you to purchase crypto um through some kind of on-ramp or swapping it on some kind of decks or using it to stake you know the sec's view most likely around daxes is that if you are offering some kind of front end you should be grouped together with whoever developed the underlying protocol and we can talk about it that more in the like kind of when we talk about the rule making when they talk about like groups of persons um but but in exchange includes like somebody that is maintaining it when it's like a group of persons not just one individual organization so that's likely what they're looking at along again with their views on staking and stake is a service depending on on how you look at that you know coinbase also has liquid staking um that is another place that the SEC is probably very interested in looking at and so I think there's just like many attack factors there for coinbase I think there's also a lot of arguments to defend themselves and I think they lay a lot of that out pretty clearly I think on the staking stuff right they actually wrote a request for rulemaking to the SEC around that and so I think coinbase has handled this frankly really really well but those are kind of like the the different areas that it looks like the the SEC is attacking yeah I I agree with it Mark said what I what I do suspect is that given the number of meetings that was expressed in the blog post I believe it was around 30. I suspect that the queen bees team has a good sense of of some of the the possible attack areas because it sounded like they submitted proposals to the SEC that um they either didn't get a response on or perhaps they did not receive a positive response on it I don't know it wasn't there um again it all comes down to whether there's the existence of a security whether on the trading platform or whether for example staking itself as a service constituted a security and I do think just from the sec's perspective my understanding my impression I should say um is that there may be a level of frustration as well with coinbase because in the sec's view I believe again just my beliefs that they in some senses felt that coinbase should almost be happy and thanking them for warning them not to use not to introduce the Lend program right because then we saw enforcement actions against block five against you know Gemini and and others um and so that didn't happen to coinbase so I do think part of this I think part of it's motivated by frustration I do expect though that as some have said in in um different posts you know here and there that what we're seeing with Big C or bexi and bittrex that we're going to see something similar um with coinbase and it it makes me think back to when Gary Gensler at in one of his speeches was talking about you know exchanges come in you know we have exemptive relief powers I just wonder I had always thought that maybe that related to saying okay we can grandfather in potentially some of these digital assets that the SEC May believe were legally sold security so that an ATS could list them or something like that but now more and more I'm beginning to think that maybe that exemptive relief was meant to apply to to some of these various functions that the SEC has called out more recently I think this idea of exemptive relief is really important because the SEC clearly has the authority to provide exemptive relief and we think about that a lot in the form of like no action letters on like digital assets that's been talked about a lot but this isn't different with exchanges like they they specifically have the authority to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the exchange act as long as they think it's like necessary or necessary for like the public interest and so if they reach the conclusion and it would require a commission that truly believes in the benefit of decentralization in terms of eliminating risks that exist with typical exchanges you would reach the conclusion that there are actually public benefits to or it's in the Public's interest to do something that provides some kind of exemptive relief at least around like defy I also believe that that exists around centralized exchanges right like the the nature of the Way digital assets trade is very different from what you would typically see and so I think while yes this idea of like separating um you know broker dealers from uh exchanges from clearing agencies make sense in traditional exchanges and there definitely needs to be like controls in place and some separation whether that exact same thing really makes sense in terms of like separating clearing agencies from like a national Securities Exchange with respect to centralized exchanges I think it's like a little less clear whereas like maybe like broker dealers and National Securities exchanges separating those I think most people would probably agree that that actually does make sense so I think that you would really need a commission that believes in the technology um and the fact that it is inherently different to want to provide that exemptive relief which clearly this admin doesn't want to do well I had always thought that maybe you know we would see something in the in a settlement with a large player I mean maybe a coinbase or something like that where people may be motivated to find a solution rather than having a years long I would imagine litigation over it I do think though that even as we grapple with the separation of these different functions one of the things that I really think we should be pressing the SEC for an answer on is okay so say all this gets registered what happens to the tokens that are out there that the SEC believes are securities can anyone trade them because as we know you know in ATS for example can't do its due diligence on on an allegedly illegally issued security right so will those be grandfathered will they not be I think that this is is a key question that even before we reach the questions of whether something should separate out by function we need to know the answer too all right so in a moment we're going to talk about about how the definition for an exchange might change and how that might

trust visit hallborn.com for more back to my conversation with Josh and Mark as we have alluded to that SEC is proposing to change the definition of an exchange what does the proposed change say and why does it seem like that will have a big impact on crypto andify so I I think the the key aspect of um what you have to look at right now when it comes to an exchange I think like starting with that definition is probably helpful right and generally what you're looking for in an exchange is whether there is some organization or group of persons who are um kind of maintaining or providing um some kind of marketplace and then comes kind of the key language which is bringing together purchasers and sellers of Securities and when you break down like what the SEC considers to be like a Marketplace it's super technical but it very much focuses on um orders and the matching of those orders specifically you're bringing together orders from multiple buyers and sellers and then you have this concept of um using an established non-discretionary method to actually have those trades interact with one another and then there's one last part that the SEC does not mention in the bittrex compliant but I think is relevant to to something like Defy is that and then the buyers and sellers have to be agreeing to the terms of the trade and so when you look at that it's very much focused on the actual existence of um an order when you take carry that out to the like defy it becomes very hard obviously you've got border book taxes um and those look very much like traditional order books but once you get to an amm it's very unclear right you have a pool and I could I could make an argument the SEC could make an argument right now you could make an argument that every single person who deposits assets into a pool has agreed to a price and has placed an order at that time and what they are agreeing um is that there is a non-discretionary method which is the formula underlying the the amm um the the curve um that is dictating what price they're willing to sell at and then there's somebody who comes and takes that order on the other side whether they're agreeing with each other on the terms of that trade because is a whole lot less unclear and whether you can even kind of rationalize what I just said and carry that out I think is is tricky on most amms and so the SEC is basically saying I don't want to have that fight when I don't need to have that fight so let's go ahead and let's change the rule and if we change the rule we're basically going to focus it on this concept of a Communications protocol and basically what that means is that instead of looking at orders we're basically going to look at whether there's any kind of trading interest whatsoever and effectively what this does is it starts like adding in I think systems that wouldn't typically apply so like request for quotes I think like an amm starts potentially applying and you start bringing in a whole lot of actors that you probably didn't capture before which might include things like Bloomberg terminals um and that's how expansive the definition really is but it does get them to the point where now they feel like okay we'd be comfortable actually being able to bring a case against an amm without the risk of losing it because the key being the risk of losing it if the SEC loses a case on whether an amm constitutes an exchange the floodgates open and that is the last thing the SEC wants yeah and just to jump on jump in on that I I think as a practical matter it's moving from the active to the passive right much more passive activities you know bringing together folks you know with trading interest as opposed to orders this is a big change right and also this reference to groups of persons I mean where does that end and I think with the reopen proposal I mean the message that seemed to be it doesn't necessarily end right you can group together large groups of people I think one of the other big things I I think and you know I I had said elsewhere what do you call a conspiracy theorist who often is correct a prophet right the industry had said look this is likely to apply to digital assets and to crypto even though you know the proposal initially was something of a trojan horse right it never even mentioned digital assets I mean here and it may be partly because of the administrative procedures act right and people saying like listen if it's going to cover crypto you have to say crypto but I mean we have even references now in this new proposal that talks about immutable smart contracts right and what is the expectation well either you can change the code or if you can't well you better hard Fork it right and so I think that um I agree with Mark like they're trying to to cover all bases and make sure that they that they're able to win a case Esther purse um who is a commissioner at the SCC and who is often called crypto mom wrote a very strong dissent about this role change um can you summarize some of her objections I mean the way I would put it is you know that there was a prioritization and the prioritization was not for innovation right and I mean that's what I think it is in a nutshell that that commissioner purse is concerned that look you're not even looking at what this new technology can do you're just trying to make it impossible to do and so that that was my takeaway generally yeah and she harps on a few things that I think are important right so the the core here is what is a communication protocol system but you don't actually have a definition of a communication protocol system which she points out um and people asked for a definition in the comments to the initial rulemaking and we didn't receive them so so that was like one problem that I think uh just captured I think the other one and it's one that is just an issue in crypto I think it is what the SEC struggles with a lot is that how do they have the resources to deal with this so if you suddenly turn the switch on and say these hundreds and hundreds of amms out there um I think the treasury report on illicit Finance at 600 um D5 protocols um or dexes out there specifically like what is the SEC going to do with that um live alone the centralized exchanges um and them dealing with that already and so that becomes a a massive issue um and then I think she gets to the core Point here which is they're trying to capture through this concept of group of persons everybody Under the Sun they talk about first this concept of you need to be acting in concert you're acting in concert and it's like a common term used in uh Securities regulations then you are going to be you know operating this um Communications protocol system together but then they say actually and this is what what uh commissioner points to is actually it doesn't doesn't matter if you're acting a concert that's actually just one factor to consider there could be other factors that you could consider which could mean you don't actually need to be acting in concert to be considered part of this group of persons and so now you're talking about a few actors who are acting individually in their capacity someone running a front end some developer who um developed and deployed an amm and then some miners or some validators who are validating transactions and somehow basically what the SEC is saying is we're going to try to pass a rule that can cap put all three categories in one and what uh commissioner purse then says is yeah but you probably have some like First Amendment issues um when you're basically not allowing people to communicate at all because if they communicate they're regulated in this way um and so um she kind of finally closes it with I think maybe the most important point which is at least for anyone who cares about Defy is compliance isn't possible you're basically requiring centralization to actually make this possible and that's ultimately the core here right is if this rule passes um you end up in a spot where you're going to have to spend years trying to figure out how to actually comply with this in a decentralized way and I find it very hard to believe it's ever going to happen why because the SEC needs to agree that it can happen in that decentralized way so you can actually register so instead it's going to say no come in and register now we have the power to force you to do it under this new definition and when we do that we're also going to tell you how you need to centralize this thing so that you can comply and you end up with basically proficient um D5 only in that situation which I think is why um D5 Advocates are pushing kind of very hard and frankly the industry as a whole should be pushing very hard against this rule I think and one thing on the other descent commissioner uyeda I'm not sure how to say his last name actually my apologies but one of the things he says I think is really interesting you know he talks about how there's ambiguity and overbreds and how we need to remember that the Howie test says that we need to look individually at each digital asset right the way he says it I I think is very um is very helpful he says instead one might wonder whether this is simply a paper exercise under the administrative procedures act so that the commission can finalize a decision that has already been made namely that nearly all crypto assets or Securities and are subject to the commission's jurisdiction while not as scathing as commissioner purse's dissent I still think it's it's important um it's an important descent as well and I I do say and maybe this is me being a bit cynical um on one hand I do think that the SEC is still looking for answers with respect to how to treat D5 I don't think that it it believes that everything is a slam dunk as it seems to have uh have the view that it's figured out how to regulate um centralized exchanges however I I also um I I do think that in a way it's almost as though all of the well-reasoned comment letters that are cited heavily in the release it's almost as though they're thinking about a future litigation and addressing each one and saying yup you have Fair notice about this you have a fair notice about that you have Fair notice about this right it's almost like a treasure map to all the different ways that the SEC will be able to hold liable defy and when they ask for additional questions yes I think in part some of it may be to say okay how do we carve out these systems that maybe we're not trying to catch but cynically I actually believe that they're looking for information saying tell me more on how they can can attack from those various points I view that kind of differently because I think when when I go back and I look at Gensler you know starting his term as as chairman and him talking about defy in a way that says everything's centralized and we all know that T5 is more centralized than we would like not across the board but often but I do think that he started looking at these D5 protocols and realizing it's actually not that centralized and not that easy I need to find a way to deal with these because when you look at uniswap you're basically sitting there and you say what do I do about this like yes maybe I believe that they're violating existing law I'm sure Gensler believes that like I don't denzler does and so if you believe that then you're basically saying what do I do about this and you go and I think there's articles out there about uniswap having some requests for information for example right so you go out and you you say okay give me some information and you get that information and then you start digging into it and you say oh wow so I actually can't get these guys to stop this thing what do I do about that and then you say okay who's around there who can I get to stop it oh wait it's The ethereum validators okay let's go look at this all right who do we even go talk to who has the power to do this oh that's a really big group of people who all need to coordinate but don't coordinate um continuously in that way what do we do about this and the answer is well let's go write a rule that basically allows us to capture all of these and actually have a basis for trying to get them to all act together so that we don't have these yeah amms out there anymore and to me that's the entire like basis of why this is happening is a realization that there actually is true decentralization and that there's nothing that a regulator can do about that because there is no centralized point to stop it I mean one thing about this I I do think though it brings up an important tension which is you know there's a visceral reaction that people have when you think about going against the writer of a smart contract right that the person who wrote the code right and that can be for free speech reasons and all kinds of things that coin Center can remind us of um and others right but at the same time you know you end up in this position if you're not going to go against the person who writes it which as we know with as you mentioned earlier with ether Delta you know Zachary Coburn the actual author was the the person who was enforced against and yes different facts different time different technology um but you know if there is in the sec's view of violation somewhere I mean isn't rule making what the industry is looking for I mean not necessarily this rulemaking but isn't that what's being asked for to have some kind of clarity about what will come next I mean I think that Point's really important why aren't we happy with this rulemaking right and and it's sort of the exact same reason why if you go to anyone in tradfy and you say why aren't you happy with this rulemaking they'll say the same thing which is I have no idea what this actually says because it captures anything under the sun this we're talking about this in a crypto way Trad five does not like this at all and it's not about more regulation for them they already are regulated enough that like the incremental cost here to them might not be that significant relative to others it's the actual fact that like this is not even practical and when you do apply it to crypto you start looking at it and you say hey SEC you have these benefits that you can deal with there's this transparency that you can get okay you can still get that in a permission system but there's also this lack of trust that you can get and you can see that by the fact that you really can't shut down an amm right now because you can't go to all of these validators to actually have them um censor every transaction on this amm or that contract and so then you get to a spot where you should be recognizing okay there's this benefit to this thing there's these people who usually custody these assets who now don't need to custody these assets we don't need to worry about them okay that's fantastic maybe we need to write some rules that deal with how these systems should be developed or protections that should exist in terms of you know audits things of that nature so that you reduce risk around those assets um or caps on dollar amounts before certain things happen um in in terms of like protected launches and things like that or guarded launches and so there's a lot that can be done there if you really care to appreciate that the technology makes a difference but if you don't depreciate that technology makes a difference you write this rule um so just talking about non-crypto use cases where this makes it very difficult to give legal advice frankly if for example if you have a hosted Communication System right that B2B users are using right and one of your B2B users decides to have you know have the portal be used in such a way that it now satisfies this definition are you part of that group what if you provide some type of I.T support or something like that you know all kinds of people are being pulled in and when you think about Technologies where you may have something that seems different right like so if you have wallet connect right and you have a user who elects to link to wallet connect and then access D5 you know at what point do you stop at what point do you stop pulling back and say this is not a group of people these are separate actors making choices it's tough yeah um one so this is not necessarily SEC but I just wanted to draw this in because it's very related to what we're talking about which is the treasury report on D5 which was really interesting because it just kind of repeatedly says like no matter if a service is decentralized it has this obligation to follow the bank secrecy act and so I it just kind of raised the question of like well how does that get implemented and I wondered if you felt that treasury here was doing a sort of similar thing of like not really engaging with what the technology can do or do you think that um you know it is possible to do what the report is suggesting which is like even if it's decentralized it needs to implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing checks so I think I mean I think part of the whole point of the treasury report is exactly what you said Laura is making clear that even though you know when we and I think this is confused things a bit in the industry right when we have the s and the Frameworks work for 2019 talking about an active participant right and when we have this concept of potentially decentralization maybe allowing something not to be a security or or to no longer be a security depending on which way you look at it I think treasury wanted to make clear look decentralization and and what people may sometimes refer to as decentralization theater in certain instances um you know it doesn't apply here I think this is an important message because just like I actually think sometimes the sanctions and the kyc AML that know your customer any money laundering stuff gets lost a bit often we're so focused on the SEC and people tend to think okay if there's no fraud then maybe no one's going to jail right but guess what if you have sanctions and money laundering and terrorist financing you know potentially you're going to jail so I I think that was part of the message was just making clear like this you're obliged to do this I do think that there are um and I thought it was really interesting also the focus on D5 Bridges right as a as an attack point because we have seen D5 Bridges being attacked frequently um I I also think just stepping back a little bit more broadly um to look at the bigger picture I think all of these Regulators you know whether it's a cftc bringing suit against ukidao right and trying to find liability within that Dao or if we look at the California case against the predecessor you know bzx Dao right where they had they found a general partnership and a a theory of of negligence right um saying that there was a duty to the other General partners and the users and and that there was a it was morally reprehensible because the hacks were foreseeable things like this I think it's just all ways to try to find someone to hold liable for this I think we are seeing some Innovative Technologies um including um when it comes to to ofac including with respect to like Nev relays and and finding ofac compliant methods um so I do think that this is something where new tools may be developed and some already are uh but but yeah I think the question of how this is done is a tough one at the same time and I'll I'll keep it brief I do think it comes back to how much do we exercise how how much enforcement should be exercised against the author of the code so if we think of tornado cash right which the ofak o-fac you know had the enforcement action basically saying you can't use tornado cash right sanctioned and people having suits potentially important suits right by coin Center and those backed by coinbase and others saying freedom of speech but also you know there are non-nefarious uses there are privacy reasons Etc well if you're not going to be able to hold a lot to sanction a particular system because it's not property it's not a person it's not an entity then it seems like the logical other point would be the developer and I I just think there's even more of a strong reaction from the industry about holding liable a developer yeah I think if we leave a side like the ethos of like privacy and what the industry wants from a privacy perspective right and we live in the world and we look at things from treasury's perspective where it says we currently have a world where Financial transactions happen um except through cash in a kyc'd manner unless that cash transaction is is too large um then you get to a world where you look at this report and you say they were thoughtful actually um and and what I mean by that is that first of all when you look at their background and they describe defy and how it works well not perfect it's it's pretty on point it does a good job of that it's fair in its characterization like this was not in my opinion like a biased report and so in that sense I view it as like very positive I also think while they do say we need to fill gaps they recognize that under current law you have to look at facts and circumstances as to whether somebody is a financial institution under the BSA or not they're not saying right now everything in Defy is they're saying a lot in Defy is but you need to look at the facts and circumstances and there might be gaps that we feel like we want to to fill which obviously they're going to say from their perspective at the treasury um but they do a good job of talking to people but then they also go ahead and they recognize some benefits right they talk about the transparency of blockchains and how that can be used they talk about some difficulties related to it as well but they also talk just that it can be used in that way and I think that's like a really important recognition from them we know that that fincen like enforcement has long utilized tools that can be utilized as a result of transparency then they also look at like zero knowledge proofs and the ability to use zero knowledge proofs to maintain privacy while still proving certain facts about identity and so to me they're not shutting the door on saying you know everything in Defy is bad I think what they are saying is we are leaning strongly right now and saying that we need to fill gaps in D5 how we do that and whether we can do that while maintaining the permissionless nature of D5 is a big open question and we want to talk to you about it and to me that's like a very positive outcome from the report so I don't view it as like negative as everyone else I do it as like realistic for where treasure is at all right so we're running out of time but I definitely feel we have to touch on ether we've um discussed it a little bit here and there um but one question I just really wanted to bring up so obviously last week during the house Financial Services committee SEC chair Gary ensler sort of just danced around uh the question of whether etha's a security and I wondered so in 2018 the previous SEC director of Corporation finance bill Hinman said that eth in its present form was not a security and in 2019 then SEC chair J Clayton affirmed that the agency agreed that an asset could start as a security meaning you know for instance ether when it was sold in an initial coin offering but then later it could turn into a commodity and so given this history of you know the SEC having this record of kind of saying eth is not a security but then chair Gensler coming in and now saying that every crypto asset except for Bitcoin is a security I wondered um how those previous statements would affect the ability for the current SEC to pursue any enforcement action on eth now or in the future given that I'm not a litigator and I think it's a question that a litigator would be best um uh to respond to I best suited to respond to I I will say that to me there's probably a certain period of time in which people were relying on those statements now they're not SEC statements they are director hidman's uh statements and they are former chairman um uh Clayton's statement uh and they're not the SEC statements and that's what they're going to stick to now we've seen in multiple situations where you know folks don't like that we saw it last week we also saw it in the bankruptcy proceeding for Voyager when binance U.S was looking to buy Voyager and the bankruptcy judge is looking at that and saying wait so you're telling me staff that you think that binance us is trading uh Securities without properly being registered but the SEC is not willing to tell me that and the answer is like no right and so we see that that actually can be used against the SEC in certain situations but like my view is it's it's probably like a very narrow set of situations where like as a legal matter it actually influences the outcome of actions that people are taking I think a few things too I think um one and I'm not a litigator either and I think Jason Gottlieb whom you had on who talked about statutes of limitations and stuff like that that may very well be I do think though that when chairman gensler's been focused on ether it appears to be the post merge point right which if you're thinking about a change right it seems that part of the concern related to staking but not necessarily native staking I'd like to differentiate that and differentiate staking as a service from this idea of refraining from selling or locking up you know a digital asset and what potentially maybe in chairman gensler's view may have looked like getting a return right getting interest or something like that for a system approval stake system that wasn't yet up and running so I think in his if I'm taking his view for a moment I would say that maybe that's the change and again I think that these speeches in large part are really to say to the market don't do this don't copy this I don't think um I think as others have said you know it likely would be very hard to enforce against Heath right and I do think also with respect to the hearings I mean Gary Gensler is saying look it comes down to facts and circumstances you wouldn't want me to prejudge I think for the industry this is great I think this is an important thing to emphasize that it isn't you can't just make a statement like that you have to prove a statement like that where you have to get someone to agree with you in a settlement right so I I do think that that is um that that's something important I will say you know in interactions with the SEC whether in various contexts often when things were analogized to Ether it was said very clearly back well we never gave an a no action letter to the ethereum foundation so I think they're always there always is this idea that even if something may have changed from what could have been at one point of security to a non-security there is the point um where it depending on actions and activities it could go back to being a security I just have to say that I think like this idea that either is a security is such nonsense um it's when you look at this and and the merge or or not to me is irrelevant if you go ask people pre-merge um the merge is gonna fall apart um do you still want to own ether the answer is going to be for most people yes some people will they sell sure will it have some small impact on the price sure what are you really relying on then if you're holding ether I'm relying on awesome scaling Solutions across ethereum I'm relying on awesome dexes um awesome lending protocols I'm relying on on and off ramps continuing to support ether I'm relying on about like thousands and thousands of different pieces that are adding True Value and that if they were to go away would destroy the value of ether and if ethereum Foundation would go away would not at all um and when you just look at those facts alone merge or no merge the idea that ether is a Security based on like the ethereum foundation's efforts or trying as they did with Dash but in very different facts trying to bring the validators together with the ethereum foundation as one again with dashed masternodes actually had control over the equivalent of of like the dash Foundation concept that's just not the case case here there is like true Independence there and so we're facing like a totally different situation again I don't think we'll see it because of the statute of limitations issue anyway but bottom line like the idea even that that ether is a security is is so far-fetched uh from my perspective I mean I I don't necessarily disagree with you and I also I do think frankly notwithstanding what chairman Gensler may have said from time to time about everything other than Bitcoin if you if you believe that New York mag uh semi quote right um but I mean because I've seen up front and you know up close and personal instances in which a digital asset that the SEC initially believed was a security where we believe that it no longer is a security right and where that argument has been made and you know I'm quite comfortable with saying that so I I I don't agree in any instance that everything other than Bitcoin um is a security I think there are lots of projects and it comes down to facts and circumstances I don't think though that um that the SEC wants people to be doing things that look like lending and that's why I believe some of these statements are made I do think also just going back to the hearings for a second a lot has been made about how German Gensler didn't give a specific answer I think one interesting thing just to remember is you know the New York AG has the case against kucoin right now right where they've alleged that either is a security so you have to think about you know where are the obviously there was a very uh big divide on somewhat partisan divide in the hearing right and so thinking about what answers may come back to haunt someone um especially if you think about is Gary Gensler political strategist you know does he have designs on potentially being head of Treasury or something else I mean some say let's just remember TurnKey Jets pocket full of quarters we know there's two other tokens that are not Securities and I think that hyperbole by cheer ginsler is really problematic right because you you can't make these statements um if that statement is true that everything other than if that's a true statement that was made everything other than Bitcoin is a security we like know for a fact that even the staff at the SEC was willing to stand behind two no action letters proving that that's not the case we also can point to probably many obvious examples of other things where it'd be just total like nonsense so I I honestly think it's like his responsibility to be a little more careful um with what is being said there because it does move entire markets and I don't think that the chair of the SEC should be looking to move uh Commodities markets in the way that he's doing yeah there's something contradictory between it all comes down to facts and circumstances and everything but Bitcoin is a security so um well there's like five million other questions that I had but we are definitely over time so just one kind of big wrap-up question for each of you like obviously there's just so much activity in this space so going forward like what are kind of the main things that you're looking out for like developments that you're interested to follow so I guess I'll go first for this um I I think I my eyes are are open watching what goes on with with coinbase and other exchanges I do believe we are going to to the extent that we haven't seen enforcement actions against particular groups I think we will see them I think there's a very planned attack on a whole variety of of fronts I do think and I I know that this is somewhat uh controversial as are some of my other views but I I do believe that the SEC views certain VCS in certain instances as having acted as Underwriters and I do expect that we will see certain enforcement actions um relating to that and and just explain what that means what does it mean to be an underwriter sure um well it means purchasing uh with a view to resell right not purchasing for your own account but you're planning to resell into the market right that and where it where the kind of rubber meets the road on that in in a couple of I'll try and keep it short right is for example if you have a reg D offering right to accredited investors one of the requirements is that you not sell to Underwriters and we saw this come up in telegram a couple of years ago right where they weren't allowed to deliver their grants to folks in the US because they said look you've said this is a micropayment system there's going to be millions of new users a month and yet you only sold to a handful or a hundred right purchasers and the average size was about 10 million um so clearly they were designed to to sell on and then the SEC was able after that to stop or have the court agree with them to not allow grams to be delivered overseas outside of the US because it was part of a single plan based on my understanding I do believe that in certain instances I won't say all but you know the FCC believes that certain marketing and other activities by um by VCS that those VCS may be acting as Underwriters again if if this is the case in any particular instance then a company an issuer of any type of digital asset may have thought that they complied with reg d right and yet it may no longer be deemed to be compliant where I think this comes up and then I I promise I will zip it is we keep hearing or we kept hearing chair Gensler say that tokens need to register or issuers need to register their tokens to which I would always say you know you don't need to register your token you can just sell pursuant to an exemption such as write d but if in fact this underwriter piece comes up then I do think what he was saying may make more sense right if there is no good exemption then maybe there there would need to be the registration but I I do think with that we need to think about bad actor status um we did see for example someone mentioned I I forget which one of you mentioned earlier the EOS enforcement action right against the plain vanilla ERC token right that initially was sold in that instance um there was a request uh for a waiver of bad actor status bad actor status will stay with you right you won't be able to be on a board or an executive officer of a company that wants to do an exempt offering you know if you have that and that was one enforcement action where the lawyers very wisely sought a waiver and I think that's something that people should be aware of as enforcement actions come along ask that waiver not legal advice yeah the things that I'm looking at um I think broadly is just on the policy uh side of things in in Congress really I think we have a like very solid group of people who are now working on policy in the space much better than it was just a few years ago much bigger than it was a few years ago and we have policy makers who um are listening on both sides of the aisle quite well and forming like opinions on it and so I'm like very excited to see where that moves I think it might be slow moving in the next few years but I do think that there's like momentum that'll build up there I think the the next one is definitely exchanges I think it's really hard to not pay attention to what those happens given like the market impact um that it is going to have um and then lastly the actual rulemaking on exchanges um what ends up happening there the litigation that comes out of it right because you can be sure that if that rule is finalized there will be in in its current form there will be litigation around it um and then how that turns out I think is going to shape a lot uh partially because I think D5 is just a crucial part of any blockchain right if you don't have D5 on the blockchain you have Bitcoin and I love Bitcoin but it's just a simple payments platform that ends up being very very useful but if you want to do more than that you need D5 and so the impact that that rulemaking will have on D5 I think is is something that we definitely need to pay attention to all right well this has been such a fascinating discussion I have enjoyed it so much where can people learn more about each of you and
