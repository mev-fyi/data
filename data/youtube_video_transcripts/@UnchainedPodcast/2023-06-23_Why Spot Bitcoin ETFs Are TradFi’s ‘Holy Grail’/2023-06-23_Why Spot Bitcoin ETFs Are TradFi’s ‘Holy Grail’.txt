listener person caller great to have you last week BlackRock the world's largest asset manager filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF what were the sec's previous objections to approving spot Bitcoin ETFs and how does this application address those concerns to start the Winklevoss Twins were the first ones to file for a Bitcoin ETF back in 2013 when Bitcoin was a hundred dollars and basically over the last decade we're literally coming up on a decade next month um there's been they've whittled away at all of the sec's concerns or not all of them but as far as I'm concerned they've ordered that the key ones the one things that the one main thing they're hung up on in the most recent denial specifically the grayscale gbtc application last year they want a regulated spot Market and they want it to be of significant size those are terms they use of significant size I think in this in the grayscale denial they also they all they wanted of significant size but they want also a surveillance sharing agreement so they either want a regulated market or they want a surveillance sharing agreement with the spot Market both of which need to be of significant size so those are terms that the SEC uses and that is that fact is what makes this application possibly different aside from the fact that it's BlackRock right so BlackRock is the largest issuer in the United States for ETFs they take up about 33 of the market based on our estimates so they are Far and Away the largest well that's that's a lie Vanguard is close behind at like 28 but they would never file for an ETF so the fact that BlackRock who obviously they have ties and know what's going on in Washington's filing is a huge thing but the difference in their application when it first came out on Thursday their perspectives didn't highlight anything that was like extremely uniquely different about their filing but uh the next day we saw what was called the 19b4 filing which we can get into the differences there if you want but the key note there was which coindesk broke this first was they have in their a line basically saying that they have a surveillance share ingredient between NASDAQ and a spot Exchange Market which is critical now I'm going to assume that it's coinbase it's not guaranteed that it's coinbase because it's not named but BlackRock is using coinbase as their custodian coinbase has other Partnerships with BlackRock for pricing and their institutional clients so based the theory is that it is coinbase that's the spot Market the question is is it of significant size and what's your take on that do you think it is or not so if you read like any of the other language that the SEC has done so like there's been 30 plus denials of spot Bitcoin ETFs they shouldn't approve this right based on the language they've used in the past like they probably shouldn't approve this that said they've done things where they like kind of are flexible in some areas and super rigid in others so I mean if you look at any charts of the breakdown of like the Bitcoin spot market right you have binance at 50 60 percent of a trading volume right but if you narrow that down to USD exchanges exchanges that have USD on-ramps all of a sudden coinbase is a significant Market if you look at the solely things with US dollar pairs also coinbase is the significant Market but if you're just looking at Bitcoin as a total Market which is how most people would look at it then coinbase is definitely in my opinion not a market of significant size maybe you could argue that in combination with the CME Futures Market could be enough to surveil the market yeah so essentially if the SEC wants to say the whole Bitcoin market then I would argue that coinbase probably isn't but if you want to get narrow narrow things down you you might be able to say it and if you look basically we had Bitcoin future ctfs the first one to launch launched under What's called the 1940 act and then we had other ones that ultimately got approved under this same 19b4 process their 1933 act products and when they got approved they spent half the time of those approval letters saying why they were approving this and why they weren't going to approved spot Bitcoin ETF it was it was borderline of how much time they spent saying when approving why they weren't going to prove a spot coming so that was why we were confident grayscale wasn't going to get approved but in that letter the reason that they said the CME Futures Market was a market of significant size was because they determined the market was only CME Futures market so if your only Market you're comparing it to is the CME then all of a sudden the CME Futures is a market of significant size so if they do something similar like they did with that approval then it doesn't get so far-fetched and by when you say similar you mean by limiting limiting it to US dollar BTC pairs yes exactly something along those lines I I don't there's no way to know exactly how the SEC is going to do it or even if they do that at all like I said coin like no matter how you slice it no matter what source you look at binance is Far and Away the dominant player especially after FTX is no longer around yeah which of course is um you know probably not the sec's favorite crypto exchange um so earlier you said you could also talk about the 19b4 filing so go ahead and tell us a little bit about that yeah so a 19b4 filing is basically it comes from an exchange usually in partnership with an issuer in this case when you're trying to file for an ETF and you need to get a rule change that allows these things to happen right now it's against rule step a spot Bitcoin ETF so typically what would happen is an exchange like nicey or New York Stock Exchange or CBOE or NASDAQ will partner with an issue and filed this is why we think you should change the rules to allow spot Bitcoin ETF and here's all the reasons why here's your objections and why we think those objections have been satisfied so on and these these are like 80 Pages hundreds of pages sometimes detailing this back and forth this is the filing that I should filed on Friday and that's where we saw the spot the spot exchange surveillance sharing agreement that they're saying they have which is basically means they're going to share all the trade data from coinbase with NASDAQ and then NASDAQ is obviously regulated so therefore the SEC can see that data oh but was coinbase named coinbase was not named so coinbase was not named at the 19 before they just say they just refer to it as a spot Exchange Market I don't know what the exact ordering but it's it's basically I'm operating under the assumption over the last few days that it's going to be coinbase is ultimately that person and honestly I'm not sure why they didn't name coinbase which I don't I actually don't have an answer for that um but the following day I believe it was Monday after that 19 before dropped on Friday bitwise had filed um for a 19 before application and nights on nicely so nicey now has an application doesn't have the same surveillance sharing agreements and then also recently there was a lot of news about Invesco and Galaxy who have partnered for applications of the past also followed with CBOE so now there's active 19b4s at all three of the major exchanges the first one that would come up is Blackrock and NASDAQ um I should also add arc Arc Investments Kathy Wood and 21 shares which is a large ETF issuer in Europe they partnered at filed for 19 before this ishares one that was actually delayed already but that that one doesn't have the the the differences with the surveillance sharing agreement either all right so before we get into kind of this horse race amongst all these different issue viewers let's actually just talk about the fact that in recent months the SEC has kind of been on a tear with enforcement actions and lawsuits and all kinds of things against crypto companies so why do you think BlackRock decided to file now I have a lot of like theories You could argue some of them are conspiracy theories in some way so though there's two there's two trains of thought here right either either BlackRock knows something and thinks there's an Avenue here and they they know and they they found a little narrow way to get through and they think Gensler is going to waver a bit on what's going on or they just think they have a narrow way and they're filing for the chance anyway so we'll start with that second one first even if the odds I've said this on multiple occasions but even if the odds of of uh spot Bitcoin ETF approval for eye shares being first are like 10 right even if they view the odds it's like pretty low of them getting approval based on the fact that the SEC has a lot of experience denying spot Bitcoin ETFs the the chance that maybe we think we can get through and be the first is critical I mean it's it's significant money we saw bito the Bitcoin Futures ETF the first one to launch that thing took in a billion and a half dollars in two days so that and you're charging fees on that obviously that's significant money even for somebody like BlackRock it's not nothing and you're going to grow that over time being a first mover is a huge Advantage we saw the same thing with spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada the first mover purpose had a huge advantage over all of its competitors so just taking that alone taking out who BlackRock is it makes sense why issuers are filing these things right because they have to be there and then everyone's following suit because they don't want to be too far behind if you're a day or two behind BlackRock or whoever getting out first that's not a big deal all of a sudden you're a couple months behind that's a way harder proposition to make in on a competitive landscape now if we take the other side of things that BlackRock might know something you have to go to kind of what's going on with grayscale there's the Ripple lawsuit which Ripple might actually win there's a that's not it's not if you asked me a couple years ago I've been like oh yeah scc's got this closing shot up in this grayscale case we were always we always thought grade school had a legitimate chance then after the oil arguments it looks like we we my litigation analyst my colleague Elliot Stein please the grayscale is about 70 chance of winning that is not good for the SEC so these all could be reasons why Gensler might be looking for a way to like save face a little bit like back down um and if you look at all the allegations obviously the finance allegations is separate from coinbase right the lawsuits there's a lot of things that are they're being accused of there uh including wash trading which could question the how much of this of their Market size is actually 60 if there's a bunch of watch trading happening on finance us who knows what else is happening there so that's another thing also going back Gary's might be facing the loss at uh grayscale and he's focused on all these lawsuits they're all on all coins or things that he's claiming to be Securities for the most part the one thing he said which you've covered extensively is Bitcoin is not a security it'll even even though he's said in the past that ethereum is not a security the SEC has said it in the past he won't say it now the one thing he's admitted unwaveringly is yes we we don't think Bitcoin is a security so if he's going to give ground anywhere it might be on bitcoin right and coinbase they're not accusing them of fraud or these other things they're accusing them of operating at unregistered Securities Exchange because they're claiming these tokens to be Securities which is regulation via forcement and you've covered that a bunch but all these areas mean like if he's going to give anywhere it might be on a Bitcoin ETF and also if he can then find a way to approve these things before being handed a negative decision from the courts maybe this is the way to do it because he can say look there is a way to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF you can't say that we didn't offer a legitimate path because basically the lawsuit by grayscale is saying you approve Futures ETFs you're not approving spot you're not treating like situations alike and for those reasons they're saying they violated the APA the administrative procedures act and it looks like the courts are going to agree and our basic case before this was like the courts would send it back to Great to the SEC and say you can't deny for those reasons so either approve or to die for other reasons and we just thought grayscale I mean the SEC was going to figure out another reason to deny grayscale now with Brock Rock here obviously BlackRock is very tight end so we think maybe they know something's going on that we don't but again you fall back on the fact that they're the only one that now has what's a surveillance sharing agreement with the spot market and maybe they just think this this should be enough to get by with the sec's concerns and obviously Hester purse would agree with everything we're saying here like the the re she's been very adamant and dissented on all these decisions that the the SEC has given for for denying spot Bitcoin ETS yeah and I saw some other analysis that um like perhaps uh she and another commissioner Mark uieda um they're aligned and may have persuaded another commissioner or something um but then the other thought that I've been having is that when you have all these you know exchange treated products around Bitcoin in other jurisdiction that I've been trading for a long time it does feel like at a certain point you're right like the US just sort of needs to give and um you're right that yeah they're not pursuing regulatory actions on bitcoin um so in a moment we're going to talk about the differences between some of these different applications but first a quick

one actually last bit on the BlackRock ETF that I have to ask about is you know as we've discussed the SEC is suing coinbase so um you know why do you think uh like BlackRock chose coinbase as the custodian does that cause any problems uh because you know they are facing this lawsuit from the SEC I mean that is undoubtedly something that like I've gotten from other people and you have to take that as a risk which is why we don't think the odds of like this can get approved they're like 70 like we think the grayscale victory like the odds are still stacked against BlackRock um my colleague Eric Bell Tunis and I are roughly around 50 50 we think maybe which is way higher than most other people in the Trad five space but that said like I said the coinbase allegations are around completely separate Securities they're not accusing them of fraud so I could make the I would make the argument that like they're not worried about their Bitcoin custody program and why would BlackRock choose uh coinbase they already have a partnership with coinbase they use them for pricing algorithms they input on their side unlike products they have like Aladdin um and also I believe they they it was about a year ago that they announced a partnership with BlackRock coinbase and BlackRock so they're also like institutional clients of BlackRock um they'll use they use coinbase to get access to the crypto market so I I assume it's for custody and other things like that trading perhaps um so there's already a built-in partnership between BlackRock and coinbase and also there aren't all that many other people that you can partner with Gemini also does a custodian business there's a few others but but coinbase is obviously like relatively the leader in the space that our public firm uh so it makes sense that BlackRock could partner with them and if we were talking about other cryptos or some of the ones that the SEC was alleging to be Securities we wouldn't be having this conversation I don't think yeah and then just to take a step back let's uh just spell this out for any especially more kind of recent listeners because we've had Bitcoin Futures ETFs for a few years now um but everybody's really been waiting for a Bitcoin spot ETF so why is that yeah I mean a spot ETF is the Holy Grail really like that that's what you want there Futures ETF so in Futures ETFs the way they work is Futures markets or uh you you buy every month right so basically it's it's currently June so right now you might be holding the June contract but as the end of June gets comes closer you're gonna have to sell those June contracts and by July in a typical Market or typical Bitcoin Market it's in contango which means that next month is a little bit more expensive so over the very long term um you're basically selling at a lower price and then buying at a higher price so that eats away and returns to be fair the Bitcoin ETFs the Futures ETFs have done very well they haven't lagged spot by much at all a couple of percent here and there um but in the times before the Bitcoin ETF launched that was like 60 70 percent that the Futures Market rolling front month Futures was lagging spot Bitcoin now a lot of that has to do with institutions coming in things are way more efficient um the carry trade that you might have heard of other people doing just isn't as profitable as it used to be but also we haven't been in a Raging Bull Market you were talking about with gbtc the carry trade oh no no so people would basically carry trade Futures so you could you you could buy the Futures and then you could handle basically you could make make money off the difference between spot and Futures market so if the spot Market was different from the Futures Market you could you could do things like post collateral and trade Futures around that and basically as that went up as the price went up and met the futures or Futures came down to meet spot or what have you you could make money doing that okay yeah so basically those Futures ETFs have done very well if you want to trade Bitcoin and you want to get exposure to bitcoin there's nothing wrong with the Futures ETFs that are out there but that's as many people would call it it's paper Bitcoin their Futures products even though they do settle in Bitcoin but you're you're not actually holding the physical Bitcoin in a trust somewhere it's not on a wallet anywhere you're just trading Futures back and forth and like I said there was no bull market right so when you get into a really steep bull market that's when those other months might be further away from the current month and where those costs of selling the current month and buying the next could really start going up so we haven't been since the Futures ETFs launch they basically top tipped the market at the end of 2021 when they launched so everything's been going down or sideways it's slightly up now so it'll be interesting to see what happens with that Futures curve but spot is the thing that everyone wants because you know it's just held an ETF you can always create or redeem shares so essentially you could hand over Bitcoin get shares of the ETF or hand over share shares with ETF and get Bitcoin back so that means the price and nav is always stays in line which is not happening with gbtc so basically it's just an efficient market ETFs are just a wrapper and a technology and it's a way to basically get Bitcoin on tradify Rails if you will so it's just the most efficient way to do it and it would hold physical Bitcoin uh I should put physical in quotes yeah yeah and it's best for people who just kind of want to like Buy and Hold for the long term whereas yeah you're right with the Bitcoin Futures ETF it'll kind of get eaten away um so as we mentioned right after BlackRock filed a whole bunch of other institutions did as well so first of all explain like why there was this flurry of activity right after but then also talk about the material differences the applications that um for you you know you think could cause some of them to be approved versus others to be rejected so right now the only material difference between all of the 19v4 applications as far as I'm concerned is that surveillance sharing agreement there's a lot of other research in there bitwise has done tons of research to show that the Futures market and CME often lead spot uh showing that there is it is a market of significant size for spot markets so there's a lot of different things in there and they all coalesce to show like why in my opinion Bitcoin ETFs should have already been approved as far as I'm concerned but this surveillance sharing agreement that coinbase and BlackRock uh have with NASDAQ is is the real only main thing that's a differentiator here as far as I'm concerned we'll see if all these ETFs do la at some point we're going to get Bitcoin ETFs right and when they happen with the way ETFs usually differentiate themselves is one is cost fees are going to come way down for what people are typically used to seeing for for Bitcoin ETFs but they'll also do unique things like one issuer might have I talked about create shares or destroy shares usually what what that's done is like in what's called a creation unit so that creation unit could be you need 40 000 shares but there are some gold ETFs where you only need a couple thousand shares and you can take delivery of physical gold this is Bitcoin so it wouldn't actually need physical delivery so there might be some issues that have way smaller creation unit sizes where you can buy the ETF and as anyone could then go in and say I actually want to take delivery of the underlying Bitcoin two years down the line or whatever have you by giving them a wallet address so for the most part institutions are the ones that do those creation redemptions but there are unique things it'll be stored in a cold wallet some of them might say we're never going to do any lending of the underlying Bitcoin someone will advertise a much lower fee because they are going to lend out the underlying Bitcoin there's all these different differentiating factors that you could do that they're not really outlined clearly in all these perspectives most of these prospectuses are what people refer to as red herrings because they have all this red light red writing all around the edges which basically says it's not it's subject to completion it's not done yet so we don't have fees many of them don't have tickers they just have basic things like we're going to list on this exchange some of them have a ticker some they all say what their custodian is what their third party uh like administrators anything along those lines and a lot of risk disclosures but for the most part they're all pretty similar they're all going to be trusts that hold spot Bitcoin with different names different Partnerships but the only real difference is that 19b4 application from ishares that has that surveillance sharing agreement as far as I've seen thus far I have it I need to keep diving in and reading more things but these are like hundreds of pages in many cases so it's hard to like really narrow in on what the difference is without like a scoop from some issue or saying here's the difference that we just filed for this which is obviously how coinbase saw that that 19 before application had the surveillance generation I think it was buried on like page 36 of the document or something so you mean coin desk coindes sorry yeah not coinbase so then of the different applications which would you bet on as being the ones to be approved so I don't know exactly how the SEC is going to handle this right so obviously eye shares if they approve if they're going to prove one it would be the issues 19 before application because it's the only one that's truly differentiated from the ones that have been denied in the past like I said arguably it's not differentiated enough based on the sec's prior wording um but they could approve it so it would be I shares that would be first then NASDAQ so that's they're they're in partnership with NASDAQ Valkyrie filed recently and updated perspectives they gave us the ticker Burr printer gopher which is my favorite one yeah it's really good I I gotta give my hats off to Steve and Leah over there running Valkyrie but they also change from their change their listing from I believe it was nicey uh New York Stock Exchange but now it's NASDAQ so theoretically that 19 before rule change if it's approved BlackRock would theoretically be first but that means NASDAQ has the rule change in the is allowed to launch Bitcoin ETFs which would mean that likely I believe Valkyrie is the only other issuer that has a filing at NASDAQ so Valkyrie might be second the other ones are CBOE and nicey and I don't know exactly how they would how that would work I would think if you approve on NASDAQ ultimately they would then approve a nicey and CBOE because then they have the surveillance sharing agreement with NASDAQ to be able to see it but I am I'm I'm not a legal expert I've gone down a lot of rabbit holes in this front so I don't know exactly how it would play out my personal preference would be like okay NASDAQ wins let those guys go first and then everyone else should be able to launch on the same day but that's not how the SEC works like I thought the same thing with Bitcoin Futures ETFs like pro shares was one day early on a couple others and like I just it's weird to me that you're just giving one person all this it's like a like I said they took in 1.5 billion dollars in the first day like you're just handing somebody all that money I I would think it'd make more sense um to to just let everyone go from the start line at once but I guess the argument would be that'd be more communist than capitalist and that's not how our regulations work so basically there's a set timeline for like after this so many days after filing you can get approved and then you can list and things like that so there's a set timeline so the first one to file and start that clock is the one that would start everything going forward and so but you're saying even though it was 21 shares in Arc like essentially because they don't have that surveillance sharing and you think it's just unlikely they'll be approved so really the clock starts with BlackRock is that is that it yeah so so Arkansas they filed uh in May so technically the way these 19 before applications work is you apply and then there's some time period that you see it posted on the the exchange's website so in the case of our 21 shares with CBOE and then it gets posted to the SEC website that says like we're acknowledging it and then it gets posted to like what they refer to as the Federal Register and that's when a clock starts so then they have the SEC has 45 days to issue a delay deny or approve order so every other time every other spot Bitcoin ETF they've delayed so they go 45 days 45 days 90 days 60 days and at the end of that it's 240 days they either have to approve or deny they can't delay every time they've denied one they've waited to 240 days to issue the denial letter but if one of these is going to get approved it could happen after that 45-day period And if we look at what happened with Arc 21 shares they filed their date their 45-day date where they should have gotten a response from the SEC was technically June 29th but the SEC came out on June 15th and said we're going to delay this immediately so they didn't wait for the 45-day period so the 45-day period we don't know when it's going to be for eye shares because like I said it there's could be a one week or two week lag from when it hits the the exchange website to when it finally hits the SEC register so we don't actually know when it's going to happen but I'm estimating that like that 45 day time period to be somewhere around August 19th roughly give or take seven to ten days in either direction so until we see it posted in the SEC website I won't have any real clear timeline but again maybe that timeline that date doesn't fully matter considering the SEC just delayed our 21 shares two weeks earlier than they were supposed to but again if if we see a delay on the ishares application that's pretty much that's a that's a bad sign in our view because like I said if they're going to approve it under what it's currently doing they would just approve it basically the way it's filed maybe some basically there's some back and forth between all those time periods so the SEC issues the denial or delay for XYZ reasons and sometimes the issuers and exchanges will like here's more information here's something you're questioning and why it shouldn't be questioned and then maybe all of a sudden the SEC could approve but typically if you delay first the vast majority of time I see them ultimately get denied at the end of that 240-day time period and that time period is probably somewhere in late late February early uh early March of 2024. okay yeah but it's interesting to lay it on the same exact day that BlackRock filed which I don't know I like I I don't know this world but my thought is like oh that's because maybe they do plan to approve BlackRock but anyway I agree that's no that's a good notice on your part like it is very odd timing that they would just oh we got this BlackRock application uh for a rule change let's delay this Arc one because theoretically I don't know exactly how it would work with these other exchanges because technically right now it's just it's just NASDAQ like I said that has that spot surveillance share agreement but I would assume once it's approved on NASDAQ the SEC is then just going to approve these other ones which are a couple days behind the NASDAQ ones okay last thing that I definitely want to cover Before We Say Goodbye which is just that grayscale obviously has been suing the SEC over the rejection of its application to turn gbtc um its Bitcoin trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF so grayscale has said that it expects a decision on that by the end of the third quarter you know you've been talking about and I actually had your calling on my show to talk about how we thought it was looking really positive for grayscale but uh when you look at you know what's going on on these uh Bitcoin ETF applications along with this pending decision how do you think those two things will play out in terms of you know who will get approval first or like what that would mean even if there is a win for grayscale in this lawsuit and you know what are the prospects it could also become a spot Bitcoin ETF yeah so uh there's a lot to unpack here I have a lot of views on this so I think I kind of mentioned early on that I thought grayscale was going to win and Gary could be looking for a way to like make it so that the judge's decision either becomes irrelevant the case gets thrown out because they approve spot Bitcoin ETF or it just goes that way right so like I said but why would but why would it get thrown out I don't understand because it would like because then then it can launch so once an ETF is approved then grayscale can theoretically convert Theirs to an ETF if they really wanted why is that is that it's 19 before rule change is accepted if one is approved right then all of a sudden grayscale's lawsuit is kind of irrelevant because they they will be able to convert gbgc to an ETF because the the rule change was allowed to allow for spot Bitcoin ETFs so if if one of these is approved then grayscale would theoretically be able to convert GBC to an ETF so there's two there's two thought you just understand so the sec's denial of grayscale wasn't like particular to this whole process of turning gbtc into a Bitcoin spot ETF it was just about the fact that no Bitcoin spot ETFs exist already or something like that oh God yeah so the grayscale denial was basically saying I think the word surveillance sharing agreement was in their 84 times I don't remember the exact number but it was almost 100 times they said surveillance sharing agreement in their denial letter to grayscale so the reason grayscale couldn't get their ETF approved uh is the same reason that no one else can get their ETFs approved uh even though it would be way better for all the end investors they'd be protecting investors by getting rid of that discount all those different reasons that the SEC basically said we don't care about any of that it's about the underlying spot market and whether or not it's regulated or their surveillance sharing agreements so there's two ways to look at this either the one the one way that I initial thought was like maybe BlackRock thinks graciel's going to win their lawsuit and there's a potential that they could get approved to launch an ETF BlackRock wants to make sure they're right there when it gets approved or maybe they're using this as a way and the SEC is going to approve this before there's even a decision from the federal judges and that way the SEC doesn't take a loss in federal court potentially or if they do it's kind of irrelevant and it's like a loss in name only because technically the SEC they say they proved that there was a way to approve a spot Bitcoin ETFs and that it was different from Futures I don't know exactly how all that worked I'm not a legal expert obviously Elliot Stein my colleague obviously is um so he's the person I defer to on this but basically there's there's a few different reasons how grayscale's situation ties into over here but if one of these is approved then grayscale can convert JBC to an ETF I don't know what the timing looks like uh between that that announcement and when they're allowed to do it also there's grayscale has been very adamant that they're going to convert ETF and lower fees but there's no guarantee forcing them that they're going to and I know a lot of people in the crypto and Trad five space that say there's no way they're actually going to convert and give up that two percent in perpetuity I don't think that's the case I think they'd be dead in the water if they have the ability to convert to an ETF and then they don't do it um and there's so many people circling trying to crack open gbtc and break open that discount that if they don't convert an ETF something's going to happen the courts where they're going to be forced to so they might as well do it themselves and honestly Michael sunshine has been very clear we want to convert this an ETF all the way back in 2015. they've been saying they're going to convert to an ETF so I think ultimately when one of these gets approved gbtc will convert to an ETF I'll eat crow if I'm wrong but okay and then there's just one last bit that you said and I feel like I maybe had a delayed understanding of what you were saying but basically you were saying that if BlackRock uh blackrock's ETF gets approved then um that would just cause the grayscale lawsuit to get tossed out and then the SEC would not have to like face a loss is that what you said that's pot that's my thinking I don't know exactly how it would work but if basically grayscale's whole lawsuit their whole premise is basically you approve Futures ETFs you're not improving spot Bitcoin ETFs and there's no reason for it you're not giving us ground to actually be able to do it like they're saying you're not treating like situations alike if all of a sudden the SEC can come back to the courts and be like look over here we approved this one and then grayscale is going to be able to convert because it because BlackRock figured it out and you guys couldn't like I don't know how the courts would handle that but theoretically even if the courts do decide that the SEC violated the APA it's almost like a loss in name only because Gary can be like no we found a way we got the markets regulated we got surveillance sharing agreements with the underlying spot markets look Gary genzer's a politician so he wants to put feathers in his cab you can see all the videos he posts all over Twitter about different things he's doing he's he's a politician first and foremost so if he can say like push that aside and say no they they were wrong and we did this we approved um we backed down a little bit there but we're going after the real fraudsters and the things that are actually Securities he can there's there's a way for him to spin this essentially it's my whole thought

experience typically 13 more than you want I didn't have a huge effect on the price of Bitcoin though crypto is like Trump the more legal action you take against it the more popular it gets the judge overseeing the case did seem to see both sides she called the SEC strategy of using enforcement action to regulate crypto inefficient and cumbersome personally I like my regulatory oversight sleek and simple like an Apple Watch however she also expressed skepticism at binance's argument that it was caught off guard since the SEC has been investigating binance since 2020. I don't know though sometimes things just slip past you I have a warning on my car that I've been meaning to get to for the last six years the good news for binance is that the two sides reached a deal to keep finance.us open in this agreement funds belonging to binance.us customers would go into a special digital repository that's only accessible by us customers that's so cool honestly ever since McDonald's Global we've had so few uniquely American things and I guess there was the Insurrection but those years ago thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about James and the recent ETF filings check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin what's up from Kevin Fuchs Matt Pilcher and Zach Seward Juana rainovich Sam sriram Jenny Hogan Jeff Benson Leandro Camino pamachamdar Shashank and Margaret Korea thanks for listening [Music] foreign
