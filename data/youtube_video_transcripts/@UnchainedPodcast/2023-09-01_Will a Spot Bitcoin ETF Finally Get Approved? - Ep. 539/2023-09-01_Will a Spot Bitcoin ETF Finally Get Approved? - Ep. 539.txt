guest is Eric balchunis senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg intelligence welcome Eric great to be here thank you this week was a big week for a possible spot Bitcoin ETF what happened well grayscale had sued the SEC a while back and the ruling came out and it was pretty I think the word uh that one headline uses stinging it was a 3-0 decision in favor of grayscale against the SEC and basically vacated their entire justification for denying all those spotted ETFs over the years well so we have uh had a 65 chance of Bitcoin ETFs being launched this year but we upped it to 75 now we had factored in a grayscale win but the language the uh absoluteness of the way they vacated the SEC and the 3-0 decision was a little more than our expectations and some of our legal analyst friends had the same reaction and the 3-0 is important because the main judge is a trump appointee but they're the two are Obama and Carter appointee so you had two Democrats agreeing with the Republican on the bench that's important because remember Gensler is a Democrat and so there's politics involved with all this and so one thing that we've been watched this whole time is the political tenableness of genzer being able to say to keep denying ETFs because some point the political pressure could could move it could change and so we also looked at the public relations Fallout I mean this stuff was covered in New York Times Wall Street Journal CNN ABC and then all the financial publications those are Publications the Capitol Hill reads right and you know people in power like they're not you know as much as I love the crypto trade Publications you know they're probably not widespread read across Congress but the New York Times is Wall Street journalists so this was a big deal and so it was the pr and the legal aspect together that we upped our eyes to 75 we also talked to again we lean on lawyers legal experts and our own senior litigation analyst Elliot Stein who was correct in calling the grayscale win so he's been really good about this in his phrase about the ruling was that this this kind of gives the SEC very little wiggle room to sort of come back with some other reason to deny and so again we're we're still leaving 25 chance that it does not launch this year because we've been in this 10 years now and we know how stubborn the SEC has been on this issue and we know Gensler and so there's just always that possibility that in either move the goal posts you know one one thing they're talking about is custody you know that wasn't brought up in the fraud or manipulation denials but they could say well now okay fine that's not an issue but well now we're worried about how you're going to custody it whether it's safe um you know it's possible they go there um you know we just don't know but again we we keep moving a little further in our optimism yeah I mean I agree with you that this unanimous decision was definitely pretty stinging as you put it for the SEC particularly um you know they keep using the phrase the the judges keep using the phrase arbitrary and capricious in the decision-making and calling out the inconsistency and there are many points in the decision where they will say oh um you know the SEC gave this particular reasoning when they approved this Bitcoin Futures ETF and then said the exact opposite thing when they you know deny the grayscale so it was just really fascinating to watch it looked like you know they were saying uh the agency is overreached here I think this is an important point because we it it feels as though they you know by approving Futures they kind of opened up this you know can of worms because the Futures are based on spot so they're like well we don't think spot we think it's a wild west there's no way we can approve any but the Futures Market is 99.9 correlated to spot and that's how it's priced so in a way it is weird not to approve spot and approve Futures especially if you take the legal aspects you just take a step back as a normal person looking at investment products and if your goal is to protect investors and give them something like safe well by denying spot which to me would be like a green light you know in our traffic light system a green light safe ETF like GLD for gold but yet you're going to approve Futures ETFs which have to roll so like the Bitcoin Futures ETF is lagging spot by I think six seven percent this year because of that roll costs that most normal people don't understand then you also have gbtc which is a broken product that was allowed to sort of get around and almost was mistaken for an ETF by a lot of people that's a bad experience if you got into that and then microstrategy has become a ipso facto ETF by owning a lot of Bitcoin and you could argue that's not a straight Bitcoin ETF either because there's other variables there whereas a spot ETF would just be easy safe it would track the price of Bitcoin very well because you can do Arbitrage between Bitcoin and the ETF and so it's just a little bit frustrating if you're looking to give investors something that's protecting them and then all these other products come out that are in our view less safe and you know have other variables that are that you don't get in the spot Bitcoin ETF and then they just approved the 2x Bitcoin Futures ETF he's like again that'd be a top 10 most volatile ETF on the planet I mean it's it's a confusing policy so I think what they're doing is they're using the ETF almost I don't say hostage is a rough word but to regulate crypto more and more and I think but these lawsuits are going to add up and I think at some point you know perhaps they are going to just move on and approve them because we did think they were just using the ETF to do things in the crypto space that they wanted to in terms of bringing them more into like regulatory framework and having them be more regulated like Equity markets it's super interesting yeah one um thing I just wanted to ask you to explain because you said like the Bitcoin Futures rolls and then it causes the price to lag by six to seven percent um at least the ETF because you know we had talked about how the Futures price and the spot price has correlated 99.9 can you just talk a little bit about why it was at the ETF price would lag yeah so Bitcoin biddo the Ito the Bitcoin future TGF holds one or two months Futures the ones closest to it expiring so what's you know we're in um August it probably holds I'm going to say September and October and so as September approaches it has to it doesn't it doesn't want to take delivery so it has to sell September and go into October or sell October and go into November and if Bitcoin is rallying and in a good place usually the Futures curve goes up so that because there's expectations that Bitcoin will be worth more in the future and so when you sell September by October it's a little more expensive and this is called contango which means that the curve is going up and you're buying it you're selling uh lower and buying higher when you roll and those little moves all year are called roll costs and for something like oil Futures they can be massive like 40 percent but for you know gold they're very minor Bitcoin I would say you know seven percent isn't that bad the good news is when you have that contango it usually means bitcoin's in a good place so I think Betos up like 65 70 this year so but Bitcoin spot is probably up 78 so we can still you're up a lot so you're not like totally bummed but the idea that you just can't get the look at the end of the day advisors in particular and just regular investors they just want something that's close to the price that tracks it whether it goes up or down and Futures ETFs over the years advisors in particular have just they don't like them they don't like that that variable of contango and roll costs and it's hard to like figure that out and so they just want it physical so in the gold area there were gold Futures ETFs uh but they went extinct because everybody gravitated towards the physical so all 150 billion dollars in gold ETFs are in the physically back ones and so when if there's a choice everybody's going to go physical people just don't like the derivative variable in their fund and bitto I think show that this year but again bitto is doing exactly what it's supposed to do it's not like it's bad it's just when you have a Futures ETF rolling can cost cost you return and then just briefly for listeners who may not understand why there would be a demand for spot Bitcoin ETF given that it will essentially track the price of spot Bitcoin and people can just hold that even in their own wallets or on an exchange so just explain why it is that this rapper of the ETF is important for investors yeah I mean um and the ETF wrapper again I started covering ETFs in 2006 and I covered mutual funds before then so I get asked this a lot especially on Twitter there's definitely a faction of the crypto people who are like why do we even need an ETF just hold this cold wallet storage all this again look a lot of regular people don't want to bother with that they don't want to write down 12 words they got to remember for their entire life and especially the advisors they just trust the ETF they've used it it shows up nice in their client statement it's spy GLD bitto it all trades like equities um it's got the safeguards of being a 1940 or 1933 act structure it is tax efficient there's a variety of things that ETFs have that are really really advantageous for investors I covered them in 2006 and when I started covering them I noticed they were like five evolutionary steps ahead of the mutual fund they were like mutual funds but with benefits and so this is why ETFs taking the Lion's Share of all the money in terms of investment vehicles and it advisors in particular are probably 75 percent of the base of ETF investors and advisors manage 30 trillion dollars so when you think of like all these like Rich Boomers well golfing most of them have an advisor who manages their money and that is who this is going to appeal to so yes if you're a millennial crypto person you go use the exchange I get it there's no harm in that no no ETF person would ever say don't do that but for the older generally you know wealthier advisor and their clients they're gonna opt to use an ETF over going to The Exchange doing their own wallet or um even using a mutual fund and so I think what the ETF is going to act as a bridge uh between the sort of Old Guard Boomer money and remember Boomers have like I don't know 70 80 percent of all the money in America I mean they are loaded this is so wow there's a lot of money there and the other interesting thing is demographic so boomers are going to as they get older they're in their 70s and 80s they're going to transfer that wealth and so I think the advisor world I don't think a lot of them naturally would want to plow into crypto but I think um some of them are younger and be like this is a good hedge and some of them might want to impress the kids of the Boomers and be like yeah I'm gonna get you some crypto um so even if 0.5 of that 30 trillion were allocated to the Bitcoin ETF that's 150 billion dollars that's point five percent so I think that's why if you're looking for optimism it is good now whether the ETF comes out and it's to sell the news kind of thing because the rumor says look at the price and that the news there's a sell-off maybe I don't know the short-term print moves in Bitcoin are really hard to Let's predict but over the long term if you create a bridge and make it easy for you know the wealthy Boomers of America to allocate uh that's obviously going to bring some bid orders in for this asset class and so that's why this is Major and this is again it's not just an ETF it's a bridge yeah and I would also add I do think even Millennials might be interested because they could get um tax benefits and um and put it in their retiring accounts in a way that is not quite possible with spot Bitcoin so it could still be that long-term investment for them um so in a moment we're going to talk about what this means for the Bitcoin ETF race but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible toku makes

[Music] back to my conversation with Eric so this ruling doesn't necessarily mean that gbtc will automatically convert to a spot Bitcoin ETF so what are the sec's options at this point and what are you putting your money on wow okay so again this is all just suspect that you bring up a really good point about gbtc gbtc is structured as a private placement and it's restricted so it's it may have to re-file as like a regular ETF and it it's possible this is a theory that we've had for a while that one of the reasons BlackRock filed out of the blue was a little bit of a shock was to put themselves as a option for the SEC to save face and kind of get back at grayscale because they could move grayscale and have them file approved BlackRock and gracedale takes you know you know months or whatever to get to come out after BlackRock and Fidelity and the others it's possible um that you could see that as a you could see a road that that happens um in terms of grayscale immediately converted to an ETF we don't know because there's never been anything like this mutual funds have converted to ETFs but we've never really seen a private restricted or private placement do this so that would be unprecedented but again possible the SEC now has 45 days to respond to the court ruling you know the spokesperson said yeah we're reviewing this tomorrow they've got uh to a deadline on a couple of the ETFs they have these like series of deadlines we think they'll probably just uh Punt and delay while they think about it because you know the ruling just happened so my my guess is probably one of two things is possible they come back in 45 days they could like appeal and go to like the Supreme Court or the next court up but I don't know I mean if you lose 3-0 and two Democrats are on there and the Supreme Court's got you know even more Republicans than Democrats it's not looking good so I doubt that'll happen we think they'll either do one or two things they'll either come out and and and often do this new thing where custody is our new issue and we're going to just have this long drawn out thing again that's the 25 that it won't happen Theory the other thing they could do is sort of get together with these issuers and be like look we have a couple minor tweaks you know maybe we would like you to use Fidelity instead of coinbase as a custodian you know uh maybe you've got to put something here on how APS can deal with crypto there's this like behind the scenes they can tweak a little uh of the language and just to make it put a little more safeguards in and then they can sort of line them up and then we might just get you know wake up one day in October and we hear the SEC has decided to release the ETFs and they're all launching in two weeks and eight are gonna launch on the same day and that's that so that's probably the more likely Road um be given this the little wiggle room they have but again those to me would be the two routes that could possibly happen I guess there's a other possibilities but to me those are the most like way and it for that October date you're talking about the 45 days from the ruling yeah but I'm more just talk because I don't think timelines are going to they might matter because they matter more if they're going to reject them usually they when they reject an ETF they wait till like the last day or two in my opinion this is such a unique situation and somewhat sensitive and you've got BlackRock involved and I just feel like this is one of those situations where they may not approve them all on like say the third date you know there's like four dates that they have to respond they're gonna do it they they're probably gonna get together decide this thing and then I don't know if the dates will matter that much I think if they're going to approve them if they're going to disapprove them the dates could matter because on the final day the first final deadline is in January they could come out and with Arc and say Here's why we denied it uh custody is our big issue and then boom we're sort of back to the drawing board but you're talking about Arc invest yes okay if they do that they could get sued again though but you know like so they're every time they make a new issue they could go back to court and again this just the Optics are great I think if you go to court and you said fraud of manipulation for 10 years the court says that doesn't really apply you approved Futures therefore the spot is the same thing and then you have this new thing I just I don't know your risk the Optics get worse and worse I think as you did on that road but again um they've been pretty stubborn on this for 10 years so you know they could continue to do that but those dates we have a table James I can it's probably on James's Twitter feed other crypto people are basically just stealing it and tweeting about it and you know it's a little annoying but that's okay we have a table with all the dates you can keep track of the dates the first one again is Friday so we could hear today or tomorrow from the SEC but again I just think this is the the nature of this is going to be a little different because also um when you think about the SEC approving these would they approve many at once or or they go in the order of the dates if they win the order of the dates Arc would be out two months ahead of Black Rock and I think the SEC learned from bitto that even one day Head Start is crucial and you play King maker so they would make our the best biggest Bitcoin ETF and it would take years for anyone to get into that so I think what they probably do is approve many at once right now they're working on ether Futures ETFs and we here they're going to let them all out at once which by the way is also an important issue that the SEC can change ether Futures ETFs were filed and withdrawn like four times in the past five years well this time they filed and they did not get withdrawn and they're probably going to approve them in October so that's an interesting that shows there they can change they can actually progress on this issue because they didn't want to do that before um so we will see those ETFs come out and if we see like eight launched in the same day or all of them that's a good sign that spots spot ETS probably all launched on the same day as well which would create a real like demolition derby at marketing because they all offer the same thing there's no differentiation so they're all going to throw a bunch of advertising and marketing it could get pretty wild they might like team up with celebrities I don't know but you're gonna see just a wild race and in a couple days the race could be over like you'll know who the GLD of this group is and there can only be one stud the one that has all the liquidity that then there could be three or four successful ones there can only be one like true because it's all about the volume and like GLD still commands line share the volume of all gold ETFs even though there's been many cheaper ones so that early start is so crucial and that's a whole nother sort of subplot of this story that will be fascinating well so when you're saying that you think multiple will be approved at once do you have any that you think probably won't be approved um and then so then the the you know complimentary question would be which ones are the ones you think would be approved um so my again if I'm just thinking about the conservative nature of the SEC I have to give BlackRock and fidelity good odds of coming out first because that's Trad Phi that's like these are gigantic establishment firms the SEC probably trusts they've also launched many ETFs over the years so I think they'd be in the mix for sure I think you have to put Arc In the Mix because they were so early it would look weird if they held art back given they were first so I think what put those three in and then you've got some like Global X you know maybe there's a couple they could hold back um and launch five days later just to not maybe put too many out at once I'm not exactly sure but my bet is they're gonna want to give the traditional Finance ETF issuers the best shot at being the one because Again part of uh I I you know BlackRock is a powerful company and they have remember when the March 2020 covid you know sunk the stock market and the treasury worked with BlackRock to buy ETFs to provide liquidity so blackrocks work really directly with the government and I just think that they'd probably secretly want BlackRock to be the one because they're a trusted company Fidelity same way other comp the other ones are definitely ETF issuers and they're valid like a global X is a legit ETF for sure but they're just not on the same league as a black or Fidelity and so I think those would be in the in the early mix for sure but again just don't know I mean you know it's really going to come down to whoever's not in the first day is going to be pissed off these are difficult decisions they're going to have to make I think um if I were them I'd probably just I think there's 11 I'd probably just let them all launch at once I mean it's a little crazy but at least you're you could just be like hey look we're we're letting competition happen and you know we're not going to pick any winners I think that then the ones that do launch or get approved that they would compete on price it's a great question so yes I think what you're yeah so they're going to compete in a couple things like BlackRock is going to be like hey we're a brand name uh you know we're black rock this is uh the way to do it a Fidelity same deal but then like a company like Global X or um we just saw Round Hill you know in all the ether ETFs Round Hill updated their filing to say they're only going to charge I think it was 25 basis points so they already started a fee war in filings that haven't even launched yet like so they're gonna be people coming out and saying okay well blackrock's 50 basis points will be 30. um so yeah there's going to be a lot of jockeying Arc is probably going to say hey we're 21 shares we do this in Europe all the time we're close to the crypto Community Trust us we're one of you so that could be appealing to um people as like Hey we're a native we're local to crypto we're not like BlackRock we just came in to make money there's going to be a lot of mud throwing around back and forth in terms of like the competitive landscape um and this is good for investors overall you know the fee Wars have been a big part of the ETF industry for years Vanguard is probably deserves credit for pioneering the fee Wars but now look you can get an entire portfolio of equities stocks International really anything you want for uh all in fee of like six basis points I mean it's almost like free it's like an investor Utopia and this is largely part to the ETFs industry uh brutality I call it the turtle because it's just brutal you're going to compete with Vanguard BlackRock at cost and this will be the same I I see the at the end of the day three four years from now you're going to be able to buy a liquid cheap Bitcoin ETF and it's going to be powerful and this is why we we say um you know to the crypto exchanges um you know there this will be a threat to their business because coinbase and some of these exchanges charge a lot per trade a Bitcoin ETF will trade for one basis point right that will be the bid ask spread and then the fee let's just call it 35 40 basis points that's what GLD is um it's just gonna it's gonna feel real appealing uh and they do all the leg work of just storing the crypto for you uh uh the tax efficiencies there it's going to be a very very high value proposition for most investors so to your point the demolition derby and the fee War I always say the ETF industry is a hell so investors can have the habit anything's going to play out here and you know again one thing I'm going to go back to um FTX I was watching a baseball game this is like three weeks before SBF got found out and I saw FTX on a Baseball umpires like somehow the baseball empire had FTX on his jersey yeah this is after seeing Tom Brady I was like how much money does this company have and who in the hell watching baseball is going to go to FTX it's a bunch of 65 year olds I was like they just have way too much money and so I would say that I I remember tweeting and ETF fixes this and I wrote a piece saying this will be the last crypto Super Bowl if they launch ETS because ETFs are such a thin like a rough industry and some of these crypto exchanges were sort of like selling populism but making a ton of money on these high fees and so I really think is going to actually create more price competition in the crypto industry because ETFs are used to living in a terror dome but most of the rest of Finance is it so once you bring something into the ETF world uh it can be a little bit of a belt tightening situation we see it with mutual funds they come into the ETF world and they're like oh it's like going from a country club into the jungle and so I think you're going to find a little that with the crypto world and I always I just thought you'd never see uh you never see that the kind of spending that you saw with FTX with the ATF is sure they just don't have the money because the investors keep it yeah not that FTX had the money either but anyway well I will say that that was a red flag to me because I was just like this is just that's ridiculous ad spend I get you know hiring Matt Damon or whatever okay fine but like a baseball umpire that is just not even their market like how much money do they have yeah they did not have it one last question uh based on your knowledge of what happened when you know the gold ETF launched or the uh Bitcoin Futures ETFs launched um how much money do you think would pour in I mean you can't you kind of gave up you know ballpark of like how much financial advisors might allocate but but I'm curious how much money do you think would pour in initially like whether it's on the first day or the first week or first month or whatever if um uh the spot Bitcoin ETS were approved okay so bitto traded a billion dollars on the first day and that's the greatest launch ever right so the Bitcoin future is I remember Futures are less desirable than spots so I'd have to imagine spot breaks that record maybe it trades the only issue is Bido is alone if there's 10 launched at once I would say the combined volume should be bitto easily so I think as a group it'll be the most successful launch of all time over time how much money comes into them you know I've estimated maybe like 20 billion dollars in the first couple months because that's what gbtc has currently and that's a broken product that isn't even traded on big exchanges and it's still got 20 billion it had 40 billion at one point yeah well you you know you can't you can't leave so you can't that's true but but that's how many people went in I guess I would say so I would say that 20 billion is a good base for the first couple months and then over time we predict 150 billion in the first I don't know say year or two and then at that point I just don't know we have to see other things that happen with crypto but gold ETFs have 150 billion and I put them in a similar ballpark I think ultimately they probably passed gold um but this is not I don't see it being like trillions of dollars again I see 0.5 to 1 of that advisor money allocated here but again that's 150 to 300 billion dollars just for advisors the other thing you're going to get with with a liquid ETF is like GLD is used even by institutions institutions don't use ETFs a ton because they can get all this stuff privately and for cheaper because they have so much money these asset managers rolled the red carpet and charge them almost nothing but they will use GLD because it's liquid I don't have to mess with the gold and they really like the liquidity that's what's something they can't get with their private stuff the institutions love liquidity so the liquid ETF that is the most liquid one of the Bitcoin will probably get used by pensions endowments and the institutional money and they have like 70 trillion so if even if they allocate a tiny portion you're looking at uh some decent money like spy is a great example that's also used by endowments and a lot of institutional investors even hedge funds if they need a quick short or a long they just buy GLD they don't bother with the goal so I think the one that gets liquid will also attract some of the institutional money so then that's why I say it could be a little bigger than bull but gold ETFs still make up I don't know one two percent of all ETF assets so again I've allocated so much time over the past like four months to something that's going to be two percent of ETF assets but the reason this story is so fascinating is that it's a race that's always interesting there's a clock it involves the highest rungs of of Wall Street and asset management you can't get bigger than BlackRock the government's involved and then it's it's sort of this wild and you know underworld of a bunch of characters in this crypto underworld when all of this is being put into this story so in terms of interest it's off the charts but the actual assets won't be you know it won't be ridiculous one crypto trade publication saw me on a podcast like this and they killed the headline saying 30 trillions coming for Bitcoin ETFs I said no no that's the total possible pool of advisors I sent 0.5 or one percent of that so there's definitely a lot of um demand for hopium and so I do want to sort of bring it down a little again to cut down your opium killer I mean they really want they they want the hopium like sometimes I was like 75 what's wrong with you I'm like that's pretty high anyway again though a bridge to the wealthy Boomers is the way to look at this but they're not all gonna buy it but I just think that's ultimately gonna be good and again the one that gets the most volume will probably be used by the institutional crowd as well again in small doses no no big advisor or institutions going 100 of the client's portfolio are we going to allocate like they do to Gold you know a couple percent maybe uh something like that yeah all right well thank you so much Eric it's been great getting your uh actually realistic in in this case hopium actually um it's been very informative like uh methadone that's a weird reference but it's like it's like a a minor form of opium yes yes but it's just a factual opium we can call it iotopia yes all

Castillo a night budget fellow at Columbia University this week the legal woes have embattled former CEO of FTX Sam bankman freed intensified as the U.S Department of Justice took multiple actions against him on Monday the doj attorney in charge of the investigation filed a motion to Bar all seven of bangman Freed's proposed expert Witnesses citing quote an array of deficiencies end quote the witnesses include legal and business professionals whose testimonies according to the doj would quote serve no other purpose than to provide an expert patina to inadmissible hearsay testimony about the defendant's supposed lack of criminal knowledge or intent end quote harsh words coming from the doj but making matters worse in a letter to the judge overseeing the case the following day the same attorney questioned the adequacy of Sam begman Freed's quote advice of counsel and quote defense strategy and his upcoming October trial urging him to provide more details or face limitations on his defense bangman freed legal team has also been grappling with what they describe as quote inadequate and quote prison technology facilities while he was granted limited computer access his lawyers
