disclosure is a past sponsor of my shows welcome eric hey how's it going great nice to have you yeah very glad to be here shapeshift recently announced that it's becoming decentralized and i believe it's the first crypto company to make that transition what did shapeshift used to look like and what will it look like going forward yeah so we are a normal today centralized company we have 66 employees we have an office we have vc investors and we've been around since 2014 so about seven years and we have decided that we are going to start dismantling the entire corporate structure and open sourcing all of our code and moving to a decentralized dao type organizational format instead of a centralized corporate organizational format so there are certainly a number of decentralized projects within crypto so we're certainly not the first of that but i think we are the first established company that has just decided to no longer be an established company and completely decentralize itself to whatever degree we can and why did you decide to make this transition a few reasons um you know one is just that the the strategic landscape of cryptocurrency in my opinion is clearly moving toward decentralized applications and will move away from centralized ones the reason for this is various frictions that centralized entities have to deal with that decentralized ones don't there's sort of an ideological reason to do this which is just that you know bitcoin's ethos is one of decentralization immutability open openness borderlessness uh open source at a base layer and to the degree that we can be in alignment with that um i think that is better for our customers better for the brand and ultimately better for the entire cryptocurrency industry the more companies that are in line with that ethos the better and so shape shift as one of the oldest companies in the space and also you as an entrepreneur and uh one of the long longest serving entrepreneurs in the space both of you have been through a lot when it comes to the different cycles in the industry and also when it comes to regulation banking and all these other issues so what does the transition signify for you for me it signifies a development in cryptocurrency in which it's actually possible to decentralize an organization um you know this was not something i understood or thought possible even a year ago and the tools that are built by various decentralized projects have gotten very advanced and they're developing rapidly years ago we had to beg banks for bank accounts and we were always you know on the precipice of having one bank account closed and having to open another one and it was that's always a stressful thing and we were beholden to that system and we're at the point now where we don't need banks at all like not at all if we need stability we hold stable coins if we don't need stability we hold bitcoin and ethereum uh and that's just a very cool development to see that actually us as an organization can can build ourselves on top of the tools that others in this industry have been building all right so let's backtrack a second um so early on or before you started making this transition if a user went to shape shift what would happen and they wanted to make a transaction yeah in our first form you know starting in 2014 someone would arrive at our website and they would say i have some bitcoin i want some litecoin uh we would show them a bitcoin address they send their bitcoin to that address we we shapeshift receive that coin and upon receipt of it we send them their litecoin from our own wallet so it was a quick and easy way to convert one digital asset into another without custody and back then of course there was no kyc there was no user accounts it was just it was like a like a vending machine really uh and people people loved that it was it was simple it was clean it did exactly what the user wanted in the way that the user wanted it so that was our first incarnation by 2018 we'd gotten pretty large we were over 100 employees and you know that was at the tail of the 2017 boom and we had invested a lot of time and money into the regulatory world and we came to the dismal conclusion that we may be treated as a financial institution and as such would have to start imposing all sorts of financial regulatory obligations on our users and on ourselves this was extremely costly to implement but more importantly violated all of the ethical principles that we held that our users held our users hated it we hated it but we we felt coerced into that because regulators are going to regulate and we did not see a way out at that time so so we bit the bullet we implemented kyc know your customer basically a lot of the financial surveillance apparatus that all financial institutions have and that was a couple years of of struggle for sure more recently in 2020 in the fall we decided we would start integrating decentralized exchanges which are immutable protocols that aren't run by any company they're just open source software that live you know in the ethereum cloud or or on blockchains themselves and we would rip out our entire trading system which had been our lifeblood from the beginning and instead let our users trade directly with these decentralized protocols and so we got out of the business of regulated activity by getting out of the business of regulated activity the regulations do not apply to us because we're not providing that service any longer and that was the start of our move into an entirely decentralized model which we which we just announced recently so um now i mean now that you've already made a few of these steps what are some of the other things that need to happen over the next few months i guess to start the process so much stuff yeah so i mean we are certainly not decentralized today we are starting a process of decentralizing part of that is open sourcing our code and we have like you know seven years of software at all all levels and layers so that in and of itself is a huge project we have to unwind the corporate entity all of our contracts all of our banking relationships um we have to do this in a way you know with shareholder approval and board approval and through all the the corporate steps that a normal company has to deal with um and we have to build and cultivate a community of our users now that hold fox tokens and bring them into the governance process of where shapeshift goes because we will no longer be governed by essentially a foundation of shareholders we will be governed by a foundation of fox token holders and that's a different paradigm and we have to cultivate that community and build it up and so earlier when you talked about how shape-shift started and it was kind of like a vending machine what is the user experience like now and then what will it eventually look like yeah a lot of people still think of us as an exchange but at this point that's just a complete misnomer people can use us to exchange but we are not in exchange so shapeshift is best described today as a multi-chain self-custody crypto platform so that means we support lots of different chains you know like we're not ethereum only or bitcoin only or anything like that um we are self-custody so users always maintain control of their keys you can hook up various wallets to the shapeshift platform like a keepkey or ledger or trezor on the hardware side or portis or our mobile app on the software side eventually we will add metamask as well and other leading ones so you you sort of bring your own wallet to our interface and in that interface you can interact with your digital assets you can send and receive you can track your portfolio balance you can do trades from one asset to another and that's kind of the the starting point for building a crypto platform that the whole world can use and now we open source that and so once it's a dow um well i guess you may not know what the user experience will be like at that point but if you're a fox token holder then how will how will uh the shapeshift experience be for you yeah so you certainly don't need to hold the fox token in order to use anything about shapeshift you don't get any worse pricing or rates shapeshift doesn't add any fees to trading so it's just like if you went directly to uniswap or something like that but if you hold the fox tokens you have pro rata ability to govern the changes that are made to the platform going forward so today that's mostly a superficial benefit over time it will become the complete and holistic way that all major decisions get made the entire project so um that's that's the transition that we're going through uh there are some other utilities of the token for example you get rebates on your gas fees if you hold the token and things like that but primarily it is about moving the ability to govern the organization from a shareholder base to a open community that is global around the token and so a lot of projects went from centralized to decentralized via a foundation and it looks to me like shapeshift will start that way um you're kind of transitioning from shape shift the company to shape-shift the foundation or or correct me if any of that was incorrect and so how will that part look yeah so our end goal is not to have a foundation but we are establishing a foundation that will exist for somewhere between one and five years and its sole purpose is to help facilitate the decentralization uh ideally it winds itself down sooner rather than later because it's not needed there are parts of our operations and our project that uh we don't know how to decentralize today those parts need to move to the foundation for now and as and when we can figure out how to decentralize them we will so a lot of projects have a foundation that's kind of meant to be perpetual ours is meant to be temporary ideally it becomes fairly redundant and so in the at to start you airdropped these fox tokens to users across a number of different protocols but obviously to um shape-shift users historically how did you decide upon that allocation and correct me if any these figures are incorrect but as far as i can tell 34 was allocated to the shape-shift community 32 to shape-shift staff 24 to the shape-shift dow treasury 7.5 to the foundation and i believe you yourself have five percent of all fox tokens so yes part of that staff bucket um yeah i mean this was an interesting part of our design over the last few months it's like you know we had 99 of all the tokens and we've never sold these things there's a limited supply so how do we allocate these tokens in the in the best way to cultivate a decentralized community and make this successful long term so one decision was you know a lot of these tokens have to get out into the hands of the community so we took a third of all of them and airdropped it to over 1.1 million recipients uh over eight hundred thousand uh shaped past shape-shift customers and a bunch of people from different d5 projects like you know swap token holders and floor chain users and various others and the the value of that airdrop ranged from you know one or two hundred dollars up to a few thousand dollars so it was the largest airdrop in history in terms of the number of recipients and that was a great way to just kind of bring everyone in and say like here you go thank you for working with us in the past or thank you for being part of an inspirational community that has helped guide us toward this decentralized path um we put about a quarter of all the tokens into the dow itself so this is a fund that is governed by the community so what that means is that over half of all the tokens are essentially in the hands of the community either air dropped directly or in the hands of the the dao treasury which the community of token holders can govern um and then of course we have employees that have been with us for years and investors that have been with us for years no part of this decentralized process can can screw any group right so our shareholders have to be made better off our employees have to be made better off and the customers so the tokens are the way to do that right give tokens out to everyone and everyone has a stake in the future of the project everyone has governance over the project but unlike equity and unlike shares these tokens are immediately liquid and people can do whatever they want with them one caveat is that all insiders all employees and shareholders all of their tokens are locked for three years so they unlock linearly over that three-year period and that aligns them with the long-term interests of shapeshift and do you have a sense of the employees and shareholders whether or not they plan to participate in the dow or whether they're going to move on to other things yeah it'll be a range so certainly some of our employees are just going to want a new like w-2 salary job somewhere and they will move on to other projects and and that's fine many of our employees are really excited about this model and they will either part-time or full-time still contribute to what shapeshift is and depending on where the token price sits some of their grants are worth far more than what they ever received in salary so that's a that's a very cool thing and then they have complete freedom to decide their own schedule their own lifestyle you know there's not a nine to five corporate job they can work on it an hour a week or 50 hours a week whatever they want um and you know some of our investors are total totally not familiar with crypto generally right so they have no idea that what this even is others think this is the coolest thing ever and they're you know you know i'm so glad to be part of it and uh it's it's the full gamut and what do you plan to do yeah so i will no longer be ceo of shapeshift um probably by the end of this year and i would like to take a little bit of a break you know like detach from some screens for a while but ultimately my interest in shape-shift is heightened as it can be a decentralized project i mean to me that is far more exciting than a centralized company so i plan to just be one influential member among many in the community and you know i'll throw my ideas out and i'll try to help guide it and i will vote with my tokens and all that so i will certainly have a lot of influence but i will no longer control project as ceo um and i'm i'm okay with that i love seeing the community take up pieces of this and we have all sorts of great people that have been employees at shapeshift that are going to be leading various areas so i'm i'm looking forward to that and it's going to be a grand experiment and so at what point do you think this will be open source and at that point do you think that some of the engineers who've worked on shapeshift will keep wanting to work on it as an open source project yeah we're going to open source things incrementally so kind of repo by repo i think we looked and we have something like 340 different code repos it's shapeshift a lot of it isn't used anymore some of it is very mission critical we have to do security reviews of the things that we open source so as we can review things and feel comfortable that they are ready to open source you know well commented and documented those things will be released and opened uh iteratively at the same time we expect that the community will start building new repos and new things into shapeshift and around shapeshift so that we can't control or predict where that will all go but as an open source project it means that everyone in the crypto community that also has their own project can integrate what they're doing into the shapeshift platform and that's really going to like give us a a much a much better product development path where we are not the limiting factor in what gets built into shapeshift so looking forward to that and so essentially um that's what you're talking about there is like people from other projects that are integrating with shapeshift are there any efforts that you're making to attract new developers to work on the open source project or or do you feel like the fox tokens will do that naturally or how do you certainly the tokens that were granted out to all of our employees are i would say a medium a medium-term incentive for those people to continue working on the project even though they have no mandate to because they have a you know locked up vested interest in the success of this thing um but shapeshift is not a charity and does not work expect people to just work kind of philanthropically on it so anyone who is interested in working on shapeshift as an open source project can propose to the dao or to the foundation either one for a grant to do work right so this could be some tiny feature development or fixing a bug it could be someone who creates an entire team of 20 engineers and says hey i want to go work on this area of the platform for the next year give me this big grant and we'll do it and those those decisions ultimately come down to the governance of the fox token holders and um so we'll see how all that evolves but yeah the the dow has a large treasury you know it's over 200 million dollars of value at this point and so um it can easily support a great deal of of development over the coming years and have you guys already set up a governance system like is there a process that you're using for deciding these things yeah actually we had our first governance vote last night which was kind of uh kind of fun um yeah there's a bunch of really cool tools uh snapshot boardroom are two of the projects that we use and these things essentially look at token balances and use that to allow people to make decisions and vote on things and what's very cool is that you can hook these things up to uh things like that the gnosis safe you know so the gnosis safe can be like a multi-sig contract that holds all the fox tokens in it and the outcome of a vote will procedurally uh cause funds to move to a certain specified address so you get like an a nearly immutable system in which decisions can actually move economic value and you don't need to trust anyone so we're certainly not at that point yet but that's the direction we're going and all those tools are ready to go so yeah a lot of it is set up and we now have to just build that muscle of using these tools instead of using our you know internal slack channel and and corporate board governance and so the foundation has an allocation to start but is the foundation does it exist yet and if so um you know how does it plan to participate in the governance yeah so it doesn't exist yet it will likely exist within two months and it has a relatively small amount of tokens i think seven 75 million tokens to the foundation so 7.5 percent of all of them so um you know it will be an influential participant but it will not be it will not be able to control the outcome of the of the decision making it's its tokens are mostly to to put out bounties on work that it as a centralized entity thinks are important and so how are you going to staff the foundation are you going to have a role there i won't none of the current executives of shapeshift will have a role at that foundation so that's when we say decentralizing it's not like a superficial thing where we're just like the same team but now we're a foundation we are actually removing the whole power and governance structure that currently exists out of the question over time iteratively the foundation will be small it will likely have somewhere between three and five full-time employees and um these will be people that oversee the open source development and help cultivate that community help guide the project and the product but they won't be able to control it and ultimately we'll hold on to things like ip or other centralized operational systems that we haven't figured out how to decentralize yet oh and so like you literally don't know how you'll decentralize that because i i was going to ask about that how does that happen yeah yeah i mean some questions we just don't have answers to it's right so like a simple example the shapeshift.com domain name right like today that's held by the shapeshift company in a registrar's account held by the company company's going away right so what happens to that account what happens to that domain there are things like that which there are ways to solve that right there there are different you know like unstoppable domains and things that are decentralized we haven't looked into how to use those effectively yet so that's that's a project that we will deal with in the future um we believe those things can be decentralized but you know we can't do everything at once so that domain will be transferred to the foundation and it will hold it for some period of time things like that interesting and i noticed so one of the businesses under the shapeshift brand is keepkey which is your hardware wallet and the current plan is for it to become an open source hardware project which i don't know uh is that like a typical thing is that is it common for something that's like a kind of a physical product that is you know sold to the market uh to be open source and if so how do you imagine that will um kind of function as a business yeah so to be clear we haven't fully decided what to do with keepkey yet um one of the paths is to turn it into an open source hardware wallet the the firmware is already open source so no one should ever trust a hardware wallet where the the firmware itself was not open source but the entire platform becoming open source all software all code the entire hardware design everything um that is one option that we are seriously considering that would be very cool because there isn't any such thing in the world today and um you know that would be that would be great uh keep key is absolutely the best way to interact with the shapeshift platform you get all the advantages of cold storage and just the the software interaction between those two things is excellent so even though we support treasurer and ledger the the ux is definitely best with the keep key so we will figure out the right place for keep key to go another option would be that a company acquires it from us and runs it in tandem with the foundation or with some kind of partnership there um tbd but we don't we don't have to figure that out just yet okay yeah because my thinking when i saw that was that i thought it would probably work best as a managed by a centralized company i mean not that i'm an expert on these things but yeah well these are all the questions we're exploring i mean you know um if you open if we open sourced keepkey what it would mean is that anyone would have the schematics and plans to build the device or to manufacture the device so anyone could go build more of them because they would know how to do it and they could sell those they could even white label them and put them under their own brand if they wanted but you certainly get a little bit of risk in that because then how do you trust keepkey right you don't know quite quite which manufacturer you're getting it from and there are some issues there those are solvable with cryptographic signatures and various things but it is a challenge that we have to be careful about all right so we'll see what happens with that okay so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the fox token but first a quick word from the sponsors

voorhees so um earlier we talked about how you decided upon the allocations for the fox token how did you decide how to distribute it and where to and i believe there's going to be some yield farming um schemes as well so yeah how did you figure all that out yeah so for the insiders for shareholders and employees their tokens have to be locked for a period of time we wanted that to happen so they didn't just get a big pile on day one now how do you how do you do that how do you distribute over three years when the corporate entity will be gone in six months that's actually an easy answer today there's a thing called sablier which is a smart contract and you pour a bunch of tokens into it you tell it a destination address and it's just every ethereum block unlocks a tiny fraction of those tokens that can be claimed by the address owner so those contracts are all set up so all the employees and shareholders can go like see how much is available to them that day and they can let them sit there for the next three years they could claim it every every week if they wished and that will happen now no matter what like there's no way to turn that off at this point so when shape shift the entity goes away those contracts continue spitting out those tokens to those people over the next three years to the community we didn't want any lock-up provisions so we just did an airdrop there are a lot of airdrop contracts out there you know the cool stuff about the cool thing about open source software is you can just copy it and use it right so we used uh well-formed airdrop contracts that had been security audited and vetted and we just changed some parameters and used those and over a million addresses are eligible to receive those tokens at the end of 90 days anything that is unclaimed from the airdrop will get dumped into the dow treasury and that will probably be a large portion of those of those tokens so i would guess that the dow treasury will end up with around half of all the tokens in existence and there's no inflation in the fox token so that really uh imbues it with like kind of like an endowment of assets that you know especially if they appreciate can become a never-ending pool of capital so at the moment roughly um what is that just maybe a little over half of them have been claimed is that what you're saying no i'm saying that i would expect by the end of the 90 days there will probably be a couple hundred million that aren't claimed and those will go into the dow treasury yeah okay we will see the curve of people claiming it has been pretty steady and we'll see kind of how it goes as we get to the end of the 90 days um but it's it's just so many addresses you know like 1.1 million different addresses over the past six seven years so a lot of people have addresses that they don't realize are eligible and so we need to like keep getting that word out and trying to help people find it and what was your thinking about you know how you chose the different populations like i mean obviously a shape-shift user seems like you know an obvious choice but what about for some of the other um users uh we largely just did it on fields like what are those d5 projects out there which have been inspirational to us so as we learned about decentralized technology and it went from kind of theoretical dao communities which sounded cool on paper but you know that'll never work in the real world too oh wow not only can it work but a lot of people are doing this and some of the biggest d5 protocols in the world are built on them a lot of pioneers were in these projects and we wanted to just appreciate them so you know thor chain uniswap um balancer git coin uh probably about 12 different d5 protocols and projects um badger dow so these are all these are all inspirational projects to us and we decided to include them in the airdrop because that's part that's kind of part of the ethos of of defy right is these like composable interactive communities that all help each other build a decentralized financial system yeah and in a way it's like those are successful decentralized communities and so you're kind of just making sure that these tokens go to people who have a higher chance of actually using them rather than leaving them yeah yeah and i won't pretend part of it isn't marketing right like i want thousands of users of those communities to see shapeshift and to get interested in shapeshift and to learn about what we're doing and those projects are some of the more successful ones so there's obviously brilliant creative people involved in that and if we can get exposure of those people to what we're doing hopefully some of them will help integrate those projects into shapeshift and hopefully many of them will become users of shapeshift if they weren't already so there are some murmurs that uni the token of uniswap could potentially be a security and it also was a token air dropped by a centralized company do you have similar concerns for the fox token no fox tokens definitely not a security and i think the entire world is waiting for the sec to tell everyone what's the security and what's not right no one knows no one knows the lawyers don't know the sec doesn't know if you ask anyone at the sec take the top hundred coins on coin market cap and tell me which of those are security and which are not they can't do it they can't do it and that's the sec so they always talk about regulatory clarity there is none nobody knows where the line is getting drawn nobody knows which tokens are securities all you can do is kind of try to read the tea leaves and try to be as far from a security as possible so that's what we've done we've never sold the fox token there's no promise of return with the fox token it is it does not satisfy the how we test so we're not worried about the fox token but i know a lot of projects that are trying to build protocols and tokens and they have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawyers that can only give them gray answers and that's a problem so did you consult with the sec about the fox token before air dropping it well you can't consult with the sec let's put it that way um you you can consult with lawyers and if you ask the sec um the best that they can do is put you through sort of an administrative ruling process that process will take many months and most projects that apply for that never get an answer so no administrative ruling is given the sec has only given a couple of these rulings and they were on projects that were like so clearly on one side or another that that it was not helpful so so the there is essentially a bell curve of these tokens where some are very obviously securities some are very obviously not right bitcoin being like the best example of the not and then all all these things in the middle and all those things in the middle the sec will not give definitive answers on even if you go through an administrative ruling process and no lawyer in the world will tell you which list which tokens fall on and if you got a list from two different law firms you can sure as hell bet that they would be different they would include different ones in each each bucket so yeah it's a total mess thank goodness people are continuing to innovate anyway and they're not waiting for all these regulators that have no idea like about this new technology um it's been sad to see especially in america where innovation is supposed to be like the default assumption and where entrepreneurs are able to build new things and you essentially get this amazing like new transparency in finance and immutability and finance the coolest financial technology ever invented and the regulators at best are just kind of hemming and hawing and providing zero useful information so what would you like to see happen there are a number of proposals out there for how to resolve this from hester purses safe harbor proposal to some different bills in congress what's your kind of preferred way for how the sec handles this yeah um i think the sec can have a very important role and be a very valuable organization the degree to which they go after fraud is the scope of that right that's what they should focus on go find people that are lying stealing defrauding people go go find those people bring them to justice like i would applaud that but classifying things as securities or not when it's just voluntary exchange between consenting adults i think adds zero value another thing i think the sec could do that would be very reasonable is to just issue warnings or caution right or like hey this token we're worried about for this reason or hey here's some things to be mindful of if you're going to buy tokens um communicate right but don't coerce don't get in the middle of two adults with a voluntary economic exchange transaction like that is antithetical to to america it's antithetical to markets and i think is only counterproductive and harmful so but at the moment you don't have a preference for any of the proposals for how to create more clarity i don't really love any of those proposals um so if if i was king of the sec i would just go after fraud i i would feel good about that that should be the proposal find the bad actors it should come down to that right was was harm committed someone do something wrong go after those people and and stop worrying about whether something is a security or not as long as people are being honest about what they've built and how it works but i'm definitely in the minority of that viewpoint so i don't expect the sec to agree with it yeah well considering that it's the securities exchange commission uh and they're all about securities i don't think they're suddenly going to be like we're not going to regulate i know i know it's a it's a pipe dream um all right well let's talk about something that might be more fun for you uh shape shift integrated thor chain which is a new chain that enables people to swap tokens from different blockchains without using wrapped versions of those tokens um why did you like thor chain so much it was kind of uh like a little bit of a dark horse i think when you i mean there was like a lot of buzz about it but you know it it didn't launch until recently so why did you decide to adopt it so quickly yeah so i learned about it in august of last year so i guess almost a year ago um i've been a fan of uniswap for 18 months when i saw uniswap and used it for the first time i was just like awestruck because it had captured it had recaptured some of the magic of the original shapeshift it had made the simple interface no intermediary no kyc protected users by design of the of the protocol and it worked great and it had it had become massive right they became far larger than shapeshift ever was and there were days on which uh it actually was doing more trade volume than coinbase as a decentralized immutable project so i was like that's awesome i loved it but one big asterisk one big caveat is that it's only ethereum in erc20 assets and as a bitcoiner as someone who believes in a multi-chain future that was a big problem right so cool you know swap you made this great thing but how the hell do i buy bitcoin with it that's like the most important asset of all um how do i trade bitcoin and tether together you know one erc to one to one bitcoin asset and they couldn't do that um they have wrapped bitcoin but any bitcoiner knows that a wrapped bitcoin is not a bitcoin so i was a little dismayed and i didn't know like how do we bring that model to multiple chains and i had no idea how to answer that question thor chain answered that question thoracine has been under construction for two and a half years or so and they took this automated market maker you know liquidity pool model of uniswap but it works across chains so you can trade from native unwrapped bitcoin to native unwrapped eth you can trade from litecoin to bitcoin bitcoin to bitcoin cash any of the major chains can integrate into 13 that is a huge development for the industry and i do not think most people have actually recognized that that exists or how cool that is the ability to actually have a decentralized exchange that is chain agnostic is something that has never existed in encrypted before and it works at scale in large amounts with high liquidity um caveat again here torching is very new early software and they've had a few pretty atrocious bugs recently like right now the chain is offline so it's not a panacea and it's not ready for prime time but it works it's worked with real money it's out in the wild and it's getting better and better each week so yeah i love that project and we integrated it into fortune or into a shapeshift and what has been the uptake like have people kind of recognized kind of what a breakthrough it is and really you know um been drawn to use it or do you find that they're still kind of in their little camps like the ether people and then the bitcoin people and so there isn't a lot of interest in these crosstown swaps what has been interesting is you can definitely see like who the maximalists are on both sides so like the bitcoin maximalists aren't into thor chain because it supports other coins the ethereum maximalists aren't into it because it's not like an ethereum based decks like uniswap but for everyone who actually cares about decentralized finance in a broad sense the ability to move between different chains uh move value between different chains is obviously important it's a critical piece of infrastructure for this ecosystem so the growth of fortune has been pretty significant considering that they have self-imposed liquidity caps they're keeping the pools small and raising them uh marginally over time because it's such a new software and it's smart that they're doing that as those caps get continually raised liquidity will grow to the point where the pricing becomes extremely competitive and um i would not be surprised if the largest tether bitcoin market in the world ends up on 13. like that's the largest crypto market tether bitcoin um 99.99 of tethered bitcoin trading today happens at centralized exchanges this is completely out of alignment with the ethos of bitcoin as a decentralized immutable project so thank goodness there is finally a way to convert bitcoin to tether without any intermediary everyone in the ecosystem should be celebrating that and helping to contribute to fortune and making it better yeah that that idea is very cool and especially if a lot of that trading moves from centralized exchanges um it'll be interesting to see what happens to that landscape um so oh keep going did you want to say yeah i i'll add that i don't think centralized exchanges go away like they they have certain advantages the decentralized exchanges don't today but i'd like to at least go from a situation where 99.99 of bitcoin tether trading being centralized falls you know to 60 or 50 or 40 percent i think that would be a much healthier market and and what do you think are the benefits of centralized exchanges uh generally the latency right so decentralized exchanges usually have latency issues so they're not good for like small trades you would not want to use thor chain with a ten dollar swap of bitcoin to ethereum because the transaction fees would just clobber you but it will absolutely be the best way to convert one million dollars of bitcoin into ethereum and those liquidity pools will get massively deep something people don't realize is that in thor chain you can earn yield on all the assets of the liquidity pools so you'll be able to earn yield on bitcoin by depositing bitcoin into the 13 liquidity pool so all these people that are excited about earning you know like one percent with block fi uh with a custodian right and only from certain jurisdictions and only under kyc and financial surveillance they'll be able to earn 5 10 percent yield with no intermediary on thor chain that's that's huge so yeah you can tell i'm excited about it i think it's a big deal yeah yeah i mean you're not the only one a lot of people have been telling me and i because i've been so focused on the book i have not uh done a deep dive into it yet but i definitely will um so a few times in this conversation a reference to maximalism has come up and obviously you made waves at bitcoin miami where you uh you know kind of poke the bears a little bit at the conference um what spurred you to make those remarks against maximalism yeah so i've been outspoken against maximalism for years and this is of course made me very hated by the maximus um at that conference so this was a bitcoin focused conference and i i get that i respect that i can appreciate a conference that tries to like get all the noise of other tokens and other projects out of there and just talk about bitcoin i'm all for that the right before i went up as a moderator of a panel the panel before me their topic was um like it was something like why toxic maximalism is good for bitcoin so not just not just maximism not just like bitcoin is is the only one we should focus on but like toxic maximalism like how how big of can we be to people who don't think like us about bitcoin and so these people were on stage talking about the virtues of toxic maximalism um i don't know who these people were i don't know when they got into bitcoin but absolutely that is not the community that i come from in bitcoin the community i come from in bitcoin is one of openness and one of of decentralization of innovation of caring passionately about monetary economics and believing that bitcoin is a better money system for the world and that if there is an enemy it is central banks and banking and fiat currency not the dogecoin community not the ethereum community right and yet there are these toxic maximalists that they get up there and just trash these people um and and they've spun themselves up into thinking that like trashing these people is a virtue and it's helping bitcoin and it's good i think it's like uh frankly i think it's just kind of disgusting and i was embarrassed it was the first bitcoin conference i've ever been to where i was embarrassed about many of the people who were there and i want to be careful not to cast the entire audience or the entire group of bitcoiners there as these kind of maximalists i think they are a small niche but they're very loud they're very obnoxious and um the the thing that triggered me when i was backstage one of the guys that was up talking about this was he said if you're opposed to toxic maximalism you're opposed to bitcoin and you're opposed to freedom i believe that was the exact quote and this to me sounded like such absurd propaganda and i almost laughed and realized that he wasn't joking he actually believed that like if you're not a jerk to other communities you're against freedom so when i got up on stage i addressed that comment and i just said you know that was that was and that was it that was my only comment a bunch of people in the audience start booing at me a bunch of people in the audience start cheering and it became it went a little bit viral on encrypted twitter for a bit um i don't want to be the center of maximalism i just want people to realize that the best attributes of bitcoin are openness and decentralization and those attributes are best served by a thriving and diverse ecosystem of different digital assets so it's fascinating you've been in the ecosystem for so long and you've been to a gazillion crypto conferences or bitcoin conferences why do you think this was the first one where you felt that strain of toxic maximalism that was kind of being so uh you know pushed really hard well probably we see this we see this from online communities generally where due to various social media algorithms and due to self-selection of messaging people end up in bubbles of others who think like them right we see this in politics we see this on twitter for sure and i i think that the there is a bubble of bitcoin maximalist toxic maximalist whatever they want to call themselves who have just continued to reinforce their own messaging and you know if you if you're trying to get into bitcoin and you can say something that gets you you know 300 likes because you slandered someone in another community you're gonna feel good about that right and the people that like that kind of messaging are gonna be attracted to you um i think we've gotten to a point where that phenomenon has just gotten very powerful and the degree to which these people truly i think they they sincerely believe that what they're doing is right i think they sincerely believe that it's good that they are jerks to other people and that that is somehow helpful for bitcoin um it's just turned into a subculture within the bitcoin community and i've seen the same exact attributes starting to develop in the ethereum community there are ethereum maximalists and indeed some who i would consider pretty pretty toxic uh it's a smaller portion but i worry that it's just a matter of time until any of these communities you know you you build up this like this niche minority who is more about the hatred of the other than they are about the virtuous attributes of the of the chain and asset that they fell in love with so what do you think can be done to kind of um turn down those streams and foster one that you don't know i don't have any answers i will keep talking about it you know but like um i don't know how to solve that but i i think it's the biggest problem within crypto it's it's the biggest thing that prevents further progress you know these communities should be collaborating with each other bitcoin is best when ethereum exists and vice versa it is no coincidence that the two things have grown up and hit their all-time highs together they are mutually beneficial they have different attributes and i wish that the communities would see each other as allies in the actual fight which is decentralized open finance versus centralized closed fiat banking establishment that's the real struggle here and maybe some of the maximalists are too scared of that struggle maybe some of the maximalists are too afraid to actually push the boundary against the government or against a regulator they're too timid to actually fight so they just take cheap shots at each other within the crypto community and out of curiosity after you made those comments at bitcoin miami did you hear more from maximalists who were mad at you or did you hear more from people who agreed with you and just said you know i agree with you but i don't want to make noise about it because i don't want the maximalist to attack me there there was some of both um when i left the stage after my panel there were a few people that like just yelled out and heckled me like you know coiner you know like just and i've never experienced that in person right that happens on twitter all the time but there are these people who i know haven't been in bitcoin for more than a couple years right where were they 10 years ago what were they doing you know they they obviously didn't understand this technology early enough um now i think they're trying to make up for it by just being jerks and so yeah it's it was a it was uncomfortable and for the rest of the day um my friends and i were sitting around you know just kind of talking about this development and how bitcoin conferences did not used to be like that and kind of wishing that that that old that old type of conference would come back this is i find this whole thing fascinating especially since you say it's very new um i wonder what that means all right a couple last questions about regulation which um you know we've talked very generally about but uh the regulators are making a lot of moves um i guess we'll start with one of the cases that's kind of a bit older um obviously the cftc and doj went after not only bitmex but the executives um you know there were people who felt that this was overreach and i wondered what your opinion was of that case yeah i mean anyone who knows me probably knows my opinion there um where was the wrong doing where was the harm what did bit mex lie about did they defraud someone did they steal someone's money did they actually harm anyone or did they just offer a service that other people voluntarily used because it sounds like it's the latter sounds like the doj and the cftc are upset that bitmex didn't have the right licenses right or was actually allowing americans to use that service that kind of thing these are non-crimes no one is hurt in that and you just get a tremendous waste of resource and destruction of productive business when regulators go after others like that so i'm not an expert on the case maybe there are things i do not know but from my distant view of it um it seems like the actual crime is the regulators going after private property and destroying commercial business that they had no business destroying and what do you think about binance which right now kind of is um at the receiving end of a lot of different regulatory actions across jurisdictions around the world um you know it's kind of historically known for maybe leaving certain jurisdictions to avoid regulators what's your take on what's happening there yeah so again i don't have any inside knowledge there finance is obviously you know the biggest exchange i think the biggest cryptocurrency company in the world they've done a tremendous job of building a business right like i respect cz's ability to execute and to build something so big um they are building so fast and in so many directions it is not surprising to me that they've got the attention of a lot of regulators and again you know if they're doing something actually wrong if they're actually harming someone let the regulators allege the harm let's hear that and take him to court for harm i don't want to hear a bunch of like you don't have the license to operate in our jurisdiction right but um that's maybe appropriate for like soviet russia but it should not be appropriate for any like western market economy and so with stable coins there's also been a lot of noise being made here in the us recently where um the sec chairman gary gensler was saying that some stable coins might be securities and the presidential working group on crypto already started um you know looking closely at stable coins what's your take on how stable coins should be regulated here in the us well first of all they already are regulated right like everything that is involved in finance is is regulated anyone who's issuing stable coins and backing it with fiat is already under a tremendous amount of financial regulation so we need to remove this idea that stable coins are like aren't regulated same with crypto people say crypto's not regulated it absolutely is there are so many regulations that apply to this stuff it's absurd um what should be the regulatory situation with stable coins again none unless people are committing fraud their people have built a new financial asset and other people are finding it valuable that should be the end of the story right that should be it um so i think what will happen is that governments will apply further regulations because that's generally what they do they always ratchet regulations on top of more they never deregulate contrary to popular opinion and as that happens the ux the user experience of using those stable coins will get worse you'll have to jump through more hoops to use them there will be higher capital requirements which will mean that fees have to get added at various places for a user it'll end up a worse experience and you'll find that they will start moving to the decentralized alternatives the greatest beneficiary of stablecoin regulations will be dye right dai the decentralized stablecoin on ethereum and there are a dozen other projects that are decentralized stable coins like dai that are waiting in the wings to take this market the more the governments and regulators clamp down on voluntary economic exchange now that there is an ability for people to move to decentralized open source technology with no intermediary the more they will have a reason to do so so you know i'm very glad that that alternative exists and i think those alternatives will get increasingly used to the to the degree that the ux of the centralized stable coins gets worse yeah i i agree with you that the more um we're gonna see this type of regulation i feel the more people will move into d5 um all right so actually one more comment on this the the stable coin thing is getting wrapped up in this whole cbdc discussion right and i think everyone realizes that like the united states and china are going to be in this battle for like the the digital currency of the future both those countries believe it'll be a digital fiat currency obviously bitcoiners have a different view on that um but the best thing the u.s could do from a global political like strategy perspective would be to allow these us-based stable coins that are already massive to continue to flourish that is the best chance that the u.s maintains dominance from a digital fiat perspective and if they just like kill that in in the in the cradle um it would be so foolish but they may well do it yeah well actually um i don't know if you are aware the former cftc chairman chris john carlo i believe is in favor of um you know these kind of private this typical art wait or is it brian brooks i'm just blinking for a second but i would guess both of them yeah they're they're in favor of yeah a number of private stable coins and oh one other thing i wanted to ask you about was um you know right now the stable coins are being all transparent and um you know revealing what's backing their staple coins and obviously so at the moment tether kind of has the least amount of direct cash reserves and then circle has a little bit more at like 60 some percent and then paxos came out and said we have 96 percent so i was just curious if you have any opinion on on the structure i love that example because it is a demonstration of how markets regulate themselves none of those three companies are doing that because they were told to do it by a government regulator they're doing it because they're all in competition with each other and the market demands transparency if you have a stable coin and you can demonstrate that you are more sound you have a huge advantage over others so you get a far healthier financial system from that competition without a single regulation being written my guess is that when the regulations get written the further regulations on top of these things you're going to end up with worse products that act in in an antithetical way toward what the market wants and i wish that the government would just allow this incredible innovation to flourish because that is where all human ingenuity and wealth comes from is this market competition it is what made america great and i it's what made crypto great it's why crypto has thrived and grown and innovated in so many different directions it's because right now it is somewhat free and i i hope it can continue to maintain that and at least at the protocol level it always will be yeah well i think the one clarification i would make is that at least in the case of tether i believe the new transparency is because of the settlement with the new york attorney general so um okay so their hand was a little bit forced there um all right so i would guess if usdc is doing it they would have to do it to be competitive but okay yeah yeah um all right so i know you're not the decider for shape-shift going forward but i did want to ask um how do you think shape-shift could or should compete with uniswap because it's so dominant in the duck space yeah we are not trying to compete with unit swap we are not a dex we have actually integrated unit swap into shapeshift along with a dozen other dexes so when someone's doing a trade on shapeshift it is being routed to any of those dozen dexes that have the best price at that moment so we are huge fans of uniswap we hope they get massive their liquidity pools being bigger is better for us um their their strength is our strength so shape-shift going forward will be more like a dex aggregator technically we're not even an aggregator because we hook up aggregators into shapeshift but that's a little bit better a way to think about it yeah the more we integrate decentralized protocols into shapeshift so we don't have to compete on any vertical with any of those all right well we will see how this whole process unfolds it's been super interesting discussing with you and yeah i really appreciate that you came on change yeah happy to be here thanks laura good conversation oh actually and last question where can people learn more about you and shapeshift yeah shapeshift.com everyone should check to see if they're eligible for the airdrop because a lot of your listeners will be i'm at eric voorhees on twitter those are probably the best two places perfect all right well thanks so much for coming on unchained cheers thanks so much for joining us today
