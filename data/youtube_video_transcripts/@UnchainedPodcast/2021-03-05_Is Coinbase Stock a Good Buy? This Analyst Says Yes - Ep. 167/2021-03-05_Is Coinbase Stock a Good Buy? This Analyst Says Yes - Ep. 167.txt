hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marquee names and crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto five years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time unchained and unconfirmed or now published his videos if you're not yet subscribed to the unchanged youtube channel head to youtube.com c unchained podcast and subscribe today crypto.com is giving away four teslas to enter the lucky draw download the crypto.com app and buy at least 100 worth of bitcoin download the crypto.com app now today's guest is gil lauria director of research at d.a davidson welcome gil it's nice to see you back in crypto it's great to see you laura uh we've been talking for many years and you've done such an amazing job covering the crypto space and i'm really glad to be back and talking to you about it again so for those unfamiliar with gil he was the first wall street analyst to cover bitcoin in december 2013. and today's topic is going to be the coinbase upcoming stock listing however i think people probably would be interested in a bit of your background so can you tell us about your previous coverage of bitcoin sure so i was a wall street analyst covering payments companies paypal square visa those kinds of companies in 2013 when i encountered bitcoin i just lit up i read the white paper i talked to people and i realized that this has a lot to do with where we're headed in the future such an interesting topic so cross-disciplinary economics and finance and culture and mathematics computer science so i really got engaged published that very first wall street report about bitcoin in 2013. later on opened the very first institutional account on coinbase was the first for at the time i was at the first firm that accepted bitcoin for research then i picked up gbtc so i could have a price target on bitcoin so it could have a fundamental analysis based uh price target on bitcoin had a blast doing all that uh fortunately i unfortunately was promoted to head up the research department at which point i stopped publishing research uh exactly four years ago and have been mostly focused internally on helping other analysts with their research but when the coinbase ipo got closer i i just decided i had to participate in this moment it's such an important moment for crypto for financial services for this community that i i dove back in and initiated coverage of coinbase ahead of its direct listing and so your research note on coinbase is titled introducing crypto's amazon moment what do you mean by that in may of 1997 amazon went public up until then the internet was an interesting thing that people toyed with used were trying to figure out once amazon went public everybody realized this is going to be a huge business and there's so it's going to impact every other business that was the real and milestone inflection point and it feels like the coinbase listing is gonna have the same effect obviously crypto is already huge it's a trillion dollar asset class uh so much interest in it but it's almost gone on a parallel path to traditional finance when coinbase becomes public and trades at 50 billion or more those worlds will come together and the traditional world of finance and crypto will will be uh going forward will be intertwined uh as a huge business in crypto becomes a publicly traded security and you gave coinbase which will be listed under the ticker coin on nasdaq a buy rating what factors led you to that rating well we have partial information this was the first iteration of the s1 the company isn't listed they haven't disclosed all the financials they haven't provided forward guidance so we took what we had which is to say they're at least on track to generating two billion of revenue this year likely higher but we don't know that yet and given multiples that other high growth standard bearer type technology companies are getting it's pretty easy to justify 20 times revenue so that's where we started off private market transactions may be at lower or higher prices those will matter a lot less until we actually get the listing at which point we'll also have better information about current period results forecasts guidance from the management team and we'll be able to use that to reevaluate that price target and so at this moment you were able to look at you know partial numbers from coinbase but i'm sure you also have a sense of where coinbase kind of sits amongst its competitors who would you consider coinbase's main competitors and what factors would you say separate it from the competition well i'd say grayscale michael zahnenshein business within barry silbert's dcg is probably the most important competitor and comparable because they are also now gaining from the institutional move to crypto they're also a very well managed firm that was there at the beginning has grown gradually and wisely and thoughtfully so i'd call them the closest competitor then you have the the pure play cryptos that are regulated like kraken and um and gemini they're also very interesting relevant competitors and on the traditional side you have the uh the digital wallets that are really competing for crypto usage and first and foremost square they were early than paypal not robin hood those are to me the real key competitors to coinbase on from the more traditional digital wallet side as opposed to and and on the other side the pureplay crypto side and so when you look at coinbase in comparison to those what would you say distinguishes it from its competitors well coinbase when i say gold standard i mean the following from day one from when i opened the the wallet in 2013 the user experience was terrific i felt secure and i was very well aware of how much they had spent on compliance because again i was coming at it as an analyst testing uh a technology and i was so impressed their app worked better than paypal's app i think it still does and and they hired one of their very first hires was a very high profile compliance person they understood that was that was key they had they had they invested a lot in in security and safety they understood that was important it was a well-funded well-thought-out well-led startup at the time and they've continued to develop from there and it's not a coincidence that today they're well respected by the traditional financial community as well as within the crypto community not everybody in the crypto community loves them because of what they represent and how intertwined they are in the traditional world of finance but everybody respects them and that's their lead that's their lead to lose and especially as you get institutional money in institutions already see this as a very risky endeavor they want to go to the gold standard they're going to feel comfortable the company that's been around that's done a good job with security that has good user experience and again to me between coinbase and grayscale that's a lot of where this is headed and so as i'm sure you're well aware in the crypto community there's a lot made of this so-called fat protocols thesis which uh stipul or hypothesized that an investment in the crypto assets themselves would be um more uh productive than an investment in the applications on top but i was curious how would you say an investment in coinbase stock would compare to an investment in crypto assets themselves well if you're investing in crypto assets you have to decide who the winners are which is really really hard i think we know how well bitcoin's doing we think we're all very excited about the developments on ethereum there's so many other tools now there's there's defy tokens you have to do a lot of work to figure out who's going to win you know again i come from the digital world of work of world of finance where we do a unbelievable amount of work to figure out if stocks are going to go up or down it's even harder for for crypto assets and tokens and so if you're going to invest in crypto assets token you have to do a lot of work to get that right if you invest in coinbase what you're getting is you're letting them figure it out and not in a not in a portfolio way of oh i'll just buy a little bit of everything coinbase will be trading tokens regardless of who wins it could be a different token or crypto asset that does better they're going to be trading them anyway and they're going to be taking the commission into the fees anyway and that's what makes it interesting as a public company investment is they're going to win regardless of which crypto asset is the best one or does the best where if you're investing directly in the crypto asset you actually have to figure out who's going to win so in a moment we're going to discuss the coinbase stock price but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com is giving away four teslas to enter

found in the show notes back to my conversation with gail lauria you gave coin a price target of 195 dollars how did you reach that number to me there's a category of stocks it's thin air but there's a category of stocks that are gold standard market leading in an open-ended growth category so it's companies like zoom snowflake tesla crowdstrike octa these are companies that teledoc that have a a huge category that's growing very rapidly and could grow for a long time and are the market leaders in that category by being the the gold standard the standard bear in that category that's where these guys belong now valuation-wise that can take you anywhere from 10 times the revenue to 70 times revenue because the information on coinbase is still partial we're still piecing it together i used 20 times revenue as a starting point but again as we get more informations we get a better sense for the revenue we can we could revisit that and see if they can justify a higher or lower type of multiple and again on what revenue base i've extrapolated from 2020 results into 2021 but it's just my extrapolation the company isn't quite pure they're not giving guidance yet and yeah well i was going to ask next about that extrapolation can you give us some insight into how you made this projection that by year's end at least they would bring in two billion dollars in revenue yeah i i used what i would consider conservative assumptions i assume this quarter the march quarter that we're in is going to be even better than the december quarter just based on what crypto assets have done the level of activity etc but then i assumed for my calculations because there's no guidance and we're still here in march then it actually goes back down to the lower levels of activity for the rest of the year and even based on that i get them growing for a little over from a little over 1.2 billion of revenue in 2020 to 2 billion dollars of revenue in 2021. if this level of crypto asset prices continues through the rest of the year if this level of activity and volatility continues to the rest of the year they could achieve a much higher level of revenue than that yeah yeah i definitely want to emphasize that it does seem that you want the conservative route because i i'm sure you're well aware that coinbase shares have recently been reported to be trading at 373 on nasdaq private market so i wondered what you thought of that yeah you know what we've learned in similar situations ahead of ipos of squares ipo facebook ipo that these private company transactions are interesting they're indicative of where some of the price discovery is but you really have to get the stock listed before you know where where people are willing to pay you really have to put it in the marketplace with all the supply and demand to get a better sense for what the price is so it's an indication of where the price could go on that first day but realistically speaking the last real price we have is from the raise they did in 2018 which actually puts them at at only 39 a share there's no doubt that they will list at a much higher price than that but until they list we we have to go with that in order to anchor uh the current market price uh but we won't have to wait for long i would expect within the next one to five weeks for the listing ticker and what did you make of the fact that 96 of coinbase's revenue comes from transaction fees yeah i mean that's the business that's the business they've always had i think what's interesting is that the subscription type businesses they're getting into are growing even faster and and that's really going to be very important for coinbase for their revenue to be more recurring for their stock to get valued based on a recurring level of revenue as opposed to the ups and downs of of crypto asset prices and crypto volatility they're going to have to grow that line um much faster so you know there's things in there like custody for institutional accounts i would expect that line to grow very quickly because again the level of institutional activity on coinbase is now um far outstripping the level of consumer activity and those institutions are not going to be bothered with private keys they're going to pay somebody to custody their assets the other interesting one that i found is is staking if we do move more to proof of stake for proof of work again institutions are not going to want to manage their own staking enthusiasts well uh true crypto believers and participants will institutions will not they're going to want to pay somebody to manage their staking and it's and coinbase is particularly well positioned to do that for those institutions and um so talk a little bit more about this trend that we've seen where we're seeing more institutional trading volume on coinbase and less retail how much bigger do you think it could get oh much big it could operative word could get much bigger we're hearing very large asset managers talking about what percent allocation they need to put into crypto assets if they all just put a percent of their allocation into crypto assets obviously we're talking about an unbelievable uh influx of capital uh we don't know that that's going to happen you know crypto assets can roll over again and we can get into another quiet period like we had between 2014 and 16 like we had last year those things could happen but if institutions see this as an asset class that they need to have exposure right now they think most institutional capital thinks of the world as real estate stocks and bonds maybe some commodity increasingly they all realize they've missed the boat on that run from zero dollars to a trillion dollars of asset class over the last 10 years and they don't want to miss the move from a trillion dollars and up and so they understand they need a certain allocation to the extent this happens broadly that's a tremendous influx in capital and that could be the next wave of growth for crypto assets all right so then what would be your expectation of what would happen to the price of coin on the day of the direct listing it's so hard to tell it's so hard to tell what i can tell you is that it's going to be interesting volatile exciting i think the last comparable event is facebook's ipo if you remember how that transpired with very high expectations and then some letdowns and then you know facebook has obviously done tremendously well since then we may get all that wrapped up in one day there's going to be a lot of activity there's a tremendous amount of enthusiasm again everybody loves coinbase everybody respects coinbase not everybody loves coinbase everybody respects coinbase thinks very highly of them we're gonna see that come to the market when they list and so i would expect there to be a lot of activity and again i i expect the stock to do well um in its first day or days uh when it becomes listed and so while i have your attention i couldn't help but want to ask you a little bit about gbtc to harken back to your previous days did you notice that as of last week gbtc no longer is trading at a premium and instead the prices actually has fallen below the um the price of bitcoin what do you have any theories as to yeah it is very interesting i always assume that uh when etfs come to market that that premium would would be reduced it may be an indication that people believe the etfs are close i can tell you etfs have been close to the market since 2013. i i remember reading uh diligently the uh the gemini s1 in 2013 where they were trying to generate to get an etf in the market and here we are it's 2021 we do not have an etf yet so whenever the premium in gbtc goes down i imagine that has a lot to do with the expectation for an etf which which obviously trades at the value of the assets and there wouldn't be a premium there it could also be related to the coinbase ipo if people are trying to free up funds in order to to buy coinbase and think that that's um a different use of of that capital that uh influence in gptc but uh but again gptc is just one aspect and one particular security that that was very well timed that has served us very well in the market for for the duration of its existence how how it'll what form it'll take going forward if there's etfs we'll find out it doesn't really take away from what grayscale's doing on a bigger scale which is gathering assets in the trust and so what about you going forward can we expect to see more from you on crypto whether it's bitcoin or coinbase or whatever it might be i i'd like to stay involved to the extent that the community wants to to talk to me that that folks on wall street want to get my opinion i'm happy to stay involved it was hard staying away for the last four years i'm glad to be back and um i i hope to stay involved going forward great well it's been so great talking to you again i really was shocked i remember when you wrote me and you said you were not going to be covering it anymore i was like what um so welcome back and i look forward to talking to you more in the future great to
