prices during a negative week for the crypto markets which lost over 200 billion dollars in total market capitalization the consumer price index report was presented on Thursday October's inflation came in lower than expected by analysts and crypto prices rocketed but not enough to make up for this week's losses all right time for fun vids this week some of you may have noticed that I tweeted that I thought it would be great to have a comedian give their take on the FTX debacle this week I ended up commissioning Ginny Hogan a stand-up comedian and author of I'm more dateable than a plate of refried beans to write and perform some jokes on what has been an absolute Humdinger of a week please enjoy so I didn't follow crypto all that closely until I wound up in a relationship with a crypto engineer he worked in an ethereum startup well I say it was a relationship we were never official and he wanted us to be he would always ask me if I was dating other people and I was always like Josh you of all people should understand the concept of an asset only having value because of how much other people want it okay I saw what happened to Luna I'm not gonna let that be me yes I'm dating other people okay so because of him unfortunately I do still pay attention to the crypto markets crypto winter where we've been for the last 11 months started to heat up the other night whenever I hear about the crypto World fighting I feel like it's that scene in Mean Girls in the gymnasium where Lindsay Lohan realizes that every subgroup has its own drama even the huge huge huge losers I'll say it up top I think it's really fun when the crypto markets act like the regular financial markets I don't like change and it's kind of homey and comforting to know that a rerun of 2008 is coming up it's nostalgic like let's put on the Friends finale so here's to FDX the Lehman of crypto okay let's get into it what we have is a war between two men who both go by their initials CZ and SBF both celebrities in the crypto world and the guy you just swipe left on on hinge in the real world CZ is basically the bad boy of crypto he runs binance which is not as the name suggests Finance for bisexuals and he would never talk to DC regulators he's super anti-regulation he's his mid-40s and left a traditional Finance career to work in crypto which I believe is what they call a lateral move think of him like James Dean without the cool jacket or cool personality or cool anything he's also fun fact partially responsible for funding Elon musk's acquisition of Twitter which I have mixed feelings about I'm mad that he helped Elon by Twitter but I'm grateful that he's helping Elon go broke svf the founder of FDX was the good guy which of course is how women describe men who can't get laid he's super young and was sometimes called a crypto savior that's right like the crypto version of an essential worker he promised to give away his billions of dollars which well he just might have done we'll get to it so a week ago he had 16 billion dollars which is insane because I saw a photo of him and I had no idea that getting a haircut cost 16 billion and one dollars he's done a lot to raise his public profile including a Vogue spread with Giselle who he was told five minutes before the shoot began is a very famous model all of that is to say no one suspected SPF was doing anything shady with money Giselle has never made a bad choice in her entire life it started on Sunday CZ tweeted that binance was liquidating any any remaining ftt the coin issued by rival exchange FTX was once part of FTX but it spun off like a malignant tumor CeCe claimed he had to dump the ftt and listen I think it's nice when crypto guys get to experience dumping things due to Revelations about ftt which we soon Learned was that SPF was getting high on his own Supply and by that I'm referring to crypto not weed they're very different wheat is mostly legal someone discovered that Alameda SBS other firm sometimes called its sister firm making it one of very few women in crypto held a huge amount of ftt its own coin and it turns out ftt was pretty illiquid CeCe said he needed to drop the ftt because he was learning from Luna which is insane I did not realize crypto people learned from their mistakes anyway after binance dumped all this ftt 23 million coins the price of FDT went crazy well it went from 24 to 24.50 to 2228 in just one day which is to be fair not all that unusual for a crypto coin Alameda then offered to buy ftt for 22 each which seems weird like if you're getting in trouble for holding too much of your own currency don't buy another 23 million of that currency that's like when I told my ex he was sleeping with too many women and then he slept with 23 million other women just kidding I've never had an ex who was successful at getting women to sleep with him did you miss the part about dating a crypto guy anyway then on Tuesday Finance agreed to buy FTX yeah it turned out FTX was totally insolvent and people couldn't get their coins out I've dated a crypto guy so I know what it's like when they just can't perform it's not a good situation CZ offered to save crypto for now and SBF got humbled made his reputation bailing out troubled crypto Farms is now on the receiving end of the bailout he lost 94 of his net worth how's he going to keep himself afloat with a mere 994 million dollars a lot of people who will never have as much money as him are dunking at him for being poor and honestly I'm here for it but even just in the last couple days it turns out that CZ scrapped the whole deal I guess this offer hinged on binance first performing due diligence which of course being a crypto exchange meant they had to First learn what due diligence was he said their problems were Beyond his ability to fix and then he tweeted out a list of advice for crypto users one of which was to ignore the prices which seems much easier to say when you have a billion dollars on hand FDX is now on the brink of collapse and SBF said he needs eight billion dollars in emergency financing I don't understand can he just like mine for that anyway recently Justin and his son announced he's gonna find a way to return FTX and Tron users to normalcy but I've met a lot of crypto guys and I find that highly unlikely a lot of people are concerned that this means that the crypto markets will have to follow the same rules as the traditional financial markets but I assure you it's not that many rules don't worry you can still be SEC regulated and melt the entire economy boys the big Banks do it all the time thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about the collapse of FTX Eric and Kobe check out the show notes for this episode
