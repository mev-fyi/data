chief investment officer at arca welcome jeff hi thanks for having me back so this has been a dramatic week for sushi swap culminating in cto joseph de long's resigning from the decentralized exchange before we get to that moment why don't we give listeners some background and you can just tell us how it is that you came to start even working with sushi swap and how you see your role there sure so arca is a full-service asset management firm dedicated exclusively to digital assets we make investments in a variety different strategies at arca that some are early stage ventures some are more yield generating others are more long-term equity-like returns in the businesses uh and projects that are being developed within digital assets and we're thematic uh in terms of their certain areas of digital assets that we like better than others and we are always pretty hands-on we we really want to help the teams that we work with and we want to be supportive of the projects that we believe in so um truthfully sushi is not unique or different than anything else that we've been involved in in the sense that it fits a theme in a sector that we've been bullish on for a long time which is defy and specifically uh decentralized exchanges within d5 it is uh fits a fundamental tenant that we are big believers in which is strong product market fit or real kpis and metrics not something that's you know to be determined um you know has a real strong community and and has real fundamental values you know this is a project that has um you know anywhere between 600 million and a billion of run rate revenue uh every year depending on the uh the day there's a little volatility in those numbers but 600 million to a billion dollars of revenue is certainly nothing to sneeze at um it has a uh a real dividend that is paid out to token holders uh in the form of of x sushi and it has you know billions of dollars of volume every day so you know this is the kind of dream scenario for us is fit a theme fit a fundamental uh evaluation framework and then ultimately like any project they they have certain things that are going really well and certain things that aren't and our job is to help them with the things that aren't so that's the perfect segue to the recent events in sushi when and why do you think this recent trouble started and you know i think i don't mean literally this week i mean maybe starting even a month or two ago sure i mean like most things the what is being communicated on the outside is probably the extreme compared to what's actually happening on the inside and i know that's a strange thing to say when you're talking about decentralized projects and you're talking about um you know fully transparent projects but um you know at the end of the day the the there's a there's a lot of people who are contributing to sushi to make it what it is right you don't get to um you know uh tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of volume and billions of dollars of tvl and almost a billion dollars of revenue without having really talented successful people that are working on that however decentralized autonomous organizations are still experimental um they're still new uh and they're not perfect um a lot of people like to look at decentralization versus centralization as fairly black and white the reality is almost none of them are almost everything falls along the spectrum somewhere between central fully centralized and fully decentralized fully centralized is rarely a good thing in the sense that you have single point of failure and you have you know one or two people in total control i think that's you know largely what the entire digital asset movement is trying to get away from fully decentralized on the other hand is usually not that great either in the sense that it's really hard to get consensus it's really hard to get things done most projects again fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum usually starting somewhat centralized and moving towards decentralization over time in fact if you go back to uh you know sec commissioner hester pierce's three-year safe harbor that she put out like i think over a year ago at this point that still hasn't gotten any traction that's essentially what she laid out which is why don't we give these projects about three years to figure out if they can move from centralized to decentralization and it actually makes a lot of sense because you have to have some leaders in the beginning to get to a point where then you can have it more decentralized and more autonomous and quite frankly more automatic i think with sushi it was a little bit of an interesting genesis in the sense that they forked the code from uniswap and you had a lot of different people come in and out of this project to make it work and again at the individual level i think everybody has really made strong contributions to making it work but like anything if you don't have a structure and you don't have uh appointed leaders with any real control or real autonomy eventually things just get sloppy and i think that's where we are with sushi today is they need some structure there's no reason to take sides i'm not even sure the two sides are really that even far apart i think it's more it just needs some structure it needs some leadership and that's what arca is hoping to be you know one of the calm voices in the room who can get us to a productive way to move forward and we're not alone you know there's a outpouring of people on social media and in discord and telegram who also love the sushi project who are offering to help but you know we ultimately need to do that within the constructs of what a dow is which means some things have to go to an external vote and some people are ultimately going to have to you know be given some of that authority to ultimately move this project forward so just to give a recap of some of the events for listeners who may not know everything there was a core i i'm actually even not sure if he was a core developer i don't think he was a developer a xerox maki but he was kind of part of the core team at sushi swap and in september he seemed to have resigned but there was a leaked screenshot from a sushi swap telegram group that showed that joseph de long the cto who resigned this week had asked whether or not sushi should ask him to leave and according to the poll there 91 of respondents voted in favor and so people were saying you know he was forced out it wasn't that he resigned and later on uh someone on twitter named boring crypto who said that they were a former non-core sushi swap developer tweeted that xerox machi was kicked out and said quote most of the good devs have left seems like greed sadly has taken over from community what's your take on on that characterization of events uh sure we are an asset manager and we're a pretty hands-on advisor but we don't work there right if if if every single problem that any employee or customer had at every single company in the world was given a platform to put it out there publicly you'd have the same conspiracy theories and the same you know dichotomy of of he said she said as you're seeing with sushi you know in some ways it's unfortunate that some of these things have come to light in other ways it's great that some of these things have come to light in the sense that that's the spirit of decentralization is that we want to get as much information and facts out to the public in a transparent way as possible so that the stakeholders of sushi can ultimately vote to fix the problem you know if if every screenshot from every company or every organization was you know saved and leaked out to the media you know every you know you'd be a very busy person right you'd be reporting on every wrongdoing that every single company and project has ever done in history so i think it's hard to draw too many conclusions from from you know screenshots without context or conversations in isolation without context you know what i can say is almost everybody that we've ever come across at sushi um whether they're still there or not has had their heart in the right place and has been really a strong believer in in what sushi is trying to build and i think the next group of people who come in will have the same attitude and ultimately that's pretty powerful and pretty awesome right again it's to me as an investor it's much harder to get product market fit and to get customers and to get a community and to get traction than it is to fix an internal structure right that's the history of distressed investing or the history of activist investing that's basically what you look for right you look for good company bad management you oust the management and you start over with you know the core business still in place independent of who the right people are to ultimately lead this forward it's a fixable problem and that's what you gravitate toward as an investor you look for fixable problems right you want things that are trading at values that are are way undervalued i mean you know this is the cheapest thing on the planet under any fundamental valuations it's now down to basically one times forward sales with a fifteen percent dividend yield um and a in a growing uh industry in a growing sector i mean you couldn't ask for anything better as an investor but you know there's clearly problems that need to be fixed so you know again on the one hand you probably wish that some of these things were just addressed internally rather than coming to light externally on the other hand it's great you know it's it's it's pushing this to a head right it's forcing uh action it's forcing the community to now get involved in governance and i think when some of these things come to a vote and some of these recent proposals that have been written come to a vote you're going to see record turnout and record participation and at the end of the day if you treat sushi as a microcosm for what we're trying to accomplish with daos it really has a chance to be a harvard business school case study for how to do this the right way i'd find it hard-pressed to find anybody who's really rooting against this you know you may see individuals attack other individuals or individuals like some of the tweets you mentioned who are you know saying this is falling apart or this is sad but if you actually backed up a little bit and said do you want sushi to succeed or not be hard pressed to find anybody who who wants this to fall apart i i just wouldn't see the benefit of that right this is this has a chance to transcend sushi and transcend investors and community members of sushi and really set the gold standard for how to get internal structures working properly within a dao and we really haven't seen that today right there's been some single some single entity dows i suppose that have that have been really easy to run like i guess constitution doubt since it's fresh in our minds would be the interesting one right constitution dow had a single goal it's let's raise a lot of money and let's go buy a copy of the constitution now even though they failed to actually secure the the copy of the constitution that they're going after it was a pretty simple doubt right it had a singular purpose give me some money we're gonna go bid on this and that was easy but now look at it right now the people token still trades they didn't give back all the money and now they have to figure out well what the hell do we do now with this dow that we have and we need to come up with some sort of a structure so i think you know we've proven that single purpose dows are easy ways to attract capital and easy ways to coordinate and incentivize like-minded people to do a single action what we haven't proven yet is how to run you know quasi-looking companies or quasi you know businesses within with lots of different people contributing within a dow and you know for me more philosophically even than as an investor i'm really rooting for success here i'm rooting that people can put aside their personalities people can put aside their pride and everything else and recognize that this is has a chance to be a win for the entire industry okay so in a moment we're going to unpack some more of the problems and look to what this means for dows but

pay cut to leave dapper labs to work on sushi and that he was earning 300 000 a year doing that and said that actually you know this sounds like a lot like a lot of money but of course he had taken that pay cut he proposed that via sushi swaps governance that all the core developers minus himself be compensated with 200 000 sushi which was about a million dollars each from the project's treasury with no lock-ups and that would have totaled about 18 million that proposal did not pass and he tweeted this was a test to show less than one percent of the issuance going to the core team is controversial you failed by the way so what's your take on how dows can and should compensate the core developers sure well my first take is that informal twitter polls by people who are overly stressed out because of a bad situation is probably not necessarily indicative of a failure or succeeding right it was a sushi governance poll it was a sushi yeah not right i understand but you know the genesis was there's there's been a lot of rants going back and forth on twitter between current and ex sushi contributors and and i think it's been more counterproductive than than productive regardless of of who may ultimately be right or not um what i think is important from that though is there's there's in our opinion there's essentially three things that need to be solved here first is a structure right and arca actually released its own proposal for a structure a structure that would put real business leaders in place that could basically be voted on by the community but ultimately once they're voted on they can then make autonomous or uh they can make autonomous decisions within the organization in terms of onboarding and off-boarding employees understanding who works on what project etc right not everything needs to come to a vote we need there needs to be some uh a line of delineation between what the community who isn't working their day-to-day is appointing and voting on so you know as the board of directors versus what the people in-house uh are actually doing on a day-to-day basis to make a project work so whether our proposal passes or someone else's you need to set the groundwork first you need to set a structure that says this is ultimately how this organization is going to work once that is completed then the next vote needs to be all right well who should these leaders be right how do you bring certain people in to run to show you nft pro platform or to run trident to run the sushi decks and ultimately have different people across you know product lines across marketing who ultimately have a say in how those internal divisions work and that could be you know contentious but ultimately that's what the community in the board of directors is for is to hold put people in place not everyone's going to agree on it you're never going to get 100 consensus but you're at least going to get something that is a sustainable and that has market approval but that doesn't come you know that's not a lifetime a guarantee that's not a uh you know this isn't congress where you know you're going to have 30 30-year senators because they just continue to spend the most money to lobby like we're going to have real kpis and metrics that say these are the things that you're meant to accomplish and every three months or six months whatever that cadence is gonna be you're gonna you know you have to go through another re-election with the community and show that you've done what you said you're gonna do so if we solve for those first two right one is structure two is leadership the third one is easy and that's compensation committee right there's no doubt that every single person who works on this project should be compensated now whether it's what joseph de long suggested which is you know 18 million dollars across the devs or whether it's something different again these are these are little details that can be ironed out but ultimately those are the three big decisions that the community needs to make the community needs to understand what's the structure who are the leaders and how should people be compensated to ensure that they are you know on team sushi right you want everybody aligned in the same way you want everybody to be you know understand which way is north make sure they're all have the same goals and the same uh uh incentives for doing what's best for sushi and if the governance can solve for those three things everything else should be handled internally right it doesn't have to be this community guided everything it should just be the big decisions are guided by the board of directors or the token holders and everything else is guided internally subject to them meeting certain kpis and certain metrics and it's easier said than done right i'm not suggesting that this is an overnight turnaround um but again you want to back a project that already has this much product market fit success passion etc you just got to get the right structure in there to make it ultimately run so the proposal that you're talking about was put forward by alex woodward on your team and dean eichenman of dialectic and i noticed that in it they also suggest that sushi create a legal entity somewhere and you know obviously for a dao that's it's a little unusual uh but i was curious you know why do you think that's necessary or helpful for a dao to have a legal entity um i'm gonna defer legal questions for the time being but what i'll say is when we put proposals out the idea is to get the community talking and discussing right the proposal that is out isn't necessarily the exact form that ends up in a vote ultimately the part of the proposal is to get people with different skill sets and different uh backgrounds to opine and try to come up with what the best structure going forward is so with regard to you know sushi they're you know ultimately in order to do this again this this falls on the how much centralization versus decentralization do you want to be along the spectrum you know the the legal entity we think would be sort of a bridge to getting to where you need to be for the rest of decentralization so i'm not gonna go into too much detail there because i uh you know there's a lot of lawyers out there who are gonna end up opining ultimately on this but in our opinion that was the best way to bridge that gap from you know starting uh bridge that gap along that spectrum and um just to clarify joseph de long himself had also suggested in a tweet that sushi swap moved to a model that he called a uniswap labs style model and by that you know what i took to mean was uh that there would be a legal entity that is then in charge of developing this decentralized protocol so for the legal entity that you put forward in your proposal is is it the same type of idea similar yes like i said i think the details we're lacking intentionally around that because i think there's some discussions that need to be uh had with lawyers but yes the similar idea okay and last quick question so i noticed also that alex and dean in their post said that a flat structure was not scalable and as you've described here you're suggesting kind of a more like a hierarchy that be put in place here so how you know obviously that's kind of a model that's more associated with a centralized entity so i wondered how you felt that that kind of fit with this model of a decentralized autonomous organization if there is this clear leadership structure in place well again i think i think you're getting back to that black and white description of centralized versus decentralized and and i think you know that's what we have to get away from across this entire industry is that it it's it can't be fully decentralized or fully centralized because it just doesn't work right you have to fall somewhere on that spectrum so just because you put some team leaders in place and you have some hierarchies doesn't mean that it's still not decentralized in the sense that bigger decisions would still come to a vote to all stakeholders right so you know when you when you think of somebody who you know let's take a company for example uh like an elon musk or like a michael sailor right where they are the ceo they make all the internal decisions they also own all of the shares and control the board vote there's literally nothing you can do to usurp power there right it is as centralized as you get and there's almost no solution other than basically the court of public pressure and then where somebody steps down right you can still err closer on the side of decentralization where more things come to a vote and you have a deeper larger more diversified board of directors who gets to vote on things more frequently but still have some decisions that are internal where there is a hierarchy and there is a clear you know top-down delimitation to get things done um you know it's it's really hard to get things done in any flat organization right i mean somebody has to uh essentially guide a strategy so you know this is just arca's idea uh we have a lot of experience both investing as well as restructuring as well as working with companies um uh uh as board directors and things like that we think this is the best path forward but ultimately it's not our decision either right this is going to come to a vote in some form and the community will vote on whether or not this makes sense so you know in some ways it's ironic right let's let's say we put a proposal together that said we want a centralized structure but we left it up to a vote to the community to vote on that well by definition is that's actually still decentralized isn't it um in the sense that that's ultimately not our call right there's no one person who can make any call other than propose something that everyone gets to vote on so this is why for us this is this is so important to use as an example on how to get these structures right right this is not going to stop with just sushi independent of the success of sushi or not the things that we learn from this you know not just in this proposal currently and what's happening but you know you could go back six months ago 12 months ago the things that we're learning from sushi which is the largest dao in this industry are going to be a trend setting for all dows in the future so i think it's really important um i you know i i'm actually sometimes amazed when you see how how you lose the forest through the trees sometimes on twitter and everyone's attacking and everyone's you know has their personal agenda and but if you actually asked any of these people hey what's your goal for this they'd be like actually i'm fine i like sushi it's a good product i'd like to see them succeed yet all the toxicity comes out in twitter and the whole point of governance is to end some of that and you know i come from i come from a distressed background myself and you know i've sat on numerous uh bankruptcies and restructuring processes and the first thing that happens in a bankruptcy process is you split everybody into committees you have your equity committee you have your creditors committee you know whether that's unsecured or secured and basically what you're doing is you're getting representation across each of the different stakeholders depending on what they're lobbying for right equity holders want something unsecured bond holders want something secured bond holders want something employees and unions want something in my opinion that's where daos are headed right you you just need everybody needs to be represented so maybe you end up having a you know a core developer committee and you have a passive investor committee and you have a um uh you know heavy user committee um you know power user committee ultimately that's probably where you're headed because also you know what's really unique and interested about digital assets is it's just one token we all own the same token right so if you measure the success of a project ultimately by the success of the token which you know is debatable but let's say that's where we're headed well in theory if everybody owns the same token and they're all incentivized in the same way to have that token go higher but at the same time there are little nuances that each different group might want right users might want something a little bit different than developers who might want something different than passive investors well then ultimately you just need to make sure everybody has a seat at the table to be a part of those discussions and i think we'll get there you know i think again this is probably the easiest turnaround story you could imagine in digital assets because it already has so much success and we're just trying to figure out how to fix the internal happiness and structure and alignment and incentives but hopefully it does in fact succeed and it sets a really good precedent for other dows in the future yeah well we'll have to see because the token price is down about 50 from a month ago it's at like roughly six dollars now so we'll see what happens because certainly this has been a drag on the perception of sushi in the public opinion but anyway this has been such a fascinating conversation thank

recap the second worst sell-off this year the total crypto markets were at roughly 2.6 trillion dollars on friday night by saturday morning the market had crashed to a low of 2.1 trillion dollars marking a 19 dip in less than 24 hours bitcoin dropped roughly by 10 000 during this period to a low of 45 032 which amounts to a 34.5 price decrease for bitcoin since its november 9th all-time high it appears a massive round of liquidations fueled the wild price action in a blog post glasnote explained that high open interest in bitcoin futures markets could lead to an extremely volatile event glastoned wrote legacy market weakness on friday lead on all assets globally holding bitcoin's price around 53 000 and near pivotal technical support when price failed to hold cell pressure triggered a cascade of long liquidations and cascade it did data from coin glass shows that over two billion dollars worth of long positions were liquidated on december third overall 5.4 billion dollars in contracts from the bitcoin futures open interest market were flushed out between friday and saturday this accounts for a 24.5 decrease in the total value of the crypto markets according to glassnode the analytics firm calculates that this was the second largest single day change in futures open interest this year the block's frank chaparro reported that trading executives believe large institutional selling was also a factor chaparral states one executive saying that a single institution sold more than 500 million dollars in bitcoin on friday morning which resulted in the aggressive liquidations while the dip was bad news for those who got liquidated it also left the opportunity to buy the dip as el salvador did scooping up 150 extra coins at a sub 50 000 price in a turning point congress gives crypto a positive reception on wednesday's circles jeremy alaire ftx's sam bankman freed bitfury's brian brooks paxos's chad cascarilla stellar's danelle dixon and coinbase's alicia haas appeared before members of congress to discuss digital assets and the future of finance and house financial services committee hearing according to the block the crypto execs and congress covered topics such as stable coin regulation and issuance the idea of a crypto focus regulator and the overarching theme of consistent crypto-regulation across government regimes overall outside of a few straight comments from representative brad sherman the crypto execs were met with apparent curiosity from most members of congress web 3 can empower anyone said representative anthony gonzalez for example the meeting which took nearly five hours seemed to be a success bankman free the ceo of ftx tweeted i came in expecting some hostility and grandstanding but instead found the discussion to be by and large productive and helpful however not all is rosy with regulators coinbase whose ceo brian armstrong has expressed unhappiness with u.s crypto regulation and who did not attend the hearing is launching a d5 platform that will allow users to earn yields on die deposits customers in 70 countries will have access to yields fluctuating between 2.83 and 5.39 however the us will not be one of those countries as the sec recently threatened to sue the exchange if it were to launch a yield product in related regulatory news william burns director of the central intelligence agency told the wall street journal this week that the caa has multiple projects keeping track of the cryptocurrency industry in response to a question about ransomware burns revealed that his predecessor had set in motion a number of different projects focused on cryptocurrency and trying to look at second and third order consequences as well and helping with our colleagues in other parts of the us government to provide solid intelligence on what we're seeing polygon acquires another zk platform polygon a side chain working to scale ethereum announced the acquisition of mir protocol a zero knowledge proof project in a deal worth 400 million dollars in polygons native token matic the move comes after a similar deal with polygon and zk project hermes which was a 250 million merger overall polygon has pledged to spend one billion dollars on scaling ethereum what happens after a dow hack bitmart and badger dow take two different approaches bitmart a centralized exchange lost 196 million dollars worth of various cryptocurrencies on saturday sheldon zia bitmart's ceo tweeted that the security breach was caused by a stolen private key that had two of our hot wallets compromised which led to the loss of 100 million dollars in ethereum assets and 96 million dollars in binance smart chain assets according to zia bitmart will use its own funds to compensate victims to protect against a future breach bitmart replaced all of its deposit addresses for all tokens the aftermath of last week's badger dow hack in which the d5 protocol lost roughly 120 million dollars is a bit more complicated the exploit was a front-end attack that allowed hackers to change user transactions made on the website to steal funds celsius network a centralized lender was one of the addresses affected by the badger dow hack we are working with badger to recover all those funds we are collaborating with them on the investigation ceo alex mashinsky said in a live stream last week confirming celsius's involvement on twitter there is speculation that celsius lost roughly 50 million dollars in the exploit the insurance protocol used by badger dow nexus mutual will most likely not pay out funds to compensate users as its insurance coverage does not cover front-end attacks that being said celsius network's twitter account claims that no celsius client and user assets were affected the account also says the celsius network has traced the attacker and reported that information to batcher openc is not ipoing in an interview with bloomberg on monday openc's newly hired cfo brian roberts made a comment about the nft marketplace holding an initial public offering or ipo when you have a company growing as fast as this one you'd be foolish not to think about it going public explain to roberts he added i've seen a lot of p l's profit and loss statements but i've never seen a p l like this community backlash on crypto twitter was swift as many had speculated that openc will be the next big airdrop to be released on tuesday the cto set the record straight on twitter writing there was inaccurate reporting about open seas plans there is a big gap between thinking about what an ipo might eventually look like and actively planning one we are not planning an ipo and if we ever did we would look to involve the community roberts previously worked as the cfo for lyft where he led the ride sharing app to a successful ipo a solana bug was patched saving 27 million dollars an hour in the process a bug in the solana program library an integral collection of open source code for solana programmers was patched this week after sitting unnoticed for months according to neodym an auditor the bug could have resulted in 2.6 billion dollars in total value locked being at risk with hundreds of millions in potential profit for hackers in a blog post neodymium explained that one of its auditors initially found a seemingly innocuous bug in june however on december 1st neodime noticed the vulnerability was still not patched the team then calculated that the seemingly small exploit which looked like a tiny rounding error could be harvested at a rate of 7 500 a second or 27 million dollars an hour neodymium quickly contacted the at-risk solana projects and got the bug patched a task that proved tougher than originally thought due to many solana projects being closed source crypto adoption
