reimagining the world around you on tezos today's guest is aaron lammer the host and producer of the podcast series exit scam which is all about quadriga cx welcome erin hi glad to be here i'm a listener thanks for listening so exit scam has been this pretty amazing podcast series that you've put out why don't you give us a short synopsis of what it's all about well i think people who are religious listeners to the show will have heard about quadriga before i think you your piece with taylor monahan has to have been one of the first big podcast things about quadriga um so for a little recap quadriga was a canadian bitcoin exchange it was the largest bitcoin exchange in canada um and it collapsed in early 2019 after the founder gerald cotton died in india and his death was somewhat mysterious to begin with and uh got even more mysterious um when it was revealed that he had not left behind the passwords to unlock quadriga's cold storage wallets and then it got even more mysterious when some blockchain forensics by people like taylor monahan actually uh revealed that not only were these cold storage wallets locked they were empty and had been so for some time so what we really did with the show was trying to solve two mysteries uh what really happened to gerald cotton the founder and what happened to all of that money that was missing so before we dive into all the various rabbit holes that you went down to try to solve these questions why don't you tell us a little bit about your background how did you know what were you doing before how did you come to do this podcast series etc so um i'm one of the founders of longform.org uh which is a journalism aggregator for old people who were on the internet 10 years ago you may remember when it was difficult to find reading material on your phone um so we were kind of trying to fill that niche and through long form i ended up starting to do the long-form podcast um which is how i got into podcasting um which by the way is one of my favorite podcasts for listeners if any of you are media people you should definitely check it out but anyway yeah yeah for the um four people who listen to the show who don't hate journalism it's a great resource um and through that i got really into podcasting and i always like doing podcasts about my own interests like i'm not like the kind of person who can just get assigned something i kind of have to be into it myself and i got really into crypto uh in about i guess in 2017 i started getting into crypto and part of my way of getting into things is to shill them to other people and i started shilling crypto to my friend jay kang who i knew was kind of vulnerable to it because he's a poker player and kind of a gambler and that's always a good person to show crypto to um so i got him really into it and we did this show called coin talk um which i guess ran for about a year a year and a half basically until jay had to start writing his book um and and that show was about crypto but um not the most serious show about crypto i would say we kind of went into it knowing not very much got a lot of things wrong um tried to learn as we go we kind of tried to take an experiential approach to crypto so like we were doing things like i had a market on auger when augur was first out about whether donald trump p tapes would be would come we were just kind of like doing all sorts of fun things you could do and pretty much the most the thing that grabbed me the most over and over in crypto were the the charlatans uh the scammers um the people who did really outlandish uh wild west stuff in crypto and i know that a lot of crypto kind of wants to sweep those people under the rug and say they don't exist or there are a few bad apples that don't represent the whole space for me that's the stuff that stuff really kind of interests me like i don't know if i'm an amoral person or what but i've always been fascinated by that stuff and basically when quadriga happened we were still doing the show i was like there's just never going to be a story that tops this like as a connoisseur of the crypto scam this one is just on on the mount rushmore of kryptos games not because of its scale you know there's been bigger exit scams even i think mount ganks was was bigger but simply the audacity of the whole thing and how many different competing mysteries there were all kind of circling around this one person who honestly people didn't know that much about you know a lot of these founders a lot of these founders have been on your show you know they're people who are out and about and kind of promoting themselves gerald cotton wasn't really like that he was kind of an enigma he he when we started looking into him there was only a couple of pieces of audio of him talking a few videos on youtube he was really like a a kind of ghost as a figure which which made it difficult to figure out much about what really happened to him so tell us a little bit more about him a kind of you know what his life was like and also what his lifestyle was like before he died so he was living the high life he was a big international traveler private jets all around the world um there's some insinuations that on a lot of those private jets he was carrying large amounts of cash and that his trips may not have been purely tourism but involve moving money around the world and i have some theories about that and and when you say that who are your sources um the source uh is one of the guys who was um part of the the flight center uh where he would fly he was into flying private planes and people who saw him including this guy in private airport said yeah he would often have a duffel bag full of money i mean i i have a photograph of one million dollars of cash on his counter and i can tell you definitively where that cash came from and how it came to be on his counter he he had these deals with atm operators in which he would trade them bitcoin for cash and they would show up to his house or to a private airport with a large sum of cash the stuff i'm describing isn't even contentious this is in the ontario securities commission's report in fact that photograph is in the ontario security commission's report but going back further and i think this was something i was actually really kind of excited to talk about on the show gerald had roots in the pre-bitcoin digital currency world um that another thing that crypto people like to sweep under the rug but is a fascinating history of these centralized pre-bitcoin digital currencies uh liberty reserve is probably the most famous one eagle before that and the way that gerald got involved in those was he was running ponzi schemes as a teenager and you couldn't buy into those ponzi schemes with paypal you needed to use these digital currencies to buy in and at some point he jumped from scamming people using these digital currencies to being an exchanger himself he started an exchange called midas gold that was run by his future quadriga co-founder michael patrin at that point i believe using a different name and they ran a liberty reserve exchange and you can see these interviews with gerald cotton where he says i have 10 years experience in the digital currency space and this is when bitcoin is only five or six years old so if you were reading behind between the lines and you knew enough about the real history of this stuff you would know that he was involved in it uh before bitcoin which gave him this interesting leg up on anyone who wanted to start an exchange there was all of these you know guys at bitcoin meetups who could talk a big game but they hadn't really done what it takes to run an exchange which is a very bizarre specific skill set so um he started off in that world and successfully transitioned into bitcoin exchanging but the stuff he was exposed to in those days is some pretty dark criminal stuff that's kind of what was going on on liberty reserve a lot of money laundering cartels were involved and a lot of scamming i would say scamming is the dominant theme uh in all of this history and when you say that how do you know it's it's a scam it's um what like what was he doing exactly so he was involved in these things called high-yield investment programs um there was a very popular forum called pot gold that they were operated on and uh that's where he met most of his friends that's where he met the future founder of quadriga you can actually go back on this forum and wayback machine and see them interacting with each other when gerald is 15 years old and his co-founder mike is 20 19 or 20. um and so he was operating these high-yield investment programs which accepted eagle the buy-in and the way that these high-yield investment programs operated it may be familiar to some people who are kind of gambling on algorithmic stable coins at this time basically people would buy in and would be would get the first people would get paid out fairly outrageous returns and then the thing would collapse and the person operating it anonymously would disappear and this is something jerry did many many times as a teenager and we know that people who knew him were kind of weirded out they said where is he getting all this money well now we know where he was getting that money he was running these high-yield investment programs which i would just refer to as ponzi scheeps they're very low-level internet ponzi schemes in which i would argue much like algorithmic stable coins a lot of the people who are buying in are kind of aware that they're involved in something sketchy that's probably eventually going to collapse and the gambling part is whether you get out before the whole thing collapses and jerry at some point um jumped from running those schemes to realizing you could probably make more money selling the the digital currency that that was going into these schemes and got into exchanging and it's a really interesting period in some of my research there are forum posts by satoshi nakamoto in which he talks about liberty reserve and proposes a liberty reserve bitcoin trading pair this is before there would have been any fiat on ramps into bitcoin liberty reserve was considered kind of as like maybe we can use it as our our tether basically as we're getting bitcoin off the ground now i have no indication that there actually ever was bitcoin liberty reserve trading liberty reserve was shut down in 2013 so it kind of it actually ended up being kind of the last gasp of centralized digital currencies before bitcoin came out to the scene okay so here we have this larger than life character with this sketchy background although all this comes out later this was not known at the time um tell us a little bit about kind of kodriga's story and status at the time of his supposed death so quadriga had become the biggest bitcoin exchange in canada kind of by accident um i think ca vertex was previously the biggest exchange in canada and uh cia vertex shut down and there's kind of different stories about exactly why ca vertex shut down it was hacked they lost money and then i believe it was also absorbed into kraken in some way is that right do you remember that history at all i i did read that when i was doing research for this show but yeah i don't know the details so quadriga shot up and became the number one bitcoin exchange in canada and when you talk to a lot of people about why they trusted quadriga they'll cite that it was the biggest bitcoin exchange in canada there's a lot of circular logic like this in crypto and another reason most people will cite why they trusted it is that it was run by a canadian guy and people in canada liked trusting their money to a fellow canadian so jarrah gerald had all these things uh working for him you know in in that way but beyond that there was really very little known about quadriga um we know now that it was based on white label software called um w locks wlox uh that was originally developed by crypto capital which is a whole nother scandal right for for listeners who may not recall that was the company that tether um made the loan to and didn't get its money back i forget the amount but it was a huge in my 860 million or something or no i don't remember or maybe that was what they had after anyway okay so i don't know the amount but they had a huge amount that got tied up with cryptocapital and that's how tethers reserves um yeah ended up being less than what they should have been we couldn't even get into this in the show because we had so much we needed to get into about gerald cotton but there's a whole other story about the payment processors that quadriga was using many of whom froze money and had large sums of quadriga's money at the time it's shut down and crypto capital is definitely part of that story um but also they made this white label exchange software so in retrospect it looks kind of like a very small team of people used white label software to put up an exchange that people perceived to be a legit you know big time exchange but once you sort of peeled back uh that layer of reality you pretty much realized it was just gerald cotton pretty much running it by himself with a couple maybe like a team of like two or three people who were really involved and then he had hired some like customer service reps but these were people who had never met him who were just you know responding to support tickets basically in terms of like power and access to the money it was pretty much just gerald cotton and so earlier you talked about how one of the mysteries is what happened to the money so once he died kind of fill us in from that moment until the discovery that you know most of the money was gone so the the missing sum or the sum that customers had on the exchange at the time it shut down uh was about 215 million dollars canadian um and that was a combination of bitcoin ether uh canadian dollars which they called quad bucks in the uh quadriga system um and maybe a little bit of some other all coins that were traded but it was primarily those three things and you know in terms of the quad bucks it was very difficult to know where they were because there was no information about where jerry had had bank accounts even um so that mystery was kind of all like whoa we don't know anything here but in terms of the bitcoin and ethereum they should have been in a wallet somewhere that someone could pretty easily find and it turned out that people who ran other exchanges or wallets kind of have a good insight into that right because they had interacted with quadriga wallets and so they were able to pretty quickly discern what might be quadriga's cold storage wallets and by hopping from wallet to wallet people were able to sort of map out um some of the major quadriga wallets and very early like honestly if you look on reddit it does not take people very long now those people didn't know for sure but people had the suspicion very early that there was no money in these wallets and in fact that those wallets had been emptied out more than six months before gerald cotton took this honeymoon trip to india that he died on so immediately there was another mystery which was why had these wallets been cleaned out six months earlier and and where was that money now and you know depending on how much we want to spoiler it i can get into a little bit more where that money uh ended up um but early on it was just kind of well it's not here it's not anywhere we can see yeah well so my feeling about this is that probably most of my audience knows this story so i do feel that for anybody who has not listened to exit scam that you should stop the recording or stop thinking hit pause pause and keep your location and then come back binge listen to all the episodes which by the time this comes out that oh yeah they will all be out right yeah yep they'll all be out on odyssey which is a new app that i guess exits kim has partnered with and it's called a-u-d-a-c-y um i think on all the other platforms it's just a week behind yeah so the the last episode comes out on monday and odyssey and then a week from monday if you start binging now you're gonna be timed perfectly to just go right into the ending yes so then you can come back and listen to the rest of the show but i do actually want to get into those details because i do feel like probably most of my audience has been following this for a while i mean one thing that i will have to say when you talk about how quick on reddit people jump to notice that the cold storage um it seemed to have been emptied i remember that that day one of my sources texted me about this and i really think i i should look back at what the message actually says but within like a very brief period like an hour or something you know he was just like i you know i something there's something fishy here and um yeah i'll have to look at exactly what that says but um it's just fascinating how right away everybody kind of picked up that there was something wrong and so what were the other like hints at that time that this may not just be a normal person who randomly died you know uh by accident well this was an interesting thing when i started talking to people people at first were like oh this came out of left field we had no idea then i started talking to some people who were a little bit better plugged in in crypto and people said well actually people had been warning me for several months that i ought to get my coins off of quadriga so this was not a total secret that something was wrong at quadriga and in fact if you go back through the reddit history you can see people saying i can't withdraw from quadriga i put in the withdrawal request two months ago it hasn't been paid out and i'm getting no response wow and this is difficult to parse because you know i want to be fair you can find similar complaints at the coinbase subreddit and coinbase wasn't on the verge of collapse but looking backwards you start to see a pattern where basically they stop paying out withdrawals they're still taking in money but they're not putting out any money and this pattern actually extended for the month after gerald cotton died so after he died quadriga waited a month to announce his death during this month people were still putting krypto we're still putting dollars basically into the system but anyone who tried to withdraw their money wouldn't be able to so you had people putting on money to buy bitcoin trying to immediately withdraw bitcoin and having it frozen on the exchange so i i put a kind of an asterisk when people are like yeah well dumbasses like leaving their money on exchange like they got what they deserved some of these people had no intention to leave their money on the exchange they they simply didn't realize that they were putting money into a slot machine that had already had the power plug pulled from it um and that's even true before gerald cotton died people who thought that they could be on the exchange just to make a trade were unable to get the money off so finally they announced that he is dad and then people kind of rewind through the last year and see a lot of red flags um a lot of indication that quadriga didn't have the money to pay out its withdrawals um and that some of gerald cotton's actions kind of look like a person who was maybe at the end of some kind of a scheme he had told his head of customer service that he was he wanted to retire and give the business over to him um there's just various indications that he didn't see himself being the the person running this exchange uh for the long run which is generally a big red flag with an exchange you don't want to be at an exchange that the person running it is planning to take off sometime soon yeah well especially now i think i think people will be on the lookout for that um so we briefly did cover his co-founder michael patrin but why don't you just explain what happened to the relationship just so it's clear why at this point it was really just about jerry so michael patrick and jerry started quadriga together michael patron's a little older than jerry and um i think he kind of represented himself as the veteran businessman and jerry is the the young wonder kid kind of they actually intended at one point to take quadriga public um they were gonna do it's not actually an ipo it's sort of a reverse takeover where they would get a shell and um anyway in retrospect that seems totally nuts i mean i think they're red i think their revenue at the time was like 22 000 a quarter or something like that and the the plan for whatever reason failed and they had a big fight after this um from what i understand the fight may have been about jerry sort of sabotaging the going public idea but there's some dissent about that about exactly what they were fighting about but both of them agreed that they had a big fight and then mike quit the company and left and the whole board actually took off too mike had kind of installed his own board there so from that point forward for the last two or three years of quadriga it was basically just jerry and that was kind of the last point there was anyone else looking at what was going on and from that point forward you pretty much see jerry starting to leech money and crypto off of the exchange um either into his own pocket or onto other exchanges where he started getting involved in you know march and trading coins and stuff like that but tell us about the chris marquette account so one of the big mysteries had been sort of how jerry managed to get all this money off of the exchange without being detected it turned out that he was creating these fake user accounts in the quadriga system you know one of the great dangers about crypto is that you've got this real system which is the blockchain that's immutable that if you see a coin on the blockchain you know it's real and you know it's someone really possesses it and then you have this quad buck system that only exists as only existed in the cms of quadriga it's just a number right it doesn't literally represent a dollar in the bank account well i i didn't realize that this whole thing would have so many uh tetherish uh undertones to it but i'm not talking about tether right now i'm talking about quadriga so in the case of quadriga one dollar in the quadriga cms could have any relationship to one dollar in a bank account so what gerald started doing was crediting these fake user accounts with large numbers of quad bucks uh i think chris markey was ultimately credited over 500 million dollars worth of quad bucks and then he would use these quad bucks which were backed by nothing and were totally fictional like chris marquez which was the name on these accounts to buy up real cryptocurrency that was held by people on the exchange and he didn't do this selectively he did this industrially he was the largest trader on quadriga um by some estimates he did over 30 of all of the overall trading so this actually had a dual benefit to him not only was he getting people's real crypto with fake dollars he was also boosting the volume of quadriga so early on when quadriga would claim that they had the most volume of any exchange in canada you have to remember that 30 of that volume is the founder trading against his own clients and another thing people saw then was that there was often a premium on um the price of bitcoin on quadriga people would pay more for bitcoin on quadriga and this is something that people were lured into quadra international customers would see this arb opportunity on quadriga so why was the price of bitcoin higher on quadriga because there was always a guy who always had money to buy your bitcoin for more and more and his name was chris markey chris markey was driving a localized kimchi premium it was it was not as extreme as spread as the kimchi premium but you don't need a huge spread to draw new clients in if the if the spread is it's one percent higher on quadriga that's a great incentive if you're anywhere in the world and want to go sell bitcoin and in fact um the one of the biggest internet detectives on this case who who's anonymous qc acts in that's how he ended up having money on quadra he's he's not canadian he's a trader who was seeking out arbitrage opportunities and that was how he ended up having money on quadriga so ironically some of the biggest volume accounts on quadriga weren't actually canadians they were people who wanted to take advantage of this guy who just loved buying everyone's crypto all the time oh okay that makes a lot of sense because when i was listening to the shows like he sounds australian and he's australian oh okay i probably should have explained that but it was like a weird i was like i don't want to dox you but you're pretty obviously australian if we use your voice but well you know i mean he could have immigrated to canada or whatever but anyway okay totally all right so in a moment we're going to talk about gerald cotton's death and i'm going to use air quotes here this is or maybe it should be a question mark alleged death yeah but

around you on tazos back to my conversation with aaron lammer so tell us the circumstances surrounding gerald cotton's death so in the last few months of his life he got married signed a new will that left everything to his new wife and they took a honeymoon trip to india um it was actually a dual honeymoon trip and they had donated money to have this orphanage built in an indian village um so the trip was supposed to take them around india for for a period and then they were supposed to go to the grand opening of this orphanage but before they got there um he landed in jaipur and he started having stomach pains he had crohn's disease and and was being treated for it um they decided it was syria serious enough that he needed to go to the hospital um and he spent the night at the hospital and died the next day um and that was basically going in everything we knew about his death was that it was this sort of sudden tragedy in india and so tell us some of the other facts that came up that you know led people to question whether or not he actually died i think the will was one of the first suspicious things that it was filled out only three days before he took off and that it meant that his wife who had only been married to a few months was going to inherit over 10 million dollars worth of real estate in canada um that alone i think would have set off a fair amount of suspicion but the fact that those cold storage wallets were empty really ramped up the suspicion and there was certainly the question of whether someone could have faked their death in india there is a real industry in india that helps westerners fake their deaths now most of those people are doing insurance fraud it's for different ends than jerry would have but the apparatus was there and realizing that jerry had these dark web connections and had been involved in this kind of shady money laundering underworld stuff um at least for me convinced me that if he had wanted to fake his death he would have had the right tool set uh to do so um that doesn't mean he did we didn't we didn't really early on have much else to go on you know if he did fake his death no one had figured out where he went um we knew that there was this large sum of money missing from quadriga and that was also a relevant piece of evidence was well if he's really is dead then where's all this money where did all the money go right even if you accepted that he had died a natural death you had to account for um you know something like 80 million dollars that was still unaccounted for so all of those factors i think made people suspicious that that he was really dead it seemed like too great a coincidence yeah and there were a few other details where um i so i can't remember uh who this person was but there was somebody in india who was asked to embalm the body and she refused for some reason can you explain that yeah i mean what we know about what happened in india is really just from going and asking each person along the way who encountered jerry's body and the person who was first asked to embalm his body his body had been brought there by two employees of the hotel that he and his wife had been staying at and she felt like this was a non-standard way that a body would come to her embalming uh center her embalming collar i think it's actually a college um and so she refused to embalm the body and she gave you know you you can hear the explanation she gave for it um and then it went to a different embalmers and that embalmer gladly embalmed the body and send it on um i don't think that this is definitive proof that something sketchy happened um but basically you know we wanted to know whether any of this stuff looked unusual um from the perspective of people in india who were actually there when it actually happened and this is kind of the first wrinkle in that story where someone says no actually it was kind of non-standard what happened it did raise my suspicion at the time i will say that a counterpoint is that the person who was the second person who did embalm who did successfully embalm him had a copy of his passport um you know there when someone went and checked and confirmed yes i embalmed him and he was the guy he looked like the person so it's good okay okay okay because there was something in the description where i was like oh it would be so useful if bodies were you know like blockchain based tokens where you could check the provenance because there was something about kind of yeah the the chain of transfer where it did raise questions about whose body was actually being moved um so one of the more intriguing episodes or interviews you did was with this person who investigates people who fake their own debts and i wondered so what were some of the other things that he picked up on um that kind of lent credence to the theory that gerald cotton could have faked his own death well you know one thing that people have said is when there's this much money at stake you you want a body or you want dna and we looked very closely to try to um show that anyone had had confirmed that that this was the right body in the right coffin we thought originally we thought oh like they would have checked it at the airport or when it was coming through customs and we talked to canadian authorities who said well actually if there's no suspicion of foul play or anything unusual you know if it's just a tourist coming back there's nothing in the law that says we're gonna force you to open this coffin and take a fingerprint or a dna test so we were able to find no proof that such a thing had actually happened and for rombam uh stephen rambaum who's the death faking pi you know his tact is that you should just sort of be suspicious of everything and that until someone has proven any of this stuff it merits further investigation and you know certainly in his case he's seen situations where people confirm the death you know whether it's local police or medical um staff and this isn't just in india this is all over the world uh this philippines is a place this happens a lot he talked about a case in mongolia so you know some of the things that are these basic checks that to me are like oh like his doctor his doctor couldn't be lying well you know when you talk to a guy who's an expert in his stuff he's he'll say no no his doctor could be lying you know that that he's actually dealt with a lot of cases uh where this stuff has come up and you know one of the things that was very relevant to him was jerry's past as a scammer and the fact that he had an organized life history of these kind of deceptions and they follow a pattern gets a bunch of people to give him money uh he makes excuses and then he disappeared and this fit into that pattern so it's a little bit like you know if someone who is a suspect in a murder you find out that 20 years ago they were accused of a similar murder that's not in any way grounds that convict them but it is kind of the point where you're like yeah we really would like that dna confirmation you know yeah and some of the other things that fascinated me was he described how somebody who had the kind of like means and skills that gerald cotton had could have faked their own death and truly be alive now when he talked about how because jerry knew how to fly his own planes and those wouldn't necessarily have to go through the normal kind of like border control or customs or whatever it might be um or even his sailing capabilities that all those things would enable him to kind of live out life on the rest of the planet without encountering the kind of authorities who might um pull them in for questioning so can you is there anything more to add other than those details i mentioned i would say not to mention his deep experience with vpns and tor and uh cloaking his where he was online uh an ability to move funds across bank accounts and crypto accounts i mean look the hardest thing about faking your death from what i understand and i'm not talking specifically about jerry this is just i learned a lot about people who successfully faked their death is you need a new identity set up somewhere else and it's got to be all waiting for you if you're trying to set this up after you've faked your death you're in trouble so you need a passport you need a place to stay you need a local bank account that is already funded with money and all this is the kind of stuff that jerry was really experienced with it you know moving money across international borders you're right private airports are great for that did he stash money at casinos we know that he frequented international casinos one of the things i learned that is a way to stash some money in another country is to go to the casino and deposit a lot of money and then get back a claim ticket that you have money sitting at the casino all of these techniques would be useful to someone who wanted to start a new life somewhere else that had no connection to his old life um certainly privacy coins would be something i would think about in that situation and we know that that gerald was interested in privacy coins and was actually a big z cash holder at one point um so again these are all skills that rather than actual evidence that he is living a new life but when you really think about it there's not that many people who have all of these skills who could even try something like this um you know he was an early bitcoin holder during the silk road era while one of the big things sold on on silk road and a lot of dark nets is fake passports fake identification um all these things would have been useful if he if he did decide that he was going to do something like this i think the flip side of all this is that quadriga was almost out of money and so he was on the verge of being revealed you know at a certain point people weren't just going to post on reddit about how they hadn't got their withdrawal people were going to do something about it so there was kind of a perfect storm of pressure coming down on him that he needed to do something he needed to get out of the situation he was in because you know if you just look at the course of 2018 there's the big market crash that pretty much wipes out almost all the money that he's been gambling uh on behalf of his customers and people start pulling their money off their off of the exchange so a bear market and a crash are very bad for someone running a fractional reserve ponzi as soon as more people are pulling out than they're putting in you're in trouble as long as there's a bull market you're kind of fine you can just assume more people are going to want to buy that are going to want to withdraw but as the the ocean started to pull back there i think he would have found himself uh quite exposed and in fact he actually funded money back into quadriga in the last few months so money he had already embezzled out he started funding back into the exchange simply so that it could pay out some of these withdrawals and where was that coming from was that that's it i believe also in the ontario securities exchange report so they basically have a sum of all of the money that he took off the exchange and then they show actually some money came back in about 10 million over the last few months he was alive and i know he was also really waiting for the cibc to unfro they had about 26 million dollars worth of the money frozen in bank accounts and he was eagerly awaiting that money getting unfrozen so he could use it to pay out withdrawals and it actually got unfrozen just before he died like a couple days before he died so if the private investigator who investigates people who have faked their death once he kind of looked at all the evidence did he say what he really thought that you know like where where would he put the odds that jerry's alive or dead you know i mean uh he he thought it was very suspicious i believe all the the phrase he used is every red flag uh you can raise he's managed to raise that red flag now whether that means the red flag of he faked his death or the red flag of this merits investigation i i think that's ambiguous he never gave me like a percentage chance that he was alive or dead he looked at it more like you know as an insurance investigator you either investigate or you don't investigate you know when someone files a claim he's like oh this one this is the one that you send the a-team on this is the one you really really want to look into um and you know when i interviewed him it was actually only probably closer to a year after this happened and now it's two and a half years which you know the longer it goes without something happening that also could be seen as as some form of evidence you know the longer jerry goes without getting caught you know i do think that there's a very realistic chance that that he is really dead um and if that's true um and this is kind of the conclusion of the show so double spoiler alert if you're still listening my view is that he was performing an exit scam either way that we we basically factually know that he had taken a lot of money out of quadriga and was planning to try to escape the consequences of doing so whether that was by faking his death or he happened to be in the middle of that and he suffered this bizarre tragic natural accidental death um in both cases i think his motivation was actually kind of the same i mean it's almost like him dying in the middle of it is even greater coincidence or even more improbable it's a bit like if bernie madoff had had a heart attack the night before they busted in his office and arrested him um again i think people would have probably never accepted that that really happened uh just like people will probably never accept that epstein died by suicide or you know a lot of these other come on this coincidence is too crazy kind of stories yeah well yeah i mean this gets really dark but i did think well if he really did die it could be because he obtained some substance that enabled him to get ill in such a way that it would look like he died of you know the causes that the doctor said that is something we like looked into i mean murder or poisoning by murder or suicide is something we considered and i also considered the fact that someone who had just committed one of the biggest crimes in canadian financial history has existing health problems and is 200 million dollars in debt that's not healthy it could give you an ulcer um believing that people were on your trail so um yeah although um it was that it was something like his body had gone into sepsis like he had he had some infection and that caused heart attacks and then he died from that wasn't that the i mean technically he died of cardiac arrest but his death was consistent with complications from crohn's disease he had a perforation in his intestine oh and which later caused him to go into cardiac arrest so from what i've heard from talking to doctors his death was at least as documented by his doctors was consistent with a way a 30 year old could die of crohn's disease it is unusual for a 30 year old to die of crohn's disease but it is possible and you know we actually have some information that he had had previous medical breakdowns that had required intervention so he you know he would have been aware that that he had a troublesome health situation well okay yeah it's just with the timing you know shortly after as well it um so you know a lot of the customers of quadriga did ask that the body be exhumed and it looks like that's not gonna happen which is surprising so can you talk a little bit about that situation yeah so there's a group of creditors who are represented by lawyers and they have their lawyers basically send a letter to the rcmp uh requesting that they exhume gerald's body and do dna testing to prove that whatever is in his coffin is really him um and the crypto press picked up on this as if it was like a sure thing they're like they're digging him up um which it it turns out was a little bit premature because the royal canadian mounted police have no obligation to listen to a letter of this kind it has no real legal stature it's like if i uh sent you a letter that said i i want you to have this guest on uh on on your podcast you could consider it but you don't have to do it um and in fact from what i understand the royal canadian mounted police are kind of loath to investigate this case any further in terms of him faking his death period they believe from what i've been told that he is really dead they're satisfied it's possible that they have information that i don't have that proves he's dead that's a real possibility that that we've always sort of had out there is maybe the reason law enforcement doesn't want to dig him up or investigate this further is they actually know something that we don't know um but from what i understand the chances of that body getting exhumed are very low um people have put it as below one percent to me so while it would help me finish my story uh it doesn't look like it's happening yeah i have to say frankly their decision does boggle the mind at least in my opinion but you're right maybe they know something we don't know um but there's we're just gonna run through all the spoilers because one of the more intriguing episodes was the one you did on jennifer robertson gerald cotton's wife slash widow and there were a couple of things after she returned back from india that i found really suspicious notable um but one of them was about how his desk had been cleaned up while they were in india can you talk about that and i almost didn't even really know what what the show was kind of implying there so what was the significance of that well i don't mean to imply anything specifically other than the facts so i'll i'll run through the facts which are that after jerry died in india before jen returned to their house with the coffin a group of people were in the house jerry's parents uh and i believe his brother and his sister-in-law and when jen got back everyone wanted to look for this password because at this point they were still believed that there was 215 million dollars in these cold storage wallets so they tore the house upside down like they cut open furniture even basically trying to find anywhere that jerry might have uh left this password and one of the biggest beliefs was that maybe it was in jerry's safe because he had a safe in his house and he had espoused the use of paper wallets repeatedly he said the best way to keep your private keys is with paper wallets i use paper wallets and i have the safe in my house where i keep my valuables occam's razor was if these passwords are anywhere as paper wallets they're probably in the safe so this safe was in his attic and it was uh bolted to the rafters so basically when the first time anyone from the outside what came into the house these are our things they said they said that jerry's office which had a reputation of being messy and full of papers had been cleaned up and it appeared that things had that had previously been inside it were gone and the safe which had previously been bolted to the attic was found on the floor of his home office and it was open and it was empty but we i i don't understand because um doesn't that mean that the family could have gone through all those things and right so that's right yes but is that suspicious i don't i i don't feel like i'm connecting all the time well if there was a password written down anyone who was in the house um which is a small list of people could have ended up with that password before investigators were on the scene um i i offer that uh with with no um specific implication um but you know when people say so it was believed that gerald had a personal cryptocurrency stash which is referred to as his nest egg we know that he was a pre-sale ethereum buyer um he had a large amount of personal ethereum he was friendly with vitalik actually you know he was working out of uh decentral toronto at the same time as uh ethereum was getting off the ground there so my only implication in bringing up the home office and his safe was that while people were looking for this stuff um they could have found private keys to wallets that contained cryptocurrency and it's unclear if they did whether they would have disclosed that to anyone this was before anyone was investigating this was before anyone knew gerald was dead so these are all things that happened in the period between when he died and when anyone from the public knew that he was dead and if he did die i think it does merit investigation what happened to this private cryptocurrency stash and where could have the private keys been and who could have gotten them and that nest egg has still never been found and i couldn't tell you how large it is uh what's inside it or or where it is never been seen again okay yeah and one other piece i didn't quite know what to do with was how apparently jennifer and adria khan's family of origin are no longer on speaking terms what was your read on that it's difficult to read i mean you know at the time that they stopped speaking together as far as i knew jen at that point stood to inherit millions of dollars from this well and his parents stood to get nothing from the well so that could have been a reason for conflict between the two of them i don't know i haven't been able to speak to them i mean jerry's parents haven't said anything since he died so we have very very little insight there but i would say in a larger sense that even if you believe that jerry really did die of natural causes when you look at who was left behind they had sort of competing objectives right you have alex hayden who was jerry's uh lead programmer um that's the most crypto knowledgeable person the person who had the best chance to know what was really going on at quadriga and then you've got his widow jan who initially stood to inherit a lot of money and then had all that money seized and you have the creditors you have his parents and each one of these people has slightly different objectives and a slightly different view of what should happen um and so i kind of take everything that all of them say with a grain of salt um in terms of what were people's agenda and and more specifically how much did they really know about what jerry had been up to you know it's very easy to look negatively at his wife and say well she didn't she didn't tell people for a month he was dead that's that's shady that's sketchy but we ought to look and say well who who gave her that advice and what did she know at the time there's the possibility that she knew almost nothing about what jerry was up to she just thought she was married to a like successful crypto dude who was rich and was going to take care of her no matter what so in a lot of these things i i feel like you kind of have to take them at face value and say well we really don't know it's a really big difference whether you read this as her true you know belief which is that she didn't know anything or you think she's hiding something and we tried to consider it you know in both ways first update us kind of on her financial situation because what jerry put in as well is not exactly what happened um but then also yeah tell us a little bit about the different theories about you know whether she was in on it or or what and any other theories you have about her so after the fifth monitors report came out from ernst young they pretty clearly showed that all of the stuff that jen had inherited from jerry had been purchased directly with embezzled funds so jerry was taking this customer crypto and sending it to otc brokers who were cashing him out transferring the money that he was directly using to buy houses buy a plane by a boat that's that's all the stuff jen inherited so she voluntarily actually entered into a settlement with quadriga's creditors in which she gave everything back she was allowed to keep i believe 90 000 in her checking account her 2015 jeep cherokee and her wedding ring and everything else went back to quadrica's creditors and actually those houses have mostly i think been sold now jerry and jen's house was like on a canadian real estate website if you ever want to take a uh virtual real estate tour of it i think it's still up there so um you know she lost everything you know she was very very briefly rich and then and then went back to having um you know the same life she had before she met jerry i guess you could say um and as far as we know she's living in halifax she's back on social media um i believe she's started to date again um and it seems like she's moving on with her life you know it doesn't it doesn't seem like she's still kind of in this realm um and what you read from that i think you know kind of depends on on what what you think happened um but i do think i think it's very possible that she is telling the truth and that she really didn't know what her husband was up to and did get hit with a shocking secret um that she dealt with as best she could um which was that her husband was an epic fraud one of one of the biggest frauds there was out there and i do think it's somewhat credible that she could have not known that you know particularly with something like crypto i think it's very easy to be like yeah i don't know what he's doing we're rich like let's not ask too many questions and the ironic part in all that is that jerry could have been rich without stealing from people he was into bitcoin in 2014 he was an ethereum pre-sale buyer and he ran an exchange any one of those things is plenty to make you rich with jerry i came to believe that we were really dealing with someone who was addicted to scamming addicted to ripping people off that it was not really just about the money because by my count he had a lot of money already when he was stealing from people you know um maybe it's a form of gambling addiction um i it depends what you want to call it but it definitely seems to me like this stuff that he was engaged in went beyond simply trying to get money and into the realm of sort of scamming for sport um and it was an escalating thing too you know where he went from doing these very like low-level internet high-yield investment schemes to he gets involved in bitcoin and all of a sudden the stakes go up a thousand-fold you're not stealing 100 000 bucks you're stealing a couple hundred million bucks um and i think it looks like he got in over his head you know well yeah there i think one of the probably most memorable moments is at the end jennifer connects with michael patrin and um why don't you tell that story um but that for me was just like wow i uh i feel like uh this is one story maybe i'll hold this story time i feel like it's better to be a spoiler okay i feel like it's better well i feel like it's better if you kind of get it in context of of what was happening when like most of the story takes place in like the one month after he dies that story i think is best uh left to the end but you know i will say i'll give a different spoiler actually which is jen's writing a book she's writing a tell-all uh a memoir about her experiences and that in addition to the story that you just referenced are in my opinion evidence that that maybe she's telling the truth and mary maybe jerry really is dead because otherwise you have to believe that she's writing a book um about a lie that could potentially you know get her in a lot of trouble and that feels like pretty hubrisy to me so when i looked into jerry all i found was sketchiness and scams looking into to jen and what's happened to her in the last year i have some trouble believing that she's really um keeping this this horrible secret that that could you know fall apart at any moment but again you know i leave it to everyone to to come to their own conclusions about it if personally my conclusion has veered back and forth many times in the two years i've been working on the show and i still wouldn't say i'm confident at all in my conclusions well i was gonna that was gonna be my last question to you like you know what do you really think happened but do you feel you have an answer for that i feel like i set out to figure out what happened to jerry and what happened to the money and i feel satisfied now that i know what happened to the money and that's an easier thing to know because there's a record on the blockchain of where a lot of the money went in terms of gerald cotton himself i don't feel like we were able to definitively prove that he's alive um in order to do so i i think i would have to find him alive i'd have to find him on a beach somewhere or find definitive evidence that he's out there doing stuff and to prove that he was dead at this point i think that exhumation would have to happen or someone would have to reveal something that law enforcement knows that i don't in order to do it so in terms of proving either way i i don't think that that that proof exists i think without the power of law enforcement it'll be difficult to achieve that proof um well but if you had to bet your favorite crypto which way which way would you vet the longer it gets away from what happened and he doesn't show up somewhere and get caught i think slowly i inch towards thinking that there's a good chance he's really dead um but short of an exclamation i am still always i wake up in the night sometimes thinking about this and i think of a different way that he could have tricked me or um you know manipulated reality so i still believe both could be true i i i i'm always going to believe that on some level even if what it would have taken to pull this off was totally grandiose um gerald cotton does seem sometimes like he is the kind of person who could have done something like that so um i'll i'll hold off on my final judgment until i see proof one direction or the other all right okay well this has been super fun talking with you about your journey where can people learn more about you and exit scam uh you can find out
