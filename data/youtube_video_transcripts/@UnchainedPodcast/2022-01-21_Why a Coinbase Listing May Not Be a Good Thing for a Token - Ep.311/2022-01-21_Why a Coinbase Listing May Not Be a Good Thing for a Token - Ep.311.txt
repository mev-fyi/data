years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the january 21 2022 episode of unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code laura link in the description today's guest is fasil khan author of the startups and econ newsletter welcome fazil hey laura thanks for having me you wrote a well i'll call it insightful another word might be biting analysis on your sub stack of the connections between vcs and altcoins and it was titled how vcs sell crypto to retail and it was subtitled the one where mark andreessen blocks me what was your newsletter about my main goal here was to dig into whether investors benefit from investing in coinbase or in coins on coinbase i think most users on coinbase are retail investors they're not super sophisticated so they might not be looking at things the way like an advanced crypto trader might i think most advanced crypto traders are not on there um and so what i wanted to see was how do coins perform after they're listed which is when most retail gets access to it and how do they perform against what i would call like the main benchmarks bitcoin and ethereum and what were your findings basically it looks like most of the return for coins other than bitcoin ethereum comes before it's listed on coinbase uh and then after that most of them tend to do worse than either of those coins and those returns actually got worse over time uh so there's kind of a pop at the beginning uh which i think missouri and some of these other research places called the coinbase effects but no one's really shown like long term what happens to these coins and so if you look over any timeline like six months 12 months two years three years they're getting worse as time goes by yeah the the framing that you put at the beginning that i found interesting was marc andreessen actually has a seat on coinbase's board of directors meanwhile coinbase lists his coins to the public isn't that a conflict of interest so before we actually get to that because i think there was toward the end i actually was surprised by some of your conclusions you eventually found that these vc backed coins did the worst can you give us some examples of you know what the findings were especially also compared to bitcoin and ethereum yeah so i was talking about coinbase listings in general but then it got really interesting when i looked at a16z there's a couple of different explanations for why things might do worse after they're listed on coinbase but one of the things i was interested in is is it because insiders start selling and so a16z probably has had the most uh listed on uh coinbase since then and their coins i think the average coinbase listing had underperformed bitcoin by eight percent and for a16z it was like you know 22 so it was uh significantly worse and when you go over 12 months they were underperforming bitcoin by like 55 so it was definitely material and if you look at uh the coins that coinbase didn't list which is kind of a really interesting uh thought experiment uh those coins kept going up uh and especially the a16 z coins there are a couple like r weave uh and uh i'm trying to remember the other one uh they had one more coin where both of those had 10x uh after coinbase rejected them which uh it's hard to come up with another explanation other than like that insiders were selling after the listing yeah i just wonder so do you feel like that is likely the reason then or i think there's one other alternative explanation and it's probably more favorable to coinbase which is that if coinbase is like the most uh liquid and well-run exchange then there isn't going to be wash trading there's better market surveillance and so some of these coins when they're only listed on like pancake swap or some other tiny exchange they might be very easy to manipulate but then once they're on coinbase they're much harder to manipulate okay yeah although i don't think pam's pancake swap is tiny necessarily but still i get your point and then talk a little bit more about the comparison between those coins you know the ones that are vc backed versus the ones that are not and and how they perform against bitcoin and ethereum yeah so the ones that were vc backed so like the a16z those also like you know they underperformed ethereum and bitcoin by quite a bit but even uh just looking at like what percentage of coins so basically if you look at a16z's uh listings every single one of them has underperformed ethereum since listing so it's not even like uh you have one coin that did really badly and that's bringing down the average like this is pretty consistent across the board where the a16z backed coins are doing worse than the then the rest of the listings and if you look at coinbase ventures and a16z together they do even worse so that was a kind of an interesting finding that was only five tokens but all five of them have had uh like major uh negative returns and and those are yeah the ones that had been backed by both one thing that i found interesting about this comparison to the performance of eth in particular was you know at first my thought was because as you note the older the coin the worse the performance and so i kind of was like oh it could just be that older coins either you know get have grow more slowly as they get bigger so therefore the price appreciation is less than for a newer coin or it could even just be that those older coins are of poorer quality because they you know are older technology what's your take on those theories uh i think that would be a good explanation if you didn't have the non-listing trend so if you look at the coinbase especially if you zoom in on like 2020 so coinbase uh debuted 13 coins uh and rejected 18 coins so it's a pretty big sample and all the debuts averaged to uh 200 return in dollar terms but lost to bitcoin by three percent and ethereum price over 60 but the rejects like the ones coinbase didn't reject 18 different tokens they averaged out to 1800 so nine times the return in usd terms and 300 in bitcoin terms so way way outperforming uh when you're just looking at i think that's a good time frame too like a year and a half like there hasn't been enough time for that to say like oh this is like you know some ancient coin that nobody cares about and so there was a point in your analysis where you said that the fact that the a16z backed coins that are listed on coinbase have worse results than coinbase's overall listings you said this to me smells of insider selling um but then at another point in our interview you kind of said like it may not be that so what is what kind of what is your theory about what actually is happening here i think it's probably both i think insiders are probably selling we don't know if it's a16z or uh if it's the employees i think you know if they gave us a little more transparency then we could let them off the hook but you can see this trend actually scott galloway did a blog post a couple days ago and did a chart of insider ownership versus uh the year and if you look at all the coins that were launching in like 2016 2017 that had less vc backing you know the team might take 10 uh something like that and now they're taking 20 25 for the team and 20 25 for the vcs and they're basically going up to 50 in all of these like major coins that have come out in the last few years like flow avalanche internet computer and some of those are great examples of of coins that did like really badly after listing like internet computers lost uh like 90 of its value even in dollar terms i think yeah yeah there's i i know there's a lot of chatter about what is happening with that coin which is uh related to the dfinity project okay so in a moment we're going to look at some other factors that facile analyzed in his piece but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 million people using crypto.com the easiest place to buy earn and spend over 150 cryptocurrencies spend your

the code laura link in the description back to my conversation with facil so another interesting analysis that you made was at how quickly the coinbase backed coins had been listed on coinbase versus when they were listed on binance what were your findings there looking at well one thing i found was that coinbase seemed to list its own coins at a smaller market cap uh so the average market cap was sub 1 billion um versus you know the average uh non coinbase backed coin tended to be a bit bigger and so that got me thinking that you know are they being more aggressive with their own investments and there were a number of examples where coinbase you know usually lists after binance because binance is like the more aggressive uh exchange especially in terms of regulatory terms but for a number of their own investments they uh coinbase had listed it first and there's a few coins that actually binance has never listed and i think the majority of them are backed by either a16z or coinbase um so there's a number of ways you could explain that i guess you know probably once they make an investment the team start talking you know start looking at when could they potentially list in some cases actually got really interesting there were coins uh where they started evaluating whether to list them more than 18 months or sometimes even two years before the token started trading so it was like way way ahead of the potential of any trading uh and a lot of those became uh what i call day one listings where coinbase listed them from the first day that you could trade them anywhere and actually i'm thinking about putting this into a part two uh some of those day one listings have also uh performed pretty badly wow okay yeah i um find some of what you were saying really fascinating because you know you would imagine like obviously a16z has amassed this huge crypto regulatory team and so you would imagine that any coins that they had backed would be kind of like really in that sort of straight and narrow or maybe not all of them literally but you know what i'm saying they would tend to be more in that camp and so it's kind of strange that some of those are not even listed by finance and then coinbase has listed those so one other thing that i wanted to ask about was you know just in general there's been this big debate in crypto and it's kind of really stretched on for a few years because i would say in 2020 it started with the vc coins versus fair launch coins argument and then this year it sort of morphed into this like web 3 slash vc backed coins versus maybe like bitcoin uh or even maybe ether i guess because that wasn't vc backed but after your analysis where do you stand on this side of the debate i mean i'm all for experimentation and you know pushing the boundaries of what we can do with technology but i think if you're going to be creating this kind of perfect machine uh for you to print money which is kind of what uh a16z and coinbase have done where a16z can create a great halo effect before the listing and then coinbase creates liquidity uh then i think you have a lot of responsibility to be transparent about you know what you own when you owned it and just be more forthcoming in that regard in general i think there's definitely uh a lot more web three projects than we need out there but that's probably true of any startup uh kind of industry uh whether that is you know like ride sharing startups or home shake startups so there's definitely going to be tons of failures the question is are they securities should they be available to the public how much information should there be for people to evaluate because i think a lot of people just get on coinbase they look at the chart for the last month or whatever and if it's going up they buy some and they really don't uh think much past that so something um that i also found interesting you know you actually say at the end after you do this huge analysis that kind of casts some suspicion on any activity between uh a16z and coinbase you actually conclude that you don't think there's anything nefarious going on at either company so why not uh they do make some efforts to be transparent they used to say all the coins that they were evaluating which i think was an effort at transparency to you know show their listing process because they were criticized for that back in 2018 when they listed like a16g coins that no one was really using and then they said that they have like you know strict internal processes and things like that so i don't think they're lying when they say that the question is like you know if we think about google or goldman would we trust their financial statements if no one was auditing them like maybe but i would guess that out of 500 you know companies in s p 500 i would bet that you know at least 10 percent would start cheating if there wasn't an auditor uh and i think we have the same situation and crypto it's almost too tempting you know what i mean like you can invest in a startup and you know list it on your exchange six months later and get almost immediate liquidity and just keep cycling that money into you know greater and greater returns so you kind of touched on this a little bit but at the end of your newsletter you do have suggestions for regulatory solutions to this situation talk about those ideas yeah yeah i think earlier you mentioned uh what i think about web3 and i will what i will say is that i think a16z has done a lot in trying to suggest rules now like the industry should have a self-regulatory body uh and other potential policies i definitely think that's a bit of the fox guarding the chicken group kind of a situation uh so i think anyone uh you know involved or a regulator uh should be definitely more cautious about listening to their advice i think like some of the common sense things that would make sense here is like uh 13d is a regulation where if you own more than five percent of uh a company's stock then you have to disclose that uh i think you know something similar should be in place for you know tokens because it's available to retail investors the same way a public you know public market securities so we should have kind of similar similar rules around that i think something else that would make a lot of sense is i think everyone's talked about this to be honest but more clarity around like utility coins and governance tokens i think matt levine had a newsletter today where he just like jokingly called them securities over and over and said they're only not securities because you get to people say they're not securities and i think that's almost shocking that the sec has to my knowledge not said anything about governance tokens because i can't imagine that there isn't some concern about the how failing the howie test oh so i think those are a couple areas that are pretty important uh and then accredited investor rules like yes i think the web 3 people are right that everyone should get to participate uh in the startup ecosystem but that doesn't just mean like you know a free-for-all where everyone can buy the coins that you said are they're gonna change the world just because you say they do where you can fundraise just because you wrote up a white paper yeah you paid someone else to write a white paper actually um so obviously i'm you know sure my listeners know that i'm a journalist and so nothing on the show is investment advice but i just wondered you know now that you have done this analysis do you have kind of a sense of like a different way that you'll be approaching when you uh buy tokens or if if you're going to even continue doing that that's a good question i mean i think if you want to play around on coinbase i think it's probably when something lists uh there's probably an opportunity to day trade uh and i think you know that's probably also another thing factoring into the returns is that people are looking at dollar returns and you know selling whenever they have a five percent loss the way a day trader does oh so that's one way to do it as a u.s citizen i don't have access to a lot of other coins anymore since most exchanges have cut me off but i'll definitely take a closer look at circulating supply and token release schedules i was actually shocked that some of the tokens that are getting listed they're getting listed when only four percent or five percent of the supply is circulating which means you know 25 to 20 times more supply is going to come online in the next three five whatever years like that's such a formula for losing money and uh i i never imagined to be honest that you could get listed uh on a reputable exchange with that low uh a circulating supply and that much dilution coming but there's actually quite a few examples yeah yeah no as you know i or maybe you don't know but i just finished a book about the 2017 ico craze and um yes people who read the book will learn a lot more about that kind of thing i'm very excited to read your book especially about my old employer consensus oh well yes joe lubin is a co-founder of ethereum so he is definitely a character in the book okay well this has been a super fun discussion thank you so much for coming on the show where can people learn more about you and your work uh you can check out my sub stack it's called uh startups and econ so startupsmecon.substance.com great all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained yeah it was awesome thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the fed drops its cbdc report the federal reserve released its long-anticipated white paper on central bank digital currencies on thursday explaining the fed's current views plus requesting feedback on questions regarding the privacy financial stability and usage of a potential cbdc the fed did not commit to issuing a cbdc or digital dollar the federal reserve would only pursue a cbdc in the context of broad public and cross-governmental support wrote the fed adding the federal reserve does not intend to proceed with issuance of a cbdc without clear support from the executive branch and from congress ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law interestingly the paper did discuss what a potential cbdc would look like a potential u.s cbdc if one war created would best serve the needs of the united states by being privacy protected intermediated widely transferable and identity verified notably the fed's definition did not mention either crypto or distributed ledger technology in its definition of a cbdc in fact in the 40-page report about issuing a cbdc the fed only mentioned crypto 13 times and stable coins 17 times when it did discuss crypto the analysis was biting cryptocurrencies have not been widely adopted as a means of payment in the united states they remain subject to extreme price volatility are difficult to use without service providers and have severe limitations on transaction throughput many cryptocurrencies also come with a significant energy footprint and make consumers vulnerable to loss theft and fraud the fed was also tough on stable coins calling for congress to promptly enact legislation in related news on wednesday two fdic insured banks nbh bank and new york community bank conducted the first usdf transaction usdf is a staple coin created by a group of fdic insured banks in the u.s including synovus new york community bank and sterling national bank the 48th 45th and 77th largest banks in the us by assets the stablecoin operates on the providence blockchain and is redeemable for cash at a one-to-one ratio at any of the member groups as of now the fdic has not confirmed whether usdf would qualify for pass-through insurance which would protect holders against losses up to 250 000 russia arrests members of reville ransomware group authorities in russia announced the

the u.s government says who was behind the colonial pipeline attack and the government also seized roughly 6.8 million dollars in currency including crypto according to a press release the fsb said its actions came at the appeal of u.s authorities in november cnn reported that attorney general merrick garland estimated that rival ransomware had been deployed in an estimated 175 000 computers worldwide and caused at least 200 million dollars in ransom payments to be made of that 200 million dollars at least 15 million dollars in ransom payments has been confirmed to be received via bitcoin after rivals successful attacks on colonial pipeline which paid out roughly 4.4 million dollars and to the meatpacker jbs which paid out 11 million in related news russia's central bank believes that the country should ban cryptocurrency activities according to a report presented by the director of the bank of russia's financial stability department on thursday it suggests that an optimal solution for russia would be to ban crypto mining and that new laws and regulations are needed to shut down crypto related activities interestingly the report did not suggest banning ownership of crypto the world's 21st largest city intends to add crypto to its balance sheet eduardo piez the mayor of rio de janeiro announced last week that the city plans to convert part of its treasury into crypto we are going to launch crypto rio and invest one percent of the treasury in cryptocurrency said paella's at rio innovation week rio de janeiro also has plans to offer tax breaks for citizens who pay in

janeiro aspire to do buy bitcoin according to bloomberg el salvador's bitcoin trades which seem to come directly from president naive buchelli's personal device appear to be down roughly 14 based on the timing of buchelli's purchase announcements an analyst for moody's described el salvador's btc trading to bloomberg as quite risky particularly for a government that has been struggling with liquidity pressure in the past the analyst also noted that el salvador's holdings of 1139 btc does not pose a significant threat to its debt obligations however increased buying could induce greater risk to repayment capacity remarked to the analyst notably el salvador faces an 800 million dollar bond that matures in january 2023 moody's already downgraded el salvador to a rating of caa1 which judges el salvador's bond to be a very high credit risk when investing.com posted on twitter that moody had downgraded el salvador's debt due to bitcoin trades naive buchelli replied breaking el salvador d-g-a-f i'm sure you all can figure out what that means judge rules ripple can gain access to sec communication ripple won a battle against the securities and exchange commission last week when a federal judge granted them access to emails regarding former sec director of corporation finance william hinman's 2018 speech in which he said putting aside the fundraising that accompany the creation of ether based on my understanding of the present state of ether the ethereum network and its decentralized structure current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions with a decision the sec cannot claim that emails about hindman's speech are privileged meaning ripple will have access to communications from valerie steponic the sec's cryptozar and other regulators discussing the wording of the speech notably the federal judge's reasoning was that she felt the speech concerned hinman's personal views rather than sec policy although hinman and the sec admit that agency staff discussed his speech it appears that this speech was merely peripheral to actual policy formation and not an essential link in the sec's deliberative process with respect to ether accordingly emails concerning the speech or draft versions are neither pre-decisional nor deliberative agency documents entitled to protection speaking of regulation per bloomberg sec chair gary gensler said this week that crypto exchanges should expect stricter scrutiny in 2022 i've asked staff to look at every way to get these platforms inside the investor protection remit if the trading platforms don't come into the regulated space it'd be another year of the public being vulnerable the sec chair reportedly said in a virtual conference on wednesday omg d5 2.0 takes a hit ohm the native token of olympus dow crashed to an all-time low of 98.35 cents on monday marking a 91 percent decline from its all-time high in april 2021. according to d philama olympus dow's total value locked has al also plunged by over 1 billion dollars since december 1st olympus dow is a decentralized reserve currency protocol each ohm token is backed by a basket of assets like dye or fracs in the olympus treasury giving each token a baseline value below which it should not fall essentially the purpose of ohm is to act as a store of value not tied to the usd ohm tokens are generated when users bond other cryptos such as die fracs or wbtc to the olympus dow treasury this allows olympus dow to own its liquidity olympus dow also allows om holders to stake own tokens in return for more ohm tokens ohm has often traded for above the treasury of olympus dow allowing for olympus dow to print more ohm via staking rewards aka high apy to dilute the value of ohm back to the value of its treasury this has created a virtuous cycle in the past as users stake ohm to earn more ohm which they then stick again however when users stop staking their own and cash out the price of om can be wiped out quickly as happened sunday night according to crypto reporter colin wu etherscan shows a sushi swap transaction in which roughly 10 million dollars in ohm was traded for dye causing 25 slippage on ohm trades and over 5 million dollars in liquidations since the initial sell-off om has yet to recover with the token price sitting under 120 thursday morning down 46 from seven days

this week the dao tweeted their plans for the book which included produce an animated series based on it and support community projects i guess no one told them that buying a copy of a book does not give them the copy right to it i have genuinely spent 10 minutes staring at this but no it really does appear to be true that a bunch of crypto pros just spent 2.6 million euros 100x the asking price for a book at auction in the mistaken belief that they would therefore own the copyright in it wrote garybrannon on twitter alright thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about fazil and
