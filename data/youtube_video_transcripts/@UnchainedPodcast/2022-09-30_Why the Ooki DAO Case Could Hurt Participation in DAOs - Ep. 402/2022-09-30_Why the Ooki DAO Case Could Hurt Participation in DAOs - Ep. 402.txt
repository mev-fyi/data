having me one quick note everyone Nick is at the Circle converge conference so if you hear background noise it's because he was not able to find a more private place to record so Nick over the last week we have seen the crypto industry surprised by and kind of up in arms about an enforcement action by the Commodities Futures Trading commission which actually historically has been seen as uh you know an agency that's been pretty favorable to the industry what happened with this enforcement action Yeah so basically in the middle of September the commodity Futures Trading commission announced that it had settled charges with a company called b0x and his Founders on allegations that they were running a unregistered Futures commission Merchant meaning they were offering leverage trades and margin trades and did not go through the usual process in the US to do so and that's all well and good but they announced at the same time that they were also filing charges against ukidao which was the successor to b0x and the allegations are the same that ukidao was supporting the listing and trading of unregistered margined leverage trades but what's really kind of got the industry up in arms is that the cftc decided okay well you know a dow is an unincorporated association so this is an entity that we can charge and we're going to charge People based on whether or not they voted in the governance process of the Dow and yeah the question is is that a reasonable way to approach it and you know many in the industry believe that that is you know kind of overreaching or without precedent one other issue that I wanted to ask about was that the cftc's complaint mentions at various times that the Uki slash bzx Founders advertised that the doubt was a way of kind of putting the protocol beyond the reach of regulators or they would advertise that the protocol did not require people to undergo know your customer or anti-money laundering checks I was wondering how much you thought that that played a role in the enforcement action meaning if we were to take a different D5 protocol that's governed by a dow like compound or Ave obviously those probably weren't advertised in that fashion so do you think that that was really kind of what tipped it over the edge or do you think this would just apply to any defy Dao I I think that those specific arguments were kind of a you know on top of this we're gonna you know note the you know these things that the founder said I don't think necessarily that the at least the claim that putting in the Dow would bring it beyond the reach of regulators I don't think that was necessarily a factor I think it was just kind of yes or the cfdc saying hey look at that you're wrong the kyc aspect is on the other hand you know absolutely one of the charges it's a key thing for the cmtc the SEC money transmitter laws it's a core tenant of the US is that if you're offering Financial products you have to conduct kyc and any company that doesn't is probably going to face similar charges if they're offering these kinds of services so that I think was a definitely a factor it was a kind of low hanging fruit the fact that the founders decided to advertise this as a benefit I imagine got you know the cfdc's ears and uh you know they were like huh that seems very odd that's definitely not important as far as other Dows you know I think what kind of strikes me about this particular Dow is that it was very explicitly created to offer the same you know unregistered products that easy uh v0x was offering and so just by participating you're kind of voluntarily opted into this thing that is again the whole idea is to violate the law and offer these things that the founders clearly knew or appear to know that this was not how they should have done it so I think the cfdc just kind of looked it as you know this really low-hanging fruit it was a very easy example for them to go after and it might not lead to a great precedent for the industry but it's not you know I struggle to see what else the cfdc really could have done oh interesting I because I did happen to speak to Gabriel Shapiro of Delphi digital who this was for my premium offering and I of this moment haven't released it yet but he said that he thought that this enforcement action kind of indicated that it could make all of defy illegal so it sounds like you don't agree with that interpretation of of Gabriel's well so I guess first off I should definitely clarify that I'm not a lawyer and never went to law school uh for any listeners who want to know so you know I definitely respect babe I think he might be right but I also think that you know the cftc has traditionally kind of into this picture of being a friendlier regulator to the crypto industry I don't know that they'd want to blow it you know that entire reputation Away by going after all of defy but again I think in this particular case it was just kind of such a blatant example of a D5 project that was trying to break the law that the cfdc said okay yeah you know we're gonna go after this I think that you know I think the issue that you know Gabe has that a lot of you know again a lot of the industry has is that the way the cfdc is going about this is by going after any token holder who voted in the governance process and so the implication there is of course okay well if you're voting in any kind of Dallas governance process and you know that Dow happens to engage in some kind of illicit activity even if you're voting to be you know to not do an illegal thing you're still liable and that is definitely I think a concern you know if uh you're part of a Dao and that Dow decides okay you know we're gonna get rid of our kyc process we're going to watch something that could require a QRC process we're not going to have that and you vote against that proposal the implication here does seem to be that yeah you're still going to be held you know personally liable even if you were trying to do your part to not a lot of illegal activity if that's the actual case and again the cftc hasn't said anything really so you know we don't know if that's how they're going to interpret the size precedent but it seems like a reasonable assumption and so yeah I think that is definitely a very valid concern that a lot of you know individuals who are you know attorneys and members of Taos that are watching those are concerned with yeah and this actually takes us to commissioner summer singer's dissent but before we get there just one last question that I wanted to ask you briefly was bcx actually had also been the victim of numerous hacks in which customer funds were lost so do you think that that is another reason why this enforcement action happened against them was that just like in another kind of low-hanging fruit type situation yeah I think there was you know a lot of attention paid to that I think there might even have been a lawsuit against the company which you know certainly once you start filing lawsuits and you have those documents out there it makes it easier for for example cftc investigators who are you know looking at these legal filings saying home okay so this company did exactly and then you know they're gonna check and say um well they never registered with us so I think the hacks themselves I don't know necessarily if the cftc would have just gone after a company for getting hacked but it definitely made it a more high profile Target and yeah subsequently you know once that's out there it is a lot easier to say okay well you know we're gonna look into this company and try and figure out what's what so let's talk about cftc commissioner mercinger's dissent she said while I do not condone individuals or entities blatantly violating the commodity exchange act or our rules we cannot arbitrarily decide who is accountable for those violations based on an unsupported legal Theory amounting to regulation by enforcement while federal and state policy is developing can you elaborate a little bit on her objections one of the key objections is just the cfgc is going after an unincorporated association and that is a thing in the US it's a term it's legal term but it does seem a little imprisoned in how the cftc is approaching it and again part of that comes down to how are they identifying the individual members and there's a you know a whole other debate around that part actually that we should totally get into later but the question is you know who exactly are you trying to sue for the defendants or the respondents in this case and the cftc does not currently have an answer to that she's also got concerns about kind of the legal precedent that the cfcc is going with some of that comes down to state law precedent which the cftc may or may not necessarily be able to enforce being a federal agency again this was the part where me not being a lawyer kind of becomes a handicap I'm actually not 100 certain of the legal nuances of that but the cftc's case as I understand it depends a lot on state tort law and so a state regulator may want to go after for you know a company for that or private individuals might want to go after a company in state court for that the cfdc going after a unincorporated association at the federal level in a federal court might be a little bit more tricky and it seems like one of commissioner messenger's objections is tied to that and the other part of course is just you know going back to the identification question earlier there are a couple different ways you could approach Dallas one being you'd go after anyone who received a token in an airdrop obviously that's not ideal people get airdrop tokens all the time they don't necessarily know about it they don't necessarily you know volunteer to get these tokens if anyone who got you know airdropped the token was sued that would be pretty bad for the industry that would be I think hilariously difficult for the cfpc to you know enforce because it's a lot of people The Other Extreme is you have to identify the individuals that you believe are most responsible the ones who are absolutely trying to engage in the non-kyc product offerings the listing of these margin trades what not again I don't think the cftc has done that at this point I don't think they know the identities necessarily or at least if they do they haven't said so in any of the court documents I've seen the cfcc has to still find out who exactly it is they're suing the middle ground seems to be going after anyone who voted on a governance Proposal with their tokens and this is again this is kind of unprecedented I mean I'd say kind of it is very unprecedented we've never seen this before my understanding is uh you know in The Descent the commissioner said you know we should as an agency put out a request for comments we should put out some rulemaking and guidance and figure out you know get public feedback to figure out how to do this right rather than put it in an enforcement action throw it out there where people can't provide feedback unless they're the respondents and just make that president and I think that is fair you know this is kind of a situation where if you are trying to create regulation a feedback process seems to make most sense if the goal is to just get this company out and in doing so create a precedent for yourself through the courts that might be more like what this gift is actually done yeah so we're going to talk a little bit more about the issues around identifying who it is that this enforcement actions for but first a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible to swap crypto a user has to choose among hundreds of dexes on

she felt that an unintended consequence of this enforcement action would be around this issue that you raised that simply voting in one of the governance proposals would put you in a new category of being able to be targeted whereas if you didn't vote just if you were too busy or whatever like suddenly you wouldn't be you know subject to this enforcement action and so she was saying that this could actually create kind of like two classes of token holders unintentionally so can you talk a little bit more about you know why it is that people are concerned about this yeah I mean I think the big thing is just if you are a token holder and you're engaging in a doubt in good faith you might not necessarily have the expertise to understand okay well is every single thing I do above board right companies have lawyers and legal counsel to have internal lawyers they have you know GCS they have external lawyers they have Consultants they have usually a dedicated team that says okay here are all the things we're doing here are things that might be in violation of the law here are things that are definitely not I don't think a lot of dows or most dials really have that kind of entities you know by Design anyone can participate so or maybe a couple people into that were aware okay yeah so you know most of what we do is above board but this might think you know this one thing might be illegal and if most of the dad was unaware then they might be held liable for something that they didn't know about or that they weren't you know informed enough to want to you know avoid it and that could be a problem right if uh you are participating in good faith you're you think everything's above board and it's only you get sued you know that's damaging it's a problem you know for any individual who gets sued of course it's going to be it might be on your record or you know if people look you up later oh you so you got sued by the cftc for engaging in illicit activity what's that about not a good look for a lot of people so I think that's just one example of how this could be presidential in a kind of you know not great way for people who are participating in the house you know is the effect going to be to depress uh Dow participation um I don't know I do know that you know you mentioned uh Gabriel earlier I know he has put out a call for any member of ukidao to who wants representation to reach out so uh we'll see if they're able to pull together some people count soon and you know fight this but there are definitely a couple ways where intentionally or not the cftc might be depressing down participation and or not centralizing but at least limiting kind of the growth of this industry in a way that people weren't really expecting or you know you know even thinking about before yeah and I saw Tim Copeland of the block wrote an article where he said there were more than 2 200 Dows and it was like um about 10 billion dollars worth of value in those Dows um and as you mentioned you know commissioner mercinger was concerned that this could have a chilling effect on voting in the Dows and frankly perhaps on Dow is all together um so now let's talk about you know an issue that we alluded to earlier the cftc posted a notice in the ukidao Forum that the members were being served um and they used the username cftc enforcement and I wondered you know what you thought of that method would there be any defense for people who are ukidao token holders that they weren't properly notified or what are people saying about this method well so yeah I mean I think the big problem there is we don't know if the actual Dow holders were notified so what the cftc did and this is based on legal filings from earlier this week first off they posted the announcement of the lawsuit as well as how the filings on the Forum in the ukida website so I believe that's okay trades.com anyone can read a forum post but at the same time you know I I've only been part of a handful of forums where I got notifications every time someone posted I don't know if I'm you know it's an opt-in kind of thing so you don't know for sure that the members who have voted received that notification the other thing the cftc did was uh they posted the filings and complaints in a help chat bot on the website and again we don't know who that goes to right does that go to a single individual does that go to the team is there a team to begin with we don't know who exactly received that but what the fantasy has done is asked a district court to approve that approved these methods as proper service and say all right well you've done your part now the Dow members are aware that they have been served and have to respond and they have to respond within I believe it's three weeks of whenever that's approved so the cftc says they posted those documents on September 22nd meaning the if approved that that would have until middle of October to respond uh otherwise you know we'll see what the uh what the judge says but there's no certainty there and the cftc In fairness I guess you know the issue is and they said this in their documents there's no listed officer there's no listed secretary or agent they don't have any publicly identifiable people to serve and so I just say it seems to be the kind of the you know best method of trying to get in touch one of the uh paralegal who filed one to court documents also said that she had been in the ukidao telegram group and noticed that people were talking about the lawsuit in that and so clearly they're aware but again we don't know who's actually in that telegram group I've looked at the children group it was not particularly active the most activity happened after one of the advents apparently left uh publicly announced to move on coincidental I'm sure but you know it's uh there's a lot of uncertainty here and if the Dow responds maybe we'll have a better sense of okay yeah we know that they saw this or we know that they were you know they received a lawsuit till then all we know is that the filings were posted to a website and submitted to a chatbot and whoever's on the other end we do not know definitely um doesn't seem like the surest way to deliver that kind of news so at this moment you know what do you think will happen next what are the Dow four members discussing you know what are you hearing and what are you looking out for in terms of upcoming steps it's really hard to say I think there's probably going to be a lot of community support for this project but at the same time it's difficult for me to see how exactly the actual facts of the case might be in dispute and you know frankly it does look like again this was a doubt I was created very explicitly to continue on the same activities that the company b0x was doing and the founders of the company clearly knew that yeah there were some issues here they settled they've also settled by the way for 250 000 which is pretty small fine I mean it's a lot of money but relative to a lot of defines that we see it's pretty small so you know uh in that settlement the founders settled not only to be zero X charges but they also will not get charged for their activities as part of the Dow itself they seem to have really recognized okay yeah this is not good for us so even though the b0x settlement will in theory the case will not be used to support the ukidao case it's the same facts and circumstances as far as I can tell them so it's not a good case for the Dow at all what that means for the industry at large is probably the bigger question and that's really going to come down to what kind of ruling and judgment to judge the court comes down with whether it'll say okay yeah this is properly served if they do then that's going to be you know one point against you know serving individual people into housing future if they say sure you know the method that you have come up with is reasonable um that could be again the scenario I later earlier was a hypothetical but it's a hypothetical that becomes closer to reality if uh any voting member of a doubt is deemed individually liable and if the judge rules okay the cftc is right the Dow has to disband they have to you know refund whoever they have to pay a fine they have to cease and desist then the next question becomes you know how do you enforce that and then that's when things probably get really weird because we're gonna have to we're going to see a federal agency go after a Dao in an effort to shut it down and I don't know if they will succeed but just the fact that that will be happening is probably going to be a you know a major cause for concern in the industry clearly I mean just from all the commentary that the various crypto lawyers were saying definitely people seemed alarmed all right Nick well I know that you have a number of activities at the conference so I really appreciate that you took the time to come on the show and

proposal to create reversible eth token standards Royals crypto Twitter researchers at Stanford University have proposed introducing reversible transactions to ethereum to remedy crypto thefts this consists of creating new ethereum token standards that allow smart contracts to reverse transactions token standards are the set of rules that a smart contract must follow to develop tokens Kylie Wong one of the researchers argued the major hacks we've seen are undeniably thefts with strong evidence if there was a way to reverse those thefts under such circumstances our ecosystem would be much safer however the proposal caused quite a firestorm on crypto Twitter where many seemed to feel it would mean that the network would no longer be immutable one of the core pillars of blockchains another Hot Topic is that the new token standard would require humans to decide which transactions to reverse threatening the trustless aspect of the network Matthew deferante CEO of ZK Labs tweeted no contracts would accept these tokens in the first place due to the complexity of handling chains of reversals Roman semenov the founder of tornado cash also raised some concerns about the interoperability of these new token standards with other decentralized applications well erc20r be incompatible with the current defy ecosystem he wondered still reactions were not 100 negative and then consier founder of avalanche thought this was a great idea an Argent a popular wallet tweeted this was an interesting idea but the problem could be solved in other ways while still remaining
