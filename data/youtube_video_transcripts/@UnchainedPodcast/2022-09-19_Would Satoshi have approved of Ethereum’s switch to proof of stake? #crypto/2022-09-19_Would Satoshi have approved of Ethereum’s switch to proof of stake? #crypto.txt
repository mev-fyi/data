so there is this say i forget who who said that it could have been anthony sasano which is that bitcoin is the idea and ethereum is the execution and one of the things that that hall said you know 13 years ago was that he was looking into ways to make bitcoin you know more energy efficient you're talking about how finny yeah exactly and it's widely thought you know that how finley could be satoshi and i personally believe that is the most likely candidate and here we are 13 years later after whole vinnie kind of wrote this we now have basically a more secure version of ethereum which doesn't consume nearly as much electricity it consumes roughly 5 000 times less than bitcoin
