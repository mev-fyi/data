[Music] today's topic is the financial situation of Genesis and its parent company dcg here to discuss our ROM alawalia CEO and co-founder at lumita and Sam Andrew author of crypto Clarity research welcome ROM and Sam pleased to be here thank you hey Laura and rum in the last few weeks there has been some clouds on the horizon for the industry which is this question of what will happen to Genesis and dcg let's just start by making sure the audience understands who these two entities are and why it is that they're so important for crypto and Ron why don't we start with you sure I'll frame it up so dcg is a storied institution within the crypto sector dcg was born out of second Market founded by Barry Silber and it has several businesses underneath that including a coindesk the media institution as well as Genesis Lending and a number of other businesses as well and the challenge has been that Genesis Lending is the world's largest prime broker and it's had a run on the bank there's been an acceleration of customer withdrawals and Genesis Lending has been lending on a secured basis as well as unsecured basis to institutions including three arrows capital and others some of those institutions have failed to pay back their loans they've blown up they've been write downs and that's caused a collapse of confidence in Genesis Lending and what we've seen over the last few months are a series of tweets and notices from Genesis attempting to restore some kind of confidence but in the last few weeks you've seen Genesis has halted withdrawals and there's also been a letter issued by dcg summarizing the situation from their perspective and it appears to be that there's a goal to raise Capital at the dcg holdco level to attempt to repair the situation and Sam is there any more that you want to add on the importance of these two entities for crypto yeah let me highlight three things as to why the dcg issue in particular is a big deal in crypto in my mind there's three kind of main reasons for that one market liquidity two contagion and three reputation and so for Market liquidity standpoint as RAM was alluding to like genesis is really big right and they're really big and a kind of large part of the crypto markets because of their lending and trading business and just to put some numbers around that they did about eight billion dollars of loan issuances in Q3 of 2022 they did about 50 billion dollars uh at its peak and they trade about 30 billion dollars worth of volumes both in derivatives and spot contract right and so it's a huge liquidity provider to crypto markets and so what that is like think of that as like almost like the motor oil for a car right it helps the kind of lubricant of the of Assets in crypto trading fairly easily and so with that with dcg or sorry with dcg and specifically Genesis particularly gone then all that liquidity dries up and it becomes much more difficult for crypto assets to trade the second thing is Contagion Genesis in particular has about three billion dollars worth of liabilities at least if that goes to zero which I think is unlikely but if it did then it has like all sorts of knock-on effects um selling wise across the industry within the dcg business one of the businesses which I'm sure we'll talk about in detail is called grayscale they have their Prime asset in grayscale is the grayscale Bitcoin trust commonly known as gbtc it's possible though unlikely and I'm sure we'll talk about this in more detail that that trust could be Unwound in which case there would be a huge amount of cell of Bitcoin selling into the market 630 000 worth of bitcoin selling into the market which is worth about a little over 10 billion dollars again that's probably unlikely but there's there's a concern of that and the third reason why is a big deal is reputationally dcg you may not have heard of it it's this large Crypt to conglomerate that generally flew under the radar until a few weeks ago when all of a sudden Genesis halted its withdrawals and from a reputational standpoint it's yet one more hit that the crypto industry has taken so as Rob began to describe there were a number of seeds of these issues that were planted kind of over the last several months I think the headlines really started after the collapse of FTX but a lot of the origin of these problems began in some ways you could say three Arrows with three arrows Capital going under but also even before that with I think some of dcg's business strategies so ROM can you describe how it was that all these events sort of unfolded in terms of them affecting First Genesis and then ultimately ensnaring dcg yeah you have to go back to the grayscale trade so let me Define what that trait is it's a variation on a carry trade so what was happening is gbtc was trading at a premium relative to spot Bitcoin and the reasoning for that is because gbtc was what one of the only ways to access Bitcoin in scale as an institution so you had a number of players including block firing three arrows that would buy Bitcoin and then sell forward to deliver Bitcoin to grayscale and they could capture the premium however you have to wait six months before you could monetize that so you're taking risk on the spread between gbtc and the spot price of Bitcoin now what happened in around March of last year shortly before the coinbase IPO and he had new on-ramps that enabled easier access and awareness of easier access to bitcoin is that spread flipped from a premium to a discount to negative so if you had been buying Bitcoin attempting to capture this time Arbitrage as pseudo Arbitrage which isn't risk list of course then you're stuck holding the bag and you're losing money and really the unwind of that premium has caused a lot of issues and risk and contagion it was a a perpetual motion machine around which other machines were built and all that come undone so that I think is the proximate cause for the issues that three years Capital faced in addition what you saw was that dcg according to their 10q had plowed back 780 million dollars to buy gbtc at a discount now in general a closed end fund it's very unusual for a discount to exceed 20 to 25 on a sustained basis so there was a thesis there that this spread would close and of course it had historically been at a premium but in fact the spread kept widening Genesis Lending was financing three hours capital in that trade of course Genesis is wholly owned by dcg would have been in the interest of dcg to have Genesis Finance three roses capital and it appears that Genesis Lenny was also financing dcg so dcg already had operating leverage on the grayscale on the gbtc trade but it was compounded with financial leverage from from Genesis as that spread continued to widen ultimately it led to a margin call from three hours of capital they're not able to pay back their 2.6 2.3 billion dollar loan there was a collateral shortfall that led to an impairment on the Genesis Lending balance sheet so Genesis Lending had to go to its parent company dcg which has real businesses and real assets like the crown jewel grayscale and dcg took inaction to restore the solvency of Genesis Lending by borrowing 1.1 billion dollars from Genesis and assuming quote unquote certain liabilities namely the bad debt of three hours Capital that action restored the balance sheet help of Genesis but it also LED Genesis having a duration issue because they've got this 10-year loan where the counterparty is their parent company payable in 1.1 billion dollars in 10 years and a liquidity issue and yeah so I as you probably know because you were on my premium offering in in that interview you talked about how you felt that Genesis has both the liquidity and a solvency problem I have seen a lot of commentary on Twitter and also obviously the dcg statement or letter to shareholders itself and more or I don't know about more but a number of people are just saying that this is a liquidity issue so I was curious Sam for your perspective on what the core problems are for Genesis okay there's maybe just taking a step back like and just defining what the problem is there's two problems right and the two problems are interconnected so let's start with the two entities that have the two problems entity number one is Genesis and Genesis has a liquidity problem right and they have a liquidity problem because a whole bunch of depositors how want their money back and how did that come about well the business model of Genesis is take money in in the form of deposits and then lend those lend those deposits out it's in the form of loans right similar to a bank in the wake of the FTX collapse everyone wanted their crypto back didn't matter where it was it was just give me your crypto back and so they call up Genesis and say give me my give my money back and Genesis doesn't have the money right it's not surprising that Genesis doesn't have all the money because that's the business model that still is to lend it out so that's a liquidity issue that has been solved at least temporarily right now by halting withdrawals usually when you halt withdrawals that spells the end of the business right it spells the end of the business because there's no longer any trust in the entity in which you've lent your money to and that can often lead to to a bankruptcy but that's been at least halted for now and we can talk about how that things may play out for Genesis the second problem is with dcg now usually how companies organized you have separate entities each one is ring fest with his own assets and his own liabilities and that provides some form of security for all these different entities it operating that's how dcg is set up as a parent company with its various assets however there's a key problem here and that is what was revealed fields in a tweet from dcg CEO is that there's actually 1.6 billion dollars of loans that went from Genesis to dcg so that creates another problem is that if Genesis were to go bankrupt right which it's potentially on the path of doing then Genesis creditors enforce on genesis's assets the largest asset on genesis's balance sheet is alone it made Genesis made the dcg so all of a sudden by enforcing on that asset dcg gets brought into Genesis bankruptcy proceedings that is why these two entities are now intrinsically linked is because if one fall the other one Falls and that is I think critical to understand as to how these two entities are now tied together the Doom of one being Genesis will impact the fate of dcg yeah I agree and just to build off what Sam said dcg had a chance to cordon off the liabilities and let Genesis go to chapter 11 and limit The Fallout and there would still be issues around Gemini earn but by borrowing 1.1 billion dollars Sam's Point they're inextricably linked a few other points one is there's no question that after the three hours Capital impairment that Genesis was insolvent you had a 2.6 billion dollar loan that was not performing so long as write Downs are greater than retained earnings you're insolvent however dcg did come to the Rescue by swapping out this badass at a loan to three hours Capital isn't worth much you can't collect that you got to go through bankruptcy process it's going to take some time with a good loan to dcg so in doing so dcg did restore the solvency of Genesis however let's look what happens here you've got a 1.1 billion dollar loan to pairing code dcg which is payable in 10 years so Genesis has technically saw them what's the present value of that loan depending on the discount rates between 250 to 350 million dollars so it's technically solvent but if you truly were to liquidate the assets and liabilities there would be a shortfall in the assets and the insufficient Capital to go pay back your creditors so if you look at the dcg letter they start out by saying look there's a market dislocation people have been impacted third sentence now there's a duration issue that duration issue is the consequence of dcg attempting to say Genesis they borrowed a 10-year duration loan so they replaced that solvency issue with the liquidity and duration issue and although it's technically solvent the assets on a fair value basis are still less than the liabilities I just wanted to add earlier when Ron was saying that the the whole created by three arrows was 2.7 what did you what did you say two point no 2.3 billion three billion right 2.3 that I read I think this was in Sam's newsletter that that represented 47 of their loan books so that's just to make clear just you know why we're seeing that that is what made them and solve it but anyway yeah I think maybe just hone in on a couple points there that Laura you just touched on and RAM explained for us so in terms of how Genesis got into this mess the gdbc trade was part of it that Ram explained how that worked but there was also like incredibly Reckless loan underwriting at the Genesis level right and they tried to kind of cover over this so in July 6th the CEO the then CEO of Genesis tweeted that you know we've got exposure to 3ac don't worry there's roughly 80 collateralization on the loans that were extended to them we've liquidated we've kind of hedged dcg has kind of stepped in to assume some liabilities it was all very vague but in the wake of like Celsius block five Voyager collapsing you're like okay Genesis seems to have like operated pretty quickly or pretty well dcg has kind of come in we don't really know what worked or what happened because nothing was really disclosed but it seems to be okay and then 12 days later on July 18th the three AC bankruptcy filing comes out and it notes that there's a 2.3 billion dollar loan outstanding to Genesis so that means Genesis had loaned 3ac 2.3 billion dollars and you're just like wait what like didn't the CEO just say like everything was fine and now you've got this 2.3 billion dollar claim on the 3ac bankruptcy because Genesis had loaned 2.3 billion dollars to 3 AC and then you look at genesis's quarterly filings and you can see that as of June 30th 2022 there was 4.9 billion dollars of loans outstanding right now 2.3 billion of that was to 3ac so that meant that 47 as Laura you explained of your loan book was issued to one entity like that is absolutely Bonkers right and it almost got worse from there because in that loan that 2.3 billion dollar loan was a USD denominated loan but the collateral for that loan was Inc crypto linked assets so as crypto as crypto prices crash the value of the collateral totally declined but yet you still owe 2.3 billion the third issue was this 80 of the collateral like was not actually there right and you can go through which I've done and looked at the three AC bankruptcy filings and look at what the collateral value is and at most it could have been like 60 and by the time 3ac collapsed it was 15 right so you ask yourself like why did Genesis have like such Reckless loan underwriting and it's one of two reasons it's either you're like totally stupid right or you're making a ton of money doing this and there's other reasons and my suspicion is that as a bit of both and they actually made a ton of money doing this for the reasons Ram explaining of like this three the gbtc trade 3ac Genesis and grayscale all needed to be part of that those three entities and Genesis and grayscale made a ton of money doing this at its peak grayscale's Revenue was 144 million dollars a quarter that was Revenue that had very little cost Associated to it that was flowing right into dcg that's why Genesis was underwriting very lenient loans to 3ac is because they were making up for it both in their trading volume through Genesis and in the revenue that grayscale was generating I'll clarify one one piece so it's it's clear that with the demise of three Euros Capital that Genesis took action to call in loans wherever they could it was revealed uh through some of the FTX issues last week that for example there's like a 2.6 billion dollar loan to Alameda which they called in successfully so what happens is when you're calling in your loans you're going to start increasing your concentration risk to certain counterparties especially the bad ones that can't pay back the loan so but yeah clearly there were issues here there are a number of issues I don't know if you want to go around that there were secured loans but there was no Perfection of the security interest via control meaning having the collateral in a vault or even better yet on chain that's one second are these unsecured loans third there was a counterparty uh underwriting challenges that meant you mentioned and fourth there's no liquid loan market for the asset so that's the challenge right if you're a non-bank printing to be a bank then you're borrowing short-term liquid causes and you're lending against long-term illiquid assets and when there's a crisis of confidence you cannot liquidate your asset side of the balance sheet fast enough so the number of issues and overall my view is that Genesis Lending is a great business and an up only Market but when the tide goes out any business it's it's not a it's broader than like a management issue no business should be doing this the capital markets infrastructure are not mature enough for a number of reasons to have a successful lending operation and I do think that in a way all the different entities that we're talking about all their incentives went pretty much just in the same direction because you could imagine that if grayscale and um Genesis weren't owned by the same parent company that probably some of the risks they took they wouldn't have taken otherwise um so I think you know when just everybody has incentives in One Direction that means when things shift in the opposite direction then everybody gets wrecked here or they trusted they trust it as well this is the greatest irony right they trusted counterparties in a trustless world so there's some information obviously that we don't have and so I was curious what do you think we don't know that could be relevant to kind of figuring out where this could go like what do you wish you could ask Barry silbert or the people at Genesis it's a lot of questions I'd like to ask them you want to go first sure there's a ton of questions we get to ask maybe to boil it down into kind of three I think a key thing for Barry he probably has the best view on this is where do things actually stand on converting the gbtc into an ETF and the reason that is so important is the entire dcg complex is levered to like the Bitcoin price but more specifically it's levered to the gbtc premium or discount to bitcoin spot and the larger that discount is which now it's like plus 40 discount the more insolvent and the bigger the problem dcg has that discount goes more to par and potentially even a premium but like back to no discount or no premium dcg has less of a problem because its asset value goes up and it's and it's collateral various collateral values go up and there's reason to believe that there was a period when grayscale may have been pushing for an ETF conversion but maybe they didn't actually want to and this is where the incentives you know Laura you're talking about like kind of having perverted incentives this is where the incentives come in is because the reason why grayscale may not have really wanted an ETF is because they grayscale charges a two percent management fee on the Bitcoin asset value in the gbtc trust and that two percent management fee is enormous right like a standard ETF charges like a quarter of a percent right so you're like if you convert to an ETF then eventually we're inviting a ton of other competitors into doing this because it's easier to set up an ETF than a trust and all of a sudden our feed compression comes down that issue is a bit taken off the table now but like previously that was a concern now they're you know if they can convert gbtc into an ETF that would be value creative for everyone they filed suit against the SEC and they've publicly laid out a road map to convert to an ETF and they don't take those actions as if as fiduciary they could be sued so I gave them the full credit and I understand your point to captive asset great fee machine and why wouldn't they capture it but if they don't take those actions reliable here here are a few questions I would ask there are a few technical ones and then some strategic ones the technical question I would ask is around that 1.1 billion dollar loan what is the nature by which dcg quote unquote assumed the liability EG the bad debt of three hours Capital that has to be an arm's length fair value transaction which would have crystallized the impairment on the Genesis balance sheet it's not clear what that transaction was so I have a question around what happened there it's a it's a puzzle and the public disclosures haven't been able to address that oh actually wait before you keep going mom just one thing that I meant to ask earlier just for my understanding but also the audiences so um because Sam when he initially talked about how much money it is that dcg owes to Genesis sort of combine these two loans but the 575 million that's due next May that was taken out because dcg I guess was funding more purchases of gptc but then the 1.1 billion that was the one that was the 1.1 billion was the rescue to restore the health of the dcg balance sheet made in connection with the Assumption of quote-unquote certain liabilities per the dcg shareholder letter the 575 million dollar loan was for a broader set of purposes which which appears to include the purchasing of gbtc it may have been a corporate loan which is a kind of distinction as compared to like a loan fully secured by gbtc so anyway so one question is what were this precise set of transactions to transfer the risk and that 1.1 billion dollars a loan that was one the second is has dcg been selling gbtc in the open market now I know in the public financials that they report quarterly as of September 30th they have not now again they've been purchasing over 750 million dollars of gbtc while Bitcoin was riding high before and after the Bitcoin uh bubble and and crash they stopped purchasing the three hours Capital which is smart because they're harvesting liquidity but the gptc discount continues to widen we'll find out in February and the next following whether they sold gbtc to create liquidity which would be horrible because their average purchase price is forty dollars now gptc is nine dollars so they get a 75 loss on an unrealized basis and they may be realizing the losses then fundamental strategic question is this dcg has a surprised asset called grayscale but the revenues of grayscale are directly driven and correlated by the price of Bitcoin to Sam's Point so when Bitcoin was riding High the fee generating power of grayscale is enormous now it's dropped if you look at the last quarter multiply by four you have 250 million Revenue we don't know the earnings we don't know the margin I'd ask that question it's somewhere probably between 50 to 75 percent so it's going to come down to this very has to make a decision around is he going to raise money at a substantially lower price than the 10 billion dollar valuation they raised at the top of the market Exquisite type timing which appears to be a secondary transaction in November 21. it's going to be a much lower valuation because grayscale's revenues are 25 of what they used to be and if he's willing to do that he can save Genesis he can make the creditors whole if he's not willing to do that then there's pain so Barry can control his Destiny but he's gonna he's gonna have to uh you know economics yeah there's a lot of unknowns I yeah I do Wonder also if they're selling the gbtc so let's talk about um some of the ways uh that dcg slash Genesis might work its way out of this but before we do that we're going to take

leading blockchain data platform by visiting chain analysis.com Unchained back to my conversation with ROM and Sam so there's a few different ways that all of this could go so these are some of the options we've seen discussed dcg could raise Equity it could sell some of its assets it could have Genesis file for bankruptcy and Sam wrote a little bit about how it could do a pre-package restructuring let's walk through each of the options I'm curious to hear yeah the details on each of these sure so those are kind of the four main options I'll tick through all four of them quickly and I suspect we want to spend most the time discussing this potential pre-packaged restructuring and that what that could look like so the raising Equity there's two real challenges with raising equity is one is Genesis is a capital intensive business and it's Capital intensive because it's requiring loan money to come into the business to then go out and Loan it so if you raise equity and just provide that new cash infusion to Genesis withdrawals you know it'll go to fund withdrawals and then what like you're left with if Genesis has no Capital to to originate loans it has no business and so that means that like raising equity for Genesis directly doesn't make a whole lot of sense unless you can capitalize it sufficiently to fund withdrawals and additional Capital thereafter and this the second issue with raising Equity is what Ram already explained is that Genesis was just valued at 10 billion dollars at the end of last year it's going to have to take a massive write down to raise the type of equity that's required and like that doesn't make a whole lot of sense you'd have to either your valuation would either have to come down significantly and or you'd have to make up your Returns on the rest of dcg's business the second thing is monetizing existing assets so whether that's grayscale in terms of selling it to another asset manager which it's a crown jewel you could sell but if you end up selling it there's not much left at dcg um you could unwind it as in like cell there's various regulatory things you'd have to go through but you could inconceivably sell unwind gbtc which means you could sell the Bitcoin at current price as opposed to as opposed to at the discounted rate you could raise 285 million-ish dollars by doing that but that's actually not really feasible there's all sorts of regulatory challenges and it actually would take a really long time to be able to sell all that so that doesn't really work there's three AC claims that could be worth a few hundred million dollars there's other assets that could be worth a few hundred million but there's not much monetizable Beyond like grayscale so that doesn't really work you could put Genesis in a bankruptcy but then you're kind of at the same position you're in now it doesn't provide like any additional benefit to the creditors or to dcg right now to to put Genesis into bankruptcy and we can explain kind of why that would be but maybe just for the purpose of brevity right now moving on to the pre-package that in my opinion probably makes the most sense because in all other scenarios it's the death of one or two prize assets Genesis and grayscale and by killing either of those two assets it reduces the overall value of dcg and by reducing the overall value of dcg the Genesis creditors right which are the ones kind of driving this process right now have less potential value to make them whole on their deposits right and so you want to create a situation whereby there's the most value possible at dcg and the most potential value could accrue to these to the Genesis creditors and a pre-packaged restructuring would would enable both entities grayscale and Genesis to continue operating and create value I have a tweak on this I think Genesis Lending will be shut down because it's a negative Enterprise Value business this hasn't generated a retained earning through an entire cycle and the write Downs actually expose dcg so they got to shut that thing down right what happened here is an impairment to Capital and the remedy for an impairment of capital is raise fresh Equity that's just the reality of it dcg as was noted earlier now has a 1.1 billion dollar liability that's payable in 10 years creditor is going to have a claim on that one way or another either directly to dcg if Genesis goes through chapter 11 or directly or indirectly one way or another so they have to raise Capital that's that's just it's the only path and yes it's unpalatable but it's it's reality so I think you're going to see that happen and you know Barry is doing this negotiation with multiple counterparties he has to negotiate with his own subsidiary Genesis who at this point likely has retained separate outside counsel there's also these Gemini earned creditors and other asset managers that have claims here so it's a very complicated process now Barry is a former restructuring you know bankruptcy you know Banker so he's got the skills to do this but I think the right approach is raise Equity take the lumps save the prized asset uh grayscale and move forward because so you were saying because Sam basically kind of said that he felt that that was not really going to be on the table for dcg but you're saying you disagree that you think raising Equity is is the best option but Sam did you get to walk through your pre-packaged for structuring yeah so let me just explain how the prepackaged restructuring would work because I think we'll discover RAM and I kind of agree on this part of the pre-packaging restructuring would include some form of capital raise maybe let me just step back first and explain what a package restructuring is so kind of pre-packaged restructuring is when all stakeholders come together and negotiate a deal kind of between themselves it usually leads to better outcomes it avoids like a costly drawn out bankruptcy process and the key in this is in my mind to raise some some Equity some cash to fund some of the withdrawals and then having enough kind of operating capital for the business is to continue running and so how this would work is there's kind of four steps to it the first step would be some form of liquidity infusion right around 500 million I believe would work and that would be funded through either or both of monetizing some of the assets which I walked through wouldn't really work with the exception of probably the Venture portfolio they could sell assets there and like raising Equity at the dcg level now raising a few hundred million of equity is far more palatable than raising a billion dollars of equity so if you need about 500 million and some of that can be funded by selling some assets particularly The Venture portfolio and raising some Equity that becomes far more realistic secondly you'd have a partial withdrawal so partial withdrawal of the Genesis depositors so in order for this is where I think Genesis both trading and London maybe RAM and I disagree a bit on this but I think keeping Genesis operating both the trading and lending business would actually be value creative but it needs Capital to do that and so you ask your depositors Genesis depositors to say okay we'll give you part of your withdrawals now that's what the 500 million dollar cash infusion goes to fund a partial withdrawal and then you ask them to leave most of their Capital at Genesis and they're willing to they'd be willing to do that potentially in exchange for what in restructuring terms is generally known as like a debt to equity swap so in exchange for leaving some other Capital at Genesis which enables Genesis to keep operating and you can ensure that the rest of the dcg Empire kind of keeps running as it is as well you offer them equity in the dcg parent company right and so you're giving them kind of a carrot for like okay you're going to give you part of your withdrawals now you're going to leave some of your Capital here so that everything can keep operating in exchange for that will give you equity in dcg in addition to that I also think there should be like improved loan underwriting standards at Genesis and that would be part of their you know part of the terms of restructuring agreement to ensure that the like The Reckless loan underwriting cannot continue in a in kind of a post restructuring business in general and you're referring to pre-packaged bankruptcy at the Genesis entity or Genesis Lending entity specifically right not dcg yeah so at like at Genesis yeah got it so a few tweaks I think I'm broadly in alignment with the overall approach but I'll just call out a few contrasts here keep Genesis trading keep Genesis custody those are fine businesses make sense they make money too just learning got to go away we can agree disagree it's all good it's just got to go away it doesn't make any money doesn't make any sense so the challenge and as you pointed out there are ways through a bail in the conversion to debt to equity to improve uh the position of Genesis the challenge is that those creditors include unaccredited retail investors who have no business open owning a piece of dcg neither the creditors want to own it these are retail depositors that thought they had money good savings account and dcg doesn't want them on their balance sheet either so I don't think the bail in or principal forgiveness approach will matter and if those creditors aren't made whole they're retail clients they're regulatory considerations around this now we also don't know the priority of standing of those retail creditors are they secured creditors or unsecured I've looked at the terms of conditions it says the loans may be secured or not secure so it's not terribly helpful so it's you know something's got to give away here they have dcg you've got Genesis you've got the creditors I think what has to give away is is dcg now what are the assets coindesk it's a good asset it's a great business is it worth over 100 million dollars I'm not sure I'm not sure I don't think the Venture portfolio is worth much like Venture in crypto is down double digits these are not profitable businesses I don't think there's a liquid Market to buy a portfolio of these companies the prized asset that dcg can raise money off of is grayscale dcg up until these recent events was the most profitable Global institution in crypto more profitable than coinbase is not profitable the driver is is dcg that is a gray scale that is what investors are going to focus on hey everyone just inserting a note here after we wrapped Sam said he had some pushback on what ROM was saying about the value of grayscale and he didn't necessarily see it as a crown jewel he said that he felt the long-term prospects for greyscale's Value are questionable Because he believes the current construct of the trust cannot continue due to how low its trading compared to the underlying he said that since the trust can't continue in this fashion then the high two percent fee margin goes away either the trust gets resolved or it is turned into an ETF and thus that fee margin drops to 0.25 percent Ram agreed and said that if grayscale's value is less than what they were initially saying then dcg will have an even harder time raising money since an investment in dcg is essentially a levered bet on grayscale and Sam added that it was not only levered but on grayscale but also a leopard bet on Bitcoin and that there are actually better ways to be levered long on bitcoin ROM however did add that if dcg which has 67 million gptc were to unwind the grayscale trust then yes the price of Bitcoin would drop however dcg could also sell Futures in order to offset the price decline from Bitcoin he then added that this would also be possible for an acquirer of dcg to do the same and finally Sam added that there isn't a large pool of buyers for dcg and Genesis because this is obviously a pretty complicated situation and any potential buyer would need to also be pretty crypto Savvy which further limits the pull all right back to the conversation oh and just out of curiosity this is I know a small point but when you said that you didn't know if coin selling coined us could bring in 100 million dollars I don't know if you saw that report from semaphore where apparently dcg did receive an offer of 300 million for coindesk and that was dismissed for being too low so my note it's not a critical analysis that I have I'm just um maybe it's worth more who knows but uh on coindesk it's not the focus of an investor is what I'm saying the focus is grayscale yeah yeah I I have a few just kind of thoughts on what Ram shared in terms of the challenges that Genesis both particularly to the various entities and this depositors and then kind of a lot of value at grayscale my view I've kind of lumped everything Genesis as one entity which it's not but there's the trading business there's the lending business there's a custody business the reason why I've Limited at all as a one entity is that like none of this stuff is public we don't really know enough about it so to me to be able to say like this entity versus that entity needs to be gone is a little bit hard to do at this stage we may get into the weeds and realize like Ram is absolutely correct like this lending business like cut that off and keep the other two Genesis businesses that we'll we'll find that we'll find that out soon enough the second Point around Genesis depositors this is again a point we don't really know but my understanding is that actually there are most of the capital in deposits at Genesis are from high net worth individuals and family offices the there is some money from Gemini earn and from Circle the circle yield product is Tiny and almost like irrelevant there's a significant amount of capital from Gemini earn and so this becomes a question for like the restructuring and kind of like the terms of service of the Gemini earned capital is the Creditor Gemini like the organization which is like pretty sophisticated or is are they just an agent for all the depositors if there are any information for all that yeah if they're an agent for all the depositors then a debt to equity swap can potentially become more complicated the reason why I may not be as complicated is because if the Gemini earned depositors are our small portion of the overall depositors of Genesis which means that the majority of Genesis deposits are from high net worth individuals and institutions which like reading through Genesis like stuff on their website suggest that then like a debt to equity stock becomes far more feasible because Gemini earned deposits are not driving the process the high net worth individuals and the family offices that have money deposited in Gemini they're the ones who are going to be driving the process that's a good question your SM we don't know the composition and the exposure to retail they should be in the same class of creditors though so the resolution has to apply to retail as to high net worth unless High net worth is when the taken on the chin I don't see why they have an interest in doing so and there are retail non-accredited investors in Gemini earn let's take a step back why were these programs built let's zoom out for a moment so Genesis Lending they are a non-bank bank they're making these loans they make money on the interest but they need these deposits like how do we fund so Gemini says gee people want something like a savings or earnings account and they've got these customers so Genesis and Gemini talk together and say Gee let's put a program together and Gemini has distribution of these retail accounts they create a program and an offering for these retail accounts to deposit uh and then those are ultimately invested through some kind of vehicle into Genesis right so the issue with that is that Gemini retail creditors are never at the table to negotiate these terms with the lender and they aren't able to underwrite the credit risk of Genesis nor should they even be in the business of doing that so the whole set of Securities laws questions here for example is Gemini was Gemini offering a security to retail was that security registered if not under what exemption from Securities laws were there appropriate and full complete disclosures now when you invest generally of a private placement memorandum it's a private security as is the case I've not seen that so Gemini has some exposure here if you offer a security to an unaccredited retail investor without appropriate disclosures in some cases you may be subject to the full liability of losses so Gemini has a strong interest in seeking the restitution of those retail clients so I know this is super sticky and I'm about to throw a couple other wrenches into this because there are other potential issues with all this one is there could be a clawback of I believe 200 million dollars that FTX owned Genesis um and then as I believe it was Sam just discussed earlier um obviously if the price of Bitcoin Falls further that could um yeah be another issue so maybe talk a little bit about how you see those scenarios potentially playing out yeah one of the potential factors here somewhat calibrated unknowns is the exposure to FTX now we know based on I put like the FDX balance sheet in air quotes that they've balancing I'm referring to is the one that was leaked by the Ft that was the spreadsheet that seemingly sandbankment fry put together and anyway on that it suggested that there was a 200 million dollar loan they'd receive 200 million dollars from Genesis so how that plays out is kind of unclear the reason why I say it's somewhat calibrated is because if it's only 200 million in like the overall size of dcg and Genesis like it's an issue but it's not like an insurmountable problem where things what we don't know which is conceivable is that if there were let me just pause on that point to explain genesis's lending business their lending business generates a huge amount of loan origination sometimes and then like tens of billions of dollars a quarter and so they're all very short-term loans spanning a few days weeks maybe months and we know given the size of Genesis and how active they're in the market they must have like loaned money to FTX or Alameda at some point and given those two factors it is possible that Genesis would have loaned a much larger loan than the 200 million that we saw on the like quote-unquote balance sheet and it's possible that that loan was paid back depending on how the FTX bankruptcy plays out um it is possible if again these are like I'm putting together two big ifs so it's a hypothetical situation that if a lot more money gen if Genesis had loaned a lot more money to FTX and F or Alameda and those loans were repaid back to Genesis um then conceivably those loans could be clawed back if they were viewed as some form of like preferential treatment backed they could be clawed back to the FTX bankruptcy estate and that would really complicate the entire dcg slash Genesis restructuring but again a huge hypothetical but like the people inside that Genesis and dcg and their credit like they know the answer to that and so that could be one reason why like we haven't heard a whole lot or things are going to get way more complicated is because there is that potential risk factor there yeah a few scenarios here and again zooming out what happened what's going on here is dcg has operating leverage and financial leverage to the price of Bitcoin because it's the driver of grayscale's Revenue it's another carry trade the first Carry trade to impact dcg was the unwind of gbtc the second carry trade is the leverage to bitcoin so if Bitcoin moons because the FED pivots and qes are zoomed is not going to happen that is a way for uh you know a successful resolution you get Capital raise at a better valuation Etc if Bitcoin stays where it is then the assets of dcg are sufficient enough to address the liabilities here although there's pain that'll be felt from dilution if Bitcoin drops substantially then the revenues are impacted proportionately but it gets worse so the nature of operating financial leverage is this so there's these fixed costs that grayscale has to pay to operate gbtc and a number of other trusts those fixed costs don't decline right so if your revenue is declining your margins are also declining and if they're not able to drive at a resolution then those worst case scenarios that Sam identified earlier start to come into the fore are you a foreseller of gbtc at on the open market where again your average cost basis was 40 bucks now it's at nine is there selling now or you know do you look at that Defcon option I again I don't expect that to happen I really don't expect that to happen and this is why Barry has urgency to seek a financing to take the tail risk off the table he needs to do that financing now because his exposure to this volatile asset not in his control the factor in his control is his ability to raise money so he needs to de-risk do that now all right so at this point what are the odds you would say well or so what do you what do you each think is the most likely scenario to play out he raises money takes a bunch of dilution and then creditors are made whole and then Genesis Lending shuts down there could be a chapter 11 process and the longer this goes without resolution the more likely that is because the positives are owed their interest payments failure to pay is default and you're talking about it would be bankruptcy or chapter 11 for Genesis not dcg correct not dcg I know there's been some uh rumors and flood around these dcg is a quality business these are institutions acting in their lawful commercial interests uh I do believe these are high integrity players I think grayscale is a prized asset I think coined us is a great business as well and uh you know they've had a set of issues which we've discussed here and they'll get through to the other side and Barry's very skillful and Sam what would you say are is the most likely outcome so I think we're in a stalemate and we're going to continue to be in a stalemate for a period And the reason we're in a stalemate is because to our knowledge which again we don't know everything there is nothing imminent to put Genesis in bankruptcy or for some sort of Fallout at dcg and the reason there's nothing imminent is how the two things that could be really imminent are either someone has run out of money we know Genesis has run out of money or they've got these halted withdrawals but we know it's in the best interest of the depositors not to put not to enforce on the assets right now right we talked about the assets go back to dcg and then how does dcg monetize all this stuff kind of hash that out already so the Genesis creditors are unlikely to enforce right now they're willing to have a conversation the second thing is there's no impending mature debt maturities for dcg right there's 500 million dollars that's due in the beginning of next year but that's money that's due to Genesis so it doesn't really get it's like there's no real third party Capital that's imminently due and so because of that there's no like gun to anyone's head of like you need to fix this right now so that gives them a little that can be a bit of a benefit that like they can give them some breathing room and to negotiate how things could play out so with that backdrop like I don't expect like an imminent solution because it's not absolutely necessary right now I do expect a solution and I think that solution will include some form of capital raise in the form of assets being sold and Equity raise at like a much lower valuation than the 10 billion um that was previously raised and I do expect you know my view is that there's going to be some sort of pre-packaged restructuring where depositors may take a bit of a haircut and they will be made up for that haircut in some sort of form of sweetener with Equity value you in dcg or something like that those are pretty complicated things to work through so it takes a bit of time but as I explained like time is a bit on their side right now I'll take a different contrasting view on that I love the I love Sam's analysis too and it's great to have the the back and forth around this I do think they have urgency around this I think bankers and lawyers are working nights and weekend I don't think Barry's getting much sleep I think he's looking at his bitcoin price correctly like everyone's everyone's working on this around the clock right now but it's not like a panic that we need to get a deal done like tomorrow I I think I think there is I think there's motivation to get it done quickly and here's why they're two drivers one is the restitution of the Gemini earned payments those creditors are owed payments and failure to pay is a default that's one second that 575 million is a big number to do in May 575 million dollars in liquid cash isn't lying around on the dcg balance I haven't seen that balance sheet in general it's not the case that that Capital would be lying around they again they plowed back over 750 million dollars in Revenue they plug back the revenue from grayscale to buy gbtc so they've got Assets in these gbtc assets but they can't liquefy them if they sell them they're selling into a discount to nav of between 40 to 50 percent the price moves against them they could try to borrow against that that's not a good move adding leverage to the situation so they need to raise money and they need to raise money the first calls they should make are to the investors that participate in November 2021 financing because if you liked dcg at a 10 billion dollar price you should like it a lot better now you're going to get better terms you're going to have better governance and I think that is where the focus is there's that 575 million payments a big big number to me it's going to be another source of pressure in addition to Gemini earn so look blockify recall had a 100 million dollar SEC enforcement action for the payout of interest to retail depositors block 5 was acting as a bank but they're not licensed as a bank so the SEC said that's an unregistered Securities offer made to the public the fact the longer this goes on The Regulators start to get closer and closer and the risk of enforcement actions will go up I think it's highly likely an enforcement action but the longer it goes on the severities of actions increase yeah let me just clarify a couple things um did Gemini retail point that Ram explains very well that is a real problem and that is actually probably the biggest point of time pressure the the point around the 575 million dollar loan absolutely that's a big number and no one's got that money sitting around the reason why that's less of an issue is because if a company finds itself in a situation where it can't meet its maturity it's got 575 million dollars due in the beginning of next year I think it's May of next year then you go to the person who lent you the money and you look for what's commonly known as some form of like cure of like listen we can't make we can't make this payment can you give us you know can you give us some leniency maybe we can extend the maturity and in this case you're going to Genesis to ask you this it's the same like these companies are owned by the same people here's why I hear you look if I look where you're describing is like they seek out a term out financing for example however there's a complicating Factor one is this is an affiliate lending relationship and the the creditors to Genesis would not would say look that's not an independent transaction isn't the the mere fact of control by the parent insufficient they have to retain separate counsel Genesis has to act in their commercial interests they can't give dcg a break if they did that that would expose them to more liability from the creditors yeah that that makes sense to me one other thing I wanted to just bring up and I don't know how important this is but I do believe that there is an additional loan that they owe to some entity called Elbridge or something like that and it's 300 million roughly I don't know if that's important at all I just wanted to raise that it it may be okay we don't know the terms of it but the way this the dcg shareholder letter read was that that facility is a revolving credit facility which generally revolving credit facilities are like senior secured and like the most senior instrument in the capital stack there's various covenants that generally go with uh revolving credit facilities usually on like uh incurring additional indebtedness but they usually can't prevent like some form of like equitization of subordinated instruments so it's potentially an issue but again I don't view it as like a as a deal breaker because everything we're talking about is like equitizing subordinated instruments and so an RCF revolving credit facility you probably can't thwart that process yeah a revolver is a good source of financing again we don't know the the terms so long as there's no uh unwind of that facility in the near term it's a good it's a good form of Finance but the other issue we actually haven't talked about it's a great Point Laura Eldridge can say I'm not going to prove this uh workout I'm not going to prove dcg loan forgiveness Eldridge also has a stay at the table getting a bilateral deal done is hard on its face getting a three-party deal done is much harder getting a four-party deal done the probability of successful resolution is dramatically higher oh wait wait it's higher yeah sorry it's a higher likelihood of failure or issue so it's the only thing that can use sorry much harder thank you sorry okay therefore who who's gonna give up it's dcg ECG because these other parties have significant claims uh as creditors okay I do want to touch on the issue of Regulation that ROM just sort of very briefly touched on what do you think this might prompt in terms of Regulation if anything I'm happy to I'm happy to chime in there like actually regulation here is working these are commercial loans Consumer loans are highly regulated if if you have a commercial loan then commercial terms apply there are laws on the books today I don't think you need another law you don't think you know the regulation so uh I think the main lesson here is that non-banks acting like Banks doesn't end well uh second carry trades don't end well either I guess third is putting a product into a security form and then adding leverage that doesn't end well ultimately too the lessons of History right crypto speed running things we've learned over over decades and then Define that term carry trade you used it earlier and I'm not familiar with it sure sure thank you for clarifying that so A carry trade is when you borrow in one uh asset and then you make an investment other and usually this term is referenced in like FX markets for example sometimes like a hedge fund would borrow Japanese Yen because the borrowing costs of the Japanese Yen was low in local currency Yen terms because of the local interest rate and then they would turn around and lend in a high interest rate country and capture the spread so that trade works well up until there's a change in the FX rate between these two or there's a change in interest rates so again the gbtc is an example of that they they're betting that this premium be maintained and they're buying spot Bitcoin and then they're selling for Bitcoin it's not perfectly care it's not actually a carry trip but the same concept applies here too it's against borrowing short lending long you're you're you have some assumptions around that all right let's also touch on whether or not we might see further Contagion are there any concerns with holding crypto at coinbase trust I'm hearing some things about silvergate yeah so address some of the fud I guess excellent question so look trust companies trust companies are highly regulated look we love uh to have assets and liabilities and proof of Reserve liability on chain absolutely and we need to go in that direction it's not going to happen tomorrow but Trust Banks like Anchorage and coinbase trust and Gemini trust are highly regulated institutions as a whole ecosystem of verification agents and and Auditors and third parties to ensure that assets are held one for one so that's very important now what's happening the international exchanges like FTX global is not subject to U.S laws and that's why they're blowing up but what you want to look for is this one has the exchange done lending if they've done lending their high risk Institution second are they non-us they're non-us and they have to comply with U.S law and their high-risk institution will will you see more blow ups yeah I think you're gonna have some smaller exchanges uh go away you know dcg is a source of strength for this industry so we want to root for dcg they've got a balance sheet they've got a great asset they can absorb losses and help to stem the tide of contagion to some of some degree okay but you also think there's no risk of contagion to silvergate because I have seen yeah more about that but I believe I used to work there so maybe you I have a I have a view on this um but we have a research piece coming out on this next week I'll post it at my Twitter handle at Raw malawalia take a look um probably after Tuesday probably after Tuesday if you want to reach out to us reach out to us we have to share that with our clients first that's the main thing oh I see well Sam do you have an opinion about that about about broader contagion I'll answer two ways in terms of silvergate I don't have a specific opinion and I generally reserve my opinions for things I'm far more knowledgeable about and I'm just less up to speed on silvergate is this is something I'm working on so I'll save that for now in terms of broader Contagion there's a few points I generally look at like prices and kind of other entity like related entities knock-on effects and so forth if we just generally look at prices what I think has been a bit surprising is subsequent to the FTX collapse crypto markets are off about 20 25 percent and that's not a huge amount given the amount of Destruction that FTX and this potential kind of dcg Genesis that we've discussed could create and the reason that what that indicates to me is is two things one is the positioning of investors like crypto investors was far more conservative by the time the kind of end of summer fall like fall rolled around and the second thing it indicates is that like a lot of Leverage was already taken out of crypto markets right so those two things are like generally helpful if contagion were to spread that like it won't necessarily be contained but the pain from it may not be a severe right now you're also putting that in the context of like well yeah that's because prices already dropped like 70 So eventually like it's kind of hard uh to squeeze more blood out of a stone the second thing in terms of contagion is like looking at like the different entities and like what else out there could be ensnared in this in um this beating FDX and um dcg and Genesis you know that is that becomes far harder to determine because the whole point of this is like well we don't know all the inter-company workings and the loans that go on between all these different entities because they're not on chain they're private transactions that like no one is aware of until they surface it we also run the third thing in terms like the entities like we're starting to run out of entities here right and so whether it's like one of the largest exchanges out there be a binance or like one of the like bigger stable coins like tether like if those two entities start becoming in trouble then it's like it's really troublesome is there any reason to believe you know tether aside like listen we just we don't we don't know so I don't want to like um suggest either those two entities are in significant trouble when they you know I have no reason to believe that we'll talk a few quick names here so nexo look if someone tells me how many loans next to originally I can tell you where they're gonna be solving or not if the large number of loans they're not going to be solvent because the analysis is really simple it's got to say what's the impairment to the balance sheet relative to the equity calculation the balance just assume five percent equity capitalization good rule of thumb if they originate a billion dollars in loans even 500 million they're not they're going to go away they're one of the few non-bank Bank crypto lenders that somehow has survived all this I think I put them in the Red Zone that's one the second is tether so the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that tether has been issuing secured loans why are they doing that secured loans are not liquid and secured loans to the earlier point the mere fact that they're secured is insufficient if you don't control the collateral in a vault you don't have to what a secured loan is if you don't control the collaterals you rely on a legal process to recover your collateral you rely on a court system you relying to UCC filing system tether is a money market but it's not a money Mark in the sense that it doesn't benefit from all the regulations capitalization requirements oversight and transparency that investors are forwarded to in the U.S capital markets so tether's a concern yes the other concern I'd have another when I say concern I want to be very precise I'm not saying they're going to blow up or not but there's a concern absolutely there's a concern the third is is you know binance so Finance busd ate how do we know that that busd is fully reserved but where's the reporting on this you know we know that they raised a two billion dollar rescue fund it's another kind of show of confidence and show of strength very much similar to the pattern we saw from FTX uh and who's regulating binance is it do Abu Dhabi at this point you know so I have I have concerns around that so I I hear all those concerns maybe are those concerns any more heightened now like none of that stuff has changed subsequent to dcg they're high-end yes they're high-end because when you see dominoes start to fall then other dominoes fall you know in 2008 to 2009 we call it cockroach there you see one or two cockroaches you know there's 50 behind the wall and it's not a question of management or having the operations better than the other person it's because these loans are defaulting so when those loans default they create impairments on the balance sheet it's not as if one party originated better loans than another party or they had better operational risk because they weren't doing it on chain anyway so those loans are impairing the balance sheet and it's the what drives the collapse of course is when the withdrawals happen so you can be insolvent but liquid when those redemptions happen and they cannot liquefy that that uh asset that's not worth that much then you know these institutions shut down so yeah I think the urgency is heightened now that the risk factors are heightened right now oh yeah and by the way um I just wanted to say earlier that nexo is a former sponsor of my show I should just close that so A couple of things before we head out this has by the way just been such an amazing discussion um but I was curious last thing you know what are some lessons you think the industry can take away from this whole debacle go ahead go for it yeah there's a I mean we've got I feel like we've touched on a few lessons here already the two like biggest things here that like it's not just dcg and Genesis this was pervasive throughout the entire industry is one is leverage like Leverage really crushes people right and that's been the you know that's been the driver of the massive Bull Run that we had both you know C5 and D5 contributed to the huge amount of Leverage that was out in the system and so we just got to get that in check that like we can't have these like incredibly like lever long positions seconds like we need regulation right and the reason we need regulation is you end up having these kind of Shadow entities and RAM described this perfectly of like these non-bank entities that start acting like Banks and the problem when you mix that with like these perverted incentive systems is they end up extending loans that like they really should not be doing and as we discussed with Genesis and grayscale like the reason they did that is they were you know they were loaning up money over here and making a ton of money over there so it worked out until it didn't and everything imploded to leverage and regulation need to be in check wait but one one thing as I thought earlier Ron was saying that because these are regulated institutions that we're not seeing you know certain other effects that we might have seen but but are you saying what that we need more regulation or that the regulation that was in place is helpful or I'm not sure what you're what you're saying okay so on the point of Regulation I think if I can paraphrase Iran was saying in the case of some of the intercompany loans that were going on at dcg within the dcg Empire like all that stuff was regulated and and we kind of know how that should play out what is not regulated is these non-bank entities that operate as Banks and what specifically what I mean by that is they operate as banks in the sense that they take in deposits and they lend money out right that's a fine business model the problem is is they don't adhere to the same types of capital requirements that regulated Banks do and so what does that mean a regulated Bank needs to hold certain assets on its balance sheet right and has to have a certain equity ratio to ensure it remains both solvent and liquid in addition to that a regulated bank is usually backstopped by the Federal Reserve in case they have for like real emergency situations none of that exists in these like crypto Shadow Banks right they still take in deposits and they lend money but there's no requirement in terms of how much Capital they need to have on hand what their loan portfolio should look like how loans are being underwritten the type of capital that they need uh on hand and that causes these shadow crypto Banks to implode as we've seen in you know the last few months now I think the need for regulations on the international side right so uh FTX Global blown up right these um where is binance regulate those are where the primary issues are you know non-banks aren't putting depositor or taxpayer money at risk there are plenty of non-banks that do just fine and they're also non-banks that blow up and that's okay that's part of a private capitalist market system and investors and entrepreneurs and VCS can lose their money or make money so long as you don't hurt the public as long as you don't hurt retail non-accredited investors and that Gemini earn opened a window to that but there are existing laws on the books that prohibit the marketing offering of unretchered Securities to unaccredited investors I don't think you actually need much incremental U.S regulation there's a Clarity issue on certain crypto Securities regulations uh we publish them out there on the Wall Street Journal with former SEC chair author I've been talking about some of that but it's really a separate set of issues it's on the international side you already you're seeing International regulars look at this and saying okay we need to start harpenheising we need to start taking some action I think the last lesson learned is trust still matters in a trustless world trusted institutions still matter if you want to broaden crypto adoption access and usability to the next billion people you need on-ramps and gateways that are trusted so I think you're going to see web 2.5 be the next step I know there's this push for the you know not your not your keys not your coins and I'm sympathetic to that as a crypto native person however it's not applicable to the broad majority of the world population it's not something they can relate to and you're trading off another risk factor uh as well you're exposing individuals to a certain personal personal security kinds of risk as well so trust all matters in a in a trustless world you need trusted institutions ironically you need Banks you need Banks because banks have regulation banks have oversight and thanks to your point Sam have the capitalization requires they have limits on the kind of counterpart at risk they have to have the lending programs approved by the board and the regular as well and the banks have done well Anchorage has done well the Trust Banks are all doing just fine well we're gonna have to see how all this plays out this has just been yeah just incredibly fascinating to go through all the different potentialities and all the Tangled factors that landed Us in the situation um where can people learn more about each of you and your work sure so you can
