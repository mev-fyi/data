vice-president of equity research at investment banking and asset management firm Needham & Company and Daniel masters Director of Global Advisors Bitcoin investment fund welcome guys hi Laura hey Laura thanks for having me Spencer let's start with you what's your background and how did you come to learn about and then cover cryptocurrency at Needham yes so I guess for background you know the vice president of equity research here at Needham and company originally kind of joined the firm as part of our our SAS equity research team so I was doing an investment analysis of cloud software companies such as NetSuite Salesforce and HubSpot and then you know I first kind of dipped my toes in the water with Bitcoin with a small purchase in 2013 and I pretty much top tick to run up to about $100 which felt insanely expensive at the time the purchase was mostly just out of fascination with how it worked the process is borderline sketchy I had to go down to a kind of sketchy side shop in Chinatown here in San Francisco and I handed someone cash which was subsequently wired to Japan even the gentleman at the counter kind of warned me that you know make sure you're not getting scammed here and from there was kind of a classic story that nearly everyone in the Bitcoin industry shares which is that I just kept tumbling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and is you remember how you learned about it initially and then also I just want to make sure so when you sent that money to Japan it was two male yeah exactly it inhabits Bitcoin yeah i first heard about it actually in a team member meeting where previously denied him and company I was working helping build a proprietary ETF research platform and you know kind of in one of our meetings we were talking about things that are going on out in the financial media and it was the time the kind of Silk Road was getting very popular and you know a few of the guys on our team were particularly tech oriented and started talking about Bitcoin and and that was where it all began for me okay and keep going you were gonna say something else well yeah I had the opportunity to start kind of shifting that coin into kind of my professional work life in early 2015 and never look back I mean it's just Bitcoin is really intellectually stimulating and so you know I don't plan to stop anytime soon okay and Daniel what about you what's your background and how did you learn about Bitcoin and come to launch Global Advisors well I have to say I've never been to a back street in San Francisco and bought Bitcoin that sounds quite fascinating now I'm a physicist and a statistician by training I spent 13 years in Investment Banking for Salomon Brothers and JP Morgan my last job was head of global energy trading at JP where I was also a member of the bank's Risk Committee I started Global Advisors to focus on commodities and launched to quite large commodity investment funds Global Advisors commodity investment fund and Global Advisors commodity systematic fund I came to Bitcoin at the end of the commodity supercycle and I was attracted you know with my commodity traders hat on by the volatility I was intrigued by the technical platform and all the questions it raised about the nature of money I founded Gavi Global Advisors Bitcoin investment fund the world's first fully regulated Bitcoin investment vehicle in 2014 and my firm also owns a company called xbt provider an issuer of nasdaq listed bitcoin tracking certificates so we manage now about 40 million dollars for many clients in the Bitcoin space and we also have Holdings I'm a director and a shareholder of three blockchain companies a grad base glint and Aventis systems and you have actually also told me an interesting story about how when you first learn about Bitcoin you even hand solves a problem and it got you thinking about the nature of money can you talk about that a little bit well it was it was more to do with the technical infrastructure of the platform itself and what I did was I hand solved a block so this process that miners go through to to attract the block reward for essentially what would be described as a clearing process in other financial markets whereby all the transactions are verified and transmitted to the network that involves this this complex cryptographic process and hashing process that is it's quite mysterious to people so I actually took a piece of paper and it took me about two days to to work it through but I it gave me an understanding of how that mining process worked I remember that you said something interesting to me about how it got you thinking about the nature of money yeah well once you see how elegant the Bitcoin stack is and how the concept of a peer-to-peer distributed immutable time-stamped globally synchronized ledger has these tremendous advantages when transferring money from person to person you sort of then think well you know Bitcoin at the end of the days and entry on a ledger has no meaning in the physical world and people it only has a value in the sense that people are prepared to exchange other currencies or goods or services for a higher entry on their particular ledger and so you know that's a very abstract concept it's not like having a dollar in your pocket or a gold coin and you need to get your head around what money really is so before we get into the reasons of you know why we think a bit Bitcoin ETF may or may not be approved by the SEC let's talk in general about the backstory on Bitcoin in additional investment vehicles thus far Daniel you know you you mentioned actually some of these so can you describe a little bit more about you know maybe not just yours but other join related financial products yeah look like with any emerging asset class or emerging commodity of which I've seen a number in my career the early days are populated was almost like a space program with sort of trial and error experimentation where one is always running up against you know the limits for the technology which in this case might be regulation and so we've seen and we have a universe currently of some quite diverse and you know both geographically and structurally diverse products and I'll list a few of those if you want in no particular order so we have a company called revel Tura who have a big coin exchange-traded instrument listed on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange trading by appointment on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange that's an asset-backed euro denominated note custody by coin base it's not been very successful I think the bid to office spread is far too wide and the ticket size is too big then we have another company vantaa Bell operating in Switzerland Montebello and investment bank that issue a number of derivatives tracking all sorts of different assets that instruments on the Swiss law it's on the Swiss six exchange and has commonly something like seven thousand certificates outstanding at a Bitcoin per certificate so quite a small instrument no word on the sort of custody provisions there we have a company called ex ante operating more operating in Malta it's quite a popular exchange with offshore you know for offshore Russian trading it is it is it is not as tightly regulated and controlled as some of the Western multi multi product brokers like Interactive Brokers for example and it's also got a fairly wide bit to offer doesn't really trade a lot of volume very skinny on the documentation front we have the Bitcoin investment trust gbtc which I think we will probably be discussing in more detail later the u.s. trust vehicle that's selling some of its units to accredited investors we have Pantera backed by fortress Ribit and benchmark out in San Francisco they've turned into a much more private equity focused firm but they do have a Bitcoin liquidity fund I haven't seen the details on that but I suspect that's a Delaware company so it's just a private limited liability company Lee Robinson famed for his work at Trafalgar the UK brokerage company has a group called Altana they have a small Bitcoin fund and that's based in Monaco or he's based in Monaco and then yeah our our Gabi fund around five million in assets custody by Germany in Gemini and it bit listed on the Channel Islands securities exchange that fund is around five million dollars in assets and then the the two trackers we have coin xbt and coin xbe listed on NASDAQ OMX in Stockholm about thirty five million that's are passively traded exchange tracker very very similar to an ETF with two and a half cent fee and a ten percent sorry a ten basis point a bit offer so that's one two three four five six and eight vehicles in total and I think that just about covers the universe well it's interesting to me that most of them aren't really you know traded at a high volume because you know of the fact that gbtc tends to trade at a premium on over-the-counter markets you know why do you think that is well I think one has to be very mindful of the tremendous power of the onshore domestic us investor and I think that you know gbtc has a number of issues which we may get into which may or may not be solved by a subsequent filing with the SEC that is now underway but it's redeeming factor is that it's available to easily to onshore US investors and the premium of their tracks which is quite substantial I think is is is quite indicative of the native demand the pent up demand that exists in America for this kind of thing and the limited supply of product because I believe that mo the investors that would look at gbtc perhaps wouldn't look at some of the other jurisdictions of the products that I just mentioned so this actually then is a natural segue to today's main topic which is the Winklevoss investment trust or you know more generally actually a Bitcoin ETF but this is the one that is sort of in the news now three and a half years ago the Winklevoss twins who were actually previous guests here on Unchained but they weren't able to talk about their filing with the SEC but three and a half years ago they did file with the SEC to offer a Bitcoin ETF and that is you know likely to to result in a decision in March so Spencer can you tell us so far what's happened in their quest to get this approve and where where will we may end up with the in terms of the SEC s decision yeah absolutely so you know the exchange that the vinca voss twins are hoping to list their etf on has filed a request for a rule change with the SEC and that rule change has kind of been going through the process and it's a multi-step process and each point that you see can either choose to approve disapprove or extend their time period and so far they've gone through all the options of kind of extending the time period seeking additional public comments and posing some questions to the public as well so now we're at a point where March 11th is the final deadline so there is no opportunity to extend beyond March 11th as far as I'm aware and so before March 11th one of three things will happen either the SEC will approve or disapprove the necessary rule change the sponsoring party so it's the bat's exchange in this case will withdraw the rule change or there's kind of a third I call it an extremely low probability event where we hit the March 11th deadline and at least as far as I'm reading the rules and with everyone I've I've checked with there's a clause that says that if that's you see has not made a decision by that deadline the rule changes automatically approved and we can get into why that's a little bit interesting from kind of a game theory or political dynamic act a little bit later okay so before we get into into you know what might happen let's talk about all the different factors that the SEC considers when it's deciding whether or not to approve an offering like this you know um first of all why don't you guys tell me what you think all those factors are and then amongst those which are in favor of approval yeah I mean I think there's the things that are specific to the ving kvass filing and there's things that are broader than Bitcoin itself right and so I think that overall I think the greater the greater concerns are probably with broader Bitcoin issues itself or concerns there as opposed to specifics of the Winklevoss filings but if we do want to dive into some some specifics of the VIN kvass filing you know I think that there is some concern about whether or not the spot price on the gemini exchange accurately represents the price of Bitcoin it is not one of the most liquid exchanges out there but it is it does have the kind of highest regulatory approval in the form of a regulatory federal trust charter and so that federal Charter is actually the same thing that for example being why Mellon uses just to clarify for listeners who may not know Gemini is the exchange that the Winklevoss brothers run themselves but also a question for you is that a conflict of interest for them to to do that exactly yeah so that's exactly my next point here is just that you know there is I think at least some level of concern of conflict of interest there's at least the perception of it right so I'm quite confident there's not another ETF that exists in the u.s. where a single party or at least an affiliated party is both the sponsor the custodian and is responsible for kind of the exchange for the spot price and that asset value is derived from that is the case with with the vinkle vos filing I think it's easy to be highly critical of that aspect and to look at it and say oh they're just trying to make money on all sides of the table here I think when you dig in that's not really the case and I think the vinca vos twins would gladly you know give up any of those sides if they thought it would increase their chances approval but really I mean I think that they use their own exchange because again there are only two exchanges in the u.s. to have a federal trust charter that's the Gemini Gemini exchange that they run and also it bit which they use as the backup exchange in case there's any kind of technical interruption on the Gemini exchange and then as far as being the custodian I mean certainly there are other third-party custodians that you can use and some of the other filings out there do use third-party custodians but in this case I think that they really feel most comfortable just building you know controlling that and to end and being able to install kind of their own proprietary system where they feel it's really safeguarded the Bitcoin and has appeased all the concerns kind of from that you see and Daniel do you have anything to offer here on you know what factors that SEC will consider when making its decision yeah I mean I think Spencer makes some really good points there and generally speaking one would say you know is there a sufficiently good structure in place and that's you know a composite of just not the quality of the counterparties but that sort of chain of fiduciary management through that process now ironically I think if you look at the individual pieces so the trustee and Delaware Trust Company the exchange it's actually the Gemini auction price that the happens every day that the price of the NASA value is calculated by if you look at the very sophisticated storage protocol that Gemini trust has put in place in order to store bitcoins on behalf of the trustee and therefore can confer the ownership of those bitcoins to the investors themselves where on the stock lead EF those things are all very very high quality in fact our fund Gabby uses the the same storage protocol that the the Gemini trusts provide because we see them as a really highly regulated really professional very technically astute group of people who've adhered to the my DFS regulations which put Mendes personal and corporate responsibility on on the activities you do in the financial market so each of these components are actually very very high quality you're getting you know a fidelity bond to ensure that some performance you've undoubtedly got professional indemnity insurance directors and officers liability insurance and so on and so forth so it really is a very good structure and that's why we use part of it in what we do but there is this question about sort of both being the poacher and the gamekeeper and in fact you know strategically you know there is a case to say that one might use perhaps a different price index a couple of the other prospective ETFs do trade block for example provides a suitable index and you might you know potentially use alternative custodians or indeed spin the custody business out to another party there are some large US institutions making moves into the custody space in Bitcoin now those things may come too late for this particular filing and it is unfortunate that you know having filed 21 times now with the SCC since July of 2013 that there's sort of there's a concept here we're running out of Road but in many cases I think you know the the struck pieces of this structure that have been put together didn't even exist when this filing began and in some cases have only recently sort of come to fruition so at some point there was a need to actually self create the components that put this ETF together but as it stands they're all assembled sort of under one group of controllers and that is obviously asked asking some questions in the FCC's mind well I actually want to step back we you know we've really dived into the details on the Winklevoss brothers proposal here but you know I just even want to ask kind of more big-picture questions like do you think that Bitcoin itself as an investment is ready for you know being put into an etf structure and like I don't know if you do you guys think that that's a question that the SEC is grappling with or do you think that they consider it a foregone conclusion and it's just really the details of how such an investment vehicle is structured or I mean because I could think of other questions about you know liquidity or I mean you guys mentioned this a little bit but it was more around like how the Winklevoss brothers are coming up with the price but you know do think that the SEC thinks that bitcoin is really ready for for being put into an ETF I I personally believe it is I'm operating on you know three listed products currently and they seem to operate very well I don't see necessarily why you know US investors should be in principle deprived of that I think with Bitcoin you have to take a view as an investor that this is an emerging asset that it comes with some very high profile historical issues largely around you know use of Bitcoin for illicit activity anti-money laundering issues and the issues around security theft and hacking these are issues that have been pervasive in the Bitcoin market as a sort of a an experienced participant in this space I have to say that I think many of those risks have been ameliorated counteracted and addressed by things like the my DFS regulatory regime by the anti-money laundering provisions that pretty much every decent exchange now has in place which are in some cases rise to the level of opening a a bank account in terms of identification and the security protocols that are embraced in the new hardware security modules for example that Gemini's using to to perform cold storage all these things are really high quality solutions to some of the issues that Bitcoin has had so you know I personally think Bitcoin will change the world I think it's matured enough and I think there are enough really serious people banks regulators technology companies all sorts of different players now in the space doing sensible things and I do think that that the SEC should take a view on that and I do think that they should let it go in Spencer what about you yeah I guess to answer your specific question about whether or not it's a kind of foregone conclusion at the SEC that bitcoin is an asset that is itself worthy of an ETF you know they pose some questions for public comments I think if we comb through those we can get an idea of the things that are perhaps top of mind at the SEC again I don't have any special information other than that otherwise publicly available info but you know the very first question that they posed the public is that there has never been a purely digital asset in an ETF before and so I mean this is something that unlike a commodity it doesn't have a physical form and unlike a security or derivative it's not registered with any regulatory bottom body and so you know I guess another concern that they posed in there as well as that ownership of Bitcoin could in theory be changed by a coordination of a majority of the networks hashing rate now I mean within the Bitcoin industry we know that this risk is always evident but quite low but that's just one of them myriad factors that the SEC is really looking at here I mean other things are really just general broader market concerns so whether or not the Bitcoin market is somewhat stable if it's resilient if it's fair its efficient and whether or not you know the liquidity and transparency of some of the exchanges could enable any kind of market manipulation and then there's also concerns just more broadly about the risk of loss from from something like hacking and of course I think that in the specific filings that we've seen put forth especially the Ben kvass filing you know I think that these risks are highly mitigated but you know it's anybody's guess whether or not they're enough to kind of appease the concerns of the SEC okay that's those are some really great points right there and I actually want to circle back to you know your opinion cuz you did write about this but let's pause things right here to bring in an important word from our sponsor on-ramp the best companies in the world obsess about branding killer branding will transcend your company and strategically and competitively

examples of its work at think on-ramp com I'm speaking with Daniel masters of Global Advisors and Spencer Bogart of Needham & Company about the prospects for s AC approval of a Bitcoin ETF and Spencer you you know kind of laid out some general thoughts on what the SEC looks at in its decision making process but you actually recently put out a report saying that you think the chances of approval are 25% or less so why do you think it's likely not to be approved yeah again so I mean I'll come back to you know the the way we divided up some of the concerns that you see before which is there's the thing specific to the Vanco voss filing then there's the things that are related to Bitcoin and then there's kind of broader concerns as well so I think that we really need to take a heavy consideration of the general conservativeness with the SEC I mean if you think about just this just from kind of a game theory aspect if if I work at the SEC and I approve this ETF and a lot of money flows into it and something goes wrong you know there's a very good chance that I could lose my job over that if if I do approve the SEC and it goes extremely well it's very unlike that someone comes around to pat me on the back so give me a promotion right so there's one just that game theory aspect and then there's also the SCC's mission statement right so the very first task mentioned in the SEC is mission statement is to protect investors the very last thing they mentioned is to facilitate capital formation so I mean when we think about it like that a lot of the low probability that we put out of this ETF being approved is just a general conservativeness with the SEC that maybe this is an asset that's too early now you know for us when we look at the at the specific filing and we look at the concerns we do not see any reason to disapprove the ETF but again our analysis is not going to be the same as the FCC's and we generally think that conserved we'll prevail here and there's been a development since you put out that report which is that the Chinese government began taking a more active approach to regulating exchanges in China and for a long time the largest exchanges in China had no trading fees and so Bitcoin trading there was just through the roof and by most estimates although it was it was difficult to get an exact figure on it a lot of people would would say that trading in China accounted for 95% of all Bitcoin trading worldwide however since then the three biggest exchanges BTCC okay coin and Kuo be I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly have imposed trading fees and now training there is down by like 80 to 90 percent so you know since that development happened after your report came out how do you think that that you know affects your assessment yeah so obviously it's been really interesting watching the developments come out of China overall I think they're probably not a major factor for this specific filing I think that you know they could help slightly on the margin only really in the sense that there's been a misperception that China just dominates everything related to Bitcoin and you know that's true in some respects especially in mining but there's not nearly the same dominance in trading as has been kind of widely discussed in the media and so you know historically we've looked at it and you can see a lot of reports but to talk about how 95 to 98% of trading volume has been out of China historically just until last week when trading fees kind of came in but that was never really true it was never really an apples to apples comparison of volume anytime you have completely No Fee trading I mean I myself could sit there and swap a thousand Bitcoin back and forth myself that pumps up trading volume very very significantly but the the question is whether or not that volume is very meaningful and so in general comparing that the volume on those Chinese exchanges historically to other exchanges around the world was just not at all an apples to apples comparison and we've always pushed back in this notion that 98% of trading volume comes out of China I mean today we see probably a better in patient of what that actually looks like yeah well now it looks like nearly all the big exchanges are somewhat roughly even at least that's my reading on the quantity so when you say that you use to push back on that is it because you felt like the the trading wasn't meaningful and therefore it wasn't like necessarily really having much of an impact on the price is that kind of what what you meant by that you know impact on price is debatable but just at the volume just that it certainly wasn't an apples to apples comparison to compare the volume across these these No Fee exchanges and then the rest of the world were that did charge trading fees okay I mean I would I would jump in there if I can Laura yeah I think we need to be a little bit more precise about exactly what did go on in China and it's a Huber just say okay look the changes that were made were made specifically to the Chinese yuan denominated physical Bitcoin market which up until that point had been enjoying leverage that would you know leverage capability so you could buy you know five Bitcoin if he only had one Bitcoin worth the capital and there were as Spencer correctly pointed out no trading fees so that's changed the leverage has disappeared after the People's Bank of China walked into those three exchanges and started asking questions about investor protection marketing policies specifically with respect to dissing the Chinese yuan as a currency anti-money laundering provisions and so on and it certainly had a dramatic effect the timing was perfect because it was at the top of a very strong run the timing was perfect because it was just ahead of the Chinese holidays new year just still going on and so as is often the case when a central bank or a government gets involved in a marketplace they do pick extraordinarily good moments and they do have a very dramatic effect and if you look at what other banks and central bank central banks and regulators and governments have done in the past whether it's United States releasing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during price spikes for oil or the UK intervening its own currency in 92 to shored up in the Exchange Rate Mechanism or Alan Greenspan's irrational exuberance comments the activities by you know the big that these big people tend to be somewhat dramatic in the short term effective in the short term but are usually always Pyrrhic victories because these markets normally go right back to where they were now in this Chinese case the Chinese domestic yuan market was not the the only market going on okay coin for example have a very very active futures market this denominating it's a dollar based market and even post they clamp down on some of the right you know the the excessive practices in China we still see a hundred million dollars in open interest on their contracts we're seeing a hundred million dollars a day in volume we're seeing a billion dollars a day on a big day of volume and and that's real that is that is you know that is not a free market to trade and that you you know you have to put down your margin and you have to pay fees in order to trade that so so the you know the total the total eradication of volume in China and they sort of fakeness of it isn't only partially true and it's been localized to that domestic market the rest of the Chinese market is actually quite healthy that tends not to be reported on the source sites you just mentioned like honesty because it's not physical Bitcoin its derivative but it's still a very significant market now in relation to the Winklevoss ETF and other ETFs one of the push backs that the SEC could possibly have had is that it's unusual for a US ETF to be based on an asset which trades primarily outside the United States it's not it's not that it never happens you know there was a copper ETF for example and everybody would tell you that you know China is the most important market for copper but there is a small copper market on the seamy and there are ETFs that sort of trade off of that so it's not unusual it's unusual but it's not it's not that you know completely never the case that a market for an ETF can be based on something which trades perhaps or is influenced by a foreign market and that would be true in the case of copper so in some funny way you know if you go back a year you might have said well there's no of Bitcoin trading to support an ETF now along comes China and gets very very active possibly two active corrects to a more sensible level of activity but still a significant market but indeed these markets have come more back into line so you sort of have to pick your poison here are you concerned that there's not enough Bitcoin trading to support a Bitcoin ETF and because you know some of that's in China or are we now happy that the volume is much less in China and therefore it's more evenly balanced across the West you kind of can't have your cake and eat it in that respect great well so but but I do want to know you know now what it seemed to that do you guys think that it would seem to us you see that there isn't enough trading I personally think I mean look we're quite active in the markets on a day-by-day basis both for our exchange-traded notes we have people coming in to buy and sell those every day that our fund is a sort of a monthly liquidity vehicle so we have for you know periods where we're taking subscriptions there and then we we do actively managed that fund as well so we're in the markets every single day as I mentioned our assets around 40 million under management we have no problem whatsoever moving those kind of volumes around to suit our clients needs and to perfect our hedging strategies so I think there is enough for you to do an ETF Spencer what do you think yeah I mean there are certainly EPS whose underlying asset is less liquid than Bitcoin so you know I mean depending on how many assets the actual volume of assets that flow into this ETF I mean certainly you know it could be challenging the source enough liquidity to be able to acquire the bitcoins for the ETF but again I mean there are significantly less liquid markets underlying assets that do have an ETF and Spencer Daniel did you know give his opinion on what he thinks the SEC should do but we didn't actually get that from you what what do you think that season you should do should it approve a Bitcoin ETF yeah I mean you know certainly as I mentioned we don't see any specific reason to disapprove the ETF I mean as I think if you were I mean if you're rooting for Bitcoin in the long term I think that there is both puts and takes here right I mean I think the approval of an ETF certainly at least on the margin improves regulatory risk slightly there will there would certainly be an Associated positive shift in perception so again kind of this this historical association of Bitcoin with the listed activity and instead if you get me TF with kind of a CC stamp of approval on it you know I think that certainly in the broader public's mind set that's a positive shift I think that there's also at least some level of risk if you're hoping for Bitcoin to be successful in the long term and just that an ETF could be very very popular a Bitcoin ETF now that's certainly not a reason to disapprove and I certainly hope that CC does not make any decisions according to you know that particular metric I mean if so we would never approve things that the investing public wants but you know I think that a very significant sum of assets would likely flow into this ETF I think it would be very difficult in that type of environment to source the underlying Bitcoin without drastically pushing up price and so I think that you know we would have a very significant bull run if an ETF were approved and again I mean that's not necessarily bad for Bitcoin but you know too much too soon can certainly be a bit destabilizing we saw that in the 2013 run and then the subsequent mount cox implosion and you know certainly an etf could have a similar price action I hope not but then wouldn't that problem simply get worse if they waited longer to approve it meaning you know if they approved it now then that would be kind of the minimal amount of you know disruption it would cause whereas sorry go ahead jump in denim you know I just wanted to just chime in with one extra point as we're talking about this before we move somewhere else but they I think he got a look at for example one of the pivotal developments in the commodity ETF world which was the launch of GLD in 2000 the the u.s. gold ETF I was very active in the gold market prior to that ETA and if you'd have told me that that ETF could grow to 80 billion dollars which it did I would have said the gold market was couldn't possibly sustain an etf of that size but what happens in practice and this is not just with GLD it's with us oh and the natural gas ETF and some other metal ETFs the fact is that these ETFs in some way create more liquidity in the market and the gold market today the underlying futures and cash market for gold is far more active than it was prior to the issue of the ETF and indeed in terms of sourcing that gold ETF started from zero and peaked at around 1400 tons of gold a number which I think back in the day you know I'm one percent of all gold in the world above-ground you know you take out central bank reserves and countrywide reserves it is actually a very significant number you add to that some other ETFs in other locations you can double or triple it that was that was a number that people didn't really think had happened so so in some ways this has sort of become self-fulfilling the liquidity that people may be worried about isn't there actually becomes created when these instruments that appear hmm Spencer I actually also wanted to bring up something that you had written about in your report which is that you estimated that a 300 million dollars would flow into Bitcoin in its first week if a Bitcoin ETF were approved how did you come up with that figure yeah sure so I mean it's a ballpark figures I mean there's no there's no precise quantitative way to arrive at exactly what the assets would be but I mean what we did was we looked at some of the most successful ETF launches out there so I think you know for example to put it in perspective I think GLD attracted somewhere is in the order of 800 million dollars in its first week something like 1.3 billion in its first month I think EFA which is a developed market ex-us ETF also attracted something like 800 million also in its first week so I mean this gives us some ballpark of what a highly successful ETF launch looks like and then I think the next question if asked is why would you assume that a Bitcoin ETF would be on the highly successful end of that spectrum and I think the main reason is because it would be the first vehicle that is really widely available to institutional investors in the US so again we kind of did an overview of some of the vehicles that are available in the u.s. today it's mostly a smattering of relatively small hedge funds and then the Bitcoin investment trust which trades on OTCQX as takur gbtc and you know that is the best vehicle that is available for institutional investors within the needing us listed product today but it's not without its warts right I mean this is a product that either you pay a twenty five to thirty percent premium on if you want to buy it on the exchange or if you had previously wanted to get into the private placement into the Bitcoin investment trust was only available to accredited investors and came with a one-year lockup period now since the Bitcoin investment Trust has filed for their s-1 they've closed private placement and so they're there you can no longer subscribe to the Bitcoin investment trust and your only option is to buy it on the exchange but so I mean when we look at what what does a full fledged ETF looks like where the supply and and where the creation and redemption of shares it's very fluid I mean again that's the first time that large sums of institutional capital could really flow into this space and I think that that aspect gathering would really be aided by kind of a perfect storm for Bitcoin right so we'd have this this first kind of investable vehicle for many and then again the things that I've talked about before which is that perception would be improved regulatory risk would be down in price would be rallying which is going to drive incremental news flow and a lot of additional interest in Bitcoin so I think that it's very easy to get to a 300 million dollar number within the first week I mean again we think that's conservative so you mentioned the gray scale of filing and I actually just want to talk you know about pretty much all the other filings with the SEC for a Bitcoin ets because there's also one by a blockchain company called solid X and so I just want to hear from you guys you know do you have any reason to believe that any of the other filings have a better chance with the SEC and just to generally sort of compare you know these these proposals yeah I think the Winklevoss ETF is the best in class that's the bottom line the solid xs-1 filing doesn't differ none of these filings different meaning firmly and meaningfully from each other it so happens the solid X trusses in New York State Trust as opposed to a Delaware trust no big deal but just like with a Winklevoss trust you know Bank of New York and as far as the s-1 is currently constituted Bank of New York is the trustee the administrator and the custodian and there's a comment there saying the sponsor will provide custody services related to the Const custody of trust Bitcoin so ie looks like solid X I've got their own custody solution just the same way as the winklevosses do but I can guarantee they don't have the technical infrastructure that would would match what the winklevosses currently have with bi T that's a very interesting filing the digital currency group the who our own grayscale investments the sponsor had some issues with the SEC back in July last year over the mechanics of distributing and marketing the shares in vit this filing while it will have if it's successful the same effect as the other ones is almost necessary because VI T's been running into problems you can read that filing there was a judgment a settlement between grayscale and the SEC it needs to do this in order to continue marketing units in in vit once again Bank of New York trustee agent so a transfer agent of the trust and the administrator and the custodian there is a PO Zappo is a great company when sis's Oris is a visionary in the Bitcoin space the custody solution there is not completely clear to me so you know of these two other options some you know be IT and solid X it would seem to me that not only is the Winklevoss trust definitely first to get to the to the decision line on March the 11th for better or for worse I believe it's a better product overall and I would that if it so happens that the SEC deny coin and the Winklevoss ETF I think there is zero prospect to the other ones happening as a result Spencer yeah I'm not sure that that the odds are too different for any of the other filings other than the Winklevoss twins again I think that the greater portion of concerns that this you might be considering our broader Bitcoin related as to something as opposed to something specific about the vinca vas filing but you know when we really look at some of the differences between the filings I mean Daniel touched on on custodian and that's probably one of the most important factors there of course with SEC their only concern is the Bitcoin stored securely but there are there are other factors at play here as well such as you know what is the reference price for Bitcoin so I mean we talked about how the vehicle vas filing uses the Gemini spot price so the exchange their own exchange their the solid X filing uses trade blocks xpx index which we reference before again that's a volume weighted index of US dollar denominated exchanges and then there's the grayscale filing which uses the price from a particular exchange that they determine annually and review quarterly there's there's a couple other factors that could be important at play here as well and one of those is insurance this comes up a lot in discussions that I have and generally the sentiment among people at least from the first enquiring is that because solid x appears to have insurance on their filing but it might be more likely to get approved I'm not sure that that's really the case I think that the first thing to note in regards to insurance here is that it's my understanding that there is not an efficient market for insuring custodianship of Bitcoin and we've seen this with a few companies that used to prior have have insurance on their holdings and if since have since removed that principally because their insurers one kept ratcheting up the price and to simultaneously decreasing the amount of coverage so the exact situations under which the insurance would kick in I think that at this point it's extremely difficult for any actuary out there price in every wrist aspect in the storage of Bitcoin you know I'm quite confident that you know that what the vengabus twins have proposed here is it's secure and it's sound but I think that it's very difficult for an insurance company to be comfortable with that with you know potentially hundreds of millions of dollars at risk and so both the vinkle vas filing and the grayscale filing have chosen to not put insurance with that ETF the solid x1 does but according to the filing at least it only covers ten million dollars it might just be because you know that's relative to the initial filing amount which I believe that solid X filing was always for a million dollars but again this really comes down to a cost-benefit analysis of whether or not the insurance makes sense here and I'm just not convinced but there is actually an efficient market here a couple of the other factors just differentiating between these the ETFs are the exchange of course right so the vinkle basa twins filing for the bass exchange the other two filings are both for the New York Stock Exchange and then there's there's a difference in the creation and redemption process so this is how new shares of the ETF are either created or redeemed and it's that process that actually keeps the price of the ETF in line with the value of the underlying assets that it represents that's very important to again keeping the the price of the ETF from trading at a premium or a discount relative to its value I mean in this case it appears that all of the filings allow for in-kind creations in redemptions which means that to create new shares you have to literally submit the underlying Bitcoin and when I say you actually mean an authorized participant so these are special traders out in the market that help facilitate this creation and redemption process but one of the filings solid X also appears to be filing to allow for cash creates and redeems which would mean that instead of submitting the underline Bitcoin they submit the equivalent in cash and then it is up to kind of a party associated with the ETF to actually source the underlying Bitcoin and these are just some of the factors that that could weigh here in the consideration well but for that last one is is solid X way of doing it better or worse than the others yeah that's fair I'm not sure that it really improves the odds at all I in fact they don't think it does okay well so far all of our discussion has been around these Bitcoin ETFs that are being proposed by specialized issuers how do you think this would play out differently with traditional ETF issuers got involved well I've had some experience with that Laura you know in addition to the exchange traded instruments that we currently list we are going to issue some more there's definitely demand here in Europe amongst clients that we know and understand to take that further and to penetrate other regulatory pockets if you like the use its market the European market even the Asian market you know Korea Japan that's definitely strong inter strong interest to get access to these kind of products so you know the question you're asking you know where where does that leave traditional ETF players now you know we can rattle through the names I think they're probably well known most of these companies that run ETFs run multiple ETF sometimes hundreds of them and you know the bigger the bigger houses we'll have you know any number of offerings in different provinces - all different kinds of investors the issue is this this isn't this is a groundbreaking product without a doubt there is risk associated with it I believe it offers investors something they really want and I think are there risks involved that they're prepared to take that are mitigated in a really solid way that being said if you think about a legacy player in the ETF space why would you for the sake of one more ETF out of the sake of 200 ETFs choose one that had you know lots of associated reputation Eliska regulatory risk even risk of potential you know hacking or something nasty like that just to get one 200th of your fee base on top you know you could really sort of potentially pass perch besmirched the the reputation of a company and that's why I think that you know legacy incumbents in the ETF space have to date not to be interested in doing this hmm Spencer what about you yeah I really agree I think that the the large ETFs yours out there will kind of play a wait-and-see see game for even if an ETF is approved for it for a while afterwards people watch and see how successful is the ETF you know how much is this worth and of our time and reputational risk here getting associated with Bitcoin you know presuming that significant sum of assets flows in and it's worth kind of the additional fee revenue I wouldn't be surprised to see the traditional ETF issuers call it a black rock or a vanguard or both of them kind of move into the space in really when it comes down to it the ETF space is really a game of scale so when you when you have multiple BTS that are out there that provide extremely similar coverage it really comes down to the fees associated with it and how liquid the fund is so you know I could see like a Blackrock kind of coming out a while after a specialized issuer has a fund and after they've seen it have success with gathering assets I mean offer a fund that kind of a fraction of the price and just slowly over time kind of bleed away those assets into their own ETF okay great well this has been such a fascinating discussion thank you both so much for coming on the
