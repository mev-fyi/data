Chang angel investor and writer welcome Tony thanks for having me this is the second week in a row I'm doing the show about yield farming here on unconfirmed because people are continuing to talk about it like crazy so let's just start with the basics what is yield farming your farming is some as something that hmm what is your I'll start from the basics so there are ways to borrow and lend money on atheria and normally when you lend money you can earn an interest rate because the borrower's are paying for the opportunity to borrow the money from you recently some of the platforms that have that facilitate this transaction between the borrowers and lenders have been giving people a sort of subsidy like a cash back for both borrowing and lending so this cash back has been so lucrative that people have been creating and changing up their strategies across multiple platforms to maximize the amount of cash back they can get at times this has been as lucrative as a hundred percent two hundred percent annualized returns on just simply lending and borrowing money and it's been fluctuating wildly over the last couple of weeks and with a couple new tokens that are being introduced to the markets that's been adding even more opportunity for new strategies as well as more volatility in the overall space and so just walk us through an example a cane Warwick synthetics was on the show last week and talked about how people were doing this on comp maybe but he kind of glossed over quickly so you can use that as an example or you know any of these other tokens sure so the compound is really where it's gotten started on compound you can borrow and lend a handful of cryptocurrencies notably US dollar variants like USD T USD see and I as well as rapid a coin which is a Bitcoin on aetherium aetherium itself and like two or three old coins with other coins that are on aetherium each of these coins have their own markets so the rate to borrow USD T is different from the rate to borrow aetherium and that's all just based on supply and demand and the degree to which the team the compound thinks those are risky assets to borrow and lend so the curve that determines the rates vary slightly in normal times people are mostly borrowing this money to express their to get more leverage in the market so a really popular way to use the platform before was to deposit aetherium lend that out to get a stable coin like dye and then use that dye to buy more aetherium so they have more theorem exploited over all that cost something for the borrower usually and that rate has been somewhere between you know one and ten percent depending on the times what happened when what's new is that comp compound their governance token and this token is going to be used as art is actually already being used today for the community to vote on changes to the parameters of the system things like adding new tokens changing the curve that determines the the rates even the decision to like distribute the compound token to the community itself that was something that was done through this governance process the way they're distributing it is splitting every day they have a block just like a chunk of compound that they're distributing to all of their users and the way they calculate that is 50% goes to the lenders in the market and 50% goes to the borrower's and the way they decide how much each person gets is based on how much interest there either earning or they're receiving so if you want to maximize the amount of this token that you get you want to have the highest share of that interest on either side that you possibly can so that's led to all sorts of crazy things because the compound token itself was priced by the market are pretty high price I think it listed the team put it on unis WAP so that there was a market for it around I want to say around $20 I don't know exactly what it was but like directionally there and then at its peak it went up to almost $400 and for the most of that first week was hovering around 200 that was a lot higher than anybody expected and so the result of that was you could borrow at really high rates like 30% plus APY like you're paying out that much to borrow things but you're still positive because the value of the compound that you're earning from borrowing was so much higher than the fees that you were paying to borrow and this this is basically where the term yield farming came to be because it's not simply just borrowing and lending first a use case anymore it's really gaming the system and wrote like rotating your crops so to speak between two the most popular markets so that you could maximize your overall profits yeah I find it pretty nutty that people can earn money from borrowing and it doesn't sound like something that happens normally in real life and some yeah interest rates that you're talking about I mean it's pretty eye-opening but I just wondered so is this sustainable because in a way it's just like compound is incentivizing people to you go on there and either borrow or lend but only to get more comp not for the actual activity right so I'm not sure where this is gonna go yeah so it's definitely not sustainable forever the rates have to end up converging on the organic market for the borrowing and lending so the a few ways is with compresses on the supply side you just see way more capital coming and competing for the same fixed rate of those rewards that just means like every person every dollar in the system gets less and less of that share it which makes it less profitable for everybody overall we already saw that like massive massive influence on to compound to compete for these rewards the other way it could compress is the price of compound itself goes down and as a result the rewards in dollar terms goes down for everybody that's competing for them as well and both of these things have been happening and just over the long term it doesn't really make sense for it to be not positive tomorrow the real question is like a what is the long-term value of doing these things because if it's just kind of shuffling chairs around on a deck it really doesn't matter it's just like a short-term arbitrage thing and and I think a lot of people feel that that may be the case that's one and the second thing is what is like the actual value of doing this thing is there any point to this other than juicing up engagement for individual platforms and I think both those are pretty interesting conversations but on the first one like I think this degree of rewards is not going to last forever because it's a bad deal for a compound to be paying out this much money to for like the return on the engagement right they don't they actually don't have a high incentive to just give away free money so to speak to the people that are most sophisticated I gaming the system but what they actually end up want to do is they want to get a fair distribution of their coins to as many people that are most likely took the users of their platform and stewards of the direction of the platform for the long term that's the end goal the end goal is how do you come up with a good strategy to give control of the platform to the users who care about it most and this is super early days for figuring this out it's clearly imperfect but that's like that's the vision and this is a way to do it what weather this is a really short term fat or whether we're gonna have to keep thinking about this rule it really depends on how many new projects are going to continue introducing these types of incentivized engagement things and how much the market values these subsidies and I think my prediction is that we're gonna see a lot more of it before it starts to cool down just because there are so many projects in dfi that fit into this whole ecosystem where it makes sense to try to create a governance token and start to give away control to the users there's a bit of a frenzy here for sure but the the the activities are going to keep going I think we're going to see more of this type of thing directionally the yields being a hundred percent to our percent probably not yeah I would be curious to know how many different addresses now have comp like whether it's and and kind of those addresses look like in terms of the other tokens they own because I just wonder if it's sort of making the same crypto rich group richer and just sort of distributing amongst the same people alright so in a moment we're gonna discuss the potential downsides of yield farming but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible diversify has partnered with Stark where to bring serious traders a speed and security advantage without sacrificing the cornerstones of profitable trading they enable high speed UI or API access to deeply liquid order books instant execution of 9,000 plus trades per second as well as rapid withdrawal certainty for when you need to move fast if you're an arbitrage algorithmic or day trader you can capitalize on the best of centralized trading while preserving complete control of your assets 24/7 want the edge head to de ve our si fi comm and learn more today in response to the challenging times crypto TOCOM is introducing three measures to help the community first the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months second you can now get up to ten percent back by using the MCO Visa Card on food and grocery shopping lastly you could buy gift cards on the crypto comm app from merchants like Whole Foods Safeway Burger King and more and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries download the crypto comm app today back to my conversation with Tony Chang so actually before we talk about the downsides I did well I also just want to ask I mean the the amount that you can earn for borrowing and lending something like tether as opposed to a US DC or eath in particular really any of these other coins that you can earn money from income like why is it that tether paste so much more you know on in compound it's mostly just a function of how the platform determines the rates so tether was the first one that yield farmers figured out they could get the rates up very high and you can do that by just borrowing a ton of it if you borrow a ton of it then that means there's more demand to borrow and that increases the fee that you have to pay to borrow it that in turn increases the fee that the interest rate you can get for lending it and then that the the balance of the supply and demand is what determines the rates and they have a high incentive to keep the rates high because they want the rates high because there are any more comp and that's profitable for them so what happened is like the rates were pretty stable going into this once it happened they realized tether was the market that they could move the interest rate up highest most quickly because there's a huge supply of gather and you can just keep dump borrowing and borrowing and borrowing but eventually that rotated to be 80 and 0x which are less liquid coins which they could move the interest rate up even further so these are the type of games people are playing it's just going to be continuously playing this game with all the like the folks with the most weight behind their activities and it's just there's never going to be a stable equilibrium here they're just going to be constantly shuffling things around and people trying to go move to the more profitable strategy the more people that move there the last possible it gets so they have to come up with a new one and so on and so forth and people are also you know I mean maybe you kind of describe this slightly but they're basically borrowing tether and then once they borrow it then they lend it also and so there's sort of leveraging so how much leverage are people using when they yield for I don't know an average I'd actually be really interested to see that I think it's pretty common to do one loop of depositing something borrowing something using that to buy something depositing it again borrowing something else you can do that until you're out of borrowing power and I think like I think it's pretty common to do one loop it's probably pretty common to get up to like three or four X leverage I think people are doing crazier things and that as well but the I think the key here is that leverage is scary people should be very careful with leverage the nice thing though is in deify it's all transparent so there's no like scary black box where money disappears and it's way more leverage than you think it is and everything falls apart there there could be a daisy chain of liquidations for sure like something wrong goes something goes wrong somewhere and that just kind of collapsed everything everybody gets liquidated but we have more eyes on it and we don't have ways to borrow under collateralized which means like if I have one dollar I can't borrow ten I need to have ten dollars to borrow and like eight or something so those are all sort of what would you call them just just just just things that I put a put a ceiling on the degree of leverage that can be in the system right now all right so let's know talk about the risks you did a nice little tweet storm on this and there are at least from your tweet storm kind of three main things people should be worried about or careful about so why don't you walk us through what those are sure so the three ways you can lose your money yield farming the three main ones there are other ones too but the three main ones are a you deposit money into an app to try to farm yield and that money gets robbed somehow when you today robbed what do you mean it just somebody takes it that you don't expect that they shouldn't be able to take it so the most common way we've seen this happen is a hacker finds a vulnerability in a smart contract the where you're depositing the money and then they're able to drain the funds run away with them and then sell them another way that's been much less common is especially with more reputable projects is that there is some secret way that the team can actually go and access the smart contract change it and then take the funds themselves and third like it doesn't even have to be malicious intent sometimes there's just a mistake and then the funds get frozen and nobody can get them anymore or something like that so it's really just like smart contracts are pretty difficult to build there there's a long history of owner abilities with smart contracts so it is it should be one of the first questions you have in your mind like what is the risk that the smart contract fails heuristics that people can use to sort of gauge that is how long have they been around unchanged how many security audits have there been how much capital has a secured over some long period of time it sort of gives you more confidence that there are fewer risks of an unknown vulnerability but those risks multiply and and one way they can mitigate that now is to use my contract insurance Nexus mutual and open I think both offer insurance on compound I believe Nexus got tapped out completely like they don't have any more capacity to insure a compound just because of how much demand there is to insure it but over time like this is going to become a more mature market you'll be able they get coverage on anything that you want and there are a couple other ways one that we sort of hinted at earlier is people can get like what they did yes the liquidations have been happening I'm actually curious for more numbers on this I would love to see somebody do a report on actually how much has been liquidated from from my conversations with people that run liquidation boss it doesn't seem like it's been super crazy like they haven't been making money hand over fist liquidating people so that's not something but yeah you can get liquid anytime you borrow money like you borrow money then these systems work by maintaining a ratio of cloud roll to your bar oh so like we had talked about before I need to put down $10 to borrow $8 or something else if my initial deposit falls below what the system requires of me then don't start doing things to make sure that everybody gets paid back and usually what that is is they sell whatever deposit you put down for what you borrowed to pay it off and you get what's left over that can be really painful because the exchange rates aren't always good you usually get hit with a big penalty and like if you're chasing you know 100 percent would you present you'll a year and you've only been in the system for two days and you get like waited and get a 50% like fee on it you've lost a lot of money so it's important for people to keep those risks in mind but these really aren't unique to yield farming this is just leverage of scary people should to take caution and is that based on the US dollar value of the collateral yes okay and the last it's it's it's actually the sorry it's it is the US dollar but like more specifically it's the exchange rate between what you deposit in what you borrow so if that exchange rate deviates too much so peeling your wooden tether and then or sorry if you put down Ethan then borrow bad or something exactly okay it's still kind of reduces to the USD price for both of them but just like you know it's technically it's the exchange rate between the two okay and the last way that people can lose their money is that the value in the asset itself can get robbed which was very interesting can you describe what that one right yeah this isn't one that people have to think about too much outside of crypto in crypto we have a lot of assets that are either synthetically created or there they are like fiat coins or you know you take something in the real world you lock it up and you wish your token and say hey like this thing is has claims on this much of this other thing and so the simplest way to think about this is through us DT or USD C which are both US dollar fiat coins here people are depositing US dollars into some bank account and then the system mints aetherium version of that dollar and you can try that around that's what USD and USD see are there's been a ton of controversy over USD T in particular because people are worried that they're under why's that they only have different accusations that they're only like 85 or 87 percent collateralized and actually they had admitted that that was the case and then they took on like to fill the gap they had like promises of future dollars or something like that to make it a hundred percent anyways that there's not something I've really spent a lot of time on but the the worry is if it's not a hundred percent back then your US dollar aetherium coin actually isn't worth one dollar it's worth whatever ratio it is it actually should be a discount to that because you can't trust them to report the truth anymore so you could see it go like all the way down to zero because everybody just doesn't want it anymore why this matters is like say you've taken out a loan in USD T something like this happens the value of your loan drops sharply even though you thought that it was dollars borrowing dollars so the risk was low you're a liquidator you there's a bunch of money everything sucks and there and and that there are that's like the really toy example of it there are other ways especially the synthetic ones there are more complex ways that you the value of your perceived value of the thing is actually not matched with the actual value of it like an in fact smart contract Mulliner abilities could could be a reason why something that should be pegged to a dollar ends up falling off that peg all right well so I mean we've been talking about because both the I don't I don't know if I even want to call them benefits because I get worried a little bit that people won't think that this is just easy money but then obviously there are the risks and so I just wonder overall like what do you think the significance is of yield farming for both defy and the crypto space like is this kind of just a flash in the pan and it'll die out cuz its unsustainable sort of like the ICO craze or do you think that this will be some kind of fundamental building block of crypto that we're seeing being formed I think it'll become more subtle I think it'll stick around but it won't be as like people won't I did self-identify as a yield farmer um they might for a while like I co air I lasted I mean people think it was a flash in the pan but you know it lasted a while like and even even after the craziness like people filling a 30 million dollar ICO and one block like on a PowerPoint deck like that that went away pretty fast but raising funds to capitalize a project with tokens like people are still doing it right so but we just don't think of it as ICO Crusoe I think it may be a similar analogy there but what is important too I think the useful analogy that I haven't heard too much yet is this is a subsidy to the overall market that's just going to get baked into the economics of the market just like VC subsidizing consumer goods startups give you cheaper prices on food delivery like ride-sharing like buying mattresses stuff like that eventually the bottom can fall out and like but who loses it's the company's the the investors etc because the unit economics weren't good at the end of the day you still need the organic demand to be high enough to justify the existence of a thing but what's new about this is you're taking that model of subsidizing the marketplace to bootstrap the marketplace period which is shown is proven to be a winning strategy in a market a marketplace business if done correctly and successfully and then you're adding community ownership to these things so it'd be like instead of getting a few percent off of your grocery delivery it's every time you're delivering goods or you're buying your groceries or getting a little piece of instacart you know a lot of quibbles here on the equivalents of equity versus these tokens and stuff like that I'm not going to get into that but that's the vision the vision is as we're bootstrapping these things Oz we're in these early phases you're going to be subsidizing people for taking up early risk doing things that are kind of new and unproven and maybe they won't work out at the end of the day they're gonna be rewarded by being like the stewards of these these platforms so if everything works out we're gonna you know shake off this mania pretty quickly then it'll just be like there's there's some extra incentives in the market to go and use these things that are unproven don't have as much like real-world utility yet and eventually get to a state where some of these things are super valuable their core infrastructure and along the way we've like given you know the thousands hopefully tens of billions of people that use it a little piece of it and that gives the community a way to keep keep keep developing it and make sure that they're in service of the community and not you know some kind of other and trust fingers crossed you know that's that's that's the goal okay well yeah we'll see what happens watching the whole thing is it just feels like it's like watching a bunch of people walk at tightrope so we'll see how it goes anyway all right well this has been super fun thanks for coming on unconfirmed yeah thanks for having me on don't forget to stay tuned for the weekly news recap stick around for this weekend crypto after this short break in this crisis many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets others seek to maximize the yield on their cash next allows you to achieve both of these goals the company offers

what's more interest is paid out daily and you can add or withdraw funds at any time get started at neck so I oh thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline aquaponic yield farming if you've been watching this yield firming trend wondering what exactly is going on check out a recent post by Daniel it's RFID okolab ventures called aquaponic yield farming he says quote lending and exchange protocols particularly ones that utilize pooled liquidity and automated market makers are naturally symbiotic lending protocols like compound in Ave want large quantities of assets to be deposited in their liquidity pools to maximize loan availability while minimizing borrowing costs exchange protocols like you know swap and balancer want large quantities of assets to be deposited in their liquidity pools to maximize the potential size and volume of trades while minimizing slippage they don't care whether the assets in their pools are receipts for loan collateral so long as there is sufficient unutilized liquidity in the lending pool to enable withdrawals as needed then he describes how people are earning from lending using that money to yield from trading and then making more money available for lending next headline what effect do coin based listings have on listed assets coin metrics did a detailed analysis of how coin based listings have impacted the prices of the listed crypto assets unsurprisingly prices tended to immediately rise after the announcement but the size of the increase does vary based on whether it's a bull or bear market for instance before its December 2018 announcement most assets listed were dropping in price afterward the asset saw price rebounds of on average 50 percent against Bitcoin in August 2019 the coin had just hit highs that July but it started to trend down for assets announced then there was an immediate bump of 10% but by a hundred days out many of the prices had dropped and finally for new assets announced in June 2020 the listing announcement was made as asset prices were turning upward after the sell-off in March afterward asset prices continued to rise coin metrics warrants at the 132 % pop that Omi's ago saw after its listing announcement is an outlier and the mean and median values for appreciation against USD Bitcoin and eath are usually between negative 1% and 14% next headline wire card issuer of
