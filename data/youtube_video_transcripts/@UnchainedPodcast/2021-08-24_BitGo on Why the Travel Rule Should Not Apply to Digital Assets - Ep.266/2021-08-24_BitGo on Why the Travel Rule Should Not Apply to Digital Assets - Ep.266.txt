chief compliance officer at bitco welcome mike and jeff thanks for having us great to see you again laura it's been been a long time in this industry you've been through it thick and thin i really haven't it's been so fun it's honestly been the ride of my life and i just loved every minute um all right why don't we before we get into the discussion why don't we just start with a basic description of bitco bitco's also been around uh forever but just for people who may be new to the space mike sure well let's see bitco got started in in one of the early generations back in in 2013 started out you know technology company pioneered multi-signature technology which is used you know almost everywhere today for securing large amounts of digital asset we've grown to support uh over 20 different blockchains several hundred tokens provide infrastructure to a large portion of the ecosystem continuing to push forward on security and compliance i guess that's why we're here today talk about low compliance we are regulated trust company in two different states both south dakota and also new york we also have regulated entities abroad to about half our business here in the us half outside the u.s and um i think most recently you know bitcoin galaxy have have agreed to merge um so that that deal is still in progress uh hopefully closing and not not too long but that's uh that's where we're going next and that's that's all about institutional adoption digital assets right and so that's a little bit a little about bitcoin and so speaking of institutional adoption jeff you spent many years in traditional finance before making the jump to crypto um some of those years were at pershing city lima brothers goldman and then you did spend time at coinbase before joining bitco why did you decide to leave traditional finance for crypto uh great question uh you know after being 25 years doing you know some of the same things every day sometimes you look for something entrepreneurial or a little more innovative and when i received a call to join coinbase i hadn't really researched crypto yet but in taking the call i i figured i had to do some homework and i found myself getting really enthusiastic about what was the promise of crypto what could it do and to have a seat at the table to help shape regulation for a brand new asset class was just too hard to turn up and it's been exciting three years in the space and really looking forward to what the next five years will bring and so what do you do as a chief compliance officer and how would you say that that or how would you say that compliance in the crypto space differs from that of traditional finance sure i think the first question that gets asked when you're talking about crypto or regulation is is it only used for bad guys why do we need it you know venmo and paypal and other you know payment processors work fine here and i think the answer is it's a global uh challenge we don't have paypal in venmo around the globe uh it's very expensive to do remittance and uh so the first thing i do is you know i set up an aml program right how do we identify and find the bad actors how do we report them to law enforcement and have a risk-based reasonably designed compliance program and the other part of my job is working with regulators and whether that's getting new licenses running a program which needs to have trading compliance surveillance aml policies and procedures it's very similar to traditional finance we're overseen by the new york dfs they don't have a different rulebook for us than they do citibank or bank of new york mellon who they also oversee so it's really combining what you've done in traditional finance but in a fast-moving and brand new asset class where some of the technology is just different than the traditional market and mike since mikko i started you know really as um like a crypto custody company and um you know obviously like you were really a big pioneer in that how would you say crypto custody differs from being a traditional financial custodian well as jeff said you know in a lot of ways it shouldn't but a big part of what we do is help regulators kind of through the process right so look we got into this space because we do see the opportunity to make a financial system that is far superior to what we've seen in the past in terms of transparency in terms of fairness and equality and also being global as jeff said this is the first time we've really had the pipes connected around the planet so this creates a lot of confusion you know people look at at digital assets and they're like this is just different i remember the first time i uh is one of my early pitches to traditional finance was out at jp morgan it was really kind of an exploratory they were learning what what crypto was is probably i don't know 2015 or 16 or something like that and just describing how how digital assets work what is multi-sig how do the private keys work all this you start to see the light bulbs go off where they get it and and when i started to segue that with like well here's how traditional markets work and here's how they should think about it you know they could start start to relate to it i remember asking them afterwards like why why am i teaching you guys about like how market structure in in digital assets should work and and they just said they've been so confused because it's such a different asset class uh the technology is so foreign compared to what they looked at before so look it's no surprise i think we've all gone through this curve as we get into it and it's it's a fascinating space because there's so many different angles of digital assets from you know decentralization to you know what is the private key storage to how do distributions work and and whatnot that it's going to take a lot of education and we're definitely seeing that now from regulators so you know kind of back to the chief compliance officer role i would say actually on one hand the compliance officer role is probably supposed to be similar to what you'd see anywhere else but actually in digital assets right now it's different and and the thing that's different is it's problem solving it's helping regulators understand you know what's the metaphor between a particular activity and digital asset space compared to traditional markets and then helping them get over the curve of like accepting like yes even though the technology is you know kind of upside down frankly compared to how the banking system works that we can we can actually manage these and we can have safe access and we can you know fulfill what we're trying to do as you know keep regulators and keeping money money transmission safe yeah and you know and what you said like it sounds like a huge piece of that is education but obviously what we've seen in recent weeks uh with this huge storyline around regulation and um this whole fight that went down over the crypto provision of the infrastructure bill i wondered how you felt that education piece has been going because the industry even though it's it's still fairly new you know it has been around for a while um companies like yours have existed for a while so i just wondered what your sense was of the understanding of the technology um from regulators well look i applaud the senate for trying to understand and working toward it i think what we saw here in this bill was a lot less to do with crypto as it was to do with politics uh as you know they were spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure bill and they needed to have ways to show that they were they were going to bring revenue uh coincident with that and they they decided to to go and look in in the crypto sector and i think what they thought was going to be relatively easy peasy they realized wait a minute this is more subtle and complicated than we thought and and in particular that bill would have classified a bunch of people that are clearly not brokers as being brokers um so you know making a payment in digital assets would now classify you as a broker you know being a miner all these other activities it clearly doesn't doesn't match so i think this was more of a artifact of having uh done that very quickly um they're in a hurry to get the infrastructure bill out um hopefully that's for good reason and this kind of became a bit of a tag along but now on the other side of it i think there was a huge win for the digital asset space uh bitcoin crypto um with this the senator saw firsthand you know how passionate people are about democratizing money and this is a an area where we were able to mobilize we the the crypto digital asset community very very quickly um obviously a lot of uh very technical technically capable people but mobilizing on twitter they heard our voices loud and clear and i think uh if anything the best outcome for for for us in particular is that in the future they're going to be seeking out what is my position on digital assets and crypto and how uh how should i be thinking about that for my constituents in a way that this can help them you know obviously they want to get elected i think they've recognized that like this is a force that really really matters actually i did want to ask about one point and what you said where you said that um the language would have included some people that were clearly not brokers and i think you're right that at least for some of those roles um the way the regulation was written uh whoever wrote that did not intend to capture people such as miners but i wonder if there is contention about whether or not or how to tax people participating in defy and um i did wonder if maybe the way the language was written was intended to capture those people and that that is a fundamental difference in the way that some regulators view how the space should be regulated versus how the industry views how those people should be regulated i think there was more of a lack of education than a targeted view of of defy a lot of the reports came out that janet yellen and treasury was advising some of the senators on the language i do think they have an alter you know a behind-the-scenes view that they want to regulate the space as much as possible but the way to do it for a tax bill and to rope in uh either you know miners or stakers or validators was not the best way to do it and you know i look back to march of 2020 secretary mnuchin who was a crypto critic actually did convene a meeting of some of the same folks uh leaders in the crypto industry in fintech and some traditional financial services to discuss you know what were the risks in the space how do we not stifle innovation and it was all around what are we going to do about unhosted wallets and the travel rule and it was a really good dialogue and it was literally the week before the country shut down for for covid but then you fast forward to december and we had the midnight uh regulatory uh report come out about transaction reporting and it kind of undid everything that we thought we had a good dialogue about so i think we have fits and starts um on the open dialogue and trying to educate but this was another example of trying to rush regulation or legislation without partnering with the industry to get a better understanding of what it is they're asking i don't think the industry is against uh people paying their proper taxes but those are most likely exchanges who can do 1099s i don't like legislation that makes it impossibly compliant with and i also wondered you know as you mentioned a lot of people were saying that that appeared to be driven by treasury and i imagine as a chief compliance officer maybe you interact more with kind of the rank and file regulators presumably maybe in the irs and i wonder do you have a sense of what their stance is on how this should be done i mean like we intersect with everybody uh multiple fincen directors over the last couple of years i mean i sat in on the minutiae meeting you know representing compliance and regulatory so it starts at the top um but it is also the the policymakers in between and and some of them have moved around government some of them are now advisors at fincen come from doj i think the challenge is there's always a rush to do this and it's not in a timely manner and the industry needs to mobilize we sent 7 000 letters the last week of december to stop regulation coming out that we just couldn't be compliant with that regulation is still floating around washington and we're waiting for it to be reissued but hopefully with some better definitions and something that achieves what the regulators are looking for that's how do we manage the risk but how do we not drive all this innovation offshore lose jobs and i think that's part of the conversation that's happening now in washington yeah and i was also going to ask about when you mentioned fincen obviously the original fence and guidance you know was pretty clear in applying to companies that take custody of customers funds and i wondered if you felt that that was wavering because it does feel like in various places both uh you know not just in the us but even um like fat f that maybe that line is is not as clear as it used to be i don't think it's wavering i think the fatif has done a couple of reviews the financial action task force uh you know they're the global body that's trying to set some global standards um it doesn't apply to companies but applies to countries and the us is a leader at the fat if they actually help form it so i don't think treasury's going to back a way of wanting more transparency in in reporting we just need to figure out a safe way to do this that we don't cause other problems if we centralize some of this travel rule reporting it will be a honey pot of information that's not a good solution there are six or seven leading vendors that are trying to come up with a solution we're part of and a founder of the us travel working group who's trying to do it with within the us with uh companies that are all regulated under fincen as a money service business or on an equal footing and long term we're going to need to have an interoperable solution but that's not going to happen for a number of years there are privacy concerns or across border data concerns and really the conversation needs to happen is how much is this helping law enforcement are we going to do reporting for the sake of reporting we're really going to partner and help law enforcement and i think that's the open question that the industry and the regulators really need to grapple with okay yeah we'll get more into fat off um stuff financial action task force stuff but i actually want to ask one more question about this crypto provision in the infrastructure bill mike i saw you tweeted that the bill claims it would generate 30 billion dollars in tax revenue and you thought that that was preposterous and you said you suspected it would be closer to 50 million so why why do you think that well i i think in the us actually most participants in digital assets are are law-abiding tax-paying citizens um so the bill is hoping to capture to get additional reporting to somehow capture people that otherwise would not have paid their full taxes so um it's got a premise there which is that somehow that's not happening i don't know where those numbers came from as i did back in the envelope math on trading and you know projections of how much in the us it didn't get close to 30 30 billion i admit that you know the 50 million number i was it was kind of just like this as well i don't i don't have any data behind it but my point is is that like it's very easy to come up with some numbers here um but we don't really know or have a way to vet out whether that that was a good estimate of how much revenue could be generated by doing this so anyway that was the genesis of that okay yeah i mean like it would be kind of hard to estimate that just because you would need an inside look at the books on certain exchanges i would imagine that would kind of be the the main way right you don't have to know like how much of that is how much this activity is happening with u.s taxpayers versus people that are broad you know who's subjected to it what are the cost basis of these transactions and i think you know when you see an industry that's had such a positive uh success story in terms of growth in such a short period of time and we've never had an asset class grow from from zero to this um before um there's a natural tendency to think those people might not be paying their taxes especially right now in the political environment where you know obviously there's a lot of spending going on people are talking about you know what the billionaires are paying enough or where we're going to get money from it makes it an easy target but you know it doesn't mean that we should you know abandon our job of actually collecting data and figuring out look is this going to work for raising revenue or is this just you know fitting in with the hyperbole it doesn't seem like a lot of diligence was done given the speed at which this came together and given the lack of details behind the 28 billion number okay all right so let's dig a little more into this financial action task force stuff because so this is like a global body and it's been looking at ways to handle d5 and um the fat off tends to target its um guidance against what is called what it calls virtual asset service providers or vasps and traditionally as i mentioned before those were defined as those that custody assets um so before we get into kind of the full discussion around this jeff do you want to just give us some background on um you know what these phantom rules are and how they would apply to a company like biko which does custody assets sure so i attended some of the original fat of plenary uh private sector public sector meetings uh going back to uh late 2018 when they started contemplating what would a travel rule mean and how do we define a vasp and i don't think they were far off on their definition um you know we're a custodian we move assets for customers they're exchanges that move assets for customers i think where we ran into trouble though is how do you define customers of vasps and the privacy concerns with we're now tasked with sending information uh from one vast to another how do you know what vast that is all we have is addresses it's not like the swift network which is what they based the travel rule implementation on and that took nine years to build you know rule came out and banks worked on it we are still in the process of you know writing regulation for a white paper and that's just not the right way to go so i i think the definition of vasp is the right definition uh as a global industry we are working to define that and how do we share information in a secure way some are doing it in in closed loops just between three or four um uh exchanges or custodians a lot of them are being designed regionally there are a number happening in singapore we've got one in the us and i'm sure there'll be others in europe uh the biggest challenge though is how do you define who exactly is a vasp are they regulated and are you comfortable to share information with a vast that's regulated and pick your developing country versus a framework like we have in the united states or europe or japan where they've spent time trying to figure out what is the best way to regulate that's the big conundrum we're trying to face because we're dealing with customers information and the way the rules are written were required to send information on non-customers they did not consent that we would share their information with another regulated entity and so we need to balance all of that with the money laundering and terrorist financing risk that does exist out there i just don't know if all of this data sharing is really going to get us to the end game we're all regulated we can all receive subpoenas do we really need to share that information to help law enforcement well yeah i mean it is first of all sensitive information and then second you know it sort of gives this picture of a huge global surveillance network um but i did wonder so because uh under this travel role vasps would be required to send personally identifiable information or what's called pii how do you do that for crypto transactions because i i don't know you know exactly how this works where like could that then associate a person with particular addresses on particular blockchains and you know i'm sure it creates different risks so can you talk a little bit about um the security risks and how you guys are trying to mitigate those sure no it's a great question right so as a regulated exchange or custodian we're subject to ky seeing our clients so we have that information on the beneficiary what the rule is uh proposed is that we send information on the uh recipient and so i need to go out to an exchange and say do you own this address you do oh great this is who my customer wanted to send it to i'm now going to go into a private chat somewhere and we're going to share information on that client now that exchange that or custodian i'm sending it to if that information gets lost in transmission it's not secure it's hacked somebody now has an address and a customer name and yes you can unwind that and figure out how to read the blockchain and figure out that this customer was a whale this customer is whoever that doesn't happen in traditional finance you know jp morgan's customers or jp morgan's customers or name your bank and it's not out there it's only in this network which has rarely been hacked um sharing between two banks that's where i'm really worried that we're trying to have an open and honest conversation with treasury that we could create a bigger problem than you're trying to solve if any one of these steps go wrong so that's why here in the u.s we've started with regulated vasts we have a process to vet them are they regulated have they had you know aml and kyc concerns how long have they been in business and we need to do that before i'm going to trust to send my customer information or any other vasp is going to do that we're then going to go down and and do some pen tests and check security because at the end of the day the biggest risk here is that data gets out there on the internet and you can now take a look at the blockchain that's the whole point of crypto right it's it's suit anonymous it's out there and law enforcement just in the recent cases today is able to look at ip addresses and blockchain stuff and figure out who the bad guys are i don't know that we need to do the travel rule to solve that problem and if i can add a little bit here it's kind of reiterating jeff's point but there's a big change which is because it's a digital asset so if you were to go back in time to before travel rule was was ever a thing and they were determining whether or not they should implement travel rule they didn't have to worry about exposure of travel rural data exposing your entire balance at the bank it wasn't a thing it wasn't it wasn't a risk but if they implement the same travel rule that we have for traditional finance with digital assets that now becomes a risk where your entire financial history could be exposed because of compliance with this law that actually was designed for a different system so because we have a different system with digital assets we need to rethink not only like what does the regulator need but what are the risks that accompany the collection of that data however it gets handled the second thing which has changed and we've all seen this over the years i don't think the regulators have fully um acknowledged it or acknowledge their contribution to it look security is a huge part digital security is a huge problem for our industry whether you're talking about digital assets or whether you're talking about information privacy or whether you're talking about corporate corporate espionage i mean obviously there's a lot of digital security that we're now tuned into that we weren't in the past the idea that this information can leak as a result of government collection of data is real we have seen the government hacked and all personnel data from the military be leaked out onto the the internet we have seen equifax leak all personnel data from all of their the the clients reporting credit information to them i mean these are huge massive failures and and why do these things happen so unfortunately to just take the rule that was created a long time ago before we had this awareness around digital security and apply it today as though those risks don't exist i think it's uh it's a real misjustice to the people if we don't reevaluate kind of how we're doing that and the risks and just to make it clear for people um so when i use an exchange and i either i take a payment at that exchange or um let's say that i have some some crypto on my own hardware wallet and then i deposit it you know maybe to sell it or whatever there's like a particular address on whether it's like the bitcoin blockchain or um ethereum blockchain where either like a particular i mean on a theory you would call it an address or account i guess on bitcoin it's it's still an address i guess um but those kind of change a lot i guess uh but anyway but the point is that um that's associated with your account at that exchange and so even though you know exchanges will kind of like co-mingle the funds in a hot wallet um and you know they always kind of you know keep a keep account of what your balance is on their own ledger from the outside looking at the blockchain there can be a way to identify a person's own funds even in this like commingled uh kind of state is that that's right correct that's right and there's dozens of companies that are are building solutions to be able to analyze blockchain data and figure out who's who um as you point out i mean identifying who is the exchange is a little bit less sensitive other than it it could have a particular user at that exchange being identified but when it's going out of the exchange to somewhere else that's where you can really like expose a tremendous amount of data so these analytics tools though are also an interesting concept remember we don't have analytics tools in traditional finance there's no way to go and look at this data it's all private right so they created the idea of travel rule in part because they didn't have other tools right now if we live in a world where a we have a blockchain so we can build these tools which gives us a view that we've never had before and by the way this has been working already i'll give a couple examples in a moment but you know in near real time you know particular movements of money can start to be identified uh there was a hack on the liquid exchange yesterday you know some of those addresses are being blocked already and instantly right that never could have happened in the traditional finance system hey we're we've got new tools that we never have before and then b applying the same old solutions is creating new risk vectors in terms of leaking people's personal information and personal finances um and then also creating honey pots of personally identifiable information which frankly and you mentioned earlier about like regulators having slightly you know different views or is this undoing fincen or whatnot you know pretty much every regulator is looking at crypto in different ways and it's no surprise that as they start to make definitions so that they can write their rules that you sometimes see those definitions conflict this is not new to crypto right we have lots of conflicting rules on the books between state laws federal laws and international laws about what different roles are and especially when you think about things like gdpr and being an american company it actually turns out to be hard to navigate a line where you can comply with all of the laws that you're required to comply with so yeah yeah that is coming as a result of everybody trying to change all at the same time yeah this is clearly um not not an easy issue to resolve all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about these fataf rules but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's sponsor is poly market the world's leading information markets platform where you can

with so you know this whole discussion we've had about fat off has been you know four uh companies that do custody assets which was uh who the travel rule was initially targeted to um but here we have now this emergence of defy and in d5 it's not really the same thing right there's instead of traditional intermediaries that are custom customers funds we've got these smart contracts um so how are regulators looking at that are they looking to regulate that are they looking to redefine vasp in order to be able to target such things um you know how do you see that they're thinking about regulating defy well i think first and foremost it's back to education just when you thought you might be getting a handle on you know layer one on chain bitcoin or ethereum boom income smart contracts to really blow your mind um and and it's a new level um now there's some some things being done at a at a legislative level there um you know wyoming is now starting to recognize a potential for a dao a smart contract or maybe be a a thing um i think we could end up that way in in the long run where actually a counterparty can have a legal status even if it's code um but that's still coming look defy is really only a couple of years old now so it's no surprise that um we've got got less information around it you know we were talking about travel all the way back to you know 2013 when we got started it was kind of like this you know uh elephant in the room how how is travel rule going to be applied to digital assets um we're farther along now but you know it's still not not fully finished i think the same is going to happen with defy we do see industry starting to to push for different types of smart contracts that may require identity to be built in with them in order for the smart contract to interact with you that's going to have some technology impacts that's going to have some regulatory possibilities both both good and bad so i think this space is still evolving i hope that they let it evolve a little bit longer before we start clamping down too much because as jeff said earlier like we could end up just pushing all this stuff outside of the us and still it still happens it's just that now now you've got no opportunity to participate and it hurts americans and hurts american business yeah and actually going back to the travel role as applied to companies like yours one thing i did want to ask was so what would you like to see in terms of how the travel rule is implemented and how this sensitive data gets passed around or even uh you know the extent of uh what data is passed around i was gonna say i actually think that travel rules shouldn't apply digital assets because we have a blockchain since you have the blockchain and you have the forensics that lasts forever i think we really have to question whether or not you know it still applies i know that might be a little bit hard for regulators to accept but you got to go back and think about what was the purpose of travel rule and then you have to say what did it accomplish and how is it working you know what what crimes and activities is it catching today in traditional finance that are not being caught yet in crypto and if there is a big gap there let's go look at that gap but to say we're just going to apply the same reasoning i'm sorry the same solution without thinking about the inputs and the risks etc i think actually ties everybody up for no good reason i agree with mike i think we need a kind of crawl walk run solution here we don't want to do a travel rule if we're forced to do it because of enforcement we're holding up new licensing i think the industries come together that we are trying to partner and figure out the best way to partner with law enforcement and what data do they need but i think we got to go back to the original premise you know fadiff is setting global aml standards if every either vasp or custodian has an aml kyc obligation we're doing proper sanctions check you don't need to send the data to do that i've done it on my part and the customer on the other side has done that sending the data is just a risk i don't know how it really helps law enforcement given the way our technology works i don't know how much of a choice we're going to have in the end game but i've been lobbying and pushing for a sensible solution and let them evaluate and come back and go yep this is helping law enforcement or not you know at the sec and others they have to do a review of did a new rule actually help and i think they need to do that in some of the rules that they are uh putting on the crypto industry uh because at the end of the day we need to be smart about the time and resources we're putting to putting towards this and if we just send a lot of data either directly to the government or to other exchanges right it i don't know what it's going to do i don't think the government looks at all the sars and all the ctrs and vctrs that we file today so why are we doing reporting for the sake of reporting yeah and as sorry as a sp i can't even speak suspicious activity report a ct i forget what that stands for uh currency transaction report which is what you know aml and the travel rule and all these things where we're based on it when you're sending ten thousand dollars in cash uh or cash equivalent you're supposed to file a report so essentially the solution that you're advocating for is one in which investigators just look at the public blockchain they have their forensics tools and then they use other tools at their disposal such as subpoenas or or they can look at the sars reports that you file or whatever it is and you think that that's sufficient i think that's fine for where we are today i think we could get into some additional reporting but not the way these rules are laid out there's too many variables there's not enough definition and until we're at a level aml playing field there's no way for me to know who's a trusted vasp or not right but to get into the swift network you need to be approved and you need to be a regulated bank we don't have that global solution yet and i think that's what's going to hold this up and i think we're doing a little cart before the horse let's focus on if everybody is regulated properly they're examined we can then get to this next layer of how do we safely send information that may help law enforcement i think the global template is important to consider here as well you know travel rules started here in the u.s but fadiff has picked it up uh countries are applying it abroad the the global financial system is getting connected right now it used to only be available to the likes of jp morgan and the large banks but now it's available to everyone so if the us implements this and all other countries follow suit which is more or less the path that we're currently on that means american information taxpayer information is going to be sent out abroad in order to be compliant with both u.s and foreign policy does the u.s have control over all of the entities outside the u.s in terms of how they will protect that information and take care of it i mean we all know that of course they don't have the ability to do that but secondarily think about whose hands your information is going to fall into if you actually implement this and this is something that they didn't have to think about with the the current u.s law but it it's very much important for what's happening right now so as far as i understand though the this fat of travel rule i mean that's like an adopted you know uh form of guidance at the moment so it's being rolled out i mean i i did see a report saying yeah that maybe like a little less than half of jurisdictions have actually begun implementing it but i mean it almost seems like the ship has sailed is that correct or do you feel like there's a way to stop it at this point or yeah so they've published their guidance and it's written into their guidance but their guidance is not law it now is up to each country to adopt those status standards and if they don't they can end up being you know named or shamed that they're deficient in a number of fad if best practices but no country is fully compliant with all of the fat of best practices i don't think they're going to back away from it but i hope that the fact that they've continued to have the dialogue they've postponed saying that they need to take a closer look how are companies being compliant what are the issues with being compliant that ongoing conversation will help us develop one of these solutions the fear i have is that certain countries have been reluctant to license uh crypto exchanges or custodians because of this fat if rule hanging over their head but to mike's point until we have a global interoperable solution we've only solved a small piece of this puzzle so i think we can continue to chip away at it here in the us we are driving to adopt a rule um and come up with a solution for that rule the u.s travel rule is looking to start testing in october but it's a small subset it's 30 vasps here in the u.s but it's a good step and it showed treasury and fincen look we understand that rules need to apply to us we are giving our best efforts but we need to continue to talk about how the technology differs and what are those challenges i think commissioner clayton and others had said uh we have a rule book that works we don't want to rewrite the rulebook i think we actually need to change some of these rulebooks we didn't have some of this technology we didn't have decentralized smart contracts as a country and as a you know a financial industry we need to adopt and had we stifled the internet in the early days we wouldn't have amazon and the ubers of the world that have changed and made our life easier i think the same promise for crypto of can we move assets around the globe cut out a lot of the middlemen and make it cheaper we need to make sure that we continue down that path and so just going back to d5 then what would you like to see in terms of how dfi gets regulated that's a great question i wish i had a great answer other than uh from what i've heard the regulators are starting to turn their heads towards how do they surveil decentralized protocols how would they apply regs and rules uh you know some of the recent enforcement actions have come out and said i didn't care whether you were half defy or partially defy there are some controlling people and that may fall under the securities rules so you know somebody who is 100 totally decentralized i don't know that the rules could apply but i don't know if we have any of those yet there are still people behind some of these protocols that help make the decisions and um you know i think at the end of the day we do need better consumer protection we need better disclosures so that consumers know what they're getting into but i don't know if we need to do that for aml purposes or suitability purposes but i think the regulators here in the us are not giving up on uh decentralized regulation i also think there's a first pass of of this that actually industry will take on on its own you know you can't deny that there's some element of reputational risk with with working with unknown parties so industry in order to participate at a large level is going to need some amount of help for this and i think they'll come out with at least part of the solution by itself i think defy is too early to really say hey here's the prescriptive route um if we do that we could end up with a a very complicated um rule set that applies to some technologies not others and and and also stifles innovation in america but let it play out for a little while uh see what industry comes up with if industry stays away and doesn't participate then you know that might actually answer some of the questions itself but defy is definitely in the earlier stages than than other parts of digital assets yeah yeah it's almost like we don't even know what it's really going to look like so um so one other regulatory question i did want to ask about was um as we've seen in recent months there have been all kinds of warnings and actions from regulators against binance and um i did see jeff that you did an interview with coindesk talking about how binance u.s hired brian brooks the former acting controller of the currency and you call that a smart move and i just wanted to get your reading on his abrupt departure departure and just in general sort of this moment in time for finance and the kind of situation you think it's in sure so i had the privilege of working with brian for over a year at coinbase and you know even when he was the controller right uh he was doing a lot to try and manage risk uh come up with a you know a way forward for the industry to allow it some room to to grow and breathe and we'll figure out what does regulation mean along that path you know the brief conversations i had with brian uh before he left you know he was trying to operate a stand-alone business here in the us i can only tell you what i've read uh you know out there that it may have been falling uh apart around uh his uh fundraise and that he wasn't getting the funding that he was trying to achieve and that may have led to his departure brian's a smart guy uh he understands both sides of that coin and if brian couldn't be successful i have my doubts of who could turn that around look certain firm bitco and and coinbase and others right we took the long road we uh worked with regulators on sensible regulation that will work for this industry um and others haven't and i think the the level playing field is starting to happen now that you can't outrun the long arm of the u.s and we've seen some of those uh enforcement actions and that the best thing for the crypto industry is sensible regulation where people feel trust and that their assets are safe and that's one of the things that bitco focuses on in our you know cold storage and safety of our customer assets so i don't have too much to add in there i'm looking forward to see what brian does next but i think uh long term we need firms to embrace regulation that helps the entire industry oh yeah okay yeah so maybe the writing is on the wall for binance i guess we'll have to see how that plays out um all right so let's talk about bitco there's been so much regular regulatory news um obviously having you here on the show was a good opportunity to cover that but obviously biko had the big news about the 1.2 billion acquisition by galaxy and that was the first crypto deal greater than 1 billion dollars and i was wondering mike if you wanted to talk a little bit about why you thought that was the right move for bitco sure well we've seen a tremendous growth on the institutional space you know within the last 12 months um you know bitco's been after institutions businesses you know kind of this side of the uh of the the client segment since our beginnings um and in some ways you could argue that maybe you know bitcoin institutional access was was too early back in 2013-14 but this last year we finally started to see you know it's really it's really growing um and and to get there we want to do more so galaxy has also been after the institutional mission uh they've got a fantastic team that you know a lot of them come out of traditional traditional finance they've got a great trading product uh they've got great investment products the combination of these two firms is going to take the the tech that bitco's got apply it to the the knowledge that they've got and really hit hard on the institutional space so we're building a very strong industry-leading technology company i don't think there's anyone in a better position to build a technology first you know prime brokerage for the future um and that's what we're offered to do and tell talk a little bit about kind of where the institutional market is at you know there was a period in a long time ago like 2017 when we would often hear the phrase the wall of institutional money is coming didn't quite happen back when people originally said that and then it looks like it's actually um started to pick up maybe in the last year or so but i was wondering just you know what are you seeing now um how are different institutional investors thinking about the space and you know what are they interested in well i think even when you and i spoke like you know i always said it would never be a wall it would be like just a growth and i think that's what we've seen the line has been heavy um you know this last six nine months which is great but of course it's it's not some you know binary on off switch step function uh that's gonna happen but no i think the the backdrop of coronavirus actually has had pretty much everybody on the planet rethinking their portfolios and what they mean um secondarily with bitcoin now over 10 years running i mean you know frankly how much money are you gonna put into a system and it's only five years old and you know people have all these questions whether it's regulatory or technical or security it was just hard back then today a lot of those objections are gone but we now also have a very uncertain future in terms of the traditional assets so anybody that's been building a portfolio on a 60 40 mix of you know stocks and bonds transitioning over time they have to rethink it um obviously the stock market has had a very good run in recent years um and everyone attributes this to money being super cheap incredibly cheap and printing a lot of it and everybody's waiting for the shoe to drop on that we we know it's going to happen sometime we just don't know when and we don't know how bad on the bond side you know outside of the u.s i mean it's negative yields completely even inside the u.s you know you can't make any money off of off of cash so people are looking for an alternative and if you have a model that requires you to return money to your retirees or investors you know you're thinking like how am i going to meet that model we've got pension funds that are going to go belly up unless they figure out something to do they simply will not have the funds that they are legally required to distribute to their to their to their um investors um so to crypto's surprise yeah some of the most conservative uh assets out there investors out there in like retirement space with uh endowments and with um uh pension funds they are absolutely looking at cryptos so all of this has made it so that pretty much every sector of institutional whether you're talking about hedge funds whether you're talking about long-term investments whether you're talking about family offices or high net worth everybody's looking at digital assets now the more aggressive of those already have made their investments and uh and we just see more coming so i think that's why this last 12 months have been been so strong for for crypto and digital assets and as you see this part of the industry develop how how do you think um the institutional part of this industry can compete with traditional financial services firms that are trying to get into crypto oh well i mean that's that's the great thing about what we're doing this is software um and you know software when it gets into an industry it has a pattern of completely upending it so we get to rethink how pretty much everything works and you know i ask questions all the time of people i say hey who here raise your hand if you love your bank and nobody ever raises their hands um you know the fact is is that these these institutions you know on the traditional side were built a very long time ago before we had technology and then you know through regulation and through conservatism you know being conservative um they just haven't gotten to where people want it to be we now have a global society we are connected uh informationally in ways we've never been connected before um and we need a financial service a financial system that's that's for the future so the other thing that's happening i mean yeah we're lucky we're here in the u.s we might be concerned about fiscal policy here but you know if you're abroad you know you have real questions um depending on where you live about whether the money that you earned yesterday is going to be useful to you tomorrow and this happens over and over again um when when people are in charge so you know can we use computers to apply fiscal policy in a way that frankly humans aren't as good at doing and and i've said this one before which is i think exciting i think the longest standing unchanged fiscal policy in the history of mankind is bitcoin uh think of any society anywhere that had a fiscal policy that stayed constant as as for a period of a decade um i don't think it's happened so you know that's a tremendous opportunity for for what the future can hold and it also comes with transparency and it also comes with smart contracts we we can barely even imagine uh all of the combinations of better service that we're going to get going down the line and the crypto markets have really ballooned this year with the total crypto markets hitting two trillion dollars again recently a year ago they were at less than 500 billion dollars and as the industry grows and has companies such as yours begin costing larger amounts of crypto such as perhaps one day one trillion dollars worth or more how does that affect security practices oh great question you know at our roots is security it's where we started really kind of at a nuts and bolts level you know you're never done with security you just keep raising the bar so you know one thing that's happened in terms of bringing more people into the space is we've had to address how do you secure assets for fiduciaries that are holding money on behalf of other people so we're huge believers in the benefits of decentralization but we also want the industry to be able to participate everywhere which sometimes requires more centralized storage would you want a trillion dollars stored in a single wallet or under a single vendor not really right so we've got to split that apart with backstops and insurance and ways to handle disasters the industry's getting smart about this and we're seeing it so crypto technology is going to get better it's going to allow us to have decentralized holding of assets it'll be interesting to see how regulation and legislation keeps up with that imagine a multi-sig wallet today that has a key in the united states a key in canada and a key in europe whose jurisdiction is that i don't know the answer to that question i'm not trying to be uh difficult for the the regulators but do people want their money protected by the um judicial system of multiple countries absolutely they do and it gets much more complicated than that so we'll see things get more more decentralized and uh in terms of um having any single vendor with with trillion dollar wallets of course we have to keep backups of that part of what's happening is you're seeing safety funds get built um and a couple of protocols have had safety funds that they actually needed to exercise you know it's early days there's still been some technology failures some security holes right but i think we're gonna find ways with technology where certain amounts of profit is held in publicly visible you know safety funds um and this is basically insurance but now you can see it on chain and it's you know kind of as you go you build it i think we're going to get good at this over time and it's going to create a safer financial system in the end well speaking of finance i guess that was uh one of the first exchanges that did that right yeah right so um so now switching gears wrapped bitcoin is a staple in biko's business and uh wrapped bitcoin actually accounts for more than one percent of the coin circulating supply and obviously we're seeing people wrap their big bitcoins so that they can participate and defy on ethereum mostly to chase yield have you seen the drivers of that change in any way especially since you know we're not in the kind of crazy d5 summer that we were in last year um it hasn't really come down it goes up and down with price i suppose but in terms of the number of coins you can see actually hasn't hasn't really come down significantly um i think it's got real utility in terms of a centralized storage of this um you know as it grows we're gonna have to to do other things whether that means splitting across custodians in a still central way um or hopefully get to more of a decentralized technology for holding it one of these things is going to happen like you you simply don't want to wrap all of the world's bitcoin and then then have a big honeypot like we work too hard to decentralize this to create that that model um so it will change uh one interesting thing that's that's happened as well there though and it's it's related to anything that's a stable coin um and and of course wb btc is a stable coin of bitcoin as opposed to a stable coin of dollars uh is what happens when when things go wrong there was a hack at some i'm forgetting which one it was just a few weeks ago and some rap bitcoin you know no fault of rap bitcoin but you know a smart contract was was hacked and then they reached out to polly network one i think there we go thank you so and they reach out to us to freeze the asset and the rap bitcoin smart contract does not have a capability to freeze um we did not want that responsibility uh we think that's a centralized you know uh digital asset technology that that we don't want now when most of the uh us dollar backed stable coins are uh implemented they pretty much all have freeze capabilities behind them what this means is that you know there's a single party that can freeze any asset regardless of where it is in the world um and this is a little bit like you know taking your email and instead of storing it personally storing it now at google and then having someone subpoena it from google instead of from from you the same thing is happening with stable coins so this is an interesting development i can see why regulators might like that this one stop shopping but in terms of centralization i think it's it's not really the direction that we want to be in so another hot topic right now is nfts and we are seeing investors including a number of hedge funds that have been investing in these digital collectibles and i wondered do you see bitco ever doing something like custodying nfts and if so how would that differ from custodian traditional crypto assets absolutely we do i mean custodians uh can hold all kinds of things from art to fire trucks um so there's no reason why we wouldn't we wouldn't do that it's an emerging space i think it's it's just getting started you're starting you know the early days of nfts people associate with art art art you're starting to see people realize wait a minute this is about proof of ownership and providence right as those things come true a custodian is perfect solution um so of course we'll be supporting nfts in in a myriad of ways and helping people secure them um another big trend this year has been well actually last year and earlier this year has been corporate treasuries holding bitcoin on their balance sheets and i noticed actually in the last few months this has been kind of more rare of a news story and i wondered if you had any insight into what the slowdown was i think it's still pretty difficult to put on your court balance sheet so you know i mean the two big prominent ones we've got you know microstrategy obviously um he's got a corporate strategy around being a bitcoin asset to and of itself um you've got tesla um which i also think you know bitcoin is very much a for the people type of thing um elon has built a tremendous brand uh that people love it doesn't surprise me at all that he would associate with bitcoin as a way to to to build his brand but i don't think most companies really want to have commodities on their balance sheet it's not to say that bitcoin isn't a great commodity we we carry a lot on our balance sheet but that's because we're in the space we know what we're doing typically you don't see companies really investing in gold or other things so that could change as you know the monitor the monetary situation in the u.s changes if you really do need to get away from from fiat which i think is going to be a growing concern but in terms of why companies have done it so far i think it's been more about kind of the brand wins and uh positioning than than it is about actually wanting to have assets on the balance sheet okay well so i know you can't talk too much about the galaxy acquisition but you know obviously you have an important role in the industry and i just wondered you know from your perspective where do you think the industry will go uh through the rest of the year or what do you expect to be the major story lines and and this is a question for both mike and jeff jeff you want to take this one sure so but we're excited about the merger um and you know we can't get into too many specifics uh but both mike and i will have prominent roles at the combined firm and i think mike said it early right it's silicon valley uh meeting up with you know wall street and that's a powerful combination um you know they're very good at trading we're good at security and custody they've got a number of businesses asset management investment banking and you know the combined effort of those two if you really want to do prime brokerage uh prime brokerage infrastructure you need a custodian to do that and the combination of the two players will be uh a force to reckon with um as the institutional adoption grows and as we get more creative in the space you just mentioned nfts right there's a whole host of uh new and emerging technologies and ones that haven't even been thought of that will end up on the blockchain so we hope to be a player in all of them mike so i think we're going to enter a great build phase i think in general the interest is here to stay i don't see it going away the institutional interest in digital assets is is not wavering at all in spite of the the price drop really it's more about timing it's about continuing to figuring out logistics of how they're going to participate and how they're going to provide that to their clients so all it's all good and then with uh defy evolving with nfts coming um with the next wave of of layer two on the bitcoin side uh this is gonna be a great couple of years of build and grow um i i don't think we're really gonna enter into a crypto winter quite like what we entered before because i think we've reached a critical mass that's not to say it's not going to be volatile this can be hugely volatile but i don't think we're going to quite see the kind of the two-year bearish uh period that we've seen in the past yeah i've actually been thinking the same things because it's like almost like the space is getting too diversified now for that to happen so yeah well we'll see if we were right or wrong we'll check back in a couple years yeah all right well where can people learn more about each of you and biko easy to find uh bitco.com um and as we move to uh to galaxy it's galaxydigital.io so anyway happy to connect um you can find us there i think jeff is easy to find there as well and happy to answer questions for anybody that's uh that's got them perfect all right well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you laura it was a pleasure thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about mike jeff and bitco check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark murdock thanks for listening [Music]
