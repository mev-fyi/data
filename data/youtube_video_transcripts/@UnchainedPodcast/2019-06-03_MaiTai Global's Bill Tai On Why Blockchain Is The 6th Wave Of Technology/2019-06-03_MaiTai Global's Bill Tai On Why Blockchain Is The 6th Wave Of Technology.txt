welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone welcome to Unchained a forbs podcast produced by fractal recording I'm your host flourishing of Forbes contributor covering watching digital currencies and FinTech thanks for tuning in today I have a special guest bill ty one of the organizers of the blockchain summit recently held on Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island and a well-known venture capitalist and kite boarder who runs might a global a nonprofit that runs Tekin kite boarding events around the world Bill's had a long career in tech and is the kind of person who can see the next waves in technology happening from miles away hi Bill thanks for coming hey Laura thanks for having me so you've had a legendary career in Silicon Valley tell me how you got started you know I think it's all about being in the right place at the right time I was trained as a computer chip designer at the University of Illinois Illinois happened to have a faculty member that was one of the co-inventors three inventors of the transistor so they got sort of a early start in the technology area later companies like Netscape came out of Illinois so it's always had a long history of Technology having been trained as a semiconductor device person when Silicon Valley was kind of ramping up commercially in that wave in the 80s I came out here to join a very young company a company called LSI logic that was founded by the CEO of Fairchild Semiconductor which was really kind of the progenitor to the entire tech ecosystem that we now know a Silicon Valley and what do you when you say it was the progenitor of that ecosystem tell me more about it yes so Silicon Valley has the name silicon in it because one it's a valley that used to be a bunch of orchards when I moved to California the back of my apartment lot was a cherry orchard CJ Olsen cherry orchard Sunnyvale it's now of car dealerships but at that time a company called Fairchild Semiconductor had exploded onto the scene and there were a number of companies that formed by executives or engineers leaving Fairchild the start companies like Intel in Advanced Micro Devices and national semiconductor end up there are a bunch of books written on it but I think there are there's a hundred companies that came out of Fairchild that became the roots of basically everything we see in Silicon Valley today and what are some examples of those things oh as I mention you know companies like like Intel and you know uh the the very formative layer of technology that has become the basis for everything we use today that has any electrons running around in it really kind of came out of that root stock and down there's a there's a book on the kind of the history of Silicon Valley that sort of highlighted five of those companies that came out and I mentioned in Intel national AMD zilog is another one the z80 microprocessors pervasive you probably have it in your TV or remote control or your microwave oven the CEO of Fairchild or one of the CEOs of Fairchild left to start a company in 1981 called LSI logic and his name was Wolff Corrigan I ended up joining that startup in in 1984 and it it was a rocket ride I left to go to Harvard Business School to get my MBA and then upon completing that ended up doing a very short stint in Taiwan to help the government of Taiwan set up a their own semiconductor industry and it was a government-backed project where they put up I think it was four hundred million dollars borrowed processed technologies from Hitachi and VLSI technology and companies like that set up manufacturing and I helped do a spreadsheet that described what that first manufacturing facility would be like and was issued a consulting badge a zero zero one that little project has resulted in a company that today has a market value of around a hundred and thirty billion dollars it's roughly the same value as IBM or maybe twice the six times the value of Hewlett Packard maybe one and a half times Nike or two Ford Motors you know so it's quite a large company but that's basically that was my introduction to technology I then went into the finance side and became the semiconductor analyst at Alex Brown and for four years or so I ran around the valley looking for little companies that might get big someday and I would listen them on the stock market in terms of being the positioning of what the companies did to investor so that they would buy shares and I took public companies like at melons I log in cirrus logic 13 or 14 companies and then I turned 29 went into venture capital fun and started funding similar kinds of companies semiconductor based companies and then started to migrate up the stack so then went on to do sort of you know routers and hubs and switches I started an Internet service provider in 1994 that ended up going public we grew into the position of being a data center operator in 12 countries in Asia Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and Solomon or brother shared the IPO of that company called the Asia works after I brought on the then CEO of 18t Asia Pacific to to be CEO of the company but uh since then I've been kind of writing technology waves ever since and why did you make that switch to venture capital uh you know I so so I really loved the startup environment when I joined LSI logic because I'm basically a builder I'm while I act as a financier I'm not somebody that just writes checks I um I tend to have ideas in my head about what should exist and if it doesn't exist then I go and recruit teams to go make it in fact we're sitting here in the offices of a company called treasure data which I had an instinct that we needed to have a very easy-to-use scalable data data infrastructure for big data in this modern world and so I ended up putting together a team of engineers to create this company which now has like 200 enterprise customers that have thrown into our system forty trillion rows of data in three or four years and they're still throwing in in this in the time it takes me to finish this sentence there will be 8 billion more rows of data because they're throwing about a billion rows of data into our system per second twenty four by seven so on yeah so III enjoy building and I wanted to be more at the roots of the creation of companies rather than just sort of you know observing from the outside and listing them on stock exchanges okay so um I'm sure as our listeners can tell you know one thing that I gathered from you and we were on Necker is that you kind of have this very long view of the evolution of tech and on the island you gave a presentation about these six waves of technology can you describe that for our listeners and explain where you think blockchain fits in sure and and this one I can do very succinctly yes so so wave one in my opinion was basically a bunch of scientists turning physics into usable products so the semiconductor wave taking atoms moving around but putting them in little black plastic packages with spider silver legs that you could use as Lego blocks to build stuff so there was a lot of commercial activity building companies in wave one that were semiconductor companies wave two was about taking all those little building blocks and building stuff out of them so companies that made either computers or hardware devices communications gear switches routers hubs etc there was a gigantic wave of value creation around companies that were built like Cisco or Apple or Dell or any company really taking the little packages of physics and turning them into boxes that can move atoms around wave three was the assembly of those boxes and stitching them together into local area networks the land wide area networks the land and the culmination of all that was basically a worldwide network that we now call the Internet LANs and Wan's all working together and internet worked operation where you could basically transfer you know bits of ones and zeros running on all those atoms from wave 1 and 2 on anywhere you want to go and shape them in any way and that was a also a giant value creation wave of ISPs and data center infrastructure the next wave after that way for it was basically attaching a user interface on to that giant network and that's the wave that I think everybody knows because it became very consumer friendly rather than sort of hardware protocol engineers in back rooms making things and making network set ran information the world moved to basically kids like Mark Zuckerberg starting things like Facebook in a dorm room or Jack Dorsey running Twitter in seven days which the fund at particular seated and it became basically a value creation wave based around the appearance and the usage of the bits coming in and out of the network so if you think about it Twitter Linkedin Zynga all those companies Facebook they're really just user interfaces to ones and zeros coming off your screen and it's what those ones and zeros look like an aggregate that stimulates usage and behavior and creates value the wave after that was a data science wave which we're still in and which is why treasure data exists the the companies that really won because in any space where people were trying to capture user behavior there were many many companies in that wave and the ones that won were the ones that got a handle on measuring monitoring improving what users did on their screens because they knew what was happening they measured it and that's what data science is so knowing what that data the science of knowing what your data is doing so that one appears to be a gigantic wave because you have companies that have clearly moved data science out of just web companies into the physical world if you think about you know the success of a company like Walmart Walmart is effectively a data science company with a physical frontend that's a store because they're watching all the stuff moving around inside they're very efficient at knowing where it is companies like JCPenney and Sears never got it so they're basically piles of transient to inventory that create write-offs every once in a while and so data science I think is important to everybody and a very foundational wave and wave five so as we move forward now we're starting to attach physical things to the data science you can see that in companies like uber or Airbnb Airbnb or uber are really a room or a car attached to a data science infrastructure where you can transfer the ownership of a car for five minutes with an iPhone app and that brings us to watching so where we are today is we're in a world where people are now used to a term that I call virtualization where a physical thing or a piece of value is virtualized into a bunch of bits and you can move them around the transport stream one way to look at it is you know when the internet hit people were using faxes before the Internet where you would basically write a note handwritten or typed and then you would basically surround that note with a bunch of ones and zeros and then drop it into the tcp/ip transports Turing tcp/ip meaning transport control protocol slash internet protocol and that little set of words would know where to drop into the system and where to come out of the system in the form of your email and now we're basically doing the same thing to physical stuff whether it's a unit of value that can be expressed in a Bitcoin or soon the title of a car or a house or a piece of land or really anything so so I think I wrote a medium post recently called the blockchain is to banks what tcp/ip is to telcos because it's a it's basically a way to take all the stuff flowing through a system whether it's a communication systems like telcos you chop it up into little bits and it allows the pieces to flow through that cloud and come in this aggregate reassembled super efficiently we're not doing that with physical things with the blockchain so that's I think where we are today well it's so fascinating to hear you describe all these waves I mean this is like you know I can sort of just go back and remember you know different levels of Technology in my life you know like when I went to college and used pine and elm to check my email and stuff like that and then obviously now you know I can check out my phone and yeah I just love hearing this evolution say one thing that interested me and your description is when you talk about like the lands and the winds kind of coming together to form the internet there are so many comparisons that are made in like you know the way like Bitcoin and blockchain are developing now and comparing them to the Internet what would you how would you make that comparison oh I think it's uh I you know I in my individual opinion I see it also I think what what you're seeing now our little islands of activity that are springing up everywhere that will eventually kind of inter Network and merge and in the days where the internet was forming the term internet working it really refers to the meshing of different kinds of network so if you clock back to the sort of the early 90s or mid 90s there were a plethora of different kinds of networks and people may not even remember these but there were Novell networks there were tcp/ip networks there was a UNIX network Sun Sun Microsystems that came out of Stanford Stanford UNIX network or Stanford University UNIX now whatever it was I don't remember the exact terminology but there were many many different kinds of networks and then companies like Cisco came along with a multi-protocol router meaning it would sit in between these various kinds of networks and translate the format from one to another so that Len and sandy Bozak who fought at Cisco could send emails to each other even though one was on the Stanford Network and one was on the Novell Network it just sort of instantly translated so now I think what we're seeing is the formation of little private networks and in banks and other institutions where people are basically transacting and trading in a certain way and they're forming little communities that I think will be the foundation of blocks to broader communities when they're all basically internetwork in this particular case the protocol kind of already exists because the blockchain is already there and I think the world has gotten used to the social virality of communities jumping on to certain technologies you know for example messaging technologies yeah there's a lot of messenger things around but people know that the value of a network grows exponentially the more people are on it and people recognize that you know what they've seen it before they're gonna see it again and people hop on to the platform that has momentum so you see that today in blockchain there are other great technologies out there like aetherium or some other kind of chain X you know blank X meaning uh you know it could be anything you know X like chain this and that but I think what's happened is the developer community has largely centered on block Bitcoin blockchain so the momentum of human energy to fix anything that's not working is they're kind of like you know any open source movement you end up getting the best results where most of the brainpower exists and in the case of you know whether it's Linux or Internet related things I think you go to where the action is and all the action today appears to be in Bitcoin blockchain okay and earlier when you were talking about the communities that the banks are developing are you talking about private blockchains like maybe things like the r3 consortium that they're doing with Korda and stuff like that or did you mean just it's like legacy systems oh I'd say more the former meaning that there's a lot of development activity with people trying to figure it all out and you know before the internet was pervasive financial institutions and others that had the resources to build their own private messaging networks had them you know they had private networks that later were then added on to the information superhighway where all of it kind of was able to go from one place to the other and I think you know people already have transaction systems that work they may be a little bit high overhead and I think what'll happen is just as tcp/ip sort of in a positive way infected all those networks as a virus and sort of carve them out from the inside and they things got more efficient more liquid I think that's what you're gonna see and anyone that's already in the transaction business is gonna look at at the new development and say wow I could do exactly what I did before and it's gonna be a tenth to a hundredth the cost per transaction why wouldn't you do that you know and I think what happened in the world of telcos is as telcos started to see that all of their fixed lines hanging there empty most of the time if you basically chopped up the conversations into little pieces as they float onto the network you could kind of mix them all up and and use more infrastructure more efficiently by multiplexing all that stuff onto those little lines that existed are you referring to voice over IP you talk yes so data it whether it's voice over IP or voice over IP is effectively voice put into data packets so it's it's data of any form including voice being chopped up into pieces and able to be kind of time shared onto lines that's kind of what the internet did to the phone system it just made it far more efficient and far more flexible and I think blockchain is a similar thing where it's gonna introduce the ability to move assets around you know a lot easier and also create a way to build applications on top of that platform to do higher value-added levels of service which is exactly what happened to the phone companies you know there were there were a bunch of early voice over IP companies I've forgotten all their names but a lot of companies would write on top of ISPs and try to charge less for phone calls on the very expensive structure of the phone company so the fun comes are losing money on it by the ISP the what companies are making money and then the phone companies started to say well heck we could do that - and not only could we do that we could also build on top of it all kinds of you know kind of voice forwarding or whatever all kinds of other messaging things they could provide data services news and information services anything that could be packaged up in a bunch of bits and I think we're gonna see that as well in the ability to deconstruct and reassemble and then aggregate more things to higher chunks of value as assets physical assets instead of conversations get chunked up into little bits and thrown onto the blockchain it's all very exciting there's two different strands of points that you made that I kind of want to pull together and put them head at one point you talked about how you thought you know there was a network effect around Bitcoin and how that was gonna do really well for you know for that reason because there's like developer activity there and then later on when you talked about voice over IP you said that the telco has kind of caught on and they started adding these services and so in that scenario it's more like the incumbents were ended up being victorious and it wasn't necessarily the open protocol that that kind of what I mean maybe even one isn't the right word but in general I feel like a lot of people talk about this in an us-versus-them kind of way like the startup against the incumbents yeah so you know where do you see blockchain going like do you feel like it's gonna be with this startups are eventually going to be yeah you know it's interesting to draw an analogy I think in the beginning of the commercialization of the Internet it did feel like there was a little bit of a weaver's as they mentality with the startups trying to write on top of telco infrastructure and you have the same sort of thing with the banks today and startups trying to do FinTech based on blockchain or anything else that said what ended up happening in the Internet was everybody one life is better because it all merged together because it had to and if you think about the virality and network effects of a communication system period if you're on a system and no one else is there there's no one to call you know and so if there's two people there you can call one person if there's a third person call - if there's four people you know the number of conversations goes up in an exponential way you know so you know four points means six connections five points means as a 25 you know there's somebody can do the math but you know the number of lines between the dots goes up exponentially so the value the network goes up a lot faster than the number of people you know it's if 3 if 2 goes to 3 the value just didn't go grow by 1/3 it grows more and so I think financial transactions are the same if you have a shell from the ocean that is a piece of currency and there's nowhere to spend it it's not worth anything but if you're plugged into a community of you know 50,000 Polynesians that trade shells then part you're part of an economy and so I think what's happening now is that we have these little elements that are touching the economy in their own little communities and it's all going to become sort of standardized on to a common platform and then the friction goes way down the number of transactions goes way up the cost of doing transactions goes way down and it just becomes a lot easier communications is so much easier today than trying to send faxes and I think commerce is gonna be the same thing ok so I know you know you decided to create the blockchain summit I also know you're an investor and and some of the blockchain companies like bitfury in general when you are looking at the space what do you feel like it needs right now oh I just I think we're you know it's not unlike the Internet in id2 93 94 in that period I was running around at O'Reilly tech conferences picking up floppy disks to stick in computers to see what a gopher was or a an FTP like you know how do you use an FTP client and why would I use an FTP client to send a file like it just it uh it made things easier in the long run but in the short term it was a little harder and a little complicated and a little bit difficult to understand and I think we're kind of at that phase with blockchain and Bitcoin and related technologies where it's clear what the promises low-friction very fast low-cost commerce that's clear but learning how to use it is a little bit of an impediment you know because I think people are used to things you know they they got to kind of get over their past learnings of how to do certain things you know attack I mean I even still write checks sometimes you know it's so I think yeah yeah so I mean for something there's certain things that won't go away you know like when I invest in a company I actually like to have a physical record of a check that I I write and then I PDF that and I scan it and I send it to myself so I have multiple copies of different types yes I think there are some things that people will still behaviorally never get over you know as I mentioned you have invested in theory and they started as a mining and chip manufacturing company and now they're expending the watching services using the lens of how you decided to invest in them can you explain when you look at the state of the blockchain industry right now how would you analyze it as a VC okay well so I'll start with you know how did I come across bitfury why do I invest why did I invest if funny enough one of the early members of the community that produced bitfury so bitfury really started kind of as an open-source community there were as they started bitfury really started within the open-source community there were a couple of people that met online in forums while they were teaching each other how to mine Bitcoin and they started in the days when you could basically download a program to your laptop and run it and get rewarded every once in a while that winning a little bit of coin and as the world got more competitive they they would fall behind periodically and need to improve their performance so they went from software running on laptops to teaching themselves how to use graphics cards that process pictures a little bit better speed things up and then they moved on to pro field-programmable FPGAs field programmable gate arrays which you could implement certain algorithms in and make them run pretty fast and ultimately they were winning in that space and then got a little less competitive and one of them said you know we need to make our own chip and they all kind of looked at each other online because they weren't physically different places and said does anyone know how to design a chip and that I'm dead so it taught themselves how to design a chip and it was a little rad because what they ended up doing because they didn't have prior institutional knowledge is they went completely outside the rule set of how you would ever do anything and they handcrafted the transistors in a world where silicon design has migrated to a very high level experience where everything's automated and today if you're in school learning how to design computer chips you basically come up with tables of ones and zeros there are ones inputs and outputs and then you do boolean algebra on the middle to try to make the input match the output and then you load that up into a system you hit a button and a computer synthesizes the architecture and prints the transistors for you so they didn't know how to do that and they couldn't afford the tools and so they basically step-by-step designed their own transistors and their own architecture and it worked and they went so far around conventional wisdom that their silicon and their approach was just far more efficient than anything else out there so in a in a game where most efficient use of power and high throughput of calculations matters a lot they just started winning big time so the company ramped up very fast and soon found itself to be kind of the technology leader in the space and along the way you know I guess I would I had been on the board of directors of public companies that had made math coprocessors designed lots of transistors and when I saw what they were doing I said you know wow that actually it works and they totally totally revolutionary defensible so I let an angel round and wrote a check and here we are so so soon and that's in the development sort of the ASIC yes that's how that first ASIC up it was it who was who was on that message board oh that was a Valerie favela the CEO Valerie Nesby who's there their chief technologist in in the Ukraine and Niko Putin who is I think he's now heading marketing but he's kind of the universal do-everything guy in the company and it they're just a fun crazy crew to work with but done so soon they ended up with data centers in Iceland Finland and the Republic of Georgia converting anywhere from 40 to hundred you know million watts electricity to Bitcoin real-time they were massive and and they stumbled their way into running basically the world's largest consolidated blockchain processing infrastructure and as as I joined the board and started to think about what they could become I talked to George gavazzi the vice chairman and Valerie and I said you know the thing that you guys should think about is this is is a bigger play than just piling up a bunch of Bitcoin you know what we need to do is is turn this into the foremost blockchain processing infrastructure in the world and come up with a way to basically move it forward to a point where developers can build stuff on the system and you couldn't run anything on it not just like run stuff to make a a lot of coin know kind of Bitcoin here and there to in turn electricity into money so so we embarked on that strategy and I said you know what we need to do the thing that we're missing is we are missing a community of thought leaders in one place and if you hearken back to the formation of Silicon Valley from 1975 to 1986 there were a bunch of kids that loved technology whatever it was at that time and would meet at at rooms at Stanford University ultimately renting rooms from the Stanford Linear Accelerator and those kids would basically show up with their little pieces of wood with semiconductor chips sitting on them that were wired together doing things and those kids were kids like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates and Paul Allen and Andy bechtolsheim and the guys I started Sun Microsystems or Alan shugart who started Seagate and it was the interaction and communication real-time on projects that led to the creation of enough source standardization and enough critical mass around movements that massive commercial waves were formed and and we just didn't have that in the in the Bitcoin blockchain environment because the world had gotten so distributed due to the internet that people were off working on their own little projects and communication what happened online but the human to human interaction wasn't there so I said to those guys let's get the a bunch of great people and stick them on island for a couple of days and let's invent stuff that we can put on the blockchain so and and I said the other thing that was missing was Bitcoin had this sort of nefarious reputation it has a place where drug dealers and and people buying and selling it illicit goods would hang out and you know I don't even drink you know so I said what we need to do is let's let's let people understand what the potential is and let's make people create things for social good so we took the group of people invited they were kind of you know of a certain type of person creative people that knew the technology that could invent things and we divided everybody up into groups of six to eight people and we gave them 24 hours to invent something that could do social good but run on the blockchain and we had like eight or nine projects come out of there the got a ton of traction you know so John edges and Lucy Liu's project which had been kind of born before but took shape on the at Necker Island they presented in front of the United Nations about six weeks ago with the ID 2020 project yeah so amazing that that in really got traction at Necker Island and the Virgin Galactic galactic astronaut trainer Beth Moses she had a fabulous idea to create a liquid carbon credits marketplace based on the blockchain and that's still a great idea I hope she runs forward with it Nico and I spent a little time thinking about well how do you get the next generation of kids to understand this in a way where they don't really have to learn anything you know because one of the things to make this world really absorb it you need to have the next generation that that doesn't have credit cards you want their first touch to be something that's easy to use so we came up with a Bitcoin light bulb and what is a Bitcoin light bulb you know we basically took a power supply that takes your wall current AC to DC stuck a chip in there so a microprocessor from Qualcomm a bit Furion mining chip and a Wi-Fi chip and we stuck it in a light bulb and the idea there is to take anybody could take a light bulb screw it into a socket it sees Wi-Fi you turn on your iPhone you connect to it and it's mining Bitcoin for you right away and when you sign into it we want to do this on Facebook so so Shawn Ryan of Facebook of you're listening this is where I need your help we want people to just basically sign in and it puts on your feet I'm Laura Shan and I'm mining Bitcoin come join me and all your friends can click on that link get a light bulb join your pool and then suddenly you have dozens of friends in one collective entity mining way and Shawn this is where I really need your help I want people to be able to basically just send Bitcoin to each other facebook messenger independent of how old they're you know my son you just use the Bitcoin blockchain to do it oh well it's like messenger oh well you you you have what does the light bill do for you no it sets up an account for you it's already mining it puts money in your account it's connected to other people already they're so low the friction so kids can use it you know so just sort of like you know kids using Facebook that's the question oh you know that's a good point so Schad yeah you got to work on that too but but I think it's there are ways to basically use existing social networks to plug the transaction you know it would still run on blockchain of course but I think the interface could be things that are already familiar to in that case six hundred million people and there are most of them are probably not old enough to get a credit card so it's their first experience but they're you know I think there were there were so many projects the blockchain Alliance was formed in Richard Branson's hot tub on a conversation and I think it's now basically the largest group of important blockchain companies working on on you know law enforcement so there's there's all kinds of things that came out of that that are just fantastic so it was fun to see over the course of the year what could happen and I'm really excited to see what happens going forward okay so as a VC when you look at blockchain what do you think are some good opportunities in the space and what that's do you think are less likely to pay off oh boy um you know I think I it's so open-ended right now you know if you think about what happened in the 90s a lot of things worked and I think there was so much momentum behind the internet segment that there were probably a lot of things that kind of worked financially that didn't really work with businesses but you know the tide was rising so fast we're not quite there yet but we're in that in the face where things are kind of bubbling up a little bit and I don't think people are euphoric yet about the segment so I think we're at a phase where we're still kind of picking shots and and I think things that I think I'm interested in are really probably two main areas right now one is the application of blotching to land titling I've embarked on a project with Hernando DeSoto who's the president of the Institute of Liberty and democracy and we basically architected a system that uses blockchain at its core that takes the work that he's done over 20 or 30 years to basically aggregate and define titling of land and to put it into in his prior case paper based systems that now can be fully automated done with iPads and iPhones and sucked into a set of databases that runs on top of blockchain and lowers of friction completely - - giving people assets that they can then have titled take to the bank in a mortgage and have kind of a very basic capital the brick the foundational brick that forms capitalism can you describe the problem in because I mean in in a place like the US you know this is something that a lot of people are me home so can you describe what it's like in other countries sure yes so I think you know Hernando DeSoto and the the ILD they're really famous for one thing they did that was remarkable which was stopping the civil war in Peru and without firing a shot and it's kind of a weird thing but you know what how did that all work well you know back in the 70s and 80s and 90s the the Colombian drug cartels were very prominent Colombia sits next to Peru and they had a lot of influence on squatter farmers all over Peru growing coca leaves to then be shipped to Colombia to be turned into drugs and then reshipped to America for billions of dollars which then was fed back to help fuel a an army a terrorist army the called The Shining Path and The Shining Path controlled 70% of the landmass of Peru and they did that for decades and and the government itself didn't really have a lot of resources so they couldn't fight the war properly three presidential administrations in the USA spent billions and billions of dollars trying to stop the drug flow in the so-called war on drugs totally ineffective but Hernando The Economist convinced the president at the time Alberta food Mauri that what he needed to do was use behavioral economics to align people's interests with what the government wanted and he basically orchestrated a land reform program where he walked into the jungles would approach a squatter farmer and say are you tired of the peruvian army burning down your house every two years and shooting at your family do you want your kids to go to school someday if the answer is yes then just sign here and what you're signing basically says that that little green plot of land that you will deny that you're working on today now is your property forever as long as you don't grow illegal crops so as long as you grow legitimate acceptable crops you keep that land in your family forever if you want or you can sell it and so over a period of five to seven years Hernando cut the supply chain off of all the drug dealers and the war ended and so he then took that basic principle form the Institute of Liberty and democracy and has applied that in another 15 or so countries over two decades and what I'm working on with him is automating that process because he basically did it with a lot of paper forms and armies of people running around surveying squatter farmers and there's a way to basically do that very quickly and very clearly and put it on the blockchain so that's one project I'm excited about the other is just the the general level of transparency of you know what can you the everyone hears that the blockchain is transparent and that you can see all these transactions but then there's this kind of well but then why did Silk Road happen and why are all these criminals around they're like what I don't get it like if I can see everything that's happening how come I don't know who the criminals are well in my opinion is really just user interface so uh there was a company that I am part of the seed backing of called block seer and I met a young man named Danny yang who is a Stanford PhD in data science who had run the Bitcoin meetup group at Stanford University and he gathered a little bit of capital initially to create a company that is running pretty well now called my coin ma I coin which is a Chinese language Bitcoin wallet company think of it as sort of a Chinese language coin base for Taiwan and some other countries and I set it down and you know Danny your background is so unique in data science at the wallet business yeah em it's gonna exist but there's like lots of wallet companies and I think my coin is gonna be a great success in those geographies but let's do something cool can you create something that looks a little bit like a Google search page where all I have to do if I'm gonna do a deal with Laura Shen she sends me her wallet address I copy/paste clicking in there and I can see every coin that Laura she owns in her wallet know where it came from know every transaction she's ever done with that wall in her history and I can get kind of a feel for is she legit is she knowledge it is she like spinning money around in and out of Mount GOx you know it it's it's a way to provide a level of transparency and just put it in front of the public eye in a very easy way so he wrote it and so block seer today is still a seed funded company whose product is being used and I guess I can't say that they're being used by but but they are being used by three or four government agencies that have three-letter initials so everybody's using it and it's it's a great product but check it out block see you're calm okay what am I not asked you that you'd like to discuss oh um you know I I don't know if you if you're interested in kiteboarding if I can always talk about that but that may not fit into this podcast uh no but I am curious you know how you got into that and then how you ended up blending it and with your tech background uh what you know so I started as many years ago I learned how to sail a little like a interclub sailboat and it was fun but it wasn't fast so I moved to smaller craft and eventually started windsurfing and went surfing you know it's a very visceral experience because skipping across the water and you're flying you feel the air you know a little bit different than being on a boat and there was a natural progression of people that were windsurfing into the sport of kite boarding because they were all sort of water athletes and I just happen to be kind of in the right place at the right time with a bunch of the kind of professional athletes that were wind surfers I used to ride with them that train and things like that and they started pickup kite boarding around 2000 when the first controllable kites were were made by companies mostly in Hawaii and and so I inherited a kite that once belonged to Laird health and the surfer and myself had a kite in 2001 and I've never looked back and then somewhere along you know kind of around 2003 or for somebody took some pictures of Sergey Brin and Larry Page kite boarding in the bay and that coincided with this giant wave of sort of you know young people starting tech companies all over the valley and everybody wanted to emulate what you know successful founders were doing so the sport suddenly became really popular in that community in 2004 5 6 and here I was a sort of the old hand and experienced guy and and an annual trip that I would throw on Maui with the now CFO of Yahoo um but this was like 15 years ago became the place to go and the network to be part of if you were a hot young entrepreneur that wanted to learn to kite surf and so I started to have these gatherings that grew and grew and grew in size and now I have this worldwide community that's known as might a global the my in the mai tais obvious because of bill thai but there is a Suzy my who is a professional kite boarder she was a Red Bull athlete that was redbull king of the air winner of three years in a row no other athletes ever done that and she came out to help me with one of my gatherings once and it got lovingly nicknamed my tie by James Hong I think the founder of hot-or-not and in Solara caminar who went on to create adsense and run YouTube but though the tech community sort of branded it as the place where tech meets kiting meets deal generation meets investing and and so I spend my time now kind of going from place to place creating these little salon discussions whether they're blocked jeans summit or in my extreme tech challenge or other things around the world traveling around and having fun with entrepreneurs creating companies it's a life to be envied I would say I have to say it's pretty fun night you know I I do not regret how my life has played out okay great well thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me
